The story itself has a few gaps and jumps, which can be partially inferred, but in combination with the lacking translation leads to a lot of points just being meh.I appreciated the visuals, but the cadence of characters talking to each other and the timing of reactions and such is offputting.The world itself is quite interesting, a classic case of xianxia/xuanhuan being carried by their setting.Overall, it's decent if you can handle the poor translation, but I don't think I'll be...keeping an eye out for any more Exorcist Edward Elric. keeping an eye out for any more Exorcist Edward Elric.""]"
Sore ga Seiyuu!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29163/Sore_ga_Seiyuu,"[""Of the three meta-anime I've seen (Shirobako, Bakuman) this is my favourite. I like how they portray the reality of working life without resorting to anime tropes. In bakuman the typically super-asexual lead character plus relationship gimmick always seemed so unnecessary, what we have here is something more real, more similar to a slice of life. The three lead characters are suitably adorable in the way that people are adorable in real life, they have regular human flaws and worries. I think one of the things this anime does best is portraying the awkwardness found in any typical work environment, of course amplified by the...nature of this type of work. I'm very sad to see the very low ratings this show has been given on my anime list, maybe this show is being punished for being a bit too unique or maybe because the younger demographic on this site won't understand the pain of employment that helps older viewers understand the humour here. I'd recommend it to anybody bemused by their job or wanting to see something that makes fun of anime tropes rather than using them as a crutch. nature of this type of work.

Sore Ga Seiyuu! begins mainly by informing the viewer about how voice acting works and various parts of the industry. If that’s your interest field, it will immediately pull you in. As the story progresses though, the drama and reality overflows out and it becomes beautiful. Futaba is a character that is relatable for anyone struggling to pursue their passions, and her story is both convincing and high caliber.If you’re interested in characters that actually develop, and interesting plot, and music: Sore Ga...Seiyuu! is for you. I think it’s truly rare to find an anime that focuses on realism to the same degree as this one, and I hope you’ll enjoy it as much as I have!Story (9)Art (8)Sound (9)Character (7.5)Enjoyment (8)Overall (8.5) Seiyuu! is for you.

Like so many other slice of life anime, I assumed it'd be dull and uninteresting. I'm happy to say that I was wrong though.I really enjoyed learning about the ins and outs of being a seiyuu. The characters were relatable, and I appreciate the fact that the trials and troubles of the characters were realistic.The art is nothing to write home about, although I appreciate the wide variety of character designs. The music was alright and fit the overall feeling of the show, but I wasn't too impressed with that either.If you enjoy educational...anime, I'd definitely recommend trying this one. It's informative while still being entertaining and cute. anime, I'd definitely recommend trying this one.

Well, here's an anime that can give you a full picture of it!The story starts from a rookie seiyuu and progresses into a pro just like nozawa or tamura (as they already made an appearance). Its quiet interesting and funny. Art Its just ok, it reminds me of the lucky star art and wakaba girls. the ending song, quiet catchy Two are rookies, one is a normal, one wants to be an idol and another is already a pro since young?? thats basically just like the real life seiyuu's, Love it! the design is good. I basically enjoyed this...and overall, its a good anime.(Overall 8/10) and overall, its a good anime.(Overall 8/10)"", 'Sore ga Seiyuu! (or Seiyuu\'s Life), is a series made for people who wants to learn more about how being a voice actor is like, at least in Japan. As someone who got into the seiyuu fandom right before discovering this anime, it came out just about at the perfect time for me. It\'s a shame that this show is underrated and did not get much attention in the summer season, which is when it was aired, for the reason that there were a lot of other shows that caught viewers\' attention.The story focuses on Futaba, a novice seiyuu that has only two years...to prove to her agency that she have the potential to be a long working seiyuu, even years into the future. Being inexperienced, Futaba does not have a lot of confidence in her skills and abilities as a voice actor. However, as she got more and more voice acting jobs, she met many people that she was able to learn from. These people include Ichigo and Rin (who she became close friends with through work throughout the series) Hikari, who always gives advice to Futaba--not sugarcoating what she tells her, as well as professional seiyuus like, Ryouko Shiraishi (the voice of Hayate in Hayate no Gotoku). Despite her flaws, I found Futaba to be a likable character for the reason that she\'s really realistic. Even though her voice isn\'t all that unique and/or stands out from others, she\'s hard working; the fact that she really tries to do all kinds of different voices (a robot, a young female warrior, a soothing narrator, a young boy) transcends being naturally talented. (***Potential spoilers.***) I was really impressed with the audition that she had in one of the earlier episodes--where she imagined herself as a female warrior in order to try and draw out the best voice that she could do to depict the character she was auditioning for. It was interesting to see the image that she had of the female warrior, and how the scenario would look like in her mind. (***Potential spoilers section over.***) If there\'s any cons about the characters, it would be that the show didn\'t have any original male seiyuu characters as one of the protagonists--or at least as one of the reoccurring supporting characters. On the plus side, the guest male seiyuus\' perspectives and advice for the newer, younger generation of seiyuus was refreshing to see. Also, adding onto that, a pleasant surprise for this series would be that they have actual professional and/or well known seiyuus as guest stars (males and females included). A seiyuu who\'s likely the most recognizable out of all the guest stars would be Hiroshi Kamiya-san; so if you\'re a fan of his, his appearance(s) would be something to look forward to.The three main protagonists were likable, however, my favorite characters from Sore ga Seiyuu!! would probably be Hikari and Konno-san. They were both characters that didn\'t necessarily get a lot of spotlight, but were likable even with the limited screen time they were given. Konno-san did get a whole episode focused on her; prior to the episode, I didn\'t know that managers not only work with seiyuu themselves but also production companies. Hikari, on the other hand, did not get a whole episode focused on her, but there was a scene where she gave valuable advice to Futaba that I found to be very memorable and educational. (***Potential spoilers.***) In episode 6, Futaba was low in spirits as she found out that she did not get called back to do the voice of one of the main protagonists for a drama CD she voiced when her career have just started. In response to Futaba, Hikari told her this: ""...if the production company changes, or there are budget issues, the cast can often change between the drama CD and the anime. On top of that, they never tell you the changes ahead of time. It\'s painful, but it\'s something all seiyuu experience. ...You know, it doesn\'t matter to the audience if you\'re depressed, or hurting. No matter what happens, you have to do your work with everything you have. A family member might be in the hospital, or a pet might have died. But because it\'s work, no one lets that show in their attitude. That\'s the least a seiyuu can do to prepare for work. I think it would be rude to your fellow seiyuu otherwise. To do what is expected of you under any circumstance. That\'s what a professional does."" Personally, I found this part to be noteworthy as it shows how strong of a person Hikari is, but also how great of a role model she is for Futaba. Futaba needs to realize this, and Hikari didn\'t hold anything back in what she needs to hear. If it weren\'t for the fact that Hikari were honest with Futaba, then she likely would not have been able to pick herself up. Sometimes, we all need someone to snap us out of it, to tell us that we have to pick ourselves up because no one else will do it for us. (***Potential spoilers section over.***)I knew of most of the things that were mentioned about how a seiyuu\'s job is like, but there were things that the show talked about that I didn\'t know before--or didn\'t know much about before; for instance: seiyuus narrate audio books, when they have a role in a game, they tend to have to do a bunch of takes (as much as the sound director wants), and that for a unit to be formed, they need sponsors. However, just because you have a sponsor, it doesn\'t mean they will take care of everything and anything for you; sometimes, they can only do so much, and the seiyuus themselves have to figure something out--take things into their own hands, if ever needed.It\'s unlikely, but I\'m really hoping there will be more episodes from this series... Specials and/or OVAs would be nice, and of course, a second season would be more than welcome.In summary:- Recommend if you want to learn (more) about seiyuus; if you\'re even a little interested, it\'s worth checking out. It shows what goes on  behind-the-scenes, such as how animation projects\' staff works with voice actors.- Characters have varied personalities; they aren\'t epic, flashy characters that might leave lasting impressions like some characters from per say action shows would, but they are still likable in their own ways.- The art is simple, but fitting for this show; too complex art might be distracting.- The dialog gets the points across; it\'s not too heavily focused on explanations, but rather telling through showing.You\'re welcome to post a comment on my profile to tell me any feedback and/or critiques you have for my review; any feedback and/or critiques are appreciated.*** to prove to her agency that she have the potential to be a long working seiyuu, even years into the future.

To distinct from a show about voice acting. Read farther to understand.Initial expectations :A friend suggested this anime to me. Having seen a few episodes, she assumed it was informative about the voice acting job in Japan and as I was curious, I decided to watch it.In a way, it is indeed informative, but in a very superficial way. Each new pieces of information are brushed over without taking time to actually elaborate and overall, it almost disappears after the first few episodes, only appearing from time to time. Which is...fine if your aim and expectation is the slice of life genre, but really lacking if your aim and expectation is actually to show you what the seiyuu job is really like.Secondly, the show quickly focuses on the seiyuu-idol aspect of the job - in the same superficial manner - drifting even farther from my initial expectation.In short, I find it important that people are aware of what they are getting into, so they don\'t hold the wrong expectations.Story & CharactersIf you are familiar with slice of life, you might have already noticed that most of them are light-hearted and struggle-light. Aside from the context, Sora ga Seiyuu is as classical and average as one can be. Which isn\'t a complain, actually, when I\'m confronted to a genre I am aware of its average level, strong/weak points.Same can be said about the characters, you know their stereotypes just by looking at them. Their development is equally superficial (aka doing their job and nothing more).But then, those who already watched the show could come and say !!!SPOILERS!!! but look ! one of the heroine lost her job, has no gas or electricity anymore ! it\'s horrible ! and yes....in real life it is an awful situation, but it isn\'t portrayed as a big deal, not only do you have no idea if she ever gets gas and electricity back, or if she has new income (off-screen, you tell me and, yeah, it might be true, but not showing the resolution of a struggle or issue isn\'t really recommended if you want to put value into a resolution/struggle), but said heroine didn\'t seem to have such a different lifestyle ; basically, ""whining"" was the main difference. !!!END SPOILERS!!!But there again, it doesn\'t bother me too much. A lot of slice of life want to be keep you in a good mood, to be the ""every day life dream"" with ""issues not tarnishing the dream too much after all"". So be it story or character I never expect it to fly high because it isn\'t their primal aim (let\'s praise the ""slice of life"" animes going against that trend though) The only aspect that does bother me is the risk for part of the audience to actually buy that ""dreamy"" version of voice acting. Voice acting is a hard and tough job where nice speeches and solving an issue in less than five minutes hardly occur (!!!SPOILERS!!! I don\'t know how to do different sounds... -break, talk with friends- Yeah, I\'m closing my eyes and now I can figure how to do it right ! issue solved ladies and gentleman ! I wish life was that easy XD !!!END SPOILERS!!!), it takes you a LOT of dedication and constant ""homework"".Art :If there’s another thing worth mentioning, it’s the art. Just from the image on this page you can see the simplicity of the drawings. I’m not exactly against it, but the high inequality of the design – slow budget or not – bothers me. On one side, you have overly cute girls and women looking far younger (+ very few males), simple, but not sketchy, and on the other side you have the sketchy designs and the more realistic one. Those three types of design kind of tend to clash against each other. So I consider it a bad point.The background is also rather simplistic as well ; the animation varies from bad to average (even if it has a slight improvement for the last key scene).As a last add, if I had something to say about the opening, it’d be that it reflects the cheesiness of the show really well, but I skipped it past two episodes (I rarely watch them more than twice).Recommendation & Enjoyment :Overall, I’m not particularly fond of it, but it was somewhat distracting. So I’d say it was able to entertain me. I assume I could add that I enjoyed the pink haired girl the most and was expecting Hiroshi throughout the entire show (only shows up two times) just because I knew he’d be there and not because I’m particularly fond of him. You can consider this paragraph useless, but well.All in all, if you enjoy the average slice of life you can go for it if you want. If you’re curious about some aspects of the voice acting but not enough to actually put your head into it (aka a show about voice acting) you can always check this out, as long as you keep in mind it is an idealistic portrait ; at least the first episodes will satisfy you on that level. Lastly, if you enjoy idols, you might find some interests in this show, even if it isn’t the main focus either. fine if your aim and expectation is the slice of life genre, but really lacking if your aim and expectation is actually to show you what the seiyuu job is really like.Secondly, the show quickly focuses on the seiyuu-idol aspect of the job - in the same superficial manner - drifting even farther from my initial expectation.In short, I find it important that people are aware of what they are getting into, so they don\'t hold the wrong expectations.Story & CharactersIf you are familiar with slice of life, you might have already noticed that most of them are light-hearted and struggle-light.

Well, not that far, but we follow them a bit. Sore ga Seiyuu is a mixture between an ""educational"" anime about the voice acting industry and the life and (mis)fortunes of our heroines. It\'s definitely unique in its own way (though I haven\'t seen other seiyuu anime, so I can\'t really compare). What I really liked was the fact, that it\'s not all fun and rainbows and the girls have to deal with setbacks while progressing in accomplishing their goals. Even though it doesn\'t sugarcoat the seiyuu life, it...always left me with a good feeling after each episode.8/10Art:The visuals aren\'t very impressing. Since this is basically a slice of life anime, you will probably not expect anything flashy anyway. The characters are cute (though they look pretty young for adults, I mean, Futaba and Ichigo barely look older than Rin and the manager looks even younger) and the guest stars (who portray themselves) are recognizable (if you know what they look like). So in total, the art is average but absolutely okay.6/10Sound:The main characters are voiced by rather inexperienced seiyuu to fit the girls stage of career in this show. That was a pretty good decision, even though I can hardly believe that Rie Takahashi (voice of Futaba) is a ""newcomer"". They do a very good job and of course, the guests do as well (being stars of their profession after all). I am not a big fan of J-Pop so I may be the wrong person to judge the music, but I found it to be mediocre in general. However, the ending (which varies each episode) was really catchy and lots of fun.8/10Characters:Let\'s be honest, the main trio consists of stock characters. The self-doubting heroine who is unaware of her own potential, the hot-blooded brat who tries to hide her worries and the innocent cheerful child prodigy are characters we have seen before. But: the girls are very likeable. Even if you are not a big fan of them, you want to see them succeed and you feel bad for them when they fail. I think this is more important than the complexity of the characters. Sadly, no side characters are fleshed out much (except for maybe the manager), but that\'s excusable.7/10Enjoyment:As I already mentioned, Sore ga Seiyuu managed to put a smile on my face every time I watched a new episode. The show does not offer much in terms of tension or conflict (which it is not completely void of either though), but it wants you to invest emotions in it. You are supposed to care, and I did. In terms of slice of life, I recommend this to anyone who is fed up with always the same jokes and characters being recycled and nothing ever happening (not hating on these shows, just saying). It is not outstanding or groundbreaking, but it is worth a watch.8/10Overall:7.4/10 always left me with a good feeling after each episode.8/10Art:The visuals aren\'t very impressing.

Well...last year we had Shirobako, which I haven\'t seen, but seems to have had a higher budget. Even so, Sore ga Seiyuu might do in a pinch, although it only focuses on the voice acting aspects of anime production instead of the whole process.I guess I\'m showing my ""power levels"" here now when I say SgS is only the second manga I\'ve read first before it was made into an anime; in this case a doujin by seiyuu Masumi Asano. I actually heard about it before I\'d...heard about Shirobako...and yeah, I have to admit I\'ve become a bit of a seiyuuwota during my time in anime fandom. So this was one anime I was really looking forward to at the start of the summer season. Was it worth it? For the most part, yes.The SgS manga is a four-panel, and plenty of reviews have complained that a lot of anime based on four-panel manga tend to fall flat since the producers often seem to base their storyboards around the short jokes, leading to a somewhat disjointed flow. In the case of SgS however, while they did leave in some gags from the manga, the writers actually built some compelling, largely original stories into each episode giving details about all the different facets of voice acting in Japan (from anime to dubbing foreign films to recording video games) while reminding us that yes, the people who breathe life into our favorite characters are rather normal folks. Perhaps more normal than viewers unfamiliar with the  realities of the seiyuu scene would know; in one episode self-proclaimed Princess from Planet Strawberry Ichigo Moesaki is unable to pay her electric bill...right after losing her second job at a frozen-food warehouse after her seiyuu job starts conflicting with hours there. Meanwhile main character Futaba Ichinose also works a second job at a convenience store. The show never states it outright, but the implicit revelation here is that even in Animeland, voice acting doesn\'t pay all that well. Part of me wishes that they had gone into this a little more (and, heh, maybe discussed how many seiyuus actually do hentai material just to put food on the table; of course then they probably would\'ve had trouble getting sponsors). At the same time, though, so much anime lately has been laying on the darkness and edginess rather thick with minimal subtlety (usually not anime\'s strongest point) that it\'s a bit of a relief to only see some of the harsh realities implied (they do talk about saving money by having meatless curry for dinner; a gag imported from the manga). And surely not EVERY female seiyuu in anime history has ended up on the ""casting couch"" at some point, have they? Considering that an actual seiyuu wrote the original material, I\'m going to assume that what we see here is pretty true to the reality.In the last few episodes, I wish the show hadn\'t switched so much to our girls\' new idol unit group and away from voice acting. Again though, that seems to be a common trend among many female seiyuus these days, and often to supplement their incomes. (You may have looked at pictures for various seiyuus and thought they look more like models than people who supposedly only use their voices for a living; the old joke ""You\'ve got a great face for radio"" isn\'t necessarily true anymore, at least not in Japan, mainly because, again, a lot go into gravure and such to keep the lights on.) Or maybe I\'m overthinking it and they\'re just doing it because idol anime are all the rage these days. Or for that matter, it could be both (some of the more cynical types will say especially women just see voice acting as a stepping stone to real-life acting, modeling, or singing). Again, it still somewhat fits in with reality in how the girls\' producer somewhat pushed them into becoming idols rather than them deciding it on their own.Even so, the first half of the show does offer a good inside look at the workings of Japanese voice acting and how unstable the life actually is, sometimes with no role offers at all coming in when you really need them, sometimes so many that you need to run through busy streets to get to the studio. At the end of the day you\'re left with quite an appreciation for these people, which was doubtless Masumin\'s intention. Those who watched the higher-budgeted, likely better-animated Shirobako first (SgS was produced by the beleaguered studio Gonzo, but I thought the artwork was decent enough for a studio still recovering from near bankruptcy) might not be as impressed, but I\'d still advise anyone with an appreciation for voice acting to check it out. heard about Shirobako...and yeah, I have to admit I\'ve become a bit of a seiyuuwota during my time in anime fandom. So this was one anime I was really looking forward to at the start of the summer season. Was it worth it? For the most part, yes.The SgS manga is a four-panel, and plenty of reviews have complained that a lot of anime based on four-panel manga tend to fall flat since the producers often seem to base their storyboards around the short jokes, leading to a somewhat disjointed flow. In the case of SgS however, while they did leave in some gags from the manga, the writers actually built some compelling, largely original stories into each episode giving details about all the different facets of voice acting in Japan (from anime to dubbing foreign films to recording video games) while reminding us that yes, the people who breathe life into our favorite characters are rather normal folks. Perhaps more normal than viewers unfamiliar with the  realities of the seiyuu scene would know; in one episode self-proclaimed Princess from Planet Strawberry Ichigo Moesaki is unable to pay her electric bill...right after losing her second job at a frozen-food warehouse after her seiyuu job starts conflicting with hours there. Meanwhile main character Futaba Ichinose also works a second job at a convenience store. The show never states it outright, but the implicit revelation here is that even in Animeland, voice acting doesn\'t pay all that well. Part of me wishes that they had gone into this a little more (and, heh, maybe discussed how many seiyuus actually do hentai material just to put food on the table; of course then they probably would\'ve had trouble getting sponsors). At the same time, though, so much anime lately has been laying on the darkness and edginess rather thick with minimal subtlety (usually not anime\'s strongest point) that it\'s a bit of a relief to only see some of the harsh realities implied (they do talk about saving money by having meatless curry for dinner; a gag imported from the manga).

It\'s about time we finally got one about voice acting. Sore ga Seiyuu is show about three early-career seiyuus, voiced by early-career seiyuus nonetheless, being shown the ropes and challenges of the industry while being mentored by veteran VAs, many of whom are cast as themselves! Though the show doesn\'t have anything particularly nice animation-wise and is practically a blatant advertisement for Gonzo at times, it is a unique and welcome break from the endless cycle of other high school-centric shows. For veteran viewers of anime, this show is particularly nice...for its long cameos by VA veterans and for everyone else it gives an interesting look at the challenging and competitive nature of the seiyuu industry, and perhaps reasons why the job is so much more respected in Japan compared to the rest of the world.The show follows a new trainee VA, Futaba, as she auditions and works in various roles and eventually joins an idol group and radio show with two other new VAs.Animation:To be honest, Gonzo is not my go-to animation studio when I\'m looking for good eye candy. This show only reinforces that fact with relatively cheap animation characteristics. Expect a show with simple backgrounds and details throughout. Though the scenery inside a studio is new for probably most viewers, this obviously isn\'t a high-budget show. Likewise, expect relatively plain looking characters with average at best facial animations. I\'m still not sure what to make of Sayo-chan\'s heart-shaped pupils or Futaba\'s rather hideous doll/mascot Korori. The only real positives here are the caricatures of real VAs. Yui Horie\'s transformation from messy glasses girl to super-popular idol is perhaps a bit of an exaggeration but pretty fun nonetheless. Given the nature of the show, don\'t expect too much action or ecchi.Sound:The show starts with what sounds like an annoying OP, but one that eventually grows on you if you listen to it enough times- it\'s kind of an amalgamation of multiple songs using the same instrumentation. The ED is also fairly innovative, kind of like a play on the group\'s radio show; it combines a pretty catchy main melody section, free dialogue section, a section of ""requested"" famous songs, and a next-episode preview. The BGM is fairly active though nothing is particularly memorable.There is a pretty large VA cast, with a lot of special guests including huge veterans such as Masako Nozawa, Hiroshi Kamiya, Ryouko Shiraishi, and Yui Horie to name a few. The heroines do a fair job overall but it\'s hard not to be overshadowed by such veterans. Though on purpose, one of the weird pills to swallow with this show is that the ""trainee"" heroines perform quite horribly when actually in the recording studio and then immediately sound like the capable VAs that they are once outside the recording studios.Story:The show follows Futaba and later two other early career VAs as they work to build their experience and reputation. Though there are some plot twists and tension moments, a large portion of the show is spent explaining the ropes to the viewer, which I felt was pretty cool for once. For the first time, the general audience gets to see the working conditions and living conditions of the VAs that they so admire. The show even spends an entire episode on the manager\'s perspective, showing how scheduling can be a full time job in and of itself.To me, this show felt more like Gin no Saki than Mangaka-san to Assistant-san; it focuses a lot more on the actual craft and giving viewer insight than really exploring character relations and milking the perspective for comedic value. For that, I give the show props, even if it means many people won\'t find it interesting.Character:So the three heroines are supposed to grow throughout the show, and by the end, indeed they do seem to be more confident when in the studios. However, you never really get to bond with the barely-developed VAs, perhaps this is meant to reflect the idea that the VA\'s aren\'t important- it\'s the characters that they give life to that are. That being said, what are interesting are the portrayals of famous VAs. I mentioned Yui Horie earlier but Ryouko Shiraishi also gives Futaba a pep-talk about overworking herself, something that Shiraishi actually went through in real life- thus giving depth to... not the characters but the actual VAs that you\'ve watched in other shows (indeed... quite deep there). Though I have no idea how realistic the portrayals of the VAs are in other respects (glasses with Yui Horie, Hiroshi Kamiya as a rebellious youth, Rikiya Koyama as a health fanatic, etc.) it does beat in the idea that the voices behind the characters actually have real lives too.Value:The value of this show is twofold, you get to learn about seiyuus as a job and you get to learn about real life seiyuus. Despite the fairly average plot and boiler plate animation, there\'s enough good content here to merit a watch. If you ever were curious about voicing roles be it anime, games, movies, or radio here\'s your chance to find out how it\'s done. for its long cameos by VA veterans and for everyone else it gives an interesting look at the challenging and competitive nature of the seiyuu industry, and perhaps reasons why the job is so much more respected in Japan compared to the rest of the world.The show follows a new trainee VA, Futaba, as she auditions and works in various roles and eventually joins an idol group and radio show with two other new VAs.Animation:To be honest, Gonzo is not my go-to animation studio when I\'m looking for good eye candy.

The characters are fine.  The situations are moderately interesting.  The focus is mainly on the scope of banal entry-level tasks that a seiyu is likely to do, so don't expect to see anyone doing in-depth research or full-on method acting for a major role.  The show swings back and forth between affecting a light tone and then hitting you with the anxiety-inducing nature of a job where you can fade away into obsolescence at any time.The main place where the series stumbles is...in how much time it spends on the three main seiyu forming an idol group.  About half the series focuses on this plotline, and while I realise this can be a significant part of a seiyu's job, it doesn't do anything to stand out in the overcrowded pop idol genre.  It would have been better sticking to its niche and giving more insight into the voice acting side of the job.  For that reason, if you only want to watch one anime about seiyu, I'd recommend Girlish Number instead.  But if you want to watch two, this one was pretty entertaining. in how much time it spends on the three main seiyu forming an idol group.

Sore ga Seiyuu is an absorbing look behind the scenes of the Japanese voice actor industry. The main characters are written with empathy and are very easy to root for. As the show details their successes and failures as emerging seiyuu, it also provides an  overview of the broader workings of the industry. While the show is not a granular examination of the profession, and its portrayal can seem idealized at times, nevertheless it is informative and always finds ways to remain interesting. Though only 13 episodes long, by the end of the series I found myself heavily invested in the...dreams and ambitions of nearly every significant character.The show is working with a smaller budget, but the character designs are appealing and the backgrounds give a very lived in feel to the world. What naturally comes to the forefront in a show like this is the voice acting, and across the board it's fantastic. There are many famous seiyuu who appear as themselves, and each charming cameo gives added realism to the show while also serving the character development of the leads. Every ED features unique song records from the MCs, and that attention to detail from a voice acting perspective is a very nice touch. I would happily watch 10 more seasons but at least we got the one. dreams and ambitions of nearly every significant character.The show is working with a smaller budget, but the character designs are appealing and the backgrounds give a very lived in feel to the world.

Show By Rock!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/27441/Show_By_Rock,"[""Man, I really wanted to like Show By Rock.There was something quite special about it for a short time. It strayed very much on the 'simple' side of entertainment, confident more in the cuteness of its cast than anything else, but damn, it worked. It brought me the same sort of joy I felt back in the Middle Ages when K-ON first started airing. But, as seems to be the trend with most anime, it decided to abandon everything it did well and instead shoehorn in a cheesy, boring action story that the characters were obviously not meant to be a part of. Great....I remember telling my friends to give the show a shot beyond the first episode, which, at the time, seemed very misleading and unlike anything that came after. And while I would still stick to my comment that there is nowhere near as much CG as the first episode suggests, the actual content of the anime-- its story, its themes-- is that same nonsense over and over again. The interesting bits in the middle of the anime are the actual misleading part.There is nothing wrong with an anime not being what you expected it to be. Genre shifts, when done effectively, are one of the most powerful techniques in storytelling. It's not necessarily the change in style or genre that is the issue with Show By Rock, but that what it changes to is so half-hearted, so stale and lifeless that you can't help but wonder if, maybe, something went wrong during its production. Half the time it wants to be a light-hearted music show, and the other half it wants to be some deeply emotional battle opera. And as a result it succeeds in being neither.The melodrama is tiresome, to say the least. Far too little time is spent developing the characters before it is suddenly thrown our way. Five episodes in, nothing meaningful or interesting having occurred with the characters yet, it suddenly acts as though we are supposed to care when the main four's friendship is falling apart. Give me a break. The reason why K-ON-- the anime that Show By Rock clearly wanted to be-- worked so well is because it focused on making us care about the characters long before doing anything dramatic or emotional with them. Drama, if meant to be taken even remotely seriously, is a privilege that must first be earned. Show By Rock does nothing to earn it. It acts as though it is the audience's duty to cry along when the background music urges us to. No thanks. It can take my groans and sighs instead.And, really, it's stuff like this that is the biggest disappointment, because there's clearly some signs of talent hidden underneath all its problems. During the sixth episode, Cyan sings a love song in order to show her true feelings (demonstrating how important the music - supposedly - is to her), and her seiyuu actually sounds like she's about to break down and cry during it. There is obviously no real emotional response to be had with this scene, but the execution itself is pretty remarkable. If it had actually been put at the end with the rest of the series slowly building up towards it, it could have been a genuinely amazing scene. There's some neat pieces here, but the pieces are arranged so poorly that none of it actually means anything. If you slap pretty things together with no consideration as to how each individual piece works, it will invariably be a mess.I suppose the addition of four bishounen characters helps add some variety to an otherwise one-note story, but the entire time it just felt as if they were taking precious screentime that could have been better spent developing Cyan and her friends. Or, heck, they could have had their own show instead -  at least the stupidity they got themselves involved in was more entertaining than all the drama with the girls. As it stands, it feels like the production team had far too many visions for the anime going on at once, and rather than settle for one, they attempted to incorporate all three or eight of them.If nothing else, at least the sound and visuals don't entirely suck. The opening is super cute and feels like something that would have come straight out of K-ON, which, in my book, is certainly not a bad thing. The CG, on the other hand, is very much off-putting-- switching between two distinct art styles rarely ever works well-- but it's not frequent enough to truly be bothersome. Even when there is big explosive CG action nonsense going on, it looks fine. It actually carries a sort of professional quality to it, which sets it apart from pretty much all CG in anime. It's just that the traditional 2D stuff is so much more appealing, what with all the adorable faces and poses that Cyan makes...You've probably guessed from all the complaining, but I am not a very big fan of the show. I cannot recommend watching it unless you are bored out of your mind and possess a bottomless well of patience for mediocrity. You won't be missing anything of great importance if you decide to skip on it and check out something else instead, anyway.

Girl tries to join a band but with...her shy personality she pushes it off and randomly gets sucked into a world where music is the soul of the city new friendships begin confidence builds and monsters must be defeated through the shear power of music and stuff.The art is definitely something that just pops out it is super vibrant really colorful cute character designs and also great character designs i find it to be very ""I cant take my eyes off it"" But at times during most of the episodes during when something big is happening characters turn into cute little animals and totally changes the animation into cgi which catches you by suprise but with the unpredictability of the anime. Some will love it and others who like the gritty art work and a dark color scheme will not be drawn to it but one thing you cant say is that it doesn\'t stick out.Music is the main theme of the entire show so the music is great a really catchy opening as well as an ending. The music theme is rock so with the japanese rock music the ost is great everything is on point especially since its a rock music anime everything just fits and works.The characters range from super adorable-Hilarious-Dark and possibly more but from what i have seen you get a cute girl band where all the characters have different personalities but they are all bonded as the show progresses and build a stronger bond. A boy band with super funny guys and again all different personalities but are bonded and the enemies who are trying to corrupt the city. Alot of variety in the cast of characters and everything i wanted i got.I enjoyed the anime alot and had some of my favourite moments from the anime season with this show also anything that gets me emotionally invested by the end is something i love the ending was super feelsy and could potentially make your eyes water so get the box of tissues also the very end leaves you with a sense of satisfaction.8/10 - 2nd most underrated anime of the season for me. her shy personality she pushes it off and randomly gets sucked into a world where music is the soul of the city new friendships begin confidence builds and monsters must be defeated through the shear power of music and stuff.The art is definitely something that just pops out it is super vibrant really colorful cute character designs and also great character designs i find it to be very ""I cant take my eyes off it"" But at times during most of the episodes during when something big is happening characters turn into cute little animals and totally changes the animation into cgi which catches you by suprise but with the unpredictability of the anime. Some will love it and others who like the gritty art work and a dark color scheme will not be drawn to it but one thing you cant say is that it doesn\'t stick out.Music is the main theme of the entire show so the music is great a really catchy opening as well as an ending.

When reading this review, expect to see a few spoilers.After 12 episodes of good ol\' rock, I can confidently say that Show By Rock has been a very good watch this season. To show an example of what kind of anime it\'s like, imagine a quirky moe anime that turned out surprisingly fun to watch despite being a bit weirder than other shows of the same category. It\'s as if you\'re watching a bizarre fairy tale incorporating catchy rock and cute girls without becoming...a K-on! clone. It\'s spontaneous, absurd, wacky and easy to watch as you witness four adorable girls and a sexy visual kei band hone and develop their skills while bonding together to become the very best band while protecting their precious world from shady monsters.Characters- 8/10A shy girl who wishes to join a band gets to meet other cute girls and have fun together. Sounds simple right? Well imagine that girl suddenly being sucked into a world where producing music is essentially the true meaning to life. Add a twintailed megane tsundere, a cheerful alien, a gorgeous bunnygirl, a talking guitar, an egg for a manager and this absolutely hilarious boyband and you have all the materials you need for an unforgettably interesting show. For the most part, the characters are very attractive and charming and yes, very crazy.If I were to nitpick about character flaws, it would have to be how the director chose to stick with tropes. It does kind of lead the viewer into being able to predict some character\'s future actions somewhat based on their behavior contrary to how I said that this show was actually unpredictable. Nonetheless, the story is able to make up for some of the character\'s predictabilityStory- 6.5/10 (CAUTION: This part has a few spoilers!!)One of the key strengths of this anime is that you never really know what\'s going to happen in the next episode because each episode gets more and more ridiculous as the story progresses which is mostly due to the characters acting nonsensical but being able to be very likable at the same time.So then this brings us the question: why did I choose to introduce the characters first and give the story the lowest score? After completing the anime, I realized that there are a few flaws in the main plot.Despite being centered around Cyan, Show By Rock! unfortunately happens to focus a bit too many of its episodes on Shingancrimsonz to the point where they outshine Cyan and the other members of Plasmagica. The characters themselves are actually quite fine; they are all intriguing to some degree and are very charming. However, the 2-3 episodes that revolve around Shingancrimsonz seemed to de-rail the story progression at times and halt the character development within Plasmagica. Furthermore, this results in moments of awkward pacing. Essentially, rather than the problems having to do with the characters themselves, the anime situated itself in a troublesome and awkward angle where Shingancrimsonz became the main characters and caused an awkward transition back to the main story afterwards. This was something that I simply could not ignore.On the other hand, in spite of the story becoming off-track, the entire anime itself isn\'t horrifically affected from those episodes (they were quite enjoyable to be honest). For the most part, the story is actually quite good. It does in fact move forward even during those Shingancrimsonz episodes and actually has a lot of relation to the upcoming events (especially the foreshadowing). Though they were seemingly redundant at times, they were very enjoyable regardless of the weakening in the overall plot.  The story is still very bizarre and I can assure you that it won\'t really get in the way of your enjoyment when watching this show. In fact, I can tell you guys right now, expect to see some crazy stuff going on in the last two episodes!Art- 8/10This is actually a controversial topic since many viewers seem to have divided opinions about the rather unique usage of CG animation. While the characters will be drawn in a traditional style that\'s at least similar to most animes most of the time , there will be times when a sudden transition will occur which then turns your beloved characters into extremely distorted animal forms. It is an abrupt process that can seem ""off balance"" to many people. My opinion however is that this transition is so ludicrous and over-the-top that it actually goes well with the entire show since the entire thing is supposed to be eccentric anyway.Other than that, I can definitely say that the art is nice looking for the most part as Bones Studio utilizes an appealing style of colorful, stylish designs as seen from their previous works such as Space Dandy. The characters move fluidly and the guitar playing seems to match with the songs for the majority of the show. Well what else could you expect from Studio Bones other than a great performance?Sound- 8/10This is definitely a major asset of the entire show. An EXTREMELY addicting opening and a catchy ending song along with the numerous insert songs that will get you fired up as if you\'re in an actual rock concert, I guarantee that you will like this show if you enjoy J-rock to some degree. Hopefully, there will be more crazy guitar solos and shredding in the future episodes because the songs are great so far. The only thing that can possibly make this better is if they add some heavy metal to it. Yeah that would be totally kickass!EDIT: The background tracks in some parts of the anime are ominous sounding enough where it actually becomes metal! Also, though many parts of the show are light rock, all of the tracks are very melodious to the ears. I highly recommend trying to get a sample listening of the entire soundtrack because it is definitely GLORIOUS. The insert songs are just fabulously good!Enjoyment- 9/10I really shouldn\'t have to explain any more about this part. From what I\'ve described already, you should be able to imagine how much of a wild experience this show will be. I would like to point out that despite Sanrio (the studio that apparently made the original rhythm game) stating that the characters were based for an older male audience, the show can definitely be enjoyed by people of all ages. Both male and females can easily enjoy this show since there is some degree of subtle fan-service (super moe level from Plasmagica and manliness from Shingancrimsonz) though there definitely isn\'t an excessive amount.I must emphasize once again that every episode is weird enough to make you want to see more. This show is definitely far from being generic as possible. I mean, it\'s no Legend of the Galactic Heroes but I can say with confidence that this show is insane! It would make Dante from Devil May Cry very proud if he ever saw these lovable girls rocking their socks off while battling monsters to save their world.Overall- 8/10I\'m extremely content with the results that Bones has produced in 2015. If you\'re hesitating to watch this show because of the low score on MAL, stop everything you\'re doing at the moment and think about giving the show a try. It\'s seriously better than what you would expect in the first place. I\'ve been watching other shows from Spring 2015 and I can confidently say that this show has been better than otherwise cliche animes (pointing at a certain twin-tailed greek loli goddess and an almost 9-year old loli android who works in an office). This show is definitely a  good recommendation for those who want an anime that\'s easy to follow yet far from generic as possible. a K-on! clone.

Leaving out the talking guitar, cat ears, alien sheep, and the music, you might think you should take this anime seriously.Don\'t.I warned you.Even the first episode has an alternate theme song animation that tricks you into thinking it\'s a K-ON clone. It really isn\'t.My Reactions To...The First Episode:Okay, weak female protagonist is too shy to join a band. Okay, fine. Now she\'s home playing a song. Good. Now she\'s playing a cool rythmn game. Something suspicious happens with her phone.//what the heck is going on//*adorableness overload*SPOILERS AHEADStory: //7//Show By Rock has a very intriguing story, though it is simple, and for the most part, straightfoward. No next-level crap or complicated plot twists here, just ""play music to get to the top and be cool and famous"" with a little bit of ""defeat these horrible shadow monsters"".I\'d have to say, my favorite part was when I realized that Strawberry Heart (aka Mr. Berry) was the Grateful King himself. That was the closest I got to surprised, though I couldn\'t predict where the story would go, due to the unpredictable nature of the anime in general.I did find that it got a little slow towards the middle, which is dangerous for anime, as that\'s when I\'m most likely to stop watching.Aside from explaining the plot itself, there\'s nothing much else to say here.END SPOILERArt And Presentation: //8//I found the art style in general very enjoyable and easy to look at. One interesting part of this particular anime\'s art style is the fact that it also has  a pretty hefty chunk of three-dimensional animation. I, for one, loved that particular aspect of the series, as it was something I hadn\'t seen yet. (and the 3-d models were all super adorable)The show presents itself nicely, and there were very few moments where I thought the animation looked awkward, though I\'m not usually one to notice animation errors.The dub was actually well done! This made the show so pleasant to watch, even for someone who usually will watch the subs first. I actually watched a couple episodes near the middle subbed to see how it was, and I actually really wanted to go back to the dub! That doesn\'t usually happen for me.Sound: //8//Mostly, I didn\'t pay particular attention to the background music, but the songs in the anime were catchy and fun-sounding. As far as the balancing of volume, I thought it was well-done. Not much to be said here.Characters: //9//Oh boy. Characters usually make or break an anime for me, and I suspect that is the case for many others. I have to say, though I rated Characters a 9, that the main 4 characters actually have fairly predictable character development, maybe besides Moa.The real reason I rated characters a 9 is for the awesome cast of zany supporting characters that I found enjoyable, and many times relatable.The other bands have interesting characters, often extremely wacky or exaggerated, but they don\'t get repetitive. Little details like one band selling mineral water and one band having yokai members really made the experience enjoyable for me.I am glad, however, that there actually was character development for the main characters, unlike some anime. *cough cough*I did find it disappointing that Moa, who like I mentioned was the most unpredictable, got less character development than the others.Overall, I enjoyed this anime a lot, and I think I\'m going to re-watch it soon with my sister, who I\'m sure will enjoy it. Something I do have to say, though, is that if you don\'t think you\'ll like it, still try it. You might actually like it! The First Episode:Okay, weak female protagonist is too shy to join a band.

You might actually like it!', 'Now, when you first look at this anime you\'ll think how is this different than any other ""Music animes"" Well here let me tell you a little story.When i first started watching this series my thoughts were, how can this compete with for example Love Live! School idol project, since that was the first ""Music Anime"" i watched, (i think?) Well let me tell you something, I was wrong. I can\'t compare it.Show by  rock is about a girl named Cyan, who is terrified of everything and everyone, her self-confidence is -10, what we get in this anime is the character development of Cyan...and her group, combined with many other characters and groups all this in 12 episodes. This is the part where you\'d think ""Holy shit how is that possible, it has to be like very shallow!"" Well you\'re wrong, if you listen and learn from the Character development episodes, you\'ll see that it is more deep than you\'d ever thought.I did not have high hopes for this anime, the only reason i started watching it, is because kissanime (Kissanime.com) described it as ""A kitty girl wearing gothic lolita clothing"" I got totally sold from that preparing my body only to watch that kitty girl.Now that i\'ve watched it i\'d recommend it to anyone who likes anime. It doesn\'t matter what kind of genre they like, they will love this one aswell.The problems this Anime had is following:First off the cgi was insane i mean, it really looked kinda terrible, but when you get used to it or are used to cgi normally (which i wasn\'t) it turns out to be a very nice eye show.Second, since the anime was very short they had to hurry up the story a bit, even though the CH. Dev. was amazing, the story took quite a hit and is very fast progressing. (imagine if the story was just amazing as the CH. Dev. Holy shite that\'d be a favvy of mine)Third, the music, now when you think about a music anime you\'ll think ""Oh man! Alot of new music!"" Well it\'s too bad that in this anime, they have too few music parts, this made me quite sad, making it only an ""8"" in enjoyment.But overall it got a 9 which is quite nice actually.Thank you for your reading hope you\'ll learn something from it atleast :)Cuddles! //Duztie and her group, combined with many other characters and groups all this in 12 episodes.

But what if I were to mash rock and moe? We probably have some anime that got this kind of crossover, one example being the famous K-On series. This season has one anime covered for this crossover, and you may like it a lot if you are into both things.Show By Rock!! is based of a rhythmic video game aimed for the male audience. Its anime is produced by Bones, which was honestly shocking when I researched on its production staff months ago. I never thought that Bones has done...moe before (or maybe they did, I just do not know yet), so this might be an interesting take. The story sets in Midicity, a city that never sleeps and always up for music, and revolves around an aspiring rock band of four band members Plasmagica. One of them is Cyan, who is sucked into this world from Earth. Her introduction to Midicity makes a big notice to many - having to fight a “dark monster” and afterwards she is found by the president of Banded Rocking Records, which manages Plasmagica and Shingan Crimsonz, called Maple. From then on, the band has a wonderful experience rocking out together, meeting with more-famous bands along the way and a fun journey ahead. But as they enjoy their fun times, danger looms around Midicity.The story is pretty much episodic, usually dealing with problems that came about either through themselves or a band. Apart from that, there is also a sub-plot which I looked forward for the most about these “dark monster”. I found the overall story is nicely-executed and it is quite simple to understand the context of it. The story is comedic most of the time, with a lot of cute moments to feel happy about. Sometimes, it can get quite dramatic when there is a fallout and I do not think it is forced. The anime has no major problem with flaws such as plotholes or pacing, although I think the last episode has a lot of things happening - it is something that many anime suffer, but what can you do anyway? I must say that it is a great original anime done well.Plasmagica may look like a very weird rock band, but after watching the anime, I feel that the band possesses something unique, despite how ordinary they might be in terms of music. With guitarists Cyan and Chuchu, bassist Retoree and drummer Moa, they make an interesting combination to look out for whenever they perform. Since they are the main focus of the story, they are the main characters of the anime. They have different personalities that are similar to other anime characters, however still enjoyable to watch because of their interactions. Each of them have developed along the storyline, especially for Cyan, who used to be shy in her real life counterpart. The cast has also other bands such as Shingan Crimsonz - a male rock band with a theme I could not describe, Trichronika - which is introduced in the first episode, and more. A few of them look like opponents to Plasmagica, but nevertheless all of them give a push for the main band’s progress, and it is nice to see that. There is also the antagonist of the anime who is related to the “dark monsters” and he plans to take over Midicity with the help of someone.I want to stress that 3D animation does not mean the anime looks like poop. The anime has a fair usage of it, and that is during performance or battle time. You probably encounter this kind of animation on every episode, and it does not take more than 30% of an episode. My thoughts: I really love it a lot. The 3D character designs feature the band members in chibi form and the animation is so fluid, which goes along well with nice visual effects. Hence, 3D animation is not necessary bad for some anime, and it can be used if there is intention to do so. Onto everything else, most of the sceneries come from Midicity, that portrays similarly to a busy downtown with lots of flashy colourful lights and billboards, and music blasting out from place to place. They look great, but it annoys me that the sky is always dark. I wonder how the characters tell time. The character designs are nice and cute, all of them look great in their own way. Each of them has an animal trait that goes along with their design.Being a music anime, I am glad of the music of the anime is being offered. It is nice that some bands have a unique trait with their music like that one band which fuses rock to Asian tunes. Since there are a lot of bands, expect a huge song collection from this franchise. The opening and ending songs, sung by Plasmagica, are very enjoyable and great for singing as well. The opening song is very addicting that I kept it on loop sometimes, while the ending song is more catchy. I personally did not care about the soundtrack much, but I have faith that they are nice. I love the voice acting. Being a seiyuu fan myself, I always adore these seiyuus for acting their very best in their own respective characters. Inagawa Eri’s first role is Cyan, so I like to give mention for her great voice acting and I hope to see her in future roles.I do not understand why someone does not like this anime, and I feel that it deserves more recognition. It is one of those anime this season that has little mention but has a great quality overall. I personally enjoyed this anime a lot and I constantly asked for another episode every time a cliffhanger is dropped. I do not mind seeing more of Show By Rock!!, but I do not think there will be a sequel. Maybe a side story depicting another band is nice.Moa for best girl! moe before (or maybe they did, I just do not know yet), so this might be an interesting take. The story sets in Midicity, a city that never sleeps and always up for music, and revolves around an aspiring rock band of four band members Plasmagica.

They have different personalities that are similar to other anime characters, however still enjoyable to watch because of their interactions. Each of them have developed along the storyline, especially for Cyan, who used to be shy in her real life counterpart. The cast has also other bands such as Shingan Crimsonz - a male rock band with a theme I could not describe, Trichronika - which is introduced in the first episode, and more. A few of them look like opponents to Plasmagica, but nevertheless all of them give a push for the main band’s progress, and it is nice to see that. There is also the antagonist of the anime who is related to the “dark monsters” and he plans to take over Midicity with the help of someone.I want to stress that 3D animation does not mean the anime looks like poop. The anime has a fair usage of it, and that is during performance or battle time. You probably encounter this kind of animation on every episode, and it does not take more than 30% of an episode. My thoughts: I really love it a lot. The 3D character designs feature the band members in chibi form and the animation is so fluid, which goes along well with nice visual effects. Hence, 3D animation is not necessary bad for some anime, and it can be used if there is intention to do so. Onto everything else, most of the sceneries come from Midicity, that portrays similarly to a busy downtown with lots of flashy colourful lights and billboards, and music blasting out from place to place. They look great, but it annoys me that the sky is always dark. I wonder how the characters tell time. The character designs are nice and cute, all of them look great in their own way. Each of them has an animal trait that goes along with their design.Being a music anime, I am glad of the music of the anime is being offered. It is nice that some bands have a unique trait with their music like that one band which fuses rock to Asian tunes. Since there are a lot of bands, expect a huge song collection from this franchise. The opening and ending songs, sung by Plasmagica, are very enjoyable and great for singing as well. The opening song is very addicting that I kept it on loop sometimes, while the ending song is more catchy. I personally did not care about the soundtrack much, but I have faith that they are nice. I love the voice acting. Being a seiyuu fan myself, I always adore these seiyuus for acting their very best in their own respective characters. Inagawa Eri’s first role is Cyan, so I like to give mention for her great voice acting and I hope to see her in future roles.I do not understand why someone does not like this anime, and I feel that it deserves more recognition. It is one of those anime this season that has little mention but has a great quality overall. I personally enjoyed this anime a lot and I constantly asked for another episode every time a cliffhanger is dropped. I do not mind seeing more of Show By Rock!!, but I do not think there will be a sequel. Maybe a side story depicting another band is nice.Moa for best girl!', '(This has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)There’s this game series that is pretty popular, or at least, it was during its heyday. This video game is called “Guitar Hero.” I was never a music guy myself – I couldn’t play brass instruments, the “cool” drums, or jam out on an acoustic. But I had “Guitar Hero,” where playing was simpler, screw-ups were okay, and I got to have fun with a whammy bar. I got so good at the game that I managed to beat “Through the Fire and Flames,” considered one of the best “boss battles” in gaming history. I was...capable of making music, albeit dumbed down, but it was music nonetheless. With it brought happiness and plentiful memories that I’ll never forget. Show By Rock!! looks at “the power of music,” but unfortunately becomes tone-deaf along the way.STORYRock stars (pun intended) Cyan Hijirikawa, a young girl too nervous to join her school’s band club. One night, she finds herself magically whisked away to Midi City, the land where music is king. Alongside ChuChu, Retoree, and Moa, “Plasmagica” aims for the top of the sound-filled metropolis.Music is a pretty crazy phenomenon when you take a step back to look at it. There’s a lot that goes into crafting tones, beats, and melodies, but music doesn’t always have to be so involved. If you take a bunch of pebbles and put them in a cup and shake it around, you just made music. It might not be very good or worth listening to, but it is music nonetheless. No matter how rudimentary or intricate a musical piece becomes, everyone can understand the sounds that are produced. Music is like math in a way; it’s a “universal language” that people of any background or creed can speak with. One doesn’t have to live in Japan to appreciate their style, and the same goes for other places. Countries in Africa, Europe, and Asia have their own methods of producing fun-loving music, and while someone might not get the culture or even the notes themselves, he or she can still understand the emotion or message those musical pieces are infused with.This is what Rock tries to show. Bands like “Plasmagica,” “Shingancrimsonz,” and “Criti Crista” each has a signature style and distinct personality, but they are able to connect with one another and the fans that follow them through the very music they play. What’s even more profound is the effect their performances have. The joy they bring, the tighter bonds they establish between each other, and the inspiration they instill; music does so much more than simply reverberate in our ears. There are instances in the show that demonstrate this thinking. There’s Aion’s descent into negativity cured by his duo with Crow; Chuchu’s true motivations being known thanks to a simple practice session; and Cyan’s nighttime singing bringing her group closer than ever before. Many events mirror these – showcasing music’s strange ability to strengthen relationships – reinforcing the idea that music is a force to be reckoned with.Unfortunately for the anime, there are two issues that persist throughout the season and become apparent by the show’s conclusion. First is providing the aftermath of what music brings. It’s nice seeing the lead up and eventual culmination, but the show oddly refuses to use the bands and their relationships to further the narrative. Something simple is using the smaller groups visited and helped later on to impact the plot’s direction, but the show doesn’t include them. This can also be seen in the finale; it isn’t music that saves the day, but a covert operation led by a rat girl and something akin to Cupid’s bow and arrow that protect the city. Music fixes the conflicts but never seems to be used to the extent to which the anime places emphasis on.Speaking of conflicts, the second issue that Rock faces is sustaining dramatic tension. The separate scenarios usually occur and finish in the episode in which they are introduced. Those three previous examples brought up a couple of paragraphs ago are each resolved over the course of a single episode instead of being elongated. Introducing one conflict after another is an okay approach, but such a tactic prevents the show from feeling as dire as it intends to be. This is especially true for Rock, considering how it doesn’t use the aftereffects of its conflicts to its advantage and how it isn’t designed as a slice-of-life offering due to the overarching dilemma.ANIMATIONGlancing at Rock’s art style leaves one in a state of wonderment. Midi City and the surrounding areas are rife with color. The buildings are mostly blue due to the “electric” feel of the place, but the signs, the venues, and the various nuances take on quite the vibrant hues that make the environments shine brilliantly. But what Rock does better than almost any other anime is its CG usage. The locations vary by theme (depending on the band in question), but it’s the characters and their designs that give it an appropriate feel. Essentially, they appear to be plastic models, making them feel out of place but in a way that strangely fits the style and tone of the show.When the characters are not in three-dimensional mode, the designs maintain high quality. Each cast member is, more or less, an animal of some kind; Cyan is a cat, Chuchu is a bunny, etc. Their animal backgrounds provide them with small details – such as Moa’s fluffy hair (since she’s a sheep) and Rom’s spotted cloak (since he’s a cheetah) – but the show goes beyond such symbolism. They all have their own distinct colorings, accessories, instruments, and clothing that separate them not just from individual bands but from their own group members, too.Actual animation remains somewhere close to average. What’s interesting is that the CG segments are actually quite above average in execution, and it appears that they will be used regularly. Sadly, the show doesn’t use this element as much as it could and even as much as it should have. During the two-dimensional scenarios, which comprise the majority of the show, the anime surprisingly doesn’t have the bands perform their music, mostly saving it for the extra dimension outings. Besides feigning the need to animate at times, there is a lot of standing around and talking, with the occasional trek through the forest or walk down the sidewalk to bring about variance, but nothing too extravagant.CHARACTERSRock is another anime that actually has a larger cast size than at first perceived. While it does try to give different members their own time in the spotlight, many of them are quite weak, mostly due to time constraints and focusing on one character in particular only to then forget about them later on. This happens specifically to the major members of “Plasmagica.” Starting with Moa, she is technically an alien from another planet, visiting to gain information about the one she’s on now. Even with the uniqueness of the festivities around them, she is still an outlier. But the show doesn’t divulge into this side of her after the band comes together, and in fact her presence is minimal near the end. Retoree follows the same trend; there is an episode dedicated to her and her difficulty in holding friendships with others. However, following her realization that the people closest to her now are the very friends she was seeking, she isn’t looked at in-depth again.Chuchu fairs a bit better, but not by much. Chuchu’s backstory and mannerisms indicated a certain amount of jealousy towards others. She saw herself as the best, so when Cyan came along and “stole her thunder,” she slowly but surely became a bit agitated with her new band mate. Her selfish desires – of wanting to be the best, doing whatever it takes to reach the top even if that means ditching her companions – comes to light, but Cyan, Retoree, and Moa aren’t particularly phased. They understand that everyone is a little selfish from time to time, but that doesn’t mean that Chuchu’s actions didn’t help them and the band out. They accept Chuchu for who she is – as a fellow band member, a person, and most of all, as a dear friend.As for Cyan, her character is one of the worst that the show has to offer. It’s rather unclear what her character’s purpose is besides acting cute, fighting the bad guys, and being the fourth person of “Plasmagica.” The very beginning of the season painted her as someone with self-esteem issues, as a girl without the courage to do what she really wanted. For the rest of the season, the show then places its focus on the other girls, other bands, and even other characters that don’t directly influence Cyan and her development. She’s quite passive, being nice and saying kindhearted words to those around her on occasion, but never really standing out as a person let alone as the main character of the anime. In other words, she never seems affected by what happens, instead acting and speaking as she regularly does, going about her business the same way as always. It’s not until the conclusion that she finally decides to muster the courage to do what she could not, but without the proper build-up, it happens too suddenly and seemingly out of nowhere. It makes sense that her character would progress to this point, considering where she started, but nothing in the middle indicated that she was heading there.There are other character issues as well, such as Rom and Shuuzou’s past relationship not being fleshed out enough or having little to go off of in regards to Yaiba (the “hence” guy) and Maple (the president of “Banded Rocking Records”). But the worst is Dagger, the villain of the series. He’s a business tycoon who wants only the best of the best “working” for him. His main goal is to be the ruler of Midi City, but in similar fashion to Cyan, he doesn’t do much of anything. He normally sits on the sidelines, having his underlings do most of the work. When he finally decides to take part in the action, his motivations and actions aren’t very rational; he had Grateful King make him the best written song ever, which took the entirety of the season to compose, but it’s never used by him or anyone else. Even his original goal is strange, given how popular and successful his company already is. As a villain he fails, and as a character he fails even harder.SOUNDThe opening theme is a pretty fun song overall, with the English words, clapping, and quick beat. Some of the vocal segments aren’t too pleasing to the ear and it’s not too catchy, but it at least maintains the rock-n-roll vibe that is prevalent in the series. The ending theme, on the other hand, is great. It’s still a fun track, but manages to mix up its tone and instruments enough to make the piece feel special. The lyrics and beat are likewise easy to follow, making it a nice piece to listen to both here and outside of the show.The rest of the soundtrack is most notable for its plethora of insert songs. Each band has approximately one song they are known for, each with their own style. “Shingancrimsonz” is brooding, “Tsurezurenaru” is all about their Japanese culture, and “Trichronika” is more pop than rock. As standalone pieces they’re fine, but nothing entirely impressive. The rest of the soundtrack consists mainly of variations of the OP which are largely forgettable.Voice acting is somewhere around, to slightly above, average. Special shout-outs are deserved for Ayane Sakura as Moa for her constant “Pyuru!” and high-pitched yet non-grating voice and Hiroyuki Yoshino as Grateful King for his cool rocker accent and way of speaking.ENJOYMENTI really liked this one when it first started. The comedy was making me laugh, with Retoree’s overreactions to Cyan’s cuteness, Moa’s affable happiness, and the members of “Shingancrimsonz” looking up to Rom as a leader and a “working man.” Watching very well-done CG animation was refreshing, too, since most anime have such a hard time in that department.The more it went on, though, the more it lost its charm. I love “moe” shows a lot, but there were a number of factors that kept reducing the entertainment it provided for me. Cuteness began to wane as drama took precedence, the importance placed on other cast members that weren’t “Plasmagica” wasn’t enticing, and the show playing up the “dark monsters” but only using them sparingly prevented the anime from using the CG that it demonstrated it could nail. On top of all this, while the anime didn’t necessarily feel “repetitive,” it didn’t try to do anything new once it did what it wanted. The same jokes, the same performances, and the same lines were often had, depleting the show’s ability to keep me hooked.Show By Rock!! is definitely a show about rocking (and rolling), using music in nearly everything that it does. The art and animation can be splendid to see at times, but it isn’t enough to make up for the problems plaguing the narrative and the characters being weak in their execution. It even struggles slightly in the sound department, ironically enough. It can be cute and it can be musical, but as the ED lyrics allude to, it’s a decrescendo from start to finish.SUMMARYStory: Bad, nice theme of music’s “power,” but missing proper follow-up of events and dramatic tensionAnimation: Good, nice art style, nice character designs, average actual animationCharacters: Bad, Chuchu’s development is fine, but the rest of the cast, including Cyan and Dagger, are either explored improperly or not enough to warrant worthinessSound: Fine, okay OP, good ED, okay insert songs, bad remaining soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Fine, starts rather strong but continually loses its appeal right up until the finaleFinal Score: 4/10 capable of making music, albeit dumbed down, but it was music nonetheless.

I've never played the game, so I went into this show blind. Did it live up to its potential? Well, I don't really know its potential, so the real question is, was it any good? The answer: eh.Story: 6Stop me if you've heard this one: some nerd girl is too beta to join her school's band, and then her phone absorbs her and transports her to musical furry hell, where she's a lolita catgirl. She joins a band with some other furries, and they...go on a wacky adventure fighting dark monsters. Or something. Their actual goal is kind of vague for most of the show, and the parts where they actually do fight evil dark monsters are actually the least interesting parts. In addition, everything's very predictable.Art: 7This 7 doesn't mean that the art was average, this is a controversial one. Show By Rock has these bizarre 3DCG sections that mostly happen during concerts. They were a huge turnoff for me and many other people at the start of the show, but you'll be pleased to know that this 3DCG doesn't happen too much, just some of the concerts. That being said, the 3DCG isn't that bad - it's meant to be jarring and differing from the rest of the artwork, and it's stylized pretty well. The rest of the show is bright and bubbly, but nothing too special.Sound: 7I don't really like idol music, and I guess that's just my problem. To make matters worse, the lyrics of the songs they sing are utterly meaningless. At least they keep things interesting by also having an eastern band and a metal band.Character: 9The character design was by far the best part. As expected, the cast of the main band, Plasmagica, were all adorable, and they all get fleshed out at least a bit. The real stars of the show are Shingenzcrimson, the metal band. They're a ragtag team of really edgy guys who, despite all being really dark and edgy, are absolutely incompatible with each other. They are the funniest part of the show, and I'd love to see a spinoff show focusing on these guys. The other characters all check out nicely too.Enjoyment: 7If you can get past the potential-turnoff CG (or you can just skip the songs and not miss too much), the show is pretty easy to watch. You won't ever be at the edge of your chair though.Overall: 7Show by Rock!! plays it very safely. There aren't many curveballs or unpredictable events, but it's still enjoyable. If you're a furry, or really like idol music, you should probably go to church and redeem yourself of your sins. But you should also watch this show. go on a wacky adventure fighting dark monsters.

I usually wouldn't cosplay something I don't like, however I'm planning to cosplay Cyan from this show. I cringed when Cyan went back to her place, to which I really hope that there will be a second season, and it seems it will!The story was cute. Like any normal Magical Girl anime, they start with a clumsy or 'usagi-like'(sailor...moon)character. This was one of them. The story was fluffy and cute, so it really got to me.For the art, it was beautiful, it was cute for the females or mature for one of the female characters, the males in this anime were really hot- Unless you're talking about the antagonist and the president.The sound was perfectly fine, I love the music they sang and it was also addicting which got me humming during class. And the voices match the characters perfectly.Overall, this may be a short review but I can't really think of anything else because this was such a simple, but yet very cute anime. If animal ears are one of your kinks, then this anime would fit you greatly!PS, I'm a fujoshi so I ship the hot guys in this anime lmao.Great for fujoshis too moon)character. This was one of them.

It's like magical girl idols, meet cyberpunk setting, plus a decent amount of fan service. It's definitely unique and it could of been wonderful, but I felt as if the series fell short of all expectations I had.To put it simply, there was no way the writers could of adequately fit in everything they wanted to cover in twelve episodes. There were many plot twists that made zero sense, and had very little explanation. I found a lot of it to be shallow and not well developed. The series' ending was bland and only made...me annoyed that they decided to squeeze it into one episode. This is the main reason I am rating it so low.This is probably the first series that adequately and almost seamlessly incorporates 2D and 3D animation. It isn't abrupt or jarring like others, nor does it seem out of place when they switch from one to the other. The animation overall is well done, and I don't really have any complaints in regard to it, really only praise.At first I had no real opinion on the songs, but after letting them simmer for awhile I became hopelessly addicted. There isn't one I dislike. It's consistently good music, and I could listen to each over and over again. Overall the songs lend themselves more to a J-Rock style than anything else, but there is one that could be categorized as J-Pop. Really enjoyable music.Originally I started watching this series because the character designs were just so cute. And they are. I love all of the character designs, the VA's they chose, and their 3D models as well. My complaint would be that the characters had very little character development or screentime. In fact, the main band, Plasmagica, is almost completely overshadowed by another group ShinganCrimsonz. ShinganCrimsonz isn't even a rival band, they're with the same company. They were ridiculously lovable though and their antics were great comedy relief. Downside? I think I heard them perform more than Plasmagica and I also think they displayed a better group dynamic than Plasmagica as well. They honestly stole the spotlight and the show isn't even about them. That's more of a complaint on the writing than the characters though.The series is a guilty pleasure. Is it written well? No. Is it a respectable interest? No. But man is it fun to watch. I wouldn't recommend it to a friend unless they REALLY liked shows centered around bands or music, but it is fun to watch, and you might as well finish it once you begin it since it's so short. me annoyed that they decided to squeeze it into one episode.

It is essentially Precure but with a heavy emphasis on music and rock bands. It even shares the same composer of several Precure tracks, Yasuharu Takanashi, giving Show by Rock a similar feeling.The world of MIDI City is incredibly detailed, its brightly coloured cityscape and CGI give a sense of both modernity and nostalgia. Pacing is really nice, the story rarely lingers too long on one scene.The main characters are so cute, and they have no idea how much they have been in this anime series. Cyan and Plasmagica have some of the coolest designs we’ve seen in anime girls....They are strong and capable, and have actual personalities instead of being objectified. Even the side characters are just as brightly coloured and memorable. The boy band SHINGANCRIMSONZ makes for a memorable side group, they’re pretty humorous. Maple is a silly little mascot who makes for a likeable manager. The villainous Dagger is our personal favourite, one of the coolest and most intimidating anime villains ever. Every moment he appears, he exerts terrifying menace. You can even feel the fear of the characters when in his presence. Criminally underrated. (pun on criminal)The story has a great balance on comedy and music-making. The mystery and anticipation of the main story is amazing, making the perfect buildup to the climax. Battles in this anime are very few and far between, (around 4, if we remember correctly), but when they happen, they are breathtaking. The glass shattering sky when everything becomes 3D is incredibly well animated, and the first dark monster battle was so exciting and well-made that it felt like final battle quality. Of course, the actual final battle is even better.This is one of the few anime that actually feels like an anime, with the cons being almost nonexistent. Exactly why Show by Rock is obscure is beyond us. We highly recommend this masterpiece, so that it gets the recognition it deserves.

Well, I was not exactly disappointed, but I\'m going to develop it further below.Story: 6It was nothing breathtaking, quite linear and simple, though slightly deep; it had something that just made me come back to watch more. It was cute, fun and easy to follow....I definitely do not think of it as a waste of time. My main issue with the story however, was that it lost the focal point of why Cyan was sent to Midi City to begin with. We were caught in her own internal issues, trying to interact with the other members of Plasmagica and just become friends with them; which friendship, I must add, was also quite shallow and simple. While I understand very well the importance of that, it still doesn\'t excuse that Plasmagica did not feel like the main characters at all, simply because it was all just so trivial and they didn\'t even try to go back to the main goal till the last 2 episodes. I also don\'t understand why Dagger in the end only picked on Cyan when he clearly said that he also needed Shu☆Zo and Darudayu, yet that was also kind of lost in translation.Characters: 5I really cannot think of them more than simply mediocre. As I said above, Cyan and Plasmagica did not feel like actual main characters, since I felt like they simply did not contribute to anything for the plot if it was not for playing the ""roles"" of main characters (only by name). Cyan was also given credit for things that she never did, which was really annoying for me to watch. I almost wished the whole anime to be about the ShinganCrimsonZ guys. They overall looked more involved in their musical career and leaned towards a  GOAL, more than I ever saw Plasmagica do; friendship issues to a side. I find them the only valid characters, personally. And it was just overall more entertaining to see them bicker only to have Rom put them back in place, than cheesy cutesy of the main girls\' bonding. Yet, another character that I have to praise is definitely Dagger. While he fills in the typical villain troupe and is just evil for the sake of being evil (and obtaining the best song/band), I felt like he tried to symbolize the current music industry. It might be just a personal feeling, but slave contracts, overworking and cohercing is something that I did actually heard of in the asian music industry. And I really appreciated this villain for that; and also because he was that ""dark"" note that the anime needed to ""lighten"" up the whole cuteness-spree.Art: 8Definitely the thing that the anime shines in. The character designs were quite unique and even if I read many opinions on the 3DCG, I was fast into getting used to it and by the end even came to love it. It really fit the whole atmosphere and they were so cute that I wanted to take them all home!Sound: 9Definitely considering to buy the OST. There are few the songs that I don\'t like. I almost wish that they would have more songs, like ShinganCrimsonZ and Tsurezure Naru Ayatsuri Mugenan; my love for visual kei and traditional Japanese style rock being one of my favorite Japanese music genres.Overall: 6Art and Sound unfortunately aren\'t enough to make me consider this anime more than fair for what it is and what it tries to do. I definitely did enjoy it, yet I can\'t overlook the issues I pointed out above. I recommend it to all JRock lovers out there, and don\'t get tricked by the ""cute"" first impression.

It\'s a good watch!', ""This anime is such a blessing, I can't believe I'd never heard of it before spotting it on some 'top ten X' list.Pro Tip: It doesn't take itself seriously, and neither should you.This is an anime where one band has a member described as 'the only sane one' (an understatement) and another band with two 'aliens'. Both bands are managed by an egg in a suit, who can only be calmed by being 'whipped' by his well-endowed assistant. Together, they must save the world through the power of music, friendship, and cliched plot devices reworked to be charmingly insane and goofy.SbR! makes...fun of tropes, of genre cliches, but also lavishly uses them, twists them, and pokes fun at them. You get magically transported to another realm with no idea how or why? Who cares! You're in a BAND now (insert 'squee' here)!The part most likely to put people off (or at least, that weirded me out the most) is that during music/battle sequences, the characters transform into 3D chibi animal... things. It's odd, not going to lie, but in a time where Pop Team Epic is about, this seems somewhat tame in comparison.All in all, it's a goofy, fun, and at times genuinely intriguing/emotive idol anime that managed to make me like an anime in the idol genre. If you find most music/idol animes cringe-worthy and completely lacking in self-awareness, then this anime is the perfect antidote, still equipped with all the cute cat girls and bishounen boys you could ask for.tl;dr: GO WATCH THIS, CATTLE! fun of tropes, of genre cliches, but also lavishly uses them, twists them, and pokes fun at them.

I didn\'t know it was based off a game so I was pretty confused why there were cgi scenes out of nowhere. I had no prior knowledge of this series so I also didn\'t know the characters would be turned into these miniature furry chibis. But they were pretty cute. Visually the cgi scenes were the best.I felt the pacing was kind of slow sometimes and really only...picked up when ""serious"" plot happened. I also felt like Plasmagica\'s characterization was much weaker than Shingan Crimsonz but it\'s probably because the anime focused on their growth as a new band while SC was an established one with its members already familiar with each other. I\'d have prefer it if they didn\'t have Cyan be a high schooler from another world and just.. introduce the music world to us from the start with Plasmagic already established instead. It\'d make for better world building and much easier to work with story wise.The only big complaint I have is Cyan\'s voice. I understand that this is Inagawa Eri\'s\'s first gig as a main character but the inexperience kind of shows. Her voice sounded best when Cyan was really angry and determined when she strummed Strawberry Heart in the first episode. But everything before that, her high pitched voice made me cringe sometimes. It did get better... or I got used to it I\'m not sure. But I would definitely like to see Inagawa voice a character that didn\'t need to force a small, higher voice when speaking. I think she\'d sound better if she went for a more natural approach. Her singing was definitely good though, no doubt about that.Music was also good. I liked Crimson Rose a whole lot, it was definitely my fav song. I also like Tsurezure aldfjkalf THE REALLY JAPANESE BAND\'s song too.Oh yeah,  Miyano Mamoru was there and wouldn\'t stop talking and then wouldn\'t appear at all later. What was his significance?? I guess he was just automatically important. But who is he?? What was his ambition for music? We never find out even though we got to see everyone else\'s. The anime kept hinting there was more to him but in the end, we didn\'t get much. Huh.7/10 I enjoyed it but I\'m probably gonna forget about it.

We have our main character; Cyan that BECOMES a catgirl in Gothic Lolita fashion...and let\'s be honest; pretty much anyone that likes anime likes neko\'s.

I got into the game not too long ago, in February, but in the two months from when I started playing and the anime's first episode, I was hyped.Only to be disappointed. It's a good series overall, but as a game fan it let me down several times. The AU plot was okay, but my god, did they rush it. 12 episodes was not enough time to give all the characters the development they needed, and many plot points were rushed. Chuchu's in particular comes to mind, I had been...looking forward to that drama for the entire series, and not only did they wait to introduce it until episode 10, but then it was solved that very episode.With this AU storyline, 24 episodes would have been more ideal, more time for the characters to grow, and more time so that the plot isn't rushed.Now onto the part of the review that only game fans will understand.The next issue I have with SB69A is the lack of the majority of characters. Only five out of the game's twenty (well, 21 now, but 20 when it started) bands were important, and even then, only Plasmagica and Shingan got a decent amount of screen time. Three other bands, Uwasanopetals, Shizuku Secretmind, and Shinimonogurui also appeared, but very briefly.Uwasanopetals were fine in this, I had no issues with their appearances. Shizuku Secretmind and Shinimonogurui on the other hand.... yeah...When episode 5 aired, the episode with Shizuku, I had assumed Shabobon and Turtle BIG were unable to make actual appearances because they currently lack human forms in the game, they haven't gotten their UR cards yet (UR cards are the only appearance of human forms in the game, everyone's in myumon form the majority of the time). I figured Bones decided to make them not there because it would have been strange having Wendy and Corriente in human form, and Shabobon and Turtle in myumon form. With this episode, I was annoyed by them not being there, but it made sense.Until episode 7. Episode 7 had Shinimonogurui appear... and two of them were in human form and the other three were in myumon form. So what was the real reason for Shabobon and Turtle not being in epiosde 5 then? Anyway, Marimari was in human form, as was Tsugihagi. Why was Tsugihagi in human form? He doesn't even have a UR yet, why was he in human form?Duradura, Monmon, and Gashigashi were in myumon form. Out of those three, the only one with any real dialogue was Duradura, who had one line. Monmon spoke a little, just his name (for some reason? I don't think he does this in the game?), and Gashigashi had no dialogue. All three of them only appeared for a couple seconds, and didn't appear again when Marimari and Tsughagi reappeared in episodes 11 and 12 (why not?).And Marimari... oh, Marimari. After episode 6, when the preview for episode 7 was shown, I was insanely hyped. Shinimonogurui are one of Show By Rock's tie-up bands, meaning they're based on an actual Japanese musician. In their case, they're based on singer/guitarist/songwriter Marie Ueda, who, thanks to the game, has become one of my favorite musicians, with her amazing singing voice and very catchy songs. I was so excited to see her voicing Marimari, the character based on her! Except Marimari was instead voiced by some seiyuu who apparently only had one role before this one.I understand that it's hard to get musicians to do things like this due to contracts, I understand completely. With the fact that they were unable to get Marie Ueda to voice Marimari, why have Shinimonogurui appear in the anime AT ALL? Why hype us Marie Ueda fans only to disappoint us? Don't have a tie-up band appear if you can't get the real musician to provide voice work.So, with all this human and myumon form talk I've been doing, what exactly is the explanation for the forms in the anime? In the game, everyone is a myumon most of the time, but becomes a human when excited (according to a video from 2013 made to promote the game). But how did it work here? The main characters were in human form most of the time, with background characters in myumon form. The main characters went into myumon form only when performing and battling the bosses. And Maple was in myumon form the entire time, but seemed to change into human form at will in the final episode. What do the forms mean in anime canon? They didn't explain it. Why were they human forms most of the time? Can everyone just change form when they want to?And the final problem, which is the most minor of all of them, GOONEYS (the studio who did the GCI) clearly chose bosses at random. They didn't bother actually matching the bands and bosses. This was annoying. The skeleton boss? That's the one you fight when playing Shingan CrimsonZ songs. The one Tsugihagi turned into? That was the boss you fight playing Dropout Sensei songs. The moth Criticrista were? The Demons Venom boss. GOONEYS made it very clear that they didn't give a crap what bosses they used and just chose them at random./the part only game fans with understandStory: 6/10The plot itself was fine (although the whole Cyan is a human who was sucked into the game thing was kind of unnecessary), but it was way too rushed, several times.Art: 10/10Very good, both Bones and GOONEYS did a great job animating. Both the traditional animation and the CG looked very nice. The CG is probably among the best CG in anime. Very fluid and beautiful to look at.Sound: 9/10Would have been 10/10 if it wasn't for Shuu-zo's singing. Mamoru sounded very exhausted singing that song, they should have used a better take. Doing some more takes of that song wouldn't have done any harm. If he sounded better in that song, this would be a 10. The rest of the songs were great, however.Character: 7/10They could have used some more development, but the anime being 12 episodes didn't allow that to happen. However, they were in character. Well, aside from Cyan but that's because of the anime's AU plot. Everyone else was fine, they just needed more development.Enjoyment: 7/10Due to the reasons stated above, as a game fan it was hard for me to enjoy it completely, but I guess that's what I get for expecting that much out of an adaption.Overall: 7/10An okay adaption, but I would have preferred an anime with a lot of episodes, with every band, and no ongoing story. An anime similar to the game would have been better. looking forward to that drama for the entire series, and not only did they wait to introduce it until episode 10, but then it was solved that very episode.With this AU storyline, 24 episodes would have been more ideal, more time for the characters to grow, and more time so that the plot isn't rushed.Now onto the part of the review that only game fans will understand.The next issue I have with SB69A is the lack of the majority of characters. Only five out of the game's twenty (well, 21 now, but 20 when it started) bands were important, and even then, only Plasmagica and Shingan got a decent amount of screen time. Three other bands, Uwasanopetals, Shizuku Secretmind, and Shinimonogurui also appeared, but very briefly.Uwasanopetals were fine in this, I had no issues with their appearances. Shizuku Secretmind and Shinimonogurui on the other hand.... yeah...When episode 5 aired, the episode with Shizuku, I had assumed Shabobon and Turtle BIG were unable to make actual appearances because they currently lack human forms in the game, they haven't gotten their UR cards yet (UR cards are the only appearance of human forms in the game, everyone's in myumon form the majority of the time). I figured Bones decided to make them not there because it would have been strange having Wendy and Corriente in human form, and Shabobon and Turtle in myumon form. With this episode, I was annoyed by them not being there, but it made sense.Until episode 7. Episode 7 had Shinimonogurui appear... and two of them were in human form and the other three were in myumon form. So what was the real reason for Shabobon and Turtle not being in epiosde 5 then? Anyway, Marimari was in human form, as was Tsugihagi. Why was Tsugihagi in human form? He doesn't even have a UR yet, why was he in human form?Duradura, Monmon, and Gashigashi were in myumon form. Out of those three, the only one with any real dialogue was Duradura, who had one line. Monmon spoke a little, just his name (for some reason? I don't think he does this in the game?), and Gashigashi had no dialogue. All three of them only appeared for a couple seconds, and didn't appear again when Marimari and Tsughagi reappeared in episodes 11 and 12 (why not?).And Marimari... oh, Marimari. After episode 6, when the preview for episode 7 was shown, I was insanely hyped. Shinimonogurui are one of Show By Rock's tie-up bands, meaning they're based on an actual Japanese musician. In their case, they're based on singer/guitarist/songwriter Marie Ueda, who, thanks to the game, has become one of my favorite musicians, with her amazing singing voice and very catchy songs. I was so excited to see her voicing Marimari, the character based on her! Except Marimari was instead voiced by some seiyuu who apparently only had one role before this one.I understand that it's hard to get musicians to do things like this due to contracts, I understand completely. With the fact that they were unable to get Marie Ueda to voice Marimari, why have Shinimonogurui appear in the anime AT ALL? Why hype us Marie Ueda fans only to disappoint us? Don't have a tie-up band appear if you can't get the real musician to provide voice work.So, with all this human and myumon form talk I've been doing, what exactly is the explanation for the forms in the anime? In the game, everyone is a myumon most of the time, but becomes a human when excited (according to a video from 2013 made to promote the game). But how did it work here? The main characters were in human form most of the time, with background characters in myumon form. The main characters went into myumon form only when performing and battling the bosses. And Maple was in myumon form the entire time, but seemed to change into human form at will in the final episode. What do the forms mean in anime canon? They didn't explain it. Why were they human forms most of the time? Can everyone just change form when they want to?And the final problem, which is the most minor of all of them, GOONEYS (the studio who did the GCI) clearly chose bosses at random. They didn't bother actually matching the bands and bosses. This was annoying. The skeleton boss? That's the one you fight when playing Shingan CrimsonZ songs. The one Tsugihagi turned into? That was the boss you fight playing Dropout Sensei songs. The moth Criticrista were? The Demons Venom boss. GOONEYS made it very clear that they didn't give a crap what bosses they used and just chose them at random./the part only game fans with understandStory: 6/10The plot itself was fine (although the whole Cyan is a human who was sucked into the game thing was kind of unnecessary), but it was way too rushed, several times.Art: 10/10Very good, both Bones and GOONEYS did a great job animating. Both the traditional animation and the CG looked very nice. The CG is probably among the best CG in anime. Very fluid and beautiful to look at.Sound: 9/10Would have been 10/10 if it wasn't for Shuu-zo's singing. Mamoru sounded very exhausted singing that song, they should have used a better take. Doing some more takes of that song wouldn't have done any harm. If he sounded better in that song, this would be a 10.

I liked this show. It reminded me a bit of K-On!, as both were centered around a band and the friendships within the band that grow overtime. This show, of course, has a lot shorter of a run time than K-On!, so it was not able to get in nearly as much as character and relationship development, which is unfourtuneate, but not necessary. The show's ending felt complete; it didn't feel like the main plot needed to go further or that it was cut short. However, I though there was a lot of things that...were left enexplored in the show. I would have liked to know more about the world the show is set in, as well as the relationship between Shuu and Rom, which is mentioned, but not much information was provided. It just showed the two being antagonistic to eachother, which would make more sense if the audience really knew what was causing those feelings. There were some on running jokes in the show, mostly concerning the band ShingancrimsonZ, that didn't get annoying, per se, but were more boring as time went on. Overall, the jokes were all pretty funny and made me laugh out loud most of the time. I absolutely loved all the characters, especially the side characters who were from seperate bands. They all had interesting personalities and were fun to watch, though some of them we didn't see much of and would pop up every so often, making it difficult to discern what their character was. Another confusing and amusing aspect of the show was the character designs, which ranged from cool to what is that. A couple of the charcater's animals were easy to tell and for a few, one could at least make a partially accurate guess. Most of them, however, were a mystery. I had to look at the Show By Rock!! Wiki to know what animals the majority of the animals were. This is partly due to the designs of the characters looking nothing like the animals they are supposed to be. The twins from Trichronika had medium sized ears and a tail that looked somewhat nine-tailed fox-like, so I assumed they were a wolf or maybe even a cat, but they are actually fennec foxes, which perplexes me. The main and most noticeable trait of fennec foxes are their huge ears, but Riku and Kai's ears were not big at all. Fennec fox tails, too, are fairly slender and almost cat-like, but their tails were out of control. The design of Retoree, a supposed golden retriever, always makde me snicker when she ws on screen because instead of haveing actual dog ears, they gave her twin tails. I thought she was just a regular human until I saw she had a tail. She looked very out of place. What's more is that some of the animals chosen were just bizarre and sometimes weren't even animals! There was a character that was a tadpole and a few that were yokai and spirits. Their designs weren't necessarily bad, but just looked very odd next to the rest of the cast, who were mostly plain old mammals. Nonetheless, there were also lots of character designs I really liked, like Darudayu's and and Shuu's. In this review, I did point out a lot of it's flaws and didn't touch too much on the good points. This is mostly because the good points are more simple and the issues were either dissapointing, so I felt I should mention them, or funny and actually something that added to the show. I really like this show becuase of just how cute it was. The music was cute, the animal virtual animal forms were cute, and the fact they defeat monsters with music is also really, really cute.

I picked up this show because one day out of the blue I had an extreme craving for an idol anime and lo and behold I found this. It also has people with animal traits so at the time, it was a bonus.Let\'s start with the story. Girl who loves music ,but is too shy to join the school band gets sucked into another world which allows her for the chance to get into a band. Being sucked into another world has been done plenty of...times, but I wouldn\'t really call it cliche. It\'s like a writing prompt. Just by that description it might not be unique ,but it has a LOT of possibilities. However, the story is very predictable. A few episodes in you\'d probably already know how it ends and it doesn\'t really have any twists and turns that would at least make the journey more entertaining. It also tries to be two things at once. It\'s an idol anime but it attempts to use the ""big bad trying to take over the city plot."" I\'m not saying that those two aspects would never work together ,but I don\'t feel this anime did it well. The ""Big bad trying to take over the city plot"" usually requires a lot more action scenes and characters either learning or fighting in some way. There is only three scenes where ""fighting"" initiated and only one of them can I actually call a battle. I feel like this series should have just been an idol anime and left out the villain taking over the city part. It probably would have left more room for other, more important stuff, such as the characters. Drama came way too soon as when it starting showing up and threatened to break relationships, I did not care as It didn\'t  really show strong bonds beforehand.Also, the ending. I say NO to unexplained Deux Ex Machina.Let me tell you this: IT IS NOT GOOD IF IM MORE INTERESTED IN SIDE CHARACTERS THAN THE MAIN ONES. Honestly, the girls bored me. Honestly, EVERY OTHER BAND WAS MORE INTERESTING THAN THEM. I\'d honestly enjoy a spin off staring Shingancrimsonz more than I enjoyed watching Plasmagica. The worse part is that none of the other bands really got much screen time besides Shingancrimsonz. The Plasmagica members barely have any personality traits.Cyan\'s the naive newcomer who is very shy but a very good musician and singer. She ends up the main target of the villain even though the villain explicitly states that there are others he is after, he barely pays attention to the other two more interesting characters he mentions. Anyway she ends up making the band better but outside of that we don\'t really know much about her personality. Chuchu\'s only real standing trait is that she want to be the top star and used to be willing to manipulate others to get there. Retoree is a tsundere who had few friends, that\'s it. Moa has absolutely no personality traits. Look her up on Tvtropes, I\'m a 100% right. The group doesn\'t even provide any good comedy.Everyone else seemed like they could possibly be interesting characters, but their only reason for not being so is that they weren\'t the focus of the anime.Now for the Art. I personally don\'t mind the two different art styles ,but I understand that the shift CAN be a bit jarring. I also liked the vibrant colors. However, when it comes to the animal aspects of the characters I wish it was more obvious what animal some of the characters were in both of their forms. There was a frog drummer that looked nothing like a frog. Also maple\'s assistant had rounded ears so she looked nothing like a wolf. When I first saw Shingancrimsonz I couldn\'t tell what animals most of them were until I looked it up.As for Sound, it was pretty okay, but the songs most of the girl bands sung made me wonder if all female pop idols in Japan sang about the same exact kind of thing.Finally Enjoyment. I\'ll say this, I didn\'t hate it, but it lost me at a lot of parts.Overall, it\'s far from a masterpiece. If you were expecting one, go away times, but I wouldn\'t really call it cliche.

Show By Rock may not have it all to be the greatest anime ever, but it's a really decent anime topped with it's own story, colorful cast of characters, and good musical elements to top it off.From what I can see this...show has an average stand point. Not too bad, not too good, but honestly it's enjoyable to watch. It's funny because I'm not into moe anime that much but this is just too kawaii for me to handle, also cyan is best girl.I hope when season two comes out we'll get the full effect on the story, music, and characters from different bands we haven't see so I can't wait. :3 show has an average stand point.

I was able to finish the anime without complaining how bad or how slow. But put that aside, this is an anime where you will have the cringe feeling with some episodes, I had no problems with so I was able to enjoy the episodes.Story (8) - Show By Rock!! is somehow unique to its own, or maybe not (I may have to see another anime where a random main character is sent to another world just to save it and all). More of the reason why I like this anime it is...because of the story development. It doesn't feel rush or too slow, although it has 12 episodes. It felt like it didn't have 12 episodes.More reasons, characters have almost equal screen time, and this is why I was able to remember their names and able to find myself with some of them.Art (10) - Yes, I gave it a perfect score because the creator of this anime tried a mix of 2D and 3D. Although the 3D looked like it was made to lure the kids into buying them because they really look like a figurine. What I like about this series is that they keep separate and appropriate where they show the 3D version and 2D version. This is why it didn't confuse me.Too be honest, the 3D version will stick to me more because it's not something you get to see on every anime.Sound (10) - Since it's a music genre, it has to live up its expectations. It has some good variety of genres, thanks to the bands that are available on the series. We get to hear some classical Japanese music, some rock music, some visual kei (well a certain boy band looked like it can pass for a visual kei band). And they are all catchy.Enjoyment (8) - I certainly enjoyed this anime, even though I had moments where I was cringey. Or sighed because how dumb the joke was, or it was getting annoying.I like that the creators didn't focus on one main thing, and they add some fun things in there while Cyan is getting better with her guitar skills.Overall - It is an anime that you can recommend to a younger teen, not to an older teen, even though they are scenes that can be deemed not for 12 year-old or so. Reason why I said this anime is for younger teens it is because of the 3D animation and models, the models look like they are there to lure the kids and the kids will beg to buy one for them.Anyhow, I hope my review is helpful even though it is already 2 years late.Have a nice day! because of the story development.

It's a school girl being summoned from another world to fight of darkness, in other words an isekai. That's it in a nutshell, the only differences is, this time it's in a world of music, and friendship is the key to victory. I love music, so this was a good concept...at first.GOOD:Let's get the good out of the way first: Visuals are good, the transition from 2d to the 3D music scenes are great, the music is well written, and the easter eggs for musicians such as when Cyan writes her song is awesome....The sound is really good, and the music other than being well written is done in many different styles which is refreshing showing each bands personality in their own way.The character of the main president is quite funny and I really like his design being  an egg, the shingancrimsonz characters are funny for most of the time, the other bands are okay rivals, the main bad guy and his henchman are a funny bunch too, and balance out the two sides well.So, that's everything that's good. Unfortunately, most of the story does not focus on this, but instead the band of plasmagica, which has at the start interesting takes on characters but unfortunately puts Cyan in the spotlight for most of it, and unfortunately does not develop other characters unless it's through her, and she by all intents and purposes is not a good written character.BAD AND SPOILERS AHEAD:Cyan is a highschool girl who wants to be in a band, she can play the guitar and is summoned into a different world from her own. She is then told through her guitar which is possessed by the spirit of grateful king (Another guitarist) that she must vanquish the evil dark monsters of their world.The first time Cyan beats a dark monster is in the first episode. This is not done through her alone but also through grateful king who helps her. He even says it's through his power, not hers.Yet without any training (that we at least see) she can somehow turn dark monsters back into people later when she can't even communicate with him, and in the last episode beats the main bad guy in one hit with a bow which is summoned out of nowhere, which again is not explained.The writer takes any convenience possible not to develop characters but to show he/she kind of tried and gave up halfway..Everytime.Each time there is tension it will be resolved either that episode or the next, and this happens with every character and situation, it's just more noticeable with Plasmagica because they are the centre characters, but it happens to every character who has a small (if we can even call it) arc.Cyan: a person who can literally do anything out of convenience, and can finally be in a band which has always been her dream.Retoree: A person who is afraid of losing her friend, until she again accepts out of convenience out of the plot that she's okay with Cyan leaving. She has no further development.Chuu Chuu: a person who wants to be the top musician in the world, she wants all the spotlight on her, until that is that she no longer wants to because Cyan and the rest of the band ask her if it's true. Then she says she's sorry, that those were her thoughts and again, the band just accepts it and it's okay that she was using them.Moa: an alien from another world who has to study this music world, and misses her mom and family, but at the same time doesn't', and this goes nowhere.It's important to note, I am not saying their characters are bad by default, they have interesting aspects to them, I enjoy the band members by themselves when you take into account their flaws and what could come from them to develop the characters. But that's the thing, they don't develop, they just win all the time, every time there is a sad moment between them, you can bet it will be their friendship that will win the battle, not their skills, and that their inhibitions, and bad sides will be put to the side and will be resolved almost instantly because the writer just wants to continue the story.Cyan from this band and  Natsu from fairy tail are actually very similar they both win by ass pulls constantly. But here's the main difference: It's actually believable sometimes with Natsu because he has had about 20 years of experience by the first season and keeps getting more training to get stronger. When he beats someone by the skin of his teeth, you will accept it sometimes because you have seen how much he has struggled and trained, and how many opponents he has won previously, before almost losing and pulling an ass pull. This stops working it it happens all the time.This happens constantly in show by rock, and it ruins the entire viewing experience. There is no development, and the main character will always win in the first season, so what's the point of even watching it? The sound is really good, and the music other than being well written is done in many different styles which is refreshing showing each bands personality in their own way.The character of the main president is quite funny and I really like his design being  an egg, the shingancrimsonz characters are funny for most of the time, the other bands are okay rivals, the main bad guy and his henchman are a funny bunch too, and balance out the two sides well.So, that's everything that's good.

He even says it's through his power, not hers.Yet without any training (that we at least see) she can somehow turn dark monsters back into people later when she can't even communicate with him, and in the last episode beats the main bad guy in one hit with a bow which is summoned out of nowhere, which again is not explained.The writer takes any convenience possible not to develop characters but to show he/she kind of tried and gave up halfway..Everytime.Each time there is tension it will be resolved either that episode or the next, and this happens with every character and situation, it's just more noticeable with Plasmagica because they are the centre characters, but it happens to every character who has a small (if we can even call it) arc.Cyan: a person who can literally do anything out of convenience, and can finally be in a band which has always been her dream.Retoree: A person who is afraid of losing her friend, until she again accepts out of convenience out of the plot that she's okay with Cyan leaving. She has no further development.Chuu Chuu: a person who wants to be the top musician in the world, she wants all the spotlight on her, until that is that she no longer wants to because Cyan and the rest of the band ask her if it's true. Then she says she's sorry, that those were her thoughts and again, the band just accepts it and it's okay that she was using them.Moa: an alien from another world who has to study this music world, and misses her mom and family, but at the same time doesn't', and this goes nowhere.It's important to note, I am not saying their characters are bad by default, they have interesting aspects to them, I enjoy the band members by themselves when you take into account their flaws and what could come from them to develop the characters. But that's the thing, they don't develop, they just win all the time, every time there is a sad moment between them, you can bet it will be their friendship that will win the battle, not their skills, and that their inhibitions, and bad sides will be put to the side and will be resolved almost instantly because the writer just wants to continue the story.Cyan from this band and  Natsu from fairy tail are actually very similar they both win by ass pulls constantly. But here's the main difference: It's actually believable sometimes with Natsu because he has had about 20 years of experience by the first season and keeps getting more training to get stronger. When he beats someone by the skin of his teeth, you will accept it sometimes because you have seen how much he has struggled and trained, and how many opponents he has won previously, before almost losing and pulling an ass pull. This stops working it it happens all the time.This happens constantly in show by rock, and it ruins the entire viewing experience. There is no development, and the main character will always win in the first season, so what's the point of even watching it?"", ""(Please note that I haven't watched this in a while, so take this with a grain of salt!)Not counting things like Pokemon, which I admittedly didn't know was an anime at the time, this was my first anime, and what a great first anime it was! I was only around 10 when i watched this for the first time and I fell in love with it almost immediately. While it doesn't bring a whole lot to the table in terms of story (I do remember being bored at some points), it makes up for it with incredible music (the opening still remains one of my...all time favorites!) and its fun, vibrant art and designs. It's hard to look away with how colorful the show can be and its cutesy character designs are still a big inspiration for me. Another big part of the show is its cgi segments during performances--that might seem like a bad thing if you've seen other shows that brought idol anime to the mainstream, but this show's cgi is unique, high quality, and just really cute! It definitely caught me off guard when I first watched, but it soon became one of my favorite parts of the anime.I mentioned earlier that it was a great first anime, and I definitely do think its a good introduction to not just music anime, but anime in general (it certainly was for me lolol). While there definitely are tropes present, to me they were a good introduction to these tropes and didn't exactly hinder my enjoyment (but like I said at the beginning, take that with a grain of salt, I was 10). I feel like this would be a nice thing to show an older kid if you know they wouldn't really care about some cursing or fanservice (I think there's some fanservice? Once again I haven't watched in a while, but if anything it's not major). I've only seen this season, so I can't really say the same for later installments, but overall I think Show By Rock is a great show if you just need something cute to relax with, and you'll get some fun music too~☆ all time favorites!) and its fun, vibrant art and designs.

The art is astonishing, and the moe is real. Very good anime if you want to get an heart attack or get diabetes, because it handles the cuteness factor very, very well. The story was a bit lacking, sadly, but made it up by showing beautiful songs and charismatic characters. At first sight, I thought i would've been a slice-of-life anime, a bit like K-ON!, but instead they brought up a plot that was... not bad, but not that good either. it isn't easy to fit a complex story into so few episodes,...but somehow I feel like they could've done better in that sphere.In the end though, if you're ready to turn your brain off, your speakers up and to squee at how moe, cute, kawaii, etc this anime is, go watch it, definitively worth the time! but somehow I feel like they could've done better in that sphere.In the end though, if you're ready to turn your brain off, your speakers up and to squee at how moe, cute, kawaii, etc this anime is, go watch it, definitively worth the time!"", ""what?What just happened?That was it???no, no, no, no, no , NO!The songs that were played were nice and the characters were nice (Although it is the typical nonsense kind of personalities)The decisions they made really didn't make any sense; I mean it suits the series but it kind of makes the viewers do a faceplam sometimes when watching the show.....It is defiantly for people who wanted to listen to the music cause the storyline was rushed and it feels like a big faceplam....The music I must say was great tho! "", ""Cyan, a shy guitarist whose dream is to join a band, gets transported into Sound World, specifically Midi City, a place where everything revolves around music.She bumps into an amateur band down on its luck called Plasmagica, joins them and their journey begins.It's a story that's been done numerous times (minus the weirdly complicated isekai setting), but does this story stand out among the others?Production-wise and entertainment-wise, yes, but on most other levels, maybe not.There are two main plot lines.One of them concerns the bands of Midi City, mainly Plasmagica.We follow them getting to know each other, practicing, improving and finally performing and...competing with other bands.Plasmagica's members are all different and the development of their relationships are fun, emotional and rewarding to follow. They're not incredibly complex, but they all get their small character arcs throughout the season and they're definitely interesting and loveable enough to carry the series and for me to care about them.From time to time SHINGANCRIMSONZ, another band in the same agency as Plasmagica, gets the spotlight, and they're extremely fun to watch. Their intensity and immaturity serve as a great foil to Plasmagica's friendly, cutesy demeanour and they're the source of most of the humour in the season.I'd say their scenes are just as enjoyable as Plasmagica's and I hope they appear a lot more in the following seasons.Several other bands also appear, but, even though most of them seem and look interesting, those characters don't get much screentime or development, at least not in this season. One of them, a band called Criticrista, has a bit of a bigger role, but they're unfortunately  among the less interesting ones. Tsurezure Naru Ayatsuri Mugenan is the most interesting among those secondary bands, having a distinct japanese aesthetic and greater presence than most others.The second plot line revolves around a shadowy figure called Dagger, who wants to rule Midi City by recruiting and manipulating the best musicians while also occasionally corrupting them and turning them into monsters.While Dagger is a surprisingly cool and threatening villain, that whole part of the plot could have been left out altogether and not much would be lost.The fights are visually spectacular and very well animated, but they're not really why I started watching the show and just leave me a bit confused as to why they're even featured. What's more, there aren't even that many fights: out of the 12 episodes, only 4 feature fighting, which makes it even stranger.Animation and art-wise Show By Rock looks consistently gorgeous with no noticeable mistakes. There's no drop in quality at all and every episode looks great. All the characters and locations look colourful, vibrant and alive.During concert sequences and fight scenes the characters are depicted as really cute and well-designed CGI chibi animals, which works really well as a way to handle those complex, more demanding scenes.It definitely helps that the CGI looks truly great, almost like something you'd see in a movie production.Aside from the opening and ending songs, which are pretty catchy, none of the other songs really stuck with me, which isn't a small flaw, since this is a music anime. The songs aren't bad, but they're mostly forgettable and similar to songs found in other music anime.Even though Show By Rock isn't the most groundbreaking show, even among music anime, it's a fun, feel-good anime I'd recommend to anyone who's looking for something cute and entertaining to watch.Its likeable characters, positivity, earnestness and very high quality production captured my heart and I'm definitely going to check out season 2 in the future. competing with other bands.Plasmagica's members are all different and the development of their relationships are fun, emotional and rewarding to follow.

They say imitation is the greatest form of flattery. However, this isn\'t always a good thing, as there\'s a lot that can go wrong, such as companies making rip-offs or copies of said show, focusing too much on fanservice and doing what K-On did rather than actually having a decent story, characters, and conflict, or standing out on its own merits. If creators try too hard to copy other works, they won\'t...be appreciated for their own merits, and if a piece of media can\'t stand on its own merits, then it\'ll just fade into obscurity. But even shows that stand out and are able to stand on their own merits aren\'t always good, and sometimes the show that inspired so many rip-offs may not even be that good! Despite its problems, Show By Rock definitely stands out and knows what the heck it wants. Unfortunately, it\'s being held back by many problems that, if rectified, could have made it so much better, had the creators been given more leeway with it.A young girl named Cyan (pronounced Shion) Hijirikawa wants to be a rock star and join her school\'s music club but is too shy to do it. But when she\'s at home, she gets an app on her phone that suddenly takes her to this magical world called Sound World, particularly one place called Midi City. It\'s full of half-animal half-human people called Myuumons, and music is par for the course. There are popular bands such as Trichronika, Criticrista, ShingancrimsonZ, and another band she joins called Plasmagica. She receives a sentient heart shaped guitar named Strawberry Heart that tells her she needs to defeat dark monsters that are threatening Midi City. Dark monsters are created when someone\'s Melodisian Stone is corrupted by negative feelings or outside forces. Cyan joins Plasmagica and gets the chance to fulfill her dream, along with saving Midi City from the dark monsters.Yeah...as you can tell by the summary, the premise is admittedly very convoluted and cliche. Random kid gets taken to another world by someone or something, is the chosen one and has to defeat evil villain via insert macguffin here, make friends, etc. There\'s too much to deal with, and it doesn\'t help that the show is only twelve episodes long. It could have benefited from being a lot longer, like 26 episodes or even 39, for a variety of reasons that I\'ll get into. Sound World itself doesn\'t really get expanded upon, nor do we learn all that much about Melodisian Stones, the villain behind the scenes, what made him what he is, why certain people are so important, how and why Midi City is the way it is, etc. I do find it interesting that Sanrio (Yes, this was made by Sanrio, the people behind Hello Kitty. Just go with it) named a city after a midi file. Heck, I remember when midi files were especially popular on places like Neopets, waaay back in like, 2003-2005 or something. However, having an interesting setting doesn\'t matter if you can\'t expand upon it or use it to your advantage.Same goes for the characters. They\'re not bad, but there\'s loads and loads of them, and they\'re all very under developed and bland save for one character, Cyan getting the worst of it, which is actually lampshaded in the final episode. She begins and ends the show being the exact same person. She doesn\'t do anything, she gets scared, she doesn\'t do anything by herself, she\'s shy and insecure, she just gets dragged into things without actively doing anything about it, she\'s never directly affected by anything that goes on around her...she\'s just not very interesting as a character. Not only that, she\'s constantly told that she\'s the one who absolutely has to defeat the dark monsters, but it\'s never stated why she of all people has to do it. Others could have very easily been better candidates, and they never state the actual reason why SHE is the one that got picked, which makes the whole chosen one plotline very superficial. Give us a reason, dag nabbit! Sakura from CCS was made to be the cardcaptor because she accidentally released the cards from the Clow Book. Sasami from Sasami Magical Girls Club was born with her powers. Hitomi from Vision of Escaflowne had a pendant from Gaia that she inherited from her grandmother, who received it from a dying man whose son becomes her friend later on. They all start off one way, and end the series having grown and learned from their experiences. Cyan doesn\'t. Therefore, she\'s not interesting.The other characters are no better. True, some of them do get expanded on, but it\'s all very predictable, and none of their backstories are actively fleshed out save for Chuchu. Retoree is shy, Moa is a cheerful alien who misses her home (and it\'s quickly forgotten about), Chuchu wants to be the best, etc. I have to admit though, ShingancrimsonZ is the best band in the entire show. The guys in that band are not only hilarious, but charming and are often the comedic relief despite being crazy gothic punk rock bishounen who scream a lot. They\'re just as bland and underdeveloped as the others, but their antics are funny enough to steal your heart. Criticrista, on the other hand, is the worst of the bunch. We\'re told that they\'re best friends who love each other, but we never see them interact much unlike with Plasmagica. It doesn\'t help that they\'re all annoyingly cute moe girls with obnoxiously high pitched voices (one of them being voiced by Rina Hidaka, one of my favorite new VAs, and as much as I like her, her work as Rosia really isn\'t one of her best) who are there to pander to creepy guys, etc. Everyone else is just there for eye candy or doing stuff nobody really cares about. But there are these two animal high schoolers who appear at the end of some episodes who go to school and constantly complain about wanting to go to Midi City, with one of them always saying ""Sorrrry!! X is the pits!!"" Why are these Myumons here? What purpose do they serve? Nothing! They\'re never used for anything, so they\'re just a waste of animation and broadcasting time! The producers should have ditched them and used their budget for, oh, I don\'t know, actual world building and character exploration? Also, Moa also has an annoying voice actress who tries way to hard most of the time, coming off really shrill in the process.Animation wise, the show is decent, albeit way too flashy, especially with the way they draw the character\'s eyes. Too many sparkles and diamonds in them! It\'s so distracting and completely throws you off. But the character movements are fluid, the character designs are relatively decent, albeit a little too over the top for some (the water band and Criticrista being two such examples), the cosmopolitan look of Midi City is very beautiful and it kinds resembles modern day New York, as the biggest tower in the city kinda looks a lot like the Empire State Building, complete with flashy neon colored lights, etc. Also, the CGI. It is beautiful, and I do not mean that sarcastically. I\'m serious. The CGI in this anime is the best I\'ve seen. It\'s actually fluid, the animators actually put in effort to make it relevant to the story, and since the characters are all rendered into their animal forms during the CGI scenes, they don\'t fall into uncanny valley territory, and considering how anime CGI is usually REALLY bad a lot of the time, that\'s saying a lot. I also appreciate that the show likes to parody various animation styles, especially when ShinganCrimsonZ is involved, like having the characters go all buff and beefy a la Jojo\'s Bizarre Adventure, or giving them girly 70s shoujo faces complete with exaggerated faces and long eye lashes and sparkles a la Rose of Versailles. The way its used for comedy is actually pretty cool.Since the show\'s about music, obviously the music has to be the best part of the show, right? Well...yes and no. Pretty much everything by ShinganCrimsonZ, Trichronika, and that other band called Tsurezure is awesome, but all the other songs are mostly just bland, cutesy moe fare that grates on your ears, Criticrista\'s song obviously being the worst one. The opening and ending songs are no better. It\'s nice that the show uses a rock and roll music style, since the show is about bands and the music is actually relevant to the story, albeit used in a ridiculous, stupid, and deus ex machina-using way. However, if the songs have cutesy high pitched voices singing them, then all they are is annoying if said voices aren\'t in tune with the music.So yeah. Show By Rock isn\'t great, but it\'s not bad. Cliched, yes, but not bad. It\'s pretty fun if you want something good to watch, and the fanservice is pretty mild for the most part. But if you\'re looking for more serious fare, then give it a miss. Also, ShinganCrimsonZ is awesome.

I'm kind of over simplifying a bit but honestly it's not that deep or complex of a story-line. While understand the 'whole main character getting suck into a another world' idea isn't that original, there are way to makes it seem unique or interesting. Unfortunately, Show by Rock doesn't really do anything new with the plot. I guess you can say it's  bit different since its about music but other than added rockband and idols to the mix the story still comes off quite boring. Girl is shy but talented, girl get...sucks in to favorite music game, girl joins band and start to gain confidence, girl save world through music.[Art]It's okay? I mean nothing about was really worth noting, I did however was kind of interested when the anime switch over to 3d mode. It was a bit cool looking at first but after each ep it gets old and you quickly realize it's probably just the studio trying to find ways to save money.[Sound]The music isn't bad persay, but the reason I'm giving it such a low rating because feel a show about music should have at least one really good song in it. All the songs played in this anime sound very generic and unmemorable.[Character]The characters are...meh.  Cyan is the generic protagonist and she does well...generic protag things (caring for her friends and sometimes rivals, being confused about what's going on around her, doing the big save the world thing at the end of the anime, and etc), Retroree doesn't really have a personality other than being the otaku-like character and having a crush on the protag, Moa was my favorite but I admit that mostly because of her character design nothing about her personality really stood out to me either, ChuChu fills in the generic big sister trope for Cyan. The secondary characters are...well secondary characters.[Enjoyment]Ehh[Overall]It's definitely not the worst anime ever but even I've watch mediocre anime that at least had one thing interesting about it. sucks in to favorite music game, girl joins band and start to gain confidence, girl save world through music.[Art]It's okay?

Cyan is the generic protagonist and she does well...generic protag things (caring for her friends and sometimes rivals, being confused about what's going on around her, doing the big save the world thing at the end of the anime, and etc), Retroree doesn't really have a personality other than being the otaku-like character and having a crush on the protag, Moa was my favorite but I admit that mostly because of her character design nothing about her personality really stood out to me either, ChuChu fills in the generic big sister trope for Cyan. The secondary characters are...well secondary characters.[Enjoyment]Ehh[Overall]It's definitely not the worst anime ever but even I've watch mediocre anime that at least had one thing interesting about it."", ""Characters have too many details.Plot is broken.Bad mix of characters.It's not the best thing ever but it could be better. Also for a music genre anime it lacks a lot of music. The characters are still cute and enjoyable with their development and relationship between each other. It also has a good moral to the story, looking forward to season 2 which better have some improvements.The is very good it just needs to tone down a bit on the details, I know they are main characters but still, too much detail is never good. The bands in the series need a bit more time to...develop and get them to know so Show By Rock! was definitely a bit rushed which led to a lot of drama. Not a very good combination of action, drama and feels. At least the music in it was enjoyable, they just had to be a bit longer. develop and get them to know so Show By Rock! was definitely a bit rushed which led to a lot of drama. Not a very good combination of action, drama and feels. At least the music in it was enjoyable, they just had to be a bit longer."", 'What do I like about Show by Rock? Honestly, there are quite a few things I like about it. The fact that there\'s this crazy premise about Midi city and defeating ""dark monsters"" and everyone\'s an animal, and how Cyan is just randomly plopped in this music world and yet, the tone of the story matches the crazy premise. This anime is not a super ""deep"" show with a lot of serious tones a lot of the time, and the introduction does keep a good atmosphere that matches the setting. Coming into this anime, I\'m not looking for flowery backstory and exposition about how this...world came to be. I don\'t care. The anime clearly understands, and just breezes past all the requisites in order for Cyan to join the band in this magical world. There isn\'t a super serious story with tons of text on why all of this happened, it\'s more like, ""well, defeat the baddies,"" and I\'m okay with that since that was not what I was expecting, anyway.I also do find the CGI to be quite well made. When was this made? 2015? The CG is extremely expressive and does its job well. Well, the only thing is that there is no mouths because obviously, the animators did not want to animate mouth movement. Overall, it\'s one of the best CGI I\'ve seen in anime, but that also doesn\'t count for too much in this industry. I still would have just liked for 2d animation instead of this weird animal gimmick, but I don\'t hate it.Really, the only thing I don\'t quite like about this show is the lack of focus. I really like how unlike Love Live or any idol anime ever, this anime is a band oriented one, and it means that there are only 4 members in  a band that get screen time and characterization, as opposed to the 10+ girls in an idol group. This small pool of characters could definitely bring for a good depth of character for all four. The problem is, it doesn\'t. These girls get less development than the girls did in K-ON. Despite the show being all  about music, they even have less practice and screen time about music than K-ON. There is no struggle or obstacle for any of these girls to make music, and if they are, they\'re symbolized by stupid drama instead of actual roadblocks such as not being able to write new songs, play a certain part, synergy, etc. Look, I didn\'t really like K-ON, didn\'t like Carole and Tuesday and I don\'t like CGDCT anime, so I guess it\'s only on par for course that I don\'t like this show. All of these shows have an emphasis on music, yet there\'s never any realistic depictions of these girls rising to stardom and there\'s a lack of any sort of progression and maturing that should be happening for bands that are getting better and better. Beck is still my favorite music-type show/manga because it really shows these characters getting better, so I actually care when they get that break towards success. Sadly, this show just skips and muscles through any sort of development, characterization, and realistic obstacles for me to ever care about these characters. world came to be. I don\'t care.

However although she is shy and a bit of a clutz, she is actually a rather talented musician. Cyan decides to wait another day, before asking to join the band, until one night, she was playing a music game on her phone and gets sucked into the mobile game world, known as MIDICITY. There is...a crisis in MIDICITY, where these gigantic beings known as Dark Monsters are threatening to capture the hearts of every musician in the city. Cyan, quickly defeats one of these monsters with the help of her new guitar and is scouted by an agency to come and join the band known as Plasmagica. Now this band aims to get big around the city, while also dealing with inside issues with the band members, while also trying to prevent the Dark Monsters from destroying everything.The show’s pacing is kind of fast, given the fact this show looks a lot like a kid’s show. Every problem is usually solved within the episode that it’s introduced. Problems seem to come and go too quickly. Now if this is a kid’s show, that’s usually fine, but the problem I have with the story, is there is some dark or mature parts in the story. There is some sexualise scenes and some disturbing scenes, which might not be right for a kid. However because the show feels structured towards a young target audience, with every episode feeling like something new, the plot does take itself to different scenarios, ranging from enjoyable ones to less than enjoyable ones. But like the pacing of the show, the conflicts and issues felt like they were solved too quickly. This kind of given off, in the first episode when Cyan realises she’s been sucked into another world, but doesn’t seem to care.Characters - 7/10Cyan is the main protagonist of Show by Rock!! She was transformed to cat-girl when she entered MIDICITY. Now she is a nervous, shy and clumsy girl, with the talent to play the guitar incredibly. Her goal is to simply play in a band, so when Plasmagica asked her to join, she greatly accepted. Cyan fulfils the role of the character with a pure heart, as she is trying to make sure the band doesn’t have any conflicts and she doesn’t want to be seen as a burden as well. During the course of the series, we get to see her grow from a measly nervous high school student who can’t enter a band, to a girl full of confidence in her music play, which she has plenty of.The leader of Plasmagica is Chuchu are rabbit-girl. She tries to play the big sister to everyone, making sure the band works hard as she believes the better the band, the better chance she has at a solo career, however because of her wanting to pursue a solo career, she gets jealous when Cyan starts outshining her.Retoree is the bassist of Plasmagica and a Dog-Girl, she seems to appear as cold and cool first, but this is an act to hide her sensitive and introverted side. She’s joins the band in order to make friends. And also she seems to have a crush on Cyan.Moa is the band’s drummer and a Sheep-girl. She pretty much fulfils the role as the happy girl, however she never really has any problems in the show, only the fact that is from Outer space. And the problem that gave her was did she want to go back to space or stay with her band, which was solved very quickly.Show by Rock!! Has a huge range of supporting characters, each one of them just as enjoyable. Plasmagica’s brother band ShinganCrimonZ, I would say is more enjoyable to watch than Plasmagica, as the guys all have such cool dynamic that makes them shine. There are multiple bands that play in the anime, so there’s good decent chunk of supporting characters, playing different music. However overall, the character interactions along with the story felt rushed, as their interactions with each other felt like they ended too quickly. The characters may be likeable due to their wide range of personalities, but none of them have interesting backstories that added towards the plot that much, they felt like they were there for the sake of having multiple bands.Animation and Sound - 4/10, 8/10The art style is very cute and moe. With every character being made to look very cute, with blushes everywhere. The colours is very bright to show the cutesy, light hearted art style. Every character has a unique design. But for some reason, the audience look like chibis all the time, which gives the vibe, you can’t be a performer if you’re short. The art style is fine, however, there is some fan service that really gets in the way and distracts from the cute art style, which is rather weird. For a music anime, I expect the musical performances to be the best part of the anime, sadly its worst part of the anime. Because every performance actually puts all the characters into some 3D CGI world, which looks so bare-bones. The performances looks so simplified, there really is no atmosphere to them. Also the Dark Monsters don’t look that well animated, in fact the whole sequences in the 3D world looks clunky. Because of the art style and the choice to go 3D, I have feeling they were trying to appeal to kids, which is fine, if it wasn’t for the parts that it tries to be really mature. Honestly why couldn’t we have performances where it was beautifully animated in 2D, instead of the 3D.The music being played however is kind of enjoyable to listen to. It’s just ruined by the performances, but only slightly, if you take that away, it’s still enjoyable to listen to. The music what you expect from this time of genre, it’s really catchy and upbeat most of the time. Also because there is a lot of different bands in the anime, we get a nice range from more traditional music, to heavy metal to pop etc. And I find them all rather enjoyable, I only wished there was more and longer performances, because the performances are either cut short to fight a Dark Monster, or shows the spectators backstage. But I also guess fewer performances is sort of a good thing, so we don’t have to watch that CGI.Enjoyment - 6/10I had a lot of high expectations going into this anime, which was ruined by the 3D animation. If there were more better done 2D animation performances, I would’ve enjoyed this anime much more. However I find the target audience for this anime confusing, as it has mature themes in it, but the style that it goes for appeals to this generation of kids. Some of the comedy is definitely for kids, and some of it centres towards a more mature audience. The characters are enjoyable to watch, giving the music more variety to listen to. Which has a pretty good range of different rock tracks, I just wish some of them were longer to listen to. I thought the story was solved way too quickly, and there wasn’t enough music to be played to make the experience very that deep.Verdict - 6/10For the story of Show by Rock!! I give it a 5, as I found it has a rather basic story, stopping monsters from taking over. The fact also the show doesn’t really know if it wants to be a kid’s show or a more mature show. Also the fact that almost every issue is solved really quickly, all with usually the same method.For the animation and sound, they get a 4 and 8 from me. The moe art style, is fine for me, may not appeal to other people, but the 3D animation just really lets down the entire anime. Because when you’re watching a music anime you expect the performances to be great, however in this case it’s the worst part of the show. Everything looks bland and clunky. The soundtrack however is pretty good, because there’s a huge range of different rock tracks to be heard and each one of them enjoyable, only wish some of them was longer.For the characters they get a 7 from me. Even though some of their interactions felt rushed, the main characters stories were interesting enough. The supporting cast is a likeable cast, and really adds dynamic to the show, especially ShinganCrimsonZ which I found more enjoyable than Plasmagica. It’s just that the supporting characters were there for the sake of having lots of bands.For my personal enjoyment, I give it a 6, as I couldn’t really decide whether this was kid’s show or a slightly more mature show. The story felt rather rushed, but the characters were likeable somehow. The performances however were the most disappointing part of the show, because of the animation, only the music was saving them. It sucks because for a music anime, I’m expecting to enjoy the performances the most, but they were the least enjoyable to watch.For the overall score of Show by Rock!! I give it a 6/10. The music still sort of saves the performances, but not a whole lot, the story and characters are bearable enough to find it enjoyable, but the target audience is left to be desired. I recommend this anime to maybe music fans, just have in your mind, the 3D animation isn’t really eye catching. a crisis in MIDICITY, where these gigantic beings known as Dark Monsters are threatening to capture the hearts of every musician in the city.

Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/45653/Soredemo_Ayumu_wa_Yosetekuru,"[""There don't seem to be that many negative reviews for this show, which is certainly wonderful, but I just wanted to take a moment to highlight what some people may not enjoy about this experience (which is kind of synonymous with what I took away from it as a whole).Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru is a romantic comedy by the author of Takagi-san. This is really easy to tell because of the character archetypes being very similar and the teasing + getting teased themes being extremely recurrent in the show.For those that liked Takagi-san for what it was as a romance anime, I do believe that...this anime checks even more boxes than its predecessor in terms of wish fulfillment and progression. They don't have as much chemistry, being a little bit flatter and less fleshed out than the protagonists in Takagi-san, but they're entertaining to watch nonetheless. For those that watched Takagi-san for the entertaining dialogue (and as I mentioned before, chemistry), I do believe that this one is a bit disappointing.Though goofy, the interactions between our main pair get dry within 2 or 3 episodes, and begin to feel redundant after a while. There are developments, but they're more surface level revelations than dynamically deep changes in the way characters treat one another. A good way to describe the execution of the premise is gimmicky. It certainly does its job and was able to stay relevant after a long day, but I wouldn't call it quality content.The artstyle is (as expected) very reminiscent of Takagi-san, though the visual quality is a bit lower, likely due to the franchise being much less popular (and admittedly not an insta-hit). The sound is decent and fits moments well, though I think it gets a bit corny for emotional scenes. The opening and ending slap and I love the rotoscoped (?) dancing animation in the OP.Overall, it was a good watch that definitely got a bit old and felt gimmicky after a few episodes. I'd recommend a watch nonetheless, especially if you enjoy teasing tales like Takagi-san and whatnot. this anime checks even more boxes than its predecessor in terms of wish fulfillment and progression.

This is a spoiler-free review.Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru, or should I say ""When Will Ayumu Make His Move?"" is a simple high school romance anime that I’ll never get bored of watching. This show deserves more hype.It shares the same art as teasing master Takagi...san, but the story is quite different from Takagi san. This is the story between a senpai and her kohai, Ayumu, who is a kendo star and \xa0champion in his middle school, joins a Shogi club in his first year of high school, not because he was interested in Shogi, but he fell in love at first sight with the president and the only member of Shogi club Urushi Yaotome, and decides he’ll confess his love to his senpai when he beats her in a game of Shogi, and yeah Urushi is super good in Shogi.Ayumu is a bold type of character, a kind of straight-forward guy, and a super hard-working and dedicated type, who always tries his best but gets beaten by Urushi all the time lol. On the other hand, Urushi is a shy and sweet type of girl. She always tries to maintain her character in front of Ayumu to look cool, but always gets embarrassed because of how Ayumu flirts with her with a straight face.I loved this anime because of how both characters get connected to each other through the game of Shogi, and both of them are so cute and adorable, I’ll mention this again whenever Ayumu flirts with Urushi, the reaction she gives is priceless.I loved both the main characters and the other side characters.It’s a simple, cute, and sweet show that will make you feel good, and how beautiful is the innocent love they share.And Urushi was so adorable lol.And yeah, to be honest, I love high school romance anime like this one.I would love to see more seasons of this anime in the future.It\'s a wonderful show, and I highly recommend it.I hope you’ll enjoy watching it.🌸🌸🌸 san, but the story is quite different from Takagi san.

Watching this makes me miss school and makes me somewhat jealous of the romance aspect. When a romance anime can make me jealous, then it’s either hit close to home or it’s just so wholesome and sweet that it makes me wanna punch the wall as hard as I can.Does Soredemo Ayumu hit close to home? Nope, I don’t even experience “school romance” let alone something like this.Does Soredemo Ayumu so sweet, that it makes me wanna punch the wall as hard as I can? Y E S, yes it is.The story developed just like Takagi-san(well...it’s the same author anyway) but with different takes that is, in Takagi-san the awkward one is Nishikata, the male MC but here the awkward one is Yaotome, the female MC and I can say that this is somewhat full my pleasure, cause in Takagi-san I will always hope that at least in one episode Takagi get shy and bashful like Nishikata and it barely ever happens, sure she’s getting shy a little in some episode but IT’S NOT ENOUGH. But here I can see Yaotome get shy and bashful in every episode and I think that’s an absolute win.I also love the fact that they use strategies of Shogi to the topic of love which definitely have little to no correlation and I also definitely don’t know shit about shogi or love with a strategy of shogi, even after a lot of explanation, I still don’t know anything about it but it’s still enjoyable nonetheless.Most of the characters are strong contenders for Best Male and Best Female Characters this season.Ayumu is a flat-faced guy that tries his best to make a move on his senpai while trying to keep his composure cause he can’t help but being shy just by a mere glance of his senpai.Yaotome being cute just by existing.Sakurako and Takeru, while not being the main couple,is just as cute as the main one.Everything is already perfect.Overall, very recommendedJudging by how hard I hit the wall just now,I can safely give this anime a 9/10 it’s the same author anyway) but with different takes that is, in Takagi-san the awkward one is Nishikata, the male MC but here the awkward one is Yaotome, the female MC and I can say that this is somewhat full my pleasure, cause in Takagi-san I will always hope that at least in one episode Takagi get shy and bashful like Nishikata and it barely ever happens, sure she’s getting shy a little in some episode but IT’S NOT ENOUGH.

A season should be contained and while its fine to have unanswered questions, i am not ok with a story reaching its climax and never getting...there at all...This was a let down for me because unless we have a season 2 we dont know if this will end or start something new.... For that reason I will have to say that I do not recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a story that has a start middle and end.(Yes I know there is a manga and i can get all my answers there but i dont base any anime on how good the manga is or how the manga story ark plays out). there at all...This was a let down for me because unless we have a season 2 we dont know if this will end or start something new....

To put it short, this anime won’t be blowing you out the water with it’s contents. But that’s the thing, it doesn’t have to. It does a good job in what it has, and that’s all it really needs to. Which you can truly appreciate when it comes to it. It’s a sweet, and fun watch along, that’s a treat if anyone wants something normal and fun to watch and enjoy.Story and characters: 7You don't need some long explanation on the story, or the characters.

The style is fitting for the purpose of the anime, much like the sound. It does well in both areas, to make everything look and sound right. Even if it doesn't properly stand out, it really doesn't need to. It's fun and happy tone will push forward enough, so that these two aren't really that massive.

It's a nice relaxing watch that doesn’t really do too much apart from having really sweet moments. To be honest though sometimes it would become a little boring because there's only so much of the same thing you can really take. I wouldn’t necessarily call it bad, but I wouldn’t call this anime good either.Art: 7I thought the art was fine, the anime is not ugly to look at and the character...designs are good too. I’m also not going to really complain about lackluster animation because this anime is very diologue-heavy anyway, and it's just shogi so the animation was fine to me. Other than that I thought the music in the show was okay, it could've been a little better, but no real big complaints there.Characters: 6I’m going, to be honest, I found it hard to care for any other character aside from the main duo, as they all felt a little one-dimensional, but the main duo has good enough chemistry to override that. I will say, I think they did a great job with Rin, as her story was probably the best and just plain realistic.Story: 5The story of the anime kind of fell flat for me. I understand that Ayumu wants to beat Urushi in shogi for his own personal reasons, but as I said previously, there's only so much you can take of that. Of course, if you find shogi really entertaining then it might be perfectly okay for you. It's just that if the main duo didn't have good chemistry then I think this anime would've been a lot worse. It also doesn’t help that the ending wasn’t great. Overall it was an okay watch, good wholesome vibes. 6/10 designs are good too.

This show really does warm my heart, and gave me some of those memories, though I will be honest, I didn’t really enjoy this show at the start, but little by little, I started liking it more.The show is quite simple really, a middle school kendo champion, Ayumu Tanaka, begins his first year of high school, but didn’t join the kendo club, instead, he fell in love with Urushi Yaotome, the president and only member of the unofficial shogi club....Ayumu is a rather expressionless person, which kind of reminded me of Raido from “Aharen-san wa Hakarenai”, but bolder, and Urushi is your typical cute girl that blushes a lot when teased. In a way, it’s kind of the reversal of “Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san”, where Takagi would constantly tease Nishikata and make him blush. This resemblance is no fluke though, because they were written by the same author.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 15.2/25The story is quite simple and relaxing, inoffensive and fun. It’s a whole bunch of teasing, a whole bunch of shogi playing, and a bit of slow progress in Ayumu and Urushi’s relationship. The teasing is rather uncreative and repetitive though compared to something like Takagi-san, as it’s mostly just Ayumu giving Urushi compliments, and making fun of her small size. I do wish there were more unique scenarios for the teasing and romantic moments, but I enjoyed what we got. The side characters were interesting at times with their relationships, but they weren’t extremely involved all the time. I also wish we would get a small, basic lesson about shogi in this show as well, as that could make viewers a bit more engaged.ART: 7.4/10There isn’t a whole lot of movement in the show, but for the most part, the designs were alright and the colours were good. Nothing too special here.MUSIC: 8.2/10The music compliments the show well, and gives off a nice slice of life vibe. The opening and ending were also pretty solid, and quite catchy.CHARACTERS: 13.5/20The main leads are good characters, especially Ayumu, because he’s completely willing to compliment Urushi all the time, and I wouldn’t imagine he’d be too afraid to confess his feelings. Urushi isn’t all too special, but she’s very adorable, and fun to watch. The side characters are also fun to watch, especially Takeru and Sakurako, who have an interesting dynamic. Another character I’d like to highlight would be Rin, who was also part of the middle school kendo team, and her interactions with Ayumu and Takeru are a joy to watch, and there’s some substance there. There are some backstories that were a tad bit emotional too, which is always a welcome thing.ENJOYMENT: 11.5/15Cute and wholesome, pretty satisfying.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 14/20The one thing I’d say this show lacks is creativity in comedy. Sure, it’s good, but it’s quite repetitive. There aren’t a whole lot of unique scenarios and settings. The thing this show does well is romance, because there seems to be genuine progress in the relationship, and it also feels very relatable to the vibe of high school romance, and I’m glad to see it.OVERALL: 69.8/100For a romance anime, it delivers decently. In terms of works from this author, I’d still have to go with Takagi-san over this show, but nonetheless, this show is good in its own way, and features a good high school relationship, but it just doesn’t have that extra kick or uniqueness to it. That said, if there’s ever a sequel, I’d be happy to watch it. After all, who would say no to cute romcoms?

The plot is enjoyable, and the elements that they add in during the show are nice to see as the story develops.It is really pleasurable to see that Ayumu is the one ‘head-over-heels’ rather than the Urushi. Additionally, the fact that Urushi is older than Ayumu is very different to usual stereotypes, which is refreshing to see.The OP and the outro are amazing, along with the drawing style. I am assuming that they went for a more old-school vibe, seeing as the show seems to be set...in the early 2000’s; which fits really well with the fact the show is centred around a more ancient game.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a romantic, but also comedic show! in the early 2000’s; which fits really well with the fact the show is centred around a more ancient game.Overall, I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys a romantic, but also comedic show!', 'Unpopular opinion, but out of Soichiro YAMAMOTO’s main 3 works, Soreayu is actually my favourite. While it may not be as popular as Takagi-san, it has a better dynamic between the two main characters, feels more natural and the use of shogi to facilitate the relationship is way more interesting than just teasing, IMO.With Takagi-San being over now, I needed something to fill that void in my heart and this was the logical conclusion. I did not think that it would end up being my favourite of the bunch, though. From the very first episode, I was really impressed with how calm, cool and...collected Ayumu was around the girl he likes. I enjoyed his little comments and hints throughout the season and liked that both characters really know how the other feels, but are kind of nervous to take the next step. It feels very age appropriate and realistic for middle schoolers.As with YAMAMOTO’s other works, this series also has some really fun side characters and a side ship they may be even better than the main. I don’t know what it is, but it seems like it’s actually easier to write better supporting cast relationships than the main one. If Ayumu and Urushi aren’t on screen, you never have to worry about a dull moment because Sakurako, Rin or Takeru will be able to carry the scene.As usual with any of this author’s works, this series is big on the oversized foreheads. Honestly, I think the designs look the best in this series. I feel like he toned things down substantially from Tsubaki and Takagi.

Last season it was Aharen is Indecipherable, and this season it's When Will Ayumu Make His Move. I cannot stop watching shows like this.I don't even know what shogi is, and I still cannot stop watching. They play it every single episode, and half of the dialogue and plot-points are related to it, and I know absolutely nothing about it.

Ayumu makes a promise to himself that he will confess his feelings to Urushi—under the condition that he defeats her at least once. Despite Urushi being adept at strategy, she finds herself unable to defend against Ayumu’s straightforward remarks. His flirtatious behavior doesn’t go unnoticed by Urushi, who’s almost certain of Ayumu’s true...feelings, but she is often too flustered to accept it at face value. This anime operates similarly to Souichirou Yamamoto’s other series, Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, with an episodic structure. It more so focuses on the subtle interactions between the main duo and less so tires itself with an emotional throughline. This may make the show seem a bit repetitive, but as someone who enjoys slice of life and low-stakes anime, it didn’t personally bother me.Rom-coms have several selling factors, but arguably its strongest appeal comes from the characters and their relationships. Ayumu's mannerisms are direct yet unassuming, and his expressionless demeanor is what makes his character stand out from your typical protagonist in the teasing subgenre. Many male leads are often given unassertive character traits in order to be better fodder for the main girl’s relentless teasing. However, this show takes a different approach and swaps the two main characters' traditional roles. Ayumu’s personality is different enough to feel refreshing while not deviating too far from conventional romance protagonists. Urushi, on the other hand, is timid and easily embarrassed—often at the receiving end of the show's jokes. She is eager to get back at Ayumu with her own tactics, but her attempts usually end up tragically backfiring. It’s at this point I feel obligated to point out how adorable the show’s art style is. Yamamoto’s style of drawing is so cute that it’s pretty much what sells the show’s wholesome moments. His female characters are so incredibly endearing that you can’t help but smile whenever they’re on screen.Although I find the general presentation to be rather charming, the show is not without its flaws. For one, the audience has to make concessions with how predictable the story is to enjoy a fair amount of the humor. It's an inevitability that rom-coms follow similar clichés and plot beats. And when comparing the show to others in the same genre, its scenarios feel a bit derivative. In common anime fashion, the story requires a great deal of suspended disbelief for some of its situations. The side character, Sakurako for example, uses hypnosis as a crutch to get her classmate, Takeru, to do things for her. Its inclusion feels almost too supernatural for this show and it somewhat took me out of my immersion. Having Sakurako be so possessive of Takeru may seem cute at times, but in other situations, she feels needlessly manipulative. Ayumu and Urushi’s dynamic, by comparison, seems more realistic, albeit still unnatural at times. Given how frank Ayumu is, it feels almost unnecessary to get a formal confession. Ayumu makes no effort to conceal his deep adoration for Urushi, and his remarks often feel too direct to be misconstrued as just teasing.Aside from those minor complaints, the show is successful in everything else it sets out to do. Not only is it wholesome and heartwarming, but it also has more substance than most would give it credit for. An often overlooked story-telling device is perspective and what it can do to the overall feel of a show. A character is far more compelling when we understand their internal motivations, and this is often achieved when we get to see from their point of view. We are typically disengaged from the one-note, single personality trait archetypes because their behavior is often predictable and less in line with an actual person. If Ayumu and Urushi’s thought processes weren’t available to us, their extended platonic relationship would be much harder to understand. But because we do get to see their actual emotions, their relationship is more dynamic and somewhat believable.Another strong aspect of the story was the side characters. Side romances are typically a dodgy aspect in many animes, but oddly enough I was quite invested in Takeru and Sakurako’s relationship. Unlike in Takagi-san, the side characters actually interact with the main duo quite often. The problem with Mina, Sanae, and Yukari in that show was how sparse their interactions with Nishikata and Takagi were. The trio was so non-impactful that each time the show panned over to them, it felt like the main story was being interrupted. Conversely, Takeru and Sakurako actually affect situations that pertain to the main leads, which justifies their presence in the story. It’s never a dull moment when they’re on screen and they have their own adorable charm that’s distinct from Ayumu and Urushi’s.I recommend this show to anyone that enjoys a simple rom-com. It’s a cute slice of life that’s very easy to pick up and watch but doesn’t necessarily try to be anything else. If you can forgive the show for some of its leaps in logic, then overall I think you’ll have a good time. feelings, but she is often too flustered to accept it at face value.

Its inclusion feels almost too supernatural for this show and it somewhat took me out of my immersion. Having Sakurako be so possessive of Takeru may seem cute at times, but in other situations, she feels needlessly manipulative. Ayumu and Urushi’s dynamic, by comparison, seems more realistic, albeit still unnatural at times. Given how frank Ayumu is, it feels almost unnecessary to get a formal confession. Ayumu makes no effort to conceal his deep adoration for Urushi, and his remarks often feel too direct to be misconstrued as just teasing.Aside from those minor complaints, the show is successful in everything else it sets out to do. Not only is it wholesome and heartwarming, but it also has more substance than most would give it credit for. An often overlooked story-telling device is perspective and what it can do to the overall feel of a show. A character is far more compelling when we understand their internal motivations, and this is often achieved when we get to see from their point of view. We are typically disengaged from the one-note, single personality trait archetypes because their behavior is often predictable and less in line with an actual person. If Ayumu and Urushi’s thought processes weren’t available to us, their extended platonic relationship would be much harder to understand. But because we do get to see their actual emotions, their relationship is more dynamic and somewhat believable.Another strong aspect of the story was the side characters. Side romances are typically a dodgy aspect in many animes, but oddly enough I was quite invested in Takeru and Sakurako’s relationship. Unlike in Takagi-san, the side characters actually interact with the main duo quite often. The problem with Mina, Sanae, and Yukari in that show was how sparse their interactions with Nishikata and Takagi were. The trio was so non-impactful that each time the show panned over to them, it felt like the main story was being interrupted. Conversely, Takeru and Sakurako actually affect situations that pertain to the main leads, which justifies their presence in the story. It’s never a dull moment when they’re on screen and they have their own adorable charm that’s distinct from Ayumu and Urushi’s.I recommend this show to anyone that enjoys a simple rom-com. It’s a cute slice of life that’s very easy to pick up and watch but doesn’t necessarily try to be anything else. If you can forgive the show for some of its leaps in logic, then overall I think you’ll have a good time."", ""Come for Urushi, stay for Takeru!The takeru should have been the main character.I only started wathcing this because I saw a clip on reddit that I thought was cute. But when I started watching cute was the only thing this show had to offer. So I left it at ep 1 for a month, then when I craved something cute again I came back to it, watched another episode. But after episode 2 I'd had too much cute and the main characters where getting a bit boaring, predictable and unrealistic. Then I saw the side characters takeru and Sakurako, who I was much...more interested in. Takeru is just much more relatable and the realationship between the two is just so layed back and enjoyable to watch. So I ended up skipping to anything with takeru in it, didn't care for main story story if you can call it that. more interested in.

From the start to finish, the way this anime is able to combine elements of slice of life, shogi, and relationship dynamics fascinated me. Make no mistake, for Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru is much more than just about shogi.Before the series even got a serialization, it started out as just a short webcomic. It took its baby steps before being noticed and serialized into ongoing manga with over 160+ ongoing chapters. Obviously, not every anime adaptation is created equal and this show does fall short...in terms of adaptation standard. It's only a 12 episode adaptation that capture the essence of the show, but not its full plot or character development. Yet, it's still a fascinating slice of life rom-com.The plot mainly revolves around the shogi club, organized by club president Urushi Yaotome. To her surprise, the club gets its first member in the pilot episode. Meet Ayumu Tanaka, the serious gentleman who probably has the most deadpan face out of any protagonist you'll see this year. Watching his interactions with Urushi is nothing short of comedy as the two exchange their reactions based on their personalities. In particular, Ayumu is very straightforward with his words and never holds back when complimenting on Urushi's looks. This often results in her furiously blushing and reacting in surprise. Let's face it, Ayumu does have a crush on Urushi but he made a promise to not confess until he beats her at shogi. That's one of the reasons he's there for being there in the first place. The English translation of the title is When Will Ayumu Make His Move? It's not about how Ayumu plays his shogi but when he'll make his real move.With Ayumu's deadpan mannerisms, you'd have to wonder how serious he actually is. No one can really read his true thoughts when he has the same face every episode. The way he confidently tells Urushi she is 'cute' becomes a trademark of his character. However, the character chemistry between Ayumu and Urushi is undeniable. Even if they seem like different species on this planet, they enjoy each others' company. Urushi seems to harbor feelings, or at least interest in Ayumu's character. This anime sometimes feels like a character study of Ayumu himself, as we examine his human traits. Urushi is likewise, the normal girl of the show who just wants her club to be recognized. (yes, the school doesn't recognize her club due to lack of funding)The show doesn't boast an all-star cast but it has a colorful cast of characters to keep you entertained. Slice of life/rom-coms tends to shine the most when it has a small cast as it's able to bring out the most of its characters. Besides Ayumu and Urushi, we also meet their classmates Takeru, Sakurako, Maki, and later Rin. When comparing Takeru and Sakurao, it seems their roles are reversed compared to our star duo. Takeru is the one that shows the most reactions while Sakurao maintains her elegant presence. The anime also loves its comedy gags by giving Sakurao a hypnotic device. We have to remember that this is the same brainchild behind Teasing Master Takagi-san, a franchise that made itself famous for its endless teasing segments. When translated into this show, it constantly reminds us the question of 'will they or won't they'. This extends to both Urushi/Ayumu and Takeru/Sakurako. While the show doesn't have a deep story arc, at least from this adaptation, it certainly does make us question about the development of the plot. In particular, Rin is a character that takes a hit for being introduced late in the series. The manga expands much more into her character so who knows, perhaps someday, we'll get to see Rin's character achieve her full potential.Indeed, I want to say congratulations to Souichirou Yamamoto for having multiple works being adapted into anime, including three  shows airing this year. It's not easy getting so many work being recognized but also appreciated by its fans. Let me just say that while alot of his themes can be repetitive, it earns its praise for being entertaining. Souichirou's style of engaging the audience remains fundamental and delivers what the audience expects. You're not going to get a deep story of mystery or drama with tears and emotions. Instead, his series are generally simple slice of life stories that contains romance subcontext. It's simple as it gets and honestly, just about anyone can watch their work. Soredemo Ayumu wa Yoetekuru is no exception.Silver Link is probably the one of the more suitable studios to handle this adaptation if I've been honest. Character designs are adapted from the manga with precision and captures their expressions with deadly accuracy. Like me just say that a selling point of the show is the character chemistry and this anime has no shortage of that. Character dialogues and voices also deserves a praise, in particular for Ayumu. I mean, when he talks, his dialogues becomes synonymous with his deadpan personality. The OP and ED themes also offers a colorful way of getting the audience's attention. So in essence, the technical elements of this show earns its praise.You really don't need a big brain to enjoy Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru. The anime isn't hiding some secret agenda but instead delivers a fundamentally enjoyable slice of life rom-com. Despite being just 12 episodes, every one of them felt meaningful and gave us what you'd expect. I just wish the overall length was longer because there's so much more to be explored. But sit back and relax. Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru opens the door to a world that really is more than just playing shogi. in terms of adaptation standard.

Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru opens the door to a world that really is more than just playing shogi."", 'The year is 2022, and out of all the authors to get all the notoriety for attention, it\'s Souichirou Yamamoto. This madlad of a mangaka as you will know, is the aforementioned creator of Takagi-san, which the manga sold like hotcakes thanks to the now 3 seasons of the anime adaptation plus the movie that got released in mid-June. And this year alone, his fame shot up like infamy when we\'ve come to know that 3 of his works will be released simultaneously seasonally, creating the ""forehead trio"" analogy of Winter\'s still excellent Takagi-san (Season 3), Spring\'s somewhat decent Kunoichi Tsubaki, and now Summer\'s ""superior""...version of Takagi-san that is Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru a.k.a When Will Ayumu Make His Move?. Finally, the ""forehead trio"" trifecta is complete, and how actually does Soredemo Ayumu fare to the juggernaut that is Takagi-san?I mean, come on, it\'s Souichirou Yamamoto, and if there\'s anything noteworthy to be made about this author, is that he can turn the impossible possible, which is exactly what was done for this show, which is just a palette swap of Takagi-san in the character department anyway. Simply put, Urushi Yaotome acts pretty much just like Nishikata and Ayumu Tanaka is a stern-faced expressionless version of Takagi-san, only that I\'d think that where there merits to saying that this show is how the mangaka envisions it to be, then he definitely got that formula correct, but also with an actual plot to back it up. In this case, it\'s involving Shogi to progress their relationship from being club members to love interests, which I can definitely tell that it\'s a smart move to incorporate Shogi strategies and link them to the topics of love.Ayumu is definitely in love with Urushi, but aside from his stone-cold face, he has a motive: unless he beats Urushi in Shogi, he would absolutely NOT confess to her, and no matter how much he loses to Urushi in practice and tutorial games, his blunt personality actually makes for some giggles which trigger Urushi\'s many memeable facial expression on his conquest, which is not a bad thing! The daily interactions with said female MC make for some of the most comical scenes with the straightfowardness of Ayumu to the many ""Pikachu surprised"" faces of Urushi\'s bashfulness, and if they were to compete against the other Takagi-Nishikata pair, I would say that they\'re not necessarily better, but just in the different demographics of middle vs. high school that holds well in their own regard.The replacement for Takagi-san\'s 3 girls of Ashita wa Doyoubi in Soredemo Ayumu, comes in the form of close friends ranging from Urushi\'s classmate-cum-best friend Maki to Ayumu\'s childhood friend romantic relationship trope of Takeru Kakuryu and Sakurako Mikage, and the one girl that\'s even closer to him based on common interests, Rin Kagawa. Maki is voiced by none other than HanaKana, so you would know that she\'s a thing of beauty and someone that Urushi admired because she is developed with breasts (as compared to her flatboard chest). And she\'s a genuine friend that other than her teasing antics towards Urushi, is a nice compliment in the supporting section as well, always ready to help her best friend when it counts. Definitely a Best Winggirl status in the making. As for Takeru and Sakuragi, the former\'s quite a noisy brat that sticks closer to a brother with Ayumu most of the time and is in the library club. But it\'s that same place where he would be friends with Sakurako, whom he has a crush on, and the latter is a shy one who would often lead the former into hypnotism, being unaware of that fleeting crush feeling. These two ""lovebirds"" work together as a side couple of things, and in my opinion, they\'re much sweeter than the Takagi-Nishikata pair, which is saying something of their character dynamics with one another working out the way as is intended. Of course, for every one sweet person in the crew, there will be one bad apple, and this is in the form of Ayumu and Takeru\'s junior Rin, who\'s got her head pretty much filled with Kendo as she practices day in and day out, fulfilling her promise to beat her Senpai in order to gain his recognition. But as one might expect, the literal shift from Kendo to Shogi doesn\'t sit well with her, and like from Ayumu to Urushi, she\'ll often raise challenges in the hopes that\'ll attract her Senpai\'s attention, but of course, by then he has already been entrapped in the Shogi lore with Urushi. Overall, the character cast here is one of the standouts when comparing this with Takagi-san, and I would argue that this is much better.This greatness trickles down to the performance of the VAs, and one such fact that you cannot ignore is that this is newbie VA Kanna Nakamura\'s first-ever gig for both voice acting and the ending song (which character endings are a staple of Souichirou Yamamoto shows). And starting out here as a main role (which is HUGE for rookies) for Urushi, Kanna Nakamura is very talented, even to the point of sounding like an actual veteran Seiyuu, the likes of the Queen of Teasing, Rie Takahashi herself. Definitely looking forward to more of her roles, that\'s for sure. Youhei Azakami does decent, having that deep bass voice that he\'s known for to give Ayumu a somewhat aging young man\'s voice without sounding too adult-like, that\'s fine by me.Silver Link has recently been somewhat of a wonky record, from constantly having a conflicting see-saw motion this season with this show and the mediocre Saikin Yatotta Maid ga Ayashii. There\'s bound to be equalness from standing out and being generic, but for the most part, it gets the job done intended without any distinct qualities, and I\'m fine if it does make the show stand out better that way. Also, it\'s been a long while since we\'ve heard anything HanaKana worthy, and that OP song is a bop, while Kanna Nakamura\'s ED song is one and the same. Good marks across the board, I have to say.This then, brings me (and you) back to the initial question: Is Soredemo Ayumu the ""superior"" version of Takagi-san? If you think about it in the general sense, then the model answer would be: ""Yes, it does"". But after having seen both Takagi-san and Kunoichi Tsubaki, my own personal opinion is that first impressions are everything, and nothing can ever beat out Takagi-san in terms of raw experience (be it the manga or the anime). But, make no mistake that Soredemo Ayumu is the embodiment of undulated fun, and this to me, is 2nd place behind Takagi-san for just being that. It\'s a good effort nonetheless, and to properly close 2022\'s trifecta of Souichirou Yamamoto\'s 3 seasons whip of anime adaptations, it ended in a pretty good note.But this is just me, and I hope that you find this show more fun than I did, so obviously it\'s recommended. version of Takagi-san that is Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru a.k.a When Will Ayumu Make His Move?.

While it's not really disappointing that reused content is being provided by the author in the form of everyday jokes or teenagers shyly teasing each other, my personal enjoyment after watching Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru is nowhere like how our male lead, Ayumu, enjoys being with (and of course, teasing) his senpai.The demographic for these types of shows are those who prefer the slow and steady rather than the blood-pumping, fast animation style shows.

Not only that, but the side/support character story is quite interesting too since they love each other but the girl is the one who is more expressionless. The story becomes interesting when they are always playing shogi as a reason to stay close to their loved ones.

No longer can I sit and watch a 12 episode season watching two people baby-step their way into confessing that they kinda wanna bone only for the status quo to remain by the end, and not be incredibly disappointed.“When Will Ayumu Make His Move?” was conceived by Souichirou Yamamoto, the same mangaka  who wrote the excellent “Teasing Master Takagi-san”. But where Takagi-san’s slow burn charm comes from Takagi’s devilish delight in bamboozling the emotionally immature Nishikata and him realising that it kinda...likes it, Ayumu is implied to already know that his senpai Urushi has feelings for him and vice-versa yet won’t confess his feelings to her until… he’s beaten her at Shogi…His straightforward teasing towards Urushi can be very funny and charming, but it gets old after a while. The more you think about why Ayumu doesn’t just confess his feelings and get the relationship he clearly wants, the more frustrating it is to watch.Even his best friend side character Takeru has a will-they-won’t-they relationship going on with Sakurako in a B plot and you can bet your ass that the needle is stuck in place in that relationship too.On a side note, I personally don’t think hypnosis jokes are all that funny rather they’re more creepy and weird. Theres a reason Kaa from “The Jungle Book” is one of the creepiest villains in the Disney vault.It’s not all bad. Despite the status quo romance story the characters themselves are very charming and there are an abundance of side characters to help keep the show from getting stale such as underclassmen Rin and Urushi’s best friend Maki. Silver Link’s animation won’t be getting any awards, but the art consistently looks good and it doesn’t really need to do anything all that special animation wise as the show is more character driven. I will say there are some excellent animation and lighting shots in some seasons which sometimes makes the show feel like a completely different anime.Overall, I wouldn’t say it’s bad, but I wouldn’t recommend “When Will Ayumu Make His Move?” to someone looking for a good rom-com anime. Yamamoto may be able to design cute girls with large foreheads, but his romance plots could use some work.

The more you think about why Ayumu doesn’t just confess his feelings and get the relationship he clearly wants, the more frustrating it is to watch.Even his best friend side character Takeru has a will-they-won’t-they relationship going on with Sakurako in a B plot and you can bet your ass that the needle is stuck in place in that relationship too.On a side note, I personally don’t think hypnosis jokes are all that funny rather they’re more creepy and weird. Theres a reason Kaa from “The Jungle Book” is one of the creepiest villains in the Disney vault.It’s not all bad. Despite the status quo romance story the characters themselves are very charming and there are an abundance of side characters to help keep the show from getting stale such as underclassmen Rin and Urushi’s best friend Maki. Silver Link’s animation won’t be getting any awards, but the art consistently looks good and it doesn’t really need to do anything all that special animation wise as the show is more character driven.

The original plots of these three anime are created by the same author. So this review emphasizes distinctions between this anime and the previous two.As in Takagi-san, there is a couple with a kind of romantic relationship between them. But Takagi-san has the bulk bullying/teasing relationship and the small actual romantic one, and the ration didn't change throughout 3 seasons. In contrast, this anime shapes the more mature and deep characters. Yaotome and Tanaka have their own purposes,...traits. Hereby, this affords to develop their relationships. The supporting characters became as interesting as Tsubaki's ones.The visual is very well by quality and akin to both Takagi-san and Kunoichi Tsubaki by concept. The score is just fit.

Characters with large foreheads and sticking to a formula.'When Will Ayumu Make His Move?' lives up to both of these claims to fame.The formula here is Ayumu and Urushi playing Shogi; Urushi beats him on the board, but Ayumu just keeps winning off of it. He's constantly straightforward with his feelings (despite his vow not to confess his love for his senpai until he beats her in shogi). As a result, he's yet to confess, since Urushi keeps beating him, but his feelings are pretty out in the open, and the way he causes Urushi to get flustered...by his awkward flirting is the major formula for this series.If you don't like this formula, you're not going to enjoy it when it gets repeated a dozen times in each episode, but if you do... you're in for a fun time. I DO enjoy this formula, and so I can strongly recommend this series.That doesn't mean that its going to be for everyone. If you didn't enjoy 'Teasing Master Takagi' you're probably not going to enjoy this either. by his awkward flirting is the major formula for this series.If you don't like this formula, you're not going to enjoy it when it gets repeated a dozen times in each episode, but if you do... you're in for a fun time.

It was funny, interesting, very direct, felt rather fresh and like it would do something different. However, once it got past those episodes the show felt like it progressed then regressed the characters development and it became rather normal as most animes.The most critical part I have is the jokes became pretty repetitive it was essentially, deadpan character makes very direct flirty comment to other character, the other character blushes or feels embarrassed. That was the essence of comedy for most of the show....Romance wise it is decent through lots of moments of the couples together, but follows the tiring trope of will they/won't they which is not surprising considering the anime's title.Side character romance was a nice addition with Sakurako and Takeru that helped fill the gap in wanting more romance in the show. The rest of the side characters through were rather unmemorable and sometime felt like they were taking time away from the more important couples moments.OP and ED are very catchy. Loved the little dance sequence in the OP and overall Urushi VA, Kanna Nakamura, sings really well. It is an interesting note that this is her first VA debut role and that it is a main character is impressive, she did great throughout the anime I will say.Overall, I would still recommend the show it is a decent romance if you like characters teasing/flirting a lot with embarrassed reactions with okay comedy that can be a bit repetitive. At times the show will subvert expectations for tropes and cliches, but it did it so many times it became predictable while trying to be unpredictable. Rather lighthearted that feels like a slice of life romcom which ended up becoming a rather normal chill anime to watch since there weren't too many scenes that were uniquely memorable.

I looked forward to it every week. I loved how steadfast Ayumu was and how flustered Urushi could become. It was such a treat to watch these two nerds grow their bond together over the course of the cour. I also liked how the focus of the series was on their romance more than explaining shogi to the viewer or having the club participate in tournaments or other things that take it too far away from the cute romance sub genre. Their friends were also delightful characters and the secondary couple was easy to root for...once their quirks grew on me.That said, I think Ayumu is the type of character who only works well in a romance anime rather than IRL because our boy had some creeper tendencies when we were supposed to believe he was just a determined but quiet guy. I also thought the hypnotism parts were a bit dubious but again, something that works as laughs for an anime rather than works IRL. These things did not super detract from my enjoyment of the over all story, which I found kind of relatable and nice since it came off like a romance series for introverts. Kind of sad that it was only one cour but at the same time I'm glad it didn't feel stretched out too thin.If you enjoy cute romance and couples with a kind of quiet determination meets flustered obliviousness then you will likely love this anime too. once their quirks grew on me.That said, I think Ayumu is the type of character who only works well in a romance anime rather than IRL because our boy had some creeper tendencies when we were supposed to believe he was just a determined but quiet guy.

This being Urushi towards Ayumu and Mikage towards Takeru mainly, but also Takeru towards Mikage while Rin is added pretty much as a wallflower while Ayumu and Urushi have no idea what her feelings actually are. Confused yet?...But wait, it gets worse!While it's pretty interesting to see Ayumu fall so hard for Urushi and actually making it VERY obvious, even by joining the Shogi club that is actually not a official club at that point just to see her. There is no real advancement from the moment he joined up to the moment the season ends. Yes, Urushi finally realizes that she is actually in love.

While side characters differ a lot, the main characters, especially of course, the male leads, that it's hard not to make comparsions.The problem is focus. 90% of this show is focused on romance, maybe even 95%, while 5% is focused on slice of life content and comedy. It's really so skewed towards rom-com setups and dialogue that there's basically...no other comedic elements in play. It doesn't help that in this show, you're going to be watching a shogi board, which is coincidentally super easy to animate, and thus, you're going to be looking at static frames of characters just sitting around a shogi board for minutes each episode.

He once again, directed his original work along with most of the same crew as before. After watching Be Forever Yamato, this series had much to live up to.The time setting takes place as a sequel to Be Forever Yamato. A stray missile from a battle going on in distant space goes into the Earth’s sun causing nuclear fusion to inevitably make the sun go super nova. OK, so already a little ridiculous in the overall plot. There are two options in the story: one is to try and control the sun and...the other is to find another planet to migrate to. Science aside, it sounds crazy either way.It’s the same crew doing the same Yamato stuff without much change. Although the doom impending on Earth, like the first Yamato, does bring some suspension to the show, there just is not enough variety or anything the audience has not seen before. Even old enemies are brought back. The first 15 episodes almost feel like a complete waste of time once, without spoiling it, a character comes in contact with Yamato. There is a sort of three way war going on throughout the universe of the show, but it is never capitalized on in any proper way.When it comes down to it, Yamato 3 is an average space opera anime at best. Plus, with Be Forever Yamato coming out in the same year, there just is not enough room in the Yamato universe for this mediocre one. This can be skipped unless you are a diehard fan of the Yamato universe. the other is to find another planet to migrate to.

The Sun is heating up due to a stray missile hitting it and now the crew needs to set out to find a new habitable planet. The Idea is pretty good but the execution is very mediocre and doesn't live up to the previous two series. First the good parts of it, and that would be the new expansions to the universe with the new enemies. Although the bolar federation is not nearly as good of a villain as Gamilus or Gatlantis, they are a massive improvement over the black nebula empire from be forever Yamato.Now...for the bad. the show introduces several new characters in which next to nothing is done with. Domon and Ahega are completely flat and dry and I completely forgot Ahega existed for half the show. I was expecting them to be built up as new overconfident rookies who have to learn the ropes and slowly fill their roll on the Yamato, however both get barely any screentime for their development. Even the returning characters feel like they're not even present. The bridge crew seems to have lost all of the personality and character from the previous series. Kodai just feels like the generic space opera protaganist, In Yamato 1 Kodai goes through many emotional struggles regarding his parent's death but here he just has nothing going for him. Shima barely even feels like he's there, he seems to just have almost no screentime whatsoever. The space battle scenes are also not as good and so much of the first half feels extremely pointless. for the bad. the show introduces several new characters in which next to nothing is done with.

Sekirei,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4063/Sekirei,"[""Sekirei is targeted at male audience, viewers who dislike ecchi/harem anime should look elsewhere. Likewise, those who love fan service should give Sekirei a try. It contains all the &quot;ripped up clothes&quot; scenes, &quot;censored panty&quot; shots, &quot;semi-bare breasts&quot;, etc. You will not be disappointed.It should be noted that while the show does follow the manga quite closely for the most part, the ending of the anime does deviate from the manga a bit.Story:Are you familiar with Fate/stay Night? If you are please continue reading this paragraph, if not skip to the next. Upon reading the synopsis, you may find Sekirei's plot to be very similar....In fact, to sum it up in a nutshell, the major difference is that instead of 8 servants fighting each other, this time we have 108 seikirei instead. But rather than only having 1 servant to fight for the master, in the Sekirei world, the master can have as many seikirei as he/she can get.For those who are not familiar with Fate/stay Night, Sekirei is about a battle royal between 108 artificially made life forms (disguised as mostly female, though there are some male as well). These life forms, known as sekirei, are to find their Ashikabi (humans with special genes that allows them to partner with sekirei) and fight for them.Art:The quality of the animation is great as it is done by Seven Arcs, whose work includes the Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha franchise and Inukami!. Everything flows pretty smoothly and characters are drawn in detail, though sadly the show is not broadcast in HD.There are occasional scenes that, when compared with the manga's artwork, the level is plainly a grade lower. Hence for those who actually appreciate artist's drawing, I recommend try reading the manga as well.Sound:The OP and ED are very well rated by most viewers due to the talented casts of seiyu singing them. Talking about seiyu, one should be able to recognize a few names right away. Just to quickly name a few:Kazehana voiced by Yukana Nogami (C.C. in Code Geass, Teletha Testarossa in Full Metal Panic, etc)Tsukiumi voiced by Inoue Marina (Yoko Ritona in Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, etc)Asama Miya voiced by Oohara Sayaka (Milly Ashford in Code Geass, Alicia Florence in Aria the Animation, etc)Matsu voiced by Endou Aya (Sheryl Nome in Macross Frontier, Lena Sayers in Mai-Otome 0~S.ifr~, Kinue Crossroad in Gundam 00, etc)Karasuba voiced by Paku Romi (Edward Elric in Full Metal Alchemist, Hitsugaya in Bleach, etc)etc...you get the pointBelieve it or not, this talented casts of seiyu was one of the major selling point for Sekirei (beside fan service of course).Character:Many characters tend to be under developed for the most part of the story (this is usually the case when there's half a dozen &quot;main&quot; characters and only a dozen episodes to talk about them). As the series approach the ending, we see quite a lot more development for the main casts, particularly Minato (the male protagonist) and his sekirei. It is also interesting to note that the relationship between Minato and his sekirei throughout the series also provided a lot of entertainment, but more often than not these don't contribute much to character developments.Enjoyment:I enjoyed the series very much. Each episode has its own comedy to laugh at and at the same time it still contain enough action and drama to make the overall story attractive enough to me glued to the screen episode after episode. Definitely worth spending your time on. In fact, to sum it up in a nutshell, the major difference is that instead of 8 servants fighting each other, this time we have 108 seikirei instead. But rather than only having 1 servant to fight for the master, in the Sekirei world, the master can have as many seikirei as he/she can get.For those who are not familiar with Fate/stay Night, Sekirei is about a battle royal between 108 artificially made life forms (disguised as mostly female, though there are some male as well). These life forms, known as sekirei, are to find their Ashikabi (humans with special genes that allows them to partner with sekirei) and fight for them.Art:The quality of the animation is great as it is done by Seven Arcs, whose work includes the Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha franchise and Inukami!. Everything flows pretty smoothly and characters are drawn in detail, though sadly the show is not broadcast in HD.There are occasional scenes that, when compared with the manga's artwork, the level is plainly a grade lower.

But I have a weakness for such shows regardless how silly, played out, and clichéd they usually are.  I have to say though that with Sekirei I was pleasantly surprised with the results.The basic premise for Sekirei was interesting to me.  In a lot of ways it reminded me of the action movie Highlander, only with tits and asses.  The setting is a town in Japan controlled by the massive MBI cooperation.  They are administering...a ""game"" of sorts which pits 108 mysterious girls (and a few boys) called Sekirei against one another in a battle in which only one will get the prize.  Each of the Sekirei binds themselves to a human called an Ashikabi with a kiss which grants them extra powers.  There can be only one... giant pair of boobies.Sekirei does a good job of combining a lot of different genres together and making it work.  Action and fighting anime mixed with harem romance and comedy and a healthy dose of supernatural magic.  It manages to work quite well and despite being a short series there is enough of everything to keep fans entertained.  Though the series doesn’t wrap up the main storyline it ends with an announcement of a second season.  This is good because quite a few unanswered questions remain at the end.  The pacing of the plot is good and it keeps you interested and never feels like its dragging along or becoming repetitive.  It doesn’t always stay on topic but I never found myself minding that much when it didn’t.  Unexpectantly I really did enjoy the harem aspect of the story.  This was one of the few series in which I liked the entire group of girls.  It also may be the only time I wouldn’t mind if there is never a romantic choice between them and the male lead.  They all work so well together and have so much chemistry that I really just think they all belong together.The cast overall is a bit mixed but for the most part very good.  It is brought down mainly by an uninspired and uninteresting lead in Minato.  He is your classic harem lead and I really fail to understand why the girls in the cast find him so damn interesting.  It’s not that he’s an unlikable guy, because he is but he is very unoriginal and doesn’t stand out.  Viewers are unlikely to think much of him other than to wish they were in his place.  Besides spouting clichés and acting holier than thou he contributes nothing to the plot other than to be saved by his busty harem.It’s the harem though that saves the series for me.  I really loved them all, they were hilarious together and while none of them are inspired characters from an originality standpoint they just matched each other so well that they were a lot of fun.  Musubi is the ditsy and airheaded fighter who really just cares about the competition.  Her personality provides for a lot of comedy and a whole lot of fan service.  Early on in the story you would say she was the main love interest and while she may turn out to be that in the end she kind of became just one of the girls by the middle portions of the show.  I didn’t mind this so much because the rest of the girls were fun as well.  Tsukiume is the main rival for Minato\'s affections with Musubi.  She’s the resident tsundere so of course I loved her immediately.  Like most tsundere characters it seems she underwent the most growth in personality so I felt like I was rooting for her.  Misato stars as the perverted and geeky glasses girl.  She takes more of a backseat with the romance but her personality is more for laughs.  Of course a harem wouldn’t be complete without a loli, Kusano.  Despite me not liking loli\'s much I have to admit Kuu was pretty damn lovable and impossible to hate.The rest of the supporting cast and villains is solid but not particularly deep.  Everyone’s favorite is likely to be Miya, the landlady of the house they all live in together.  She’s a bit of a mysterious character in her origins but she acts a bit like a teacher, combat trainer, and a mother.  But dont tell her that or she’ll make a scary aura appear.  Other Ashikabi and their Sekirei appear over the course of the story, some to help and others to fight against our heroes and heroines.  We only get a small taste of the main villains which mostly serve to tease the next season.  Other supporting characters like Uzume and Homura remain mostly clouded in mystery and set for larger roles in the future.Artistically I can’t say I like Sekirei.  This is not to say the animation and art is bad, because it’s not.  Sekirei really puts the service in fan service and its uncensored version rivals pretty much any other show in terms of its nudity and panty shots.  My main problem though is the unrealistic and silly body measurements and character designs.  The boobs are outrageously huge on practically every non-loli character and really not even that attractive to look at.  They are unrealistically shaped and this is important because you are going to see them ALOT!  Additionally the girls’ bodies are completely malformed with huge hips and asses and tiny waists.  Often characters, particularly Musubi look practically deformed.  It really takes away from the show as I dont think it was necessary.  Dial it down a couple of cup sizes into at least a feasible size range.  The magic and fighting special effects are pretty good though but there are far less of them then there are nipple shots.I enjoyed the music and voice performances.  I felt the OP/EN theme songs which were performed by the cast were cute and captured the spirit of the series.  Of the seiyuu, I really liked Marina Inoue and Saori Hayama as Tsukiume and Musubi.  They really brought out their respective characters and stole the show.Looking back I shouldn’t really have liked this series as much as I did.  It’s not remarkable in any aspect except just being entertaining.  If your dont like harems and over the top fan service then you should stay away from this.  However if you have a boob fetish, love service anime, or like fighting anime then Sekirei will probably be an enjoyable experience. a ""game"" of sorts which pits 108 mysterious girls (and a few boys) called Sekirei against one another in a battle in which only one will get the prize.

However, my good buddy convinced me to ignore all the critics and give this series a shot. Unfortunately...I kind of have to agree with the popular consensus on this one. Sekirei has enough problems to make it very hard for me to recommend.Plot and characters:The plot of Sekirei is that some hot alien chicks crash landed on Earth and an evil corporation is forcing them to pair up with bland males to act as their “masters” and fight each other to the death in a Battle Royale tournament with the winners getting to ascend...into Godhood. If only I hadn’t seen so many highly similar plots in other shitty anime like: Akikan, Kampfer, Future Diary, etc. It must be said that Sekirei is not exactly going to win any awards for its creativity. Each of these alien girls called “Sekirei” have different “types” that determine which techniques they can learn and how well they match up against other types based on elemental strengths and weaknesses. Funny, this seems AWFULLY familiar from somewhere! The main character is Minato, who is supposed to be a lovable loser kind of guy that has failed twice getting into Tokyo University and is now studying hard to finally succeed. Seriously! That’s just how little this series tries in terms of creativity. Although I wouldn’t say he is a complete Keitaro from Love Hina ripoff because Keitaro didn’t keep a harem of female slaves that he fought to the death in gladiator matches. I guess Minato is more like Keitaro mixed with Calvin Candie from Django Unchained?! The first Sekirei that Minato gains mastery over is a “fighting type” Sekirei named Musubi. Predictably, Musubi is an airheaded bimbo that lacks any interesting character traits. She loves to eat, flash her tits, and punch other Sekirei in the face. That’s really about as far as her character development goes. My favorite character is the mad scientist leader of the corporation controlling the Sekirei. He is so bombastic and over the top that he actually made me laugh on several occasions, especially in the English dub where he is played by Chuck Huber.Art:The animation in Sekirei is decent and some of the fight scenes look pretty good relative to its year of release. However, I wasn’t a fan of the character designs. The tits are so absurdly large that it just looks fucking stupid! Sekirei’s idea of human anatomy clashed hard with my personal aesthetics.Enjoyment:Sekirei actually did have a few moments that were genuinely funny, or at least so incredibly stupid that I laughed. In one scene, Musubi randomly starts flying and takes Minato into the air to spoof the romance scene from the 1978 Superman film…then she announces that she has no idea how to land and they fall hundreds of feet before crashing into a tree. The fight scenes as mentioned above in the art section are fairly decent and if you simply want to watch some entertaining garbage, this series is passable.Overall:Sekirei is not what I would consider a good anime by any stretch. However, it never annoyed me to the degree that Akikan and Kampfer did or infuriate me by being horribly written, yet taking itself dead seriously like Future Diary or Code Geass. Basically, Sekirei is a bad anime, but there are a LOT of anime I hate WAY more than Sekirei! Still, I would avoid this one unless you really want to see some mindless entertainment featuring impossibly busty Pokemon women fighting each other for the sake of a highly cliche' and contrived plot. into Godhood.

Yes, I\'ve found a few that I liked, but most of them are heavily misogynistic and treat the women like prizes to be won or vapid automatons that have been programmed to chase after this one very ordinary guy regardless of how he treats them or how obviously he rejects them. Who knows, maybe my general distaste for the genre makes people want reviews to see if their particular one will be one of the exceptions or maybe it\'s a case of people wanting to see me tear an anime a new one and...they figure a harem title has a good chance of filling that role. The series was created by the manga artist, Gokurakuin Sakurako or Sakura Ashika. An artist best known for her shounen ai. The anime adaptation was handled by Seven Arcs, the studio behind Inukami, which was bad and Mahou Shoujp Lyrical Nanoha, which was good. Let\'s take a look at Sekirei and see if it\'s one of those rare good harem anime or one of the many that isn\'t even remotely worthwhile.Our story begins with a ronin named Minato who\'s just failed to get into University for the second year in a row. As he\'s walking down the street a girl, Musubi, falls on top of him. She\'s being chased by lightning hurling twins. She grabs Minato and runs. It turns out she\'s a Sekirei, a being with super powers that are fully activated by kissing an Ashikabi, which is the title for their masters. The idea is that a hundred and eight of these beings will fight until one is left to claim the ascension prize. The story from there primarily focuses on the various Sekirei that flock to Minato. Just about everything in the series is pretty typical for a harem series. The only real exception is the powered being battle which, as the only potentially interesting element, is pushed into the background. Plus, the execution for what they do have of it is crap. Get this, one of the rules is that Ashikabi are forbidden to mention the Sekirei plan to outsiders, and yet you see the Sekirei fight out in the open where anyone can see them by walking by, opening a window installing a security camera or through various other means. And yet this is supposed to be a secret. That goes past Twilight and to All Star Batman and Robin levels of stupidity. The humour is another element that fails. Sekirei does have an occasional funny joke, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand, assuming a normal number of fingers. The ending is absolute rubbish. They set up for a sequel while having a pandering, arbitrary triumphant moment. The worst aspect of the work as a whole is the absolutely vile treatment of the female characters. They\'re quite strongly objectified right down to having masters who can, quite literally, claim them whether they like it or not. This is probably the best example of internalised misogyny I\'ve ever seen.The characters are about as nuanced and developed as tissue paper. They\'re fully typical for what you almost always see in bad harem anime. You have the ordinary protagonist with no special attributes who you\'re supposed to root for because he\'s a generically ""good"" character. The perky and air-headed girl. The more aggressive girl. The loli (ewww) and so on. You will never find a real woman who acts like any of these characters, but they\'re designed to appeal to incredibly shallow and hormonal men so... mission accomplished?The artwork in this could be generic, but there are several factors that bring it down. The first, and most obvious, being the absurd fan-service. Expect a lot of random panty, ass and breast shots. The fight scenes would be good, but they have the same problem as the action sequences in Highschool of the Dead and Ichiban Ushiro no Daimou, they like to break up the action with fan-service scenes and use the fight scenes as a flimsy excuse to strip the protagonists. Sekirei, stop being stupid. No one is going to do that in a fight. You\'re going to aim for causing injuries, not ripping someone\'s clothes. The only way you\'re going to go for someone\'s clothes in an actual fight is if they\'ve got loose bits that you can use to pull the person to the ground or to hinder their mobility. The backgrounds are largely dull too.Don\'t expect great vocal performances in this. It\'s almost certainly a case of dull, uninspired characters having voice actors who are good, but can\'t add depth where the script calls for none. And the problem certainly isn\'t the actors. You\'ve got Hayami Saori (who was good in both Ano Hana and Sasameki Koto), Inoue Marina (who was good in Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight and Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha Strikers) but if I give examples of good performances for every voice actor this\'ll be exceedingly long. The point to take away from this little exercise is that the actors are capable, their performances in this are just bad. The music is the best part of the series. It isn\'t good, it isn\'t even mediocre, but it\'s not bad.The yuri factor is a 4/10. There are some decidedly yuri moments in this.Sekirei is terrible. The story is largely typical harem schlock and the atypical element has been done by several, vastly superior anime. The characters are a joke, the treatment of the female characters as objects to be collected is appalling. The sheer idiocy of several of the elements is headache inducing and the fan-service is just ridiculous. I will give it some credit for it\'s few funny moments and occasional good action sequence, but they certainly aren\'t worth sitting through the rest of the series to get to. Final rating 2/10. I just hope the next thing on my review request queue is better. Let me see... Sekirei: Pure Engagement. Insert as many expletives here as you like, it probably won\'t be enough. I\'m going to take a couple hours to read Gail Simone before moving on to that, but expect the review next week. they figure a harem title has a good chance of filling that role.

I mean I know the games are getting stale but jeez Nintendo, I didn\'t think they would go down the fanservice road by turning the pokemon into big boobie bouncing girls that blindly follow their masters... Oh, hold on, this isn\'t pokemon, it\'s just another generic harem ecchi show.STORY: College drop out boy meets a cute boobilicious girl and proceeds to move into a dorm with other girls of different shapes and sizes, and also begins his quest after catching his first Sekirei to become a master or something... Okay that\'s all I...got, the ""Oh it\'s exactly like those other things"" joke are lazy tiresome and a bit repetitive, but anime like this is exactly what it should only get and deserve.And Sekirei is absolutely nothing different from any ecchi anime you\'ll see, lazy characterizations? Check! Clueless and borderline retarded female lead? Check! Female lead devoting herself to the main male lead for, no joking about this here, no reason at all and despite they only just met? You know it...But, the gimmick this time to get you interested in the tittie show is this is like pokemon, as the Sekirei practiably act like mindless tools for battle and follow their master\'s demands as this ecchi anime is also a generic action anime, you know, the kind that only clothes take damage (There clothes should only be treated as a health bar before they ""faint"" apparently). Not that it\'s a terrible idea or anything, but there is an obvious marketing underside to the idea, as the girl just love to repeat what type of Sekirei they are. I\'m the fighting type! I\'m the fire type! etc, etc...The girls range from all kinds of sizes, you got you perfect woman build, the ridiculous proportioned ones, and even a loli so no pervert is left out, as there\'s enough for all. As character\'s go... The main lead is too generic to even care about, even his name escapes me (I know I can just look it up on wiki or something but why should I if generic hero of ecchi anime is a more suitable name?)  and the lead female or pokemon-Sekirei whatever has the IQ of half her breast size in centimeters, so there\'s no dodging the ""oops, I saw your panties"" jokes or ""OMG, you\'re naked!"" routines, even we get full frontial boobs in this one, but just like any other ecchi, is nothing more than cock teasing to point of saying, ""Why isn\'t this just a hentai?""All Sekirei manages to do is kill brain cells and empty wallets, well until the next tit anime comes along, and if you\'re the type to fall for it, then more power to you, because it least you\'re fueling one of the bigger budget anime producers, Aniplex, and maybe they\'ll use the money to make more Fate/whatevers or other colored Exorcists so that they can market something not as completely bland as this.ANIMATION: At least... The animation is fine, action scenes are good and the titties are... well, bouncing, so that\'s all that should matter anyway for anime like this.SOUND: I can\'t remember, it\'s forgettable to the point of amnesia. Didn\'t watch the japanese version as much as the english version, and I did check out Funimation\'s dub and it\'s underwhelming, but even Funimation knew that the effort of a good dub would be unfitting for this anime. Chuck Huber is in it as a type-casted professor so at least that\'s kind of a treat.OVERALL:The Good:+ If you\'re in it for titties, more power to ya.+ Don\'t worry, they\'re animated quite nicely.Mixed:+/- A decent idea / A gimmick used for easier marketing.The Bad:- About as deep as every generic harem you\'ve ever seen.- No memorable character, retard main female lead.- Forgettable audio, both english and japanese audio are just as lazy.I\'m not trying to talk shit here, and I know I didn\'t really give this anime a chance (Though I can get enough information from watching two episodes to write a review speaks volumes of how truly little there is offered in this anime in terms of everything but titties) and of course it\'s only about the titties and it\'s redundant to criticize the show for it, but this is almost insulting, but if you really want to watch this, try watching it with a few friends and have a blast cracking pokemon references or even do your own Mystery Science Theater 3000 commentary with this show, that\'s probably the best way to get through this the non-shameless way instead of beating off to this. got, the ""Oh it\'s exactly like those other things"" joke are lazy tiresome and a bit repetitive, but anime like this is exactly what it should only get and deserve.And Sekirei is absolutely nothing different from any ecchi anime you\'ll see, lazy characterizations?

Like I said, you've got your typical &quot;down in the dumps&quot; male, Minato, who feels like all is lost after not making it into college, but then he meets this girl who instantly connects with him. The girl turns out to be what is called a Sekirei and now Minato is involved in a...game known as the Sekirei Plan. 108 Sekirei have been let loose throughout the city, each looking for someone they adore (technical term 'Ashikabi&quot;). After most of them have found their Ashikabi, the game sets into a new development which will cause all of the Sekirei to battle with the winner receiving a prize. That prize is that the Sekirei will be able to live with their Ashikabi forever. However, judging from how the series is going, it doesn't look like we'll see any of that Sekirei Plan game in action this season (assuming they make a second season). Anyway, the good part about the story is the fact that each Ashikabi isn't limited to one Sekirei, so it'll obviously lead to some funny moments when the Sekirei fight over their Ashikabi. However, sometimes I wish that the main character, Minato, would show a little more affection as to the Sekirei he likes instead of trying to treat them all equally. =/Art &amp; Sound - The artwork isn't bad, but the females are all generally the same with a few exceptions...big breasted with long hair (with the exception being their personalities). :P The sound isn't bad either, although the OP and ED songs aren't particularly the greatest out there.Character - Well, you're bound to like someone from the show since all of the Sekirei have a unique personality. There are a lot to choose from which would make anyone enjoy the show somewhat. The development could have gone a bit smoother, if you could even pick out any development in the series, but it isn't that bad. Having a favorite character will definitely increase the chance of enjoying the show. :PEnjoyment - Well, I really like it for some odd reason. I have my favorite Sekirei (Tsukiumi), pairings I like better than others, as well as the anticipation to see what will happen next. It really comes down to if you like Ecchi, Harem, Romance series if you ask me. The action part of the show is practically a bonus for me. With that said, I, personally, really enjoy Sekirei.Overall, Sekirei is an interesting anime that will hopefully have a second season to touch base on the actual storyline of the Sekirei Plan. game known as the Sekirei Plan. 108 Sekirei have been let loose throughout the city, each looking for someone they adore (technical term 'Ashikabi&quot;).

As a french person it\'s not very easy for me.Wow!! I\'m surprise. I\'m not a ""harem with overload of fanservice"" fan, having be introduce to a lot of crappy show in that context by friends *cough*rosario-vampire*cough**cough*to-love-Ru*cough*. I watch this anime cauze I heard a lot of good comment about it. So here\'s my review...Story: You have twelve episodes to tell a good serie and sekirei had done this part almost perfectly. Cauze in that kind of show, usually, you don\'t have a big original story. The stories are classic being concentrated to provide what I call ""overload of fanservice in...every aspect""( if you understand what I mean by ""aspect""). This show broke a little bit of those rules by adding a story who has some good moment. Despite the fact that almost every character has oversized-boobs, the fanservice is everywhere, but they don\'t exagerated things, witch I think was the good move to made. Sure, there\'s always people who will complain about being a stupid show and I respectfully disagree. I\'ll explain later in the other segement.Story: 8/10 for providing a ""descent"" story for a twelve episodes show.Art: Amazing. The character are really well draw and animeted. I think there\'s some character art that are very original and beautiful. I\'m not gonna go so far in the art, cauze I\'m not very good to explain every single good things about it.Art: 9/10Sound: Here\'s where I\'m feeling more ngh. The music is typically not so good in those shows at least in my opinion, but I can undersand the choice of music and the opening doesn\'t scare the crap out of me *cough*to-love-Ru second opening*cough*.Sound: 7/10Character: Wow!! Once again, twelve episode show. I didn\'t expect to have huge character developpement in that kind of context, but at least some characters had there own personnality and you can understand almost everybody why there doing this and that. Minato never became annoying like I don\'t know...heu...*cough*Aono Tsukune*cough*. Musubi was a hot-blooded character witch I think was funny and a good move to put that. Tsukiumi was my favorite character ( and no, it\'s not because of her huge breast). I think she had the classic ""I don\'t need those inferior person"" syndrome and finally she need her Ashikabi more than everyone else, but the way it\'s handle is perfect and at that time, this can became annoying and it never does.Character: 9/10Enjoyement: God what\'s wrong with me!! I ENJOY THE SHOW!! Me, mecha-fan, there\'s must be something wrong in my mind. Verification: I still love Gundam, yes or no... yes...ouf... No seriously, I think it\'s an awesome ride and... well that\'s it... nothing more, nothing less, ""ENJOYABLE""!! Enjoyement: 9/10Overall: I\'m gonna remember that show for a long time. Because I\'m someone who search for spectacular story with something we never saw before, and the show has some flaws (like every show does) I can\'t give more than eight, but if your a ""harem"" fan or someone who simply love anime in general, take a detour on that show, it\'s worth watching and not necessarily very long.Overall: 8/10 every aspect""( if you understand what I mean by ""aspect"").

Almost all of the girls in the show have giant boobs that hang out or show major cleavage. Also they almost all have really short skirts that show panties in action scenes, or panties flash out of the blue. The male main character gets alot of attention from his Sekirei(really hot girls) that make this hot too. The thing that I think makes Sekirei awesome, though is that unlike most ecchi anime, it actuall has an awesome plot and it has awesome action and fighting. Each girl...in the show has a different power that makes the story line kick ass. Examples are controlling water, plants, wind, or just having super strength. in the show has a different power that makes the story line kick ass. Examples are controlling water, plants, wind, or just having super strength.', ""Sekirei truly suprised me. I started watching it just thinking it was going to be a pure fanservice show with a bad story (Like Queen's Blade lol) but instead I got a very enjoyable adventure. This is my first review here so I'll break each section down.Story (8)I was expecting poor plot but instead I got a story that actually really managed to get me involved. Sekirei are basically superpowered chicks and a couple of pretty boys. They select a human to form a bond with in order to bring out their full power. These humans are called Ashikabi's and for the most part seem...to be clueless guys lol. The main idea is that there's a tournament that all 108 of the Sekirei will be competing in. The winner will get to stay with their Ashikabi forever. It seems simple enough but a lot of things happen that spice the story up.Art (7)I have mixed feelings about the art because it tends to change from time to time. Some scenes look excellent while others look like they're from a diffrent show. This doesn't happen enough to make me dislike the art though.Sound (6)I'm fairly neutural when it comes to the sound. The voice acting is pretty good but the music's a bit feminine for my taste. There's nothing really wrong with that, I just wish there was more kick ass action songs lmao.Character (9)This is where Sekirei really shines. The characters are all unique and it's practically impossible to not find someone you like. The only reason I don't give the characters a perfect score is because Minato and Musubi are the least interesting of all. That could be a problem for some people since they're the main characters. On the other hand others tend to like them so it's all a matter of opinion. Tsukiumi's my favorite because I love her attitude and her powers.Enjoyment (8)It's a very amusing show. Anyone with a sense of humour will be laughing every other minute as they watch this. The action scenes are also relaly good for the most part. I just wish they had fleshed out some of the background characters a little bit more.Overall (8)Anyone who doesn't like fanservice should beware because there's plenty. It is one of the better one's however because they actually work the fanservice into the plot. All in all Sekirei's a solid anime that I'll probably end up buying on dvd. to be clueless guys lol.

I also like how the story is simple and easly understood and the fact that all the women are really hot with big brest and short skirts doesnt hurt.Ok i know this review might not be the best but this was the first time I have ever done a review so please...have mercy on me. have mercy on me.', 'This is the other type of animes (besides gory and bloody animes) that I often most likely feel like watching. This is an action-echi-comedy anime. It\'s like any other you\'ve watched (for instance Tenjou Tenge, Ikkitousen) but this one has a more ""pokemon-cath \'em style"" theme if you know what I mean. I will include full descriptions in this review because I feel that even if I spoil the story or other stuff you will enjoy this anime not because of the story specifically. Also this anime has, halfway through, explicit content, specifically: nudity. So it\'s not suitable for underage audiences.The story is pretty...much straight forward as for any of this echi animes. You know: a somewhat failure type of guy is deppressed all over something and then when he is walking home he get\'s to meet a really beautiful girl that cames out of nowhere and just after that the girl, for whatever reason, get\'s to stay in the guy\'s house"". The twist is that this girl is one of the ""Sekireis"" that the worldwide famous MBI company has let out to provoke a ""Battle Royale"" scenario between the sekireis in the city called ""New Tokyo"". Now this girls have a wide range of super powers (water, fire, psychical, etc.) and fight in order to get their wish of being with the person they love forever come true.This girls need to ""be winged"" in order to be able to use their full power, they do this by mixing their DNA with a human\'s DNA: by kissing. Now the story is set just in a like 10 year gap from the present (2019 or something like that). So most of the stuff you see on the enviroment is as just realistic as watching it anywhere else for real. Another thing that I did found different in this anime compared with others of this genre (le\'s take Ikkitousen and Tenjou Tenge) is the reason behind the fights. In Ikkitousen they just fight to ""fullfill the destiny of the magatama"" in ""Tenjou Tenge there is really no reason at all xD! Here you\'ve got better and realistic event that causes the fighting to begin.This is a Seven Arcs artistic produccion so it\'s obviously very good. The design  of the backgrounds and specially the characters is superb. The characters are very nice to watch in action and the animation doesn\'t miss almost any amount of detail in fight sequences. The space of action get\'s it\'s great dose of originality as well. The locations are often destroyed nicely and when that happens it\'s does looks realistic and it does leave a chaotic-satisfactory feeling. Another thing this anime has to deal with is the fan service issue. Yes this anime shows almost all sekireis as big breasted babes, of course there are exceptions but that is the main idea. This babes are vey teasing and seductive from time to time, so expect some hardcore echi escenes.  But even so respecting looks every single one of the characters is different from one another by some characteristic features, even so the overall body type is the same. The characters are drawn so well that you see that they are completely different in some way or another.I haven\'t got much to say about to say about the sound. The opening and ending themes are a bit gilrlish, but then again it all comes down if they fit the theme or not, well.. at the end they do. Voice acting is a important factor in an anime too. Well in here the voice acting is superb: love Tsukiumi\'s voice (love everything about her really) and Karasuba\'s as well (lol the voice talent is the same as Hitsugaya Toushirou and Elric Edward). The sound is nice and complements this anime making it a great listening experience.Now the characters are amazing and have very different behaviors. I\'m in love with the beautiful blond, short-tempered and violent Tsukiumi, I fancy the peaceful, determined and voluptuous Musubi and definitely want the perverted, seductive and smart Matsu. Even the secondary characters or just those that only appear in one or two episodes have a great amount of detail respecting looks and personality so you\'ll be willing to see more of those characters even if they don\'t show up anymore on the storyline. You will definitely feel symphaty for the vast majority of the cast and even get attached to them.If there is something perfect about this anime, leaving aside the artistic design, I\'ve got to say that the enjoyment impact that acomplishes on the viewer is somewhat different from another aspects this anime offers. The enjoyment factor is high quality and I don\'t know about other people but I\'m really anxious and looking forward for the OVA and the second season. Why? Well because I did greatly enjoy it. If you are not a echi fan and are only used to watch animes with elaborate stories and difficult scripts then definitely this one is not for you, as you will see the story as lame and with no sense at all. But if you\'re looking for fun, great, sexy looking characters and no great complications in storyline issues then this is one anime you should seriously considering watching. much straight forward as for any of this echi animes.

That much is glaringly self-evident. I have no problem with that genre, honest, but this anime was not for me. I dropped it after seeing more than half of it, but I know the rest of the plot by reading spoilers.I noticed that a reviewer named ""Chasekun"" compared Sekirei to Fate/stay night. All I have to say in response to that is...""Are you nuts?! Have you actually SEEN Fate/stay night before, Chasekun?!""The two couldn\'t be more different. While, yes, there is a very superficial similarity in the ""Masters/Ashikabi with Servants/Sekirei"" dynamic and that...there is fighting between Servants/Sekirei. But that\'s it. Fate/stay night is far, far deeper and much more thought-provoking, especially the original visual novel— the anime adaptation is quite lackluster in comparison to the VN, but even the anime of Fate/stay night has much more substance to it than Sekirei. Interesting and well-developed characters and actual character development, dynamic plot (the VN actually has three different routes/stories each with multiple paths), actually well-thought-out mechanics for things like magic (this reviewer thinks so, anyways), etc.; I could go on but that isn\'t the point of this review.Sekirei, on the other hand...Story: Poor. There\'s not really much of a story here when you look past the feeble attempts at establishing a plot. It\'s pretty much exactly what is written (or rather, drawn) on the box. As I\'m sure you\'ve read in other reviews, it\'s basically an excuse to have 100+ super-powered chicks duke it out—oh, two or three of the Sekirei are bishounen instead. The story is written to basically allow for the premise of ""big titty aliens with superpowers in a battle harem, inexplicably having fallen in love with a completely unremarkable spineless loser (lol, only in anime can this happen), beating the crap out of other big titty aliens with superpowers for an arbitrary reason"". That may seem harsh, but it\'s literally what the story is when you sift through all the padding put in place to make it seem like there is actually something there.Art: Mediocre. I\'m kind of spoiled by series with far better artwork now, though, so I\'m not impressed, can\'t help that. Also, I tend to like more realism in character designs, rather than the style of ""impossibly wide hips, huge butts, and massive boobs"". Also, there is something about their faces that just feels wrong to me... I think it\'s the eyes.Sound: Fair. Nothing groundbreaking or amazing. Voices are decent, at least in the Japanese version (I\'m not sure if there is a dubbed version of this yet, nor am I really inclined to find out). Essentially, nothing I didn\'t already expect, but that isn\'t a bad thing, exactly.Character: Poor. Characters are pretty much static cliches meant to be the carriers of tropes commonly seen in harem anime. Let\'s see... the main male character is more of a pathetic weenie than Keitaro of Love Hina, and not even nearly as noticeable or amusing as him; he\'s just sort of... there. Main female character is... hmm, ""empty headed"" is the best way to describe her; she\'s one of those vapid ""I don\'t have \'common sense\' so I sound like a moron when I ask questions about things that should be self-evident to any normal person"" types. After her we have a scary onee-san landlady (probably one of the most interesting characters in the story), psuedo-playboy but not really bishounen Sekirei, amiable tomboy lesbian sekirei (also one of the most interesting characters, and not because she\'s lesbian, mind you), lazy pervert bum guy and his twin tsundere lightning sekirei, token loli sekirei, lecherous old man type big titty hacker sekirei, possessive violent tsundere sekirei, sensual stripper older woman bottle fairy sekirei, bloodthirsty insane sword sekirei, main character\'s weird perverted somewhat domineering little sister and her shota dark-is-not-evil sekirei, his domineering smoker researcher mom, batshit crazy mega-corporation head, and many more largely irrelevant characters.Enjoyment: Poor. Personally, I prefer stories that are actually substantial and not a flimsy cover for a ecchi fanservice harem situation. I like stories where the characters are actually modeled like real people with dynamic moods and personalities, and not essentially one-dimensional harem tropes designed for the sole purpose of ecchi comedy. I like stories that engage me intellectually and make me think, not mindless perversion barely hidden behind a cobbled-together plot.Overall: Decent, actually. While I didn\'t finish it, I didn\'t exactly hate it. I didn\'t like it either. In the end, it does what it set out to do—provide ecchi comedy—pretty well. However, I\'m not exactly interested in something lacking this much substance, since I\'m a thinking type of guy. Basically? If you want to just sit back, veg, and watch something ecchi that doesn\'t require much thought and has lots of girls with big tits and butts? Sekirei is for you. If you want to watch something that actually requires you to pay attention to the story because it has an involved plot, with developed characters?

An interesting aspect of it is the high degree...of faithfulness to the manga it's derived from, to the point of the viewer, by the end of the series, be able to pick up the subsequent manga volume and read it without major issues.Art:The art doesn't manage to impress, but the quality is very consistent throughout, and it's very hard to perceive poorly made moments due to low budget. The battle animations and choreography are, however, better than one would expect from a series of this scope, and it also gives fans who come in from the manga interesting details on each Sekirei's powers.Sound:The intro and outro songs fit the mood of the content, the background music is good but not outstanding. On the other hand, voice acting is a very catching aspect of it, with a couple higher profile actresses(namely Marina Inoue and Paku Romi, both usually typecast for bold female and young male roles). Since most of the comedy comes from the interaction of the main cast with itself, thiswas a central part of the production which was not overlooked.Character:As a typical harem series, most of the humor is derived from the eccentric and fixed personalities of the main characters, and most of the character development focuses on the protagonist, and is quite a small amount. Most of the Sekirei only change their reactions significantly shortly after and during the process of being winged, and remain unchanged after that.Overall:Sekirei is a good series, with a sufficiently fast pace that will keep most people hooked. It's leaving a lot of fans with hopes for future seasons, even though I personally find the possibility to be unlikely. It offers a small twist to the harem genre having the combat aspects and multiple masters with small harems of their own, and has been likened to Pokemon by many.

It is definitely a classic harem anime in the sense that we know the main character is not going to pick any of the girls due to his demeanor and the circumstances surrounding the plot. I personally dropped this anime after episode 3 the first time I attempted to watch it. However, after a couple months, I came back to it and it has grown on me, very much so.For as infamous as this show is for it\'s very frequent nudity, big-breasted sex-appeal women, and emphasis on Ecchi, Seikirei does actually have...a very fascinating plot and setting which balances out its constant innuendos. The Sekirei concept in itself feels much like a mixture of Pokémon, The Hunger Games, and The Running Man all weaved into one (with a lot of drama and ""slice of life"" atmosphere thrown in). The plot has a fair amount of good action and enough of an actual story line of depth to yank it from the category of an anime that is ""just being an Ecchi for ecchi\'s sake"" but not enough to make it more about the story either. So it balances itself quite nicely.The plot and concept/constructs of the story are nicely thought out and explained adequately as the story unfolds (at some point, a confusion you may be having will always be addressed). The whole concept of the Sekireis, Ashikabis, the Disciplinary Squad, and government structure of the Sekirei project offer a depth that matches many ""fair"" anime adventure series (I say ""fair"" because the plot is well-done/laid out, but also isn\'t flat-out amazing either).Minato Sahashi, the male lead and protagonist, in my opinion, is the show\'s weakest point. Much like Yusuke Takasaki from the infamous anime: Green Green (but not AS bad), he is a very tasteless character that kind of just has to be there for the plot\'s sake and structure.  By season 2, he grows a small bit and I probably accepted him more than in the first season due to the simple factor of time.The Sekirei, for the most part, are what make this anime interesting. Their personality differences as well as their constant fighting to be Minato\'s one love, is highly comical and at times, super sweet (when they get a moment to themselves with him).For me personally, Musubi and Tsukiumi are my favorite players in this anime drama. They both have very much potential (in my personal opinion) as showing quality traits of girls I personally would love to marry (Musubi more than Tsukiumi). This aspect is definitely one of the more core reasons I like this anime. The loyalty and dedication of Minato\'s Sekirei to their Ashikabi, is quite beautiful and romantic/""wifely"" if you let it be.  Attaching to a character will definitely help you ride out the entire show MUCH better.The art and sound are nothing to write home about but are good enough that they don\'t distract from the characters and plot at hand.  The opening theme to both seasons of the show are very well-done in terms of music.To conclude, a statement I once heard vulgarly put to describe this show was: ""it\'s like Pokémon, except with big-titted women."" Though that statement in the raw sense is true, yes....the show is definitely more than that. It isn\'t a flat-out amazing show, but most of the characters are quite interesting and you can definitely get attached to them. Overall: Good plot/setting/story, funny comedy, mostly all likable characters (a few I can\'t stand), very well-done opening theme song, and exciting super powered action when it\'s around. Sekirei is definitely a decent anime for the genre-mix it is trying to be.(Warning: Season 2 ends on a ""to be continued"" cliff-hanger and Season 3 will probably never be created/released to conclude the story, due to a few reasons you can research yourself. With this in mind, just realize that you won\'t get closure if you decide to get into this anime.) a very fascinating plot and setting which balances out its constant innuendos.

One day, as he is walking through the city, a random girl just happens to land on him in midst of a battle. Thus, the start of a weird ""adventure."" One by one, he meets more of these weird girls that become known as Sekirei....Sekirei are forced to fight the other Sekirei in order to prevail victorious in order to spend all of eternity with their Ashikabi, or their loved one.  However, the only thing that really happened was Minato randomly running into new girls, ""conquering"" them, and thats pretty much it. If you only want to see boobs and other ecchi stuff, I would say shoot for Sekirei.Art: The art in my opinion was a little annoying. I hated seeing the character designs as something just didnt feel right about them. Normally, a harem anime (in my opinion) should have at least cute girls in them. The poor designs were just a major pain to watch.Sound: Although the voice cast was good, I absolutely couldn\'t stand Minato\'s voice both in Japanese and the Dubbed version. He sounded so nasaly and useless that it made me want to bang my head on the keyboard repeatedly. The rest of the people sounded very exhausted and not very enthusiastic about the characters.Character: It\'s something we have seen in almost every harem genre: a useless male lead with many supposedly cute girls fall for him for either his kindness or just random reason. In this case, they love him for his kindness (i think). Each Sekirei have their own ability/ power, such as controlling plants or water.I remember when I was watching this, I wondered why I was making myself go through that kind of torture.

The anime is also a uncensored ecchi anime, not just stopping at ripped clothing but actually taking it to revealing nipples (gasp). The parts I really like is the well done artwork and soundtracks...sound in general.Story 8/10: Honestly, this is a really good rating for something you see almost everyday...a harem anime. If it wasn\'t done as well as this one, I\'d probably would have dropped the anime and will not be writing this review. The anime takes the generic harem anime and added the creative Sekirei to it. Sekirei...is a humanoid alien life form each specializing in combat (not so unique, right?). Here\'s the thing; the story actually explains where these girls and cuuute boys...well..boy came from. These Sekirei must find their ""fated"" Ashikabi (spoiler, not all of them meet their fated one, sad face) and then participate in a battle royale to decide the one that will remain with her/his Ashikabi. This is creative.Art 10/10: If i was male, i\'d be nosebleeding all over the place. This anime does it\'s artwork well. It is a fanservice ecchi anime, and it shows it with very ""sexy"" shots and angles at pretty ladies and even have a little something for the female watchers too (theres not much though). The combat scenes seems fluid and natural, with vibrant colors (well, as vibrant as you can get in mostly dark settings) and brilliant animation. I really liked the explosions and theres plenty in this anime. Everything down to the flames and cherry petals are well drawn and animated. I do complain about the insane breast size though...geez.Sound 10/10: I love the sound system for Sekirei. The voice actors are well chosen...especially for Sahashi Minato. He actually sounds like the wimpy little -beep- that he is! On a more serious note, the soundtracks fits well with the animation and adds a little something to the anime. When a character is introduced, the soundtrack that plays really matches the personality of the character, and the combat music adds spice to the awesome action already there. I personally seeked out and downloaded them after i finished the anime.Character 6.5/10 (5 and above and you round up): Excellent anime! And then we have character. We hate the word, dont we? My one big complaint about the anime; and from what i\'ve seen, many others; is the wimpy main character. To be honest, i really dont see what he has going for him beside a ""kind"" if not suicidal personality. The worse thing is, he doesn\'t change either, throughout the season. The one thing that is boosting the score for character is the MC\'s sister, who act realistically and is very likable. Also, each other character in the supporting cast is explored quite well. (Spoiler: Seriously? Getting 100% right on a test that is made harder than the entrance exam effortlessly, and you screw it up when you take the real thing... theres a limit on how much being nervous can mess with your abilities, you know!)Enjoyment 9/10: I love the anime. The fact the MC is a total idiot does dampen the enthusiasm a bit, but overall, it\'s a great anime. If you dont mind/like the ecchi and fanservice, you\'ll find the anime to be quite the attention grabber. It also has a high rewatch value, because the scenes and artwork are so well done.

If the anime continues beyond Pure Engagement, I would love to continue watching.', ""While the concept for a good anime was here, it was very poorly implemented. It had a feel on paper as being like a harem-eske version of the Fate series in terms of battles taking place across an entire city landscape. However, the environment that was used was very limited, with the majority of everything happening at the plot characters central hub.Another major problem was the characters themselves. While the main appeal of the characters was that they were all very clevagey (minus the little sister cliche), inevitably viewers want to learn more about the characters themselves. Because of the small episode count, it...makes sense that there wouldn't be a lot of time to learn about the characters in order to make way for the central plot. However, the majority of this anime takes place in the introduction stages, meaning that after all the main characters are introduced, the anime is halfway over, leaving absolutely no time for character development at all! Even during the episodes where there was growth to be made, it was simply written off and moved passed. And all of this time spent moving past important details led to one minor plot arc about characters who were never even introduced and you never really care about.This anime's biggest problem, however, was that it had so many plot holes. First of all, it is implemented that the powers of the characters can be increased, leaving an idea that a meaningful moment between the characters can change the tide of battle, allowing them to discover a new way to fight. This idea is used only by a minor character, and only like twice! Even when a fighting character did make progress that would seem to make the battle progress, the developments resulted in no change.

There are characters that are introduced as possible villains to over come but are never actually met. And there is supposed to be some overrunning plot with the stories main villain, but is never elaborated on. The biggest kick to the groin is how the anime ends with a very unsatisfying conclusion that just brings up more questions rather than answers.If your looking for an anime about women with huge chests fight, this anime for you.... I can't even say that it's even for those people either. Thats the only reason that this anime is getting a score at all. I'm a guy, I like that sort of thing. But I'm also an anime reviewer now, and this has more in common with a bad porn than an anime. I give this anime a 3/10. now i'm gonna go wash away my shame. makes sense that there wouldn't be a lot of time to learn about the characters in order to make way for the central plot. However, the majority of this anime takes place in the introduction stages, meaning that after all the main characters are introduced, the anime is halfway over, leaving absolutely no time for character development at all! Even during the episodes where there was growth to be made, it was simply written off and moved passed. And all of this time spent moving past important details led to one minor plot arc about characters who were never even introduced and you never really care about.This anime's biggest problem, however, was that it had so many plot holes. First of all, it is implemented that the powers of the characters can be increased, leaving an idea that a meaningful moment between the characters can change the tide of battle, allowing them to discover a new way to fight. This idea is used only by a minor character, and only like twice! Even when a fighting character did make progress that would seem to make the battle progress, the developments resulted in no change.

This anime is just rediculous by all counts, but as long as you don't take it seriously, every episode is so much fun and has tons of ecchi to boot. I can't WAIT for season 2!That's pretty much it. You can't...really review a story when there really isn't a decent one. haha! really review a story when there really isn't a decent one. haha!"", ""Sekirei is actually a pretty generic show in terms of plot, characters, story, and art.  The ecchi and harem aspect can immediately put people off.  With those things in mind, this is by far one of my most favorite hidden gems in anime that i've found.b-b-b-but you gave its a 7??  Yes i did, that's b/c the anime isn't finished; there are two seasons and many rumors about a third.  This is also the first anime that has made me pick up the manga.  If the story were complete, or at least if there were more episodes, this would get...a 9 from me.Sekirei is about a game played in a large metropolitan city with humanoids (mainly females) having strange abilities that go around battling one another trying to find an ashkabi (mainly male) for them to latch onto and battle for/protect.  Its like a giant battle royal with wild fight scenes and an enormous depth of back story.What makes Sekirei unique is how well its executed, the characters, while largely generic fit perfectly with the setting and context of the game, and there are many different types of characters that surround the MC, alot of them are very powerful.  It makes for an exciting dynamic.  The anime is almost a SoL though, as it doesn't really take off into crazy town until the second season, but i found that it kept me wanting more and more and more.  After each episode the show just got better and better.  the progression was almost perfect.There are some drawbacks however, namely the MC is a pussy.  What makes this even slightly tolerable is that there is a very slow progression to his character and while he is often aloof, naive, shy and stuttering, he isn't a sniveling, groveling weakling that just makes you hate his guts.There's also a fair amount of ecchi with tits and red faces popping up in almost every episode.  It isn't Highschool DxD level, but there's no doubt they are catering to the fanservice crowd.  Thankfully it doesn't really get in the way, as most of the fanservice scenes serve multiple purposes to further the character development or the plot.Even with the individual elements being somewhat generic, the way their are positioned makes the show particularly unique and especially interesting.  I've watched my fair share of animu, this is one of those shows that really grabbed my attention from the start and never let me down.  And generic works to make the characters relate-able and interesting early and b/c of this its very easy for them to break their mold and surprise the viewers.If you can handle some ecchi and are looking to be thoroughly entertained, can't do much better than Sekirei, it has a little bit of everything without being overbearing. a 9 from me.Sekirei is about a game played in a large metropolitan city with humanoids (mainly females) having strange abilities that go around battling one another trying to find an ashkabi (mainly male) for them to latch onto and battle for/protect.

Often when the average fan comes upon a show where ecchi is front and center, most shrug it off as nothing more than a titsfest with nothing of value. But look at a classic like Tenchi Muyo, or the modern day classic Highschool DxD. While both are ecchi and contain harems often fighting for a single guy's attention, both have a lot more to offer with their unique plots and set-ups. Sekirei is no different.The story itself was somewhat unique for its time, 108 Sekirei's are...loosed into the city of Tokyo to find their Ashikabi so they may compete in the Sekirei Plan, where Sekirei fight Sekirei to become the last one standing. Sekirei are lifeforms that are like humans, but are given special powers like the ability to control water or lighting, extreme strength, or masterful skills with a sword. Ashikabi are their masters who can help give them power in a fight against another Sekirei.This free for all battle style has become increasing popular since the airing of Sekirei, especially with the popularity spike in the Fate series. This kind of set up allows for serious stakes and suspense. As the Sekirei Plan progresses throughout the story, the walls begin to close in around the characters forcing more and more frequent combat. This tension really makes it compelling to watch. But at the center of the action, there is a very human story about relationships and loving ones close to you.Minato is the main character, who is pretty bland in all honesty. If it weren't for Joel McDonald's unique voice and great performance, he would be even more forgettable. This is rather unfortunate, as the series I mentioned in the first paragraph both have fairly memorable protagonists. Where the characters really shine in this series are the girls themselves. Musubi, Tsukiumi, Matsu, and little Kusano are where you'll find the majority of entertainment and comedy. Their designs are extremely attractive and personalities distinct albeit a bit cliche at times. Tsukiumi is the clear standout, with Lydia MacKay offering an outstanding performance using Shakespearean English in the place of the classic Japanese Tsukiumi uses in the Japanese version. Despite their massive differences, these four begin to develop a sisterhood that is fun to watch grow throughout the season. On the other side of the aisle with the villains, Minaka is a fun and often hilarious foil to our heroes. He is the Game Master, and wants nothing more than the Sekirei Plan to come to fruition. This makes the peril of the main cast nothing more than entertainment for him, which makes him deliciously fun.I loved the idea of Sekirei finding their Ashikabi. The author used the Red String of Fate trope to connect Sekirei and their Ashikabi. They are destined to find one another. But, the whole concept of Sekirei also helps legitimizes the harem itself. What I mean by that is Sekirei are completely ok with their Ashikabi having more than one Sekirei. Usually harems get messy and fall into the tired cliches of fighting over the guy and in the end only one girl gets him. This is a genuine breath of fresh air to those of us who love the harem genre. I think it's also one of the key hooks Sekirei has over other harem series.For sound, the music is passable with a number of upbeat piano pieces, but the real draw is the outstanding English dub. Alexis Tipton, Lydia MacKay, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Monica Rial, Chuck Huber, and Joel McDonald all have terrific performances. Huber's wackiness and MacKay's gorgeous voice are the clear standouts.Visually, Sekirei has this distinct art style that I find really attractive. You really can't find it anywhere else, and you can almost immediately recognize almost any frame and know that it's Sekirei. Going back to what I said about the character designs earlier, they are really stellar for the Sekirei themselves. Each one is unique and attractive. the Ashikabi on the other hand are pretty bland, but I honestly believe it's intentional to help separate regular humans and Sekirei. The quality of ecchi was also really top notch for this one. The hi-jinks were fun and sexy, keeping you glued to the screen.The animation isn't too bad either, there are a few action scenes that have much improved movement while the ecchi scenes have plenty of jiggle. Other than that, most scenes are pretty basic for its time. The action itself was intense and had some great choreography for certain fights. I don't think I can think of one fight that disappoints.The enjoyment I got out of this series initially was 10 because back when I first saw it, I was just getting into anime outside of Naruto and Dragonball Z. Back then, the action mixed with perversion blew my mind. I happened to re-watch it recently for old times sake, which is what prompted this review, and I can safely say I still enjoy it to this day.Sekirei is a story of love. A story of fighting for what you love. And while some of it may tread familiar ground, it throws in enough unique elements and legitimacy for an actual harem to make it a real stand out in the genre. Sekirei will always hold a special place in my heart as it helped guide me into the wonderful world of anime. And thanks to its excellent designs, unique story, and lovable characters, I'm sure Sekirei will hold a special place in the heart anime community as well. loosed into the city of Tokyo to find their Ashikabi so they may compete in the Sekirei Plan, where Sekirei fight Sekirei to become the last one standing.

The close bonds they develop live in the shadow of an end that there can only be one left standing. Another thing this series does an outstanding job with is the handle on the young female character. Many series hyper-sexualize young women. Sekirei doesn't make this mistake. Instead, Ku is one of the most adorable and tasteful characters you will ever meet in an anime. The MC is a loser. So, nothing special there. And the formal blonde is...a bit over the top. I feel like they could have expressed her personality by turning that dial to a good 7 instead of 10. It's worth mentioning that Sekirei is loaded with great fanservice. The soundtrack isn't too memorable. The art is nothing insane, but it's still great. The biggest problem with this series for me was the reason they are in this terrible position. The whole time you'll feel like their circumstances being the result of someone's entertainment is just a bit off. Just seems like they could have played that hand a bit better.

Yes this series is ecchi, yes it is comedy, yes it is romance, and yes it is fighting all which of which are pretty appealing aspects to guys out there.Story- Okay I couldn\'t have given this series a good review had I not been told there would be a second season. The reason why has a lot to do with the fact that very little was actually accomplished...during the first season so much as it was set up i.e- suspense! but I\'m getting ahead of myself. The story for this series is nothing new to people who have watched at least ten or twenty anime series in their time boy meets girl girl meets boy blah blah relationship builds blah blah harem scheme blah blah you get the idea, its something we\'ve all seen before but yet are still willing to watch to see if they add some variation (which is one of the three keys to anime either being a success or being a big flop)Art- I felt that this series was decently well drawn and pretty well animated the water looked amazing (okay not like OMG that looks like real freaking water amazing but wow that looks realistic amazing). Characters and actions other such things are drawn well (oversized boobs...apparently hard to animate but they got pretty close to what I think would be a realistic bounce just my opinion though). So art yeah good.Sound- Okay I looooved the voice acting in this series I loved how the character\'s voices matched and I mean really matched them so well, Minato\'s voice was by far the only one that actually bothered me. I loved the sounds sequence and sound effects so on this one a thumbs up.Characters- Okay yeah the cast of characters was pretty generic I mean I have seen all the character types before (snobby, brainy, loser, energetic, twins, loli, tough guy, psychopaths, villains, and perverts) but still you got love how each character\'s personality matched their body and voice type so well not to mention that each character tended to actually have some aspects that threw you for a surprise in the end (you\'ll know what I mean when you watch).Enjoyment- Okay so I actually enjoyed this series I know for a fact I\'ll like the next season better because they\'ll be more story development but hey the first season is what it should be in my opinion (setting you up for the next season). One thing I did not enjoy was the censorship there is one episode that is uncensored (I will not say which so that way if you want to know you have to actually find and watch it hehe) even I\'ll admit I was slightly happy to see an uncensored episode; honestly they were just censoring it to piss somebody off (the couldn\'t you have just done that in the first place bell rang up when I actually saw the scene). On a second note though it made me a little sad when I saw it because one of favorite things about censorship is knowing that somewhere out there there is a guy just screaming ""SHOW ME THE BOOBIES ALREADY"" or letting out a disapointed sigh ""That censorship is a bitch""at the screen.Overall- I recommend this series to you 1 if you like comedy 2 if you don\'t mind a little mediocre generic action 3 you like ecchi. It\'s a good series and I\'m expecting better things from the second season where I hope they will answer some of my unanswered question.

Ciao!', ""I am normally not a fan of harem animes because they typically leave the viewer without a conclusion. Sekirei was very unique to me because it presented a situation in which it was almost okay for the male MC to have a harem. Yes, most of the girls in his harem would have liked to have had him exclusively theirs, so those feelings remain. However, the status of all harem members is clear to all, and they're all better off for being in his harem--quite unique if you ask me.Basically, this was one of the most acceptable harems I've ever seen, and wish...they would continue the series. The manga is even better.Additionally, the action scenes are pretty awesome, and the underlying plot was good.The clincher for me was that this is a harem that seems to have actual elements of romance in it. The girls all are obvious about their feelings for him, but the male actually isn't a clueless, emotionally unavailable tsundere. He actually does show to each of them that he cares about them as individuals.  That's valuable to me in a harem anime.The people who hate this anime simply confuse me.

Problem is that the second season is taking too long to appear and the end of the first season was a little to cliff hang-ery-didy-didly-something.ANYWAYS,I give this anime, SO FAR, 9/10. A great series worthy of continuation. "", 'I think that this anime can be summed up in two words, ""cliched Harem""Although the general concept of this anime is pretty clear-cut, I had found it to be a rather enjoyable series. The fan service in this series is a bit over the top.  In near every battle it seems that someone is gonna lose thier shirt. I still have yet to figure out why no scratches are left behind from the shredding.Story:  The overalll plot of the story is kind of original. I mean how many other anime feature a battle royal between  108 Busty women? I don\'t want to...give away spoilers but there seems to be way too many loose ends at the end of the series. hopefully the sequel is able to answer most.  6/10Art: This is one area of the anime that excelled. Fluid animations, bright vibrant settings, good detailing. 9/10Sound: OP and ED were rather nice and had a fair relevance to the series. Battle Sound Effects were average. The Seiyu (voice actors) were a perfect match for their character.  9/10Character: Sadly one of the more disappointing aspects of the series. In a cliched harem the chartacters are well... cliched. The same character personalities can be seen in any other anime of the genre. There is no originality. Another aspect in which this anime was lacking was in character developement.  There are soo many characters to be introduced to in this series that not one of them gets enough time for decent character buildup. 5/10Enjoyment: I must say that this was a enjoyable series. I\'m a sucker for the comedy-romance genre and as the last episode came around I ended up wanting more.  8/10Overall: 7/10 give away spoilers but there seems to be way too many loose ends at the end of the series. hopefully the sequel is able to answer most.  6/10Art: This is one area of the anime that excelled.

The Seiyu (voice actors) were a perfect match for their character.  9/10Character: Sadly one of the more disappointing aspects of the series. In a cliched harem the chartacters are well... cliched. The same character personalities can be seen in any other anime of the genre. There is no originality. Another aspect in which this anime was lacking was in character developement.  There are soo many characters to be introduced to in this series that not one of them gets enough time for decent character buildup. 5/10Enjoyment: I must say that this was a enjoyable series. I\'m a sucker for the comedy-romance genre and as the last episode came around I ended up wanting more.  8/10Overall: 7/10', ""Robert's Too Late Reviews here for the big fight! As always I am reviewing the dubbed version though I will admit that I watched the subbed version first, and will be making small comments on differences I noticed between the two. Primarily though, we're rolling off the dub. I found the title mildly entertaining with some interesting characters, enough for a 'well if you've got nothing better' recommendation, but far from a 'Must Watch Anime' ranking. Some of the concepts are a little convoluted, and with the potential of 108 characters, some cast members get the metaphorical shaft, but it's still alright. Let's get this...pact in motion!Story 6:Basically the titular Sekirei are aliens/special humans/something *else* that are found in a spaceship like place on a secret island. For reasons not explained, the guy that found them is given authority over them to the point he devises a game where they must all fight each other to the death and the one winner is allowed to stay with her human partner. Oh, and that's another alien caveat, these Sekirei, to develop their superpowers fully, must be kissed by a human. Though it is shown in the series that it does NOT have to be the case, these humans are supposed to be special to the Sekirei and inspire feelings in them. There are a few humans (ashikabi they are termed) that go around kissing every unclaimed Sekirei they can find, and I cannot believe all of those Sekirei have 'feelings' for this 'collector'. But in best terms, Sekirei are supposed to find their 'destined ones.'Now since Japan has a long standing history with the number 108 (the stars of destiny, so on) there are 108 Sekirei. Obviously this would be a LONG show if every single one of them got any focus or screen time at all. Most of them are shown as being defeated and some of them don't even get their numbers mentioned, leaving us with a far more manageable number of cast members. Here's where one of my big rubs comes in, especially in the subbed version, but remains annoying in the dub: names. Let's check some of the character names: Musubi, Matsu, Minato, Miya, Minaka, Mitshua, Mutsu, yeah, ENOUGH WITH THE DAMN 'M's! And a fair amount of them are important characters, the primary Sekirei, the Main Character, and the Main Villain all have 'M' names. Was one reason I rewatched the dub, because I couldn't keep the subtitled names straight. It can be very confusing.The second and most obvious issue to deal with is nudity. There are moments of bare breasts throughout the series, and of course they are all the size of Goodyear blimps. I'm not anti-boob by ANY means, I'm actually quite the fan, but this show could have been done without any explicit nippleage (is that a word?) and kept the 'sexy' feel. A character that appears late in season one and is prominent in season two is named Kazehana (yes no 'M' name!) and she is double stacked. But throughout season one she never once is topless, and I still credit her for having sex appeal. Sometimes not showing the goodies can be as sexy as the full monty, or for sure toplessness. I'm not throwing any derision on any reviewer on this site, but I think that youth and nudity might have meshed together to give this anime a bit higher rating that it might otherwise warrant. I know being middle aged puts me a bit older than the average anime viewer, but at my age, nipples aren't as mystifying and fun as they used to be. A toning down of the sexual aspects would not have hurt the primary focus of the show (action and fighting) at all.The primary thrust of the story is the hapless guy gaining at first one, and then several (because you can't be an anime protagonist if you ain't a playa!) Sekirei to rally under his banner. He also like many protagonists, has no real interest in this whole 'Sekirei Plan' that the 'Game Master' (the guy who found the alien ship way back when) has developed for the creatures to fight to the death. Main Character is just cool hanging with his girls trying to keep them from killing each other, and just living life. The plan is forced on him, as always, and he slowly becomes involved. In fact his involvement even nets him a little like 10 year old Sekirei who can make plants grow (think Poison Ivy level power) who decides he's her big brother, but fights with the other girls about who his 'true' wife is.As the plan presses in harder and harder, and it looks like combat is unavoidable, the MC meets another ashikabi with a Sekirei that does not have combat prowess that seeks to flee the city (which is being used as the Sekirei's battleground, and hence fleeing is forbidden). MC decides, because he's a cool guy, to help this hapless Sekirei and her guy to get to safety because everyone should have the right to live their lives with the ones they love, right? So they set out to spring those two, and that consumes the second half of the season. Battles will be fought, sacrifices will be made, computers will be hacked, and only time will tell if the lovelorn Sekirei and her ashikabi make it out of town, and subsequently out of the Sekirei Plan (of fighting to the death).The action of the show is pretty good, I enjoyed the fights, and the stylings of the fights. The first Sekirei the MC obtains is a fistfighter and she kicks all kinds of ass. He also has one that's a hacker, who does not fight in any physical sense but has the SWEETEST computer setup in her room. God I'd die for a setup like that! She's super smart but willing to leave the bunker when the situation calls for it. There's the little girl I mentioned and her ability to grow and retract plants at will. She's just adorable, as there is a somewhat sexual connotation in being a Sekirei, and he *does* kiss this little girl, albeit accidentally, and instigated by her, herself, but she's innocent in all other ways, and doesn't carry the 'vavavoom' that the others do. I was worried at first because....well, I've seen things in anime. Terrible things heh.Story wise we're pretty good until the last episode. There's a twist surrounding the first Sekirei we and the MC meets that doesn't work very well for me, but it is what it is, and it becomes even more important in season 2 (which we will review later). But other than that, the story is serviceable, if not slightly predictable. I say give it a watch.Art: 8I thought everything looked good. The boobs do get out of control here and there, but that's endemic to damn near every anime with large breasted women. Doubly so if we're going to see those breasts bare. Every now and then I think I'd like to see an adult rated show where the biggest of the cast is a 'C' cup or something, just for a bit of reality. I know anime is fantasy, but not every man's fantasy is juggs so big they have their own gravity. Believe it or not, some men (and women) take fancy in smaller or even average sized breasts. That's why porn has everything from blimps to bumps, because what appeals to one person or group doesn't appeal to them all. Other than my titty rant here, the art was pretty nice. Each Sekirei has a very distinct style, both in 'fighting uniform' and in 'street clothes'. They are easily identified, and easy to keep up with. There is a Sekirei who is experiencing, let's say, body changes, and though somewhat subtle, those are easy to notice, but not over done. Tone down the boob blimps, and we'd really be set!Sound: 6HUGE knock here. In the Japanese, Tsukiumi the water Sekirei and the last to join the harem this season speaks normally. She's a little arrogant, and demands that she should be afforded the position of 'first wife' and so on, but other than being snotty, speaks like everyone else. In English, I kid you not, she says 'thee' and 'thou' and 'mayest' and bullshit like that. She still keeps up the 'first/true wife' thing, but while using pseudo Old English while she does it. IT. IS. INFURIATING. In the sub, she was a badass, beautiful, powerful, but slightly arrogant character. Worked very well. In the dub she's powerful, beautiful, and speaks like a complete moron. Doesn't work so well. Everyone else's voices were very well done, but I cannot complain enough about 'thee' Tsukiumi.Of note, Kusano's voice was really great, Jamie Marchi who I always enjoy, does the voice of the Veiled Sekirei Uzume (friends with, but not associated with the MC). Another favorite Monica Rial does the mysterious Miya, and finally worth mentioning Brittney Karbowski does lightning twin Hikari as well. None of these fine actresses are overly apparent in their roles, so it's not sticking out like a sore thumb like the voices in some shows are. Overall the entire voice cast works well in the dub. I don't have enough experience to make the same statement about the subbed version, but they had all had a very distinct and fitting sound for their characters as well. Took me a few episodes to get used to the dub because I imagined the Japanese voices for the characters and some of the English ones were a BIT different! Great work all around though.The music is acceptable. The opening theme works, though it was nothing to get me excited over. However, the closing theme, them funky beats, I was all over that! I loved the ending theme just so much. It makes my 'play without watching' list!Punches, kicks, destruction, background all sounded fine, but as I always say, kinda hard to mess those up. Even if you blow the punches and kicks and fight sounds, some idiot (I mean me) will think you're paying homage to old Bruce Lee/Hollywood martial arts exploitative films. So yeah, I liked what I heard.Character: 7There are some good characters, really. We have a lot of boilerplate, predictable types, we have a handful that are nothing more than racks for the huge tits, but we do have some compelling ones. The MC and his burgeoning group of girls end up at a boarding house with a very beautiful hostess running it. She's all find until she says something authoritative and while she smiles, a picture of a super scary demon (tengu?) mask appears beside her and freaks everyone out. They all walk away talking about how scary she is when she's mad. Otherwise she's this pretty woman of the proper age to be the house mother. She has a secret however, as she's HIGHLY trained in martial arts and swordfighting, and no reason for why is ever given. Foreshadowing maybe? Hmm...The Veiled Sekirei is very interesting in that she doesn't live with her ashikabi, and that her ashikabi is not the gender one would expect. This places great strain on her as she tries to live in the boarding house away from her beloved, and among other Sekirei who will eventually have to be her enemy (there can only be one winner of the Sekirei Plan (game)) She's also coerced into actions she doesn't want to do because of her situation. She's got one of the more interesting stories in the series, I wish we'd see more of how her and her ashikabe came to be together. But what we do see is interesting and compelling.Turns out, the MC's little sister becomes an ashikabi herself, after a fateful encounter with a young man she saves from a bad situation. Sekirei are not limited to being female, as he's a young man Sekirei fleeing from those either destroying non-claimed Sekirei or trying to force them to become part of an ashikabe's harem against their will. She eventually kisses him and makes him her Sekirei, but there's a good bit of humor and fumbling before it happens. It's a bit endearing I thought.As I mentioned several characters in the story section, there are ones out there that each viewer will probably take a shine to, and some they will not care for, I don't think it advantageous to list every last one on the show, as this is a review, not a book. I think most viewers will find a girl (or guy) that they fancy and makes the viewing enjoyable.Enjoyment: 6Sekirei is not a bad show by any means, it's just a bit generic and formulaic in my opinion. I would not say it wasn't worth my time, and I don't look down on it. I know people assign their own value to scores, such as I've heard people say 7 is the utter cutoff point, wont watch anything below it. But I go by the system provided by MAL, and it states that a 6 is rated 'fine' and is better than average. Sekirei is better than average for sure. I found moments I laughed, I found moments I was tense about what was going to happen, and I found moments I cheered a little as things went well. I'm not saying this is MUST SEE anime. But what I am saying is that if you like ecchi, harems, and fighting, then you'll probably really enjoy this. If you can tolerate or enjoy those same genres, but not love them, then you'll probably still get some positive mileage from this title.Best Girl: Miya the scary tengu mask showing landlady. She's so mysterious, but clearly connected to the whole situation. She's an utter badass, one I'm not sure any of the Sekirei could truly beat in a free for all, and she's just so dang nice! I wanted to put Kusano here, because cute little girl for the win, but Miya is so much cooler, and can cut a bitch too. That trumps growing plants, sorry Kusano.If you've got a moment, and need something to watch, I do recommend Sekirei. I just don't recommend if you're looking for something deep or meaningful. This is the action movie type of anime, lots of flash, a little substance, and then a lot more flash. Not a bad thing by any means, long as you know what you're getting into from the start. If I ever get superpowered alien chicks that devote themselves to me, I hope like hell I don't get the lightning charged twin sisters that constantly shock my ass like poor old Seo. Action-y thumbs up! pact in motion!Story 6:Basically the titular Sekirei are aliens/special humans/something *else* that are found in a spaceship like place on a secret island. For reasons not explained, the guy that found them is given authority over them to the point he devises a game where they must all fight each other to the death and the one winner is allowed to stay with her human partner.

I think what makes season 1 a good story is that they make the action intense in a series that is life and death for these girls. However I felt that Minato and other masters roles are fairly underused, and the point of this battle royale seems underwhelming by the enemies claims. The dialogue was decent, but I prefer...the plot and events of season 2.Art 7/10 -- Seven Arcs actually hasn't done many works, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is what they are mainly known for, and there last anime series that drew any major attention was Trinity Seven back in 2014. I liked the design of the characters, and the contrast gave a good manga feel. The lighting was nice in some scenes, however some other scenes lost a bit of quality in the moment. The fight scenes overall were executed standard, but nothing above average.Sound 6/10 -- If you don't know the cast that went into this show, you are missing out in the sound department. The OP and ED were pretty good, with several known voice actors voicing characters in this series. However, the dialogue again was very plain, and underwhelming for the talent they had.Character 6/10 -- Oh Man, how many harem animes are there where every girl says the main characters name in one scene. While Minatos dream is the type you wanna root for, you can't help but wish another team was lurking in the background with a better set of motivation. This harem lacked depth in it's characters, mainly because of the lack of any change throughout the show. Seemed like the enemy was revealed more then our protagonists, and the lack of development just killed this show.Enjoyment 7/10 -- This show is fairly enjoyable if you like ecchi, action, and next level fighting. I think the concept of a harem battle royale sounds interesting, but like every other anime, the production has to have consistent quality throughout the series to keep it interesting. Some scenes were better then others, and I still prefer the arcs in the next season. There's also some appeal in rooting for the underdog, as I find his wish to be respectful of everyone fighting, and it actually sounds possible.Overall 6/10 -- The characters make and break this show. You will either like it or you won't. Personally I thought the concept overall had lots of potential, and the cast also looked very good. The story was fairly decent, but I didn't like the limited dialogue or the lack of character development, and that makes me drop the score from a seven to six.~Castawayz the plot and events of season 2.Art 7/10 -- Seven Arcs actually hasn't done many works, Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha is what they are mainly known for, and there last anime series that drew any major attention was Trinity Seven back in 2014.

Some scenes were better then others, and I still prefer the arcs in the next season. There's also some appeal in rooting for the underdog, as I find his wish to be respectful of everyone fighting, and it actually sounds possible.Overall 6/10 -- The characters make and break this show. You will either like it or you won't. Personally I thought the concept overall had lots of potential, and the cast also looked very good. The story was fairly decent, but I didn't like the limited dialogue or the lack of character development, and that makes me drop the score from a seven to six.~Castawayz"", ""This anime features a unique story that can even be enjoyed by those who don't usually watch ecchi anime.

That is all.About the Anime: Minato Sahashi was living a normal life; he had just failed his college entrance exam for a second year in a row, and lived a quiet life in a single\'s apartment. That is, until the busty Musubi fell from the sky on top of him! She is a Sekirei, one of 108 that are destined to fight each other until only one remains; and he or she will ascend to heaven with his or her chosen one known as an Ashikabi. Minato soon finds himself in the embrace of Musubi, becoming her Ashibaki - but his life...will only become more complicated. Musubi isn\'t the last to claim Minato as her Ashibaki, and what\'s worse, plenty of other Sekirei and opponents stand in his way!Story 4.5/10: If I had to choose a moniker for Sekirei, it would probably be, ""The Little Anime that Couldn\'t"". It offers ecchi fan-service without being racy, peddles action while failing to be engaging, and sports an interesting setup that the show never puts to effective use. While it\'s possible to read the series as making fun of itself, the harem genre, and tournament-focused shounen shows, a second look reveals that the show means everything it says--much to my dismay.A quick summary of the series reads like Pokemon, but with tits. The first installment follows the hapless protagonist as he bumbles and sweet talks his way into acquiring of an increasingly powerful and scantily-clad team of humanoid aliens called Sekirei in preparation for a tournament sometime in the near future (read: second season). Thankfully, the parade of buxom woman in various states of undress meshes well with the show\'s simplistic focus on escalating confrontations. When two Sekirei meet for the first time, they fight. When Minato encounters new potential teammate, there\'s a fight. When MBI (the evil corporation behind the whole thing) seals off Neo Tokyo, the gang finds an excuse to fight. These high-energy smackdowns, which increase in frequency, participants, and outrageous displays of power as the story progresses, take a good deal of the pressure off the flagging narrative.The show does demonstrate on occasion that there might be a decent yarn hiding behind all the cheesecake, but then refuses to follow up on any of these more interesting tidbits. For example, the first episode introduces the Sekireis\' extra-terrestrial origins, but the subject gets dropped once MBI enters the picture. The dealings between Ashikabis (this world\'s trainers) also receive cursory treatment due to the series\' singular focus on Minato, squandering an opportunity to provide him some character depth by comparison; and glossing over subplots that could have held the viewers\' interest between battles. In the Kuu-chan mini-arc, the presence of another girl-wrangler and his cohort add tension and conflict to what would have been a boring meet-and-greet. But where the anime could have used the greedy antagonist to draw out the hero\'s underlying character traits, the remainder of the series chooses to leave this antagonist as a shadowy figure.Animation 6/10: Sekirei\'s visuals sport modern coloring and finishing techniques, but lack the consistency of more polished anime. For every excellent water, fire, or lightning effect associated with the fighters\' powers, there\'s a scene where the animation turns blocky or the characters look odd. Additionally, combat sequences cut a lot of corners; the chase scenes or jumping receive the lion\'s share of screen time that should have gone to the use of the Sekireis\' impressive powers or dramatic hand-to-hand fighting. The show also hamstrings its own dramatic buildups by dropping into an unattractive deformed style during important interpersonal moments in a weak attempt to add levity where none is needed.Additionally, the artists spent their limited imaginations early in the design process, leading to a plethora of derivative cuties. The lead\'s harem consists of four over-developed beauties in each of the four normal hair colors (blonde, brunette, redhead, raven-haired) and an adorable loli-girl who barely talks. While one character\'s interesting kimono and another\'s attractive black dress certainly provide some good eye-candy, two of Minato\'s girlies basically wear bedsheets, and a third wears an equally-unimaginative purple frock. The remaining cast coughs up such original creations as an outfit cribbed from Kill Bill, a guy dressed up like Neo from The Matrix Reloaded, and a set of twins in matching two-piece zippered cat suits (use the non-furry definition of cat-suit). Since the characters\' costumes don\'t reflect their powers, each design merely allows the viewer to tell Sekirei apart at a glance and nothing more.Sound 5/10: Starting with the bland OP, the series\' soundtrack does not disappoint, but also never surprises. Most of the incidental music follows in the grand synth tradition of middling anime, sounding familiar and hitting all of the ""right"" notes at the expected times. Accompanying an unapologetic fan-service slide show, the bubbly ED ends each episode on a sonic high note--assuming listeners ignore the coyly submissive lyrics (""The truth is I want you to hold only me / I\'m feeling turned on / Is it ok to show signs?""). Sadly, the voice acting doesn\'t deviate from the standard set by the score. None of the characters miss their cues or offend the ears, but the readings add no nuance to the broadly drawn character stereotypes. The only memorable performance comes from Seki Toshihiko as the MBI Chairman; his over the top mannerisms and showman\'s shouts add much needed camp, but receive tragically little time in the limelight. Be warned, this series also includes a mewling youngster in the form of Kuu-chan. The little girl\'s cooing would have rapidly gotten annoying save for the fact that her seiyuu makes some entertaining non-speaking sounds.Characters 4/10: Sekirei combines a stereotypical cast with pathetic characterization to fall flat on its face where it could have shined. Given the show\'s ecchi pedigree, a hollow male lead comes as no surprise, but where other shows provide an interesting harem to make up for a lackluster main protagonist, this series coughs up a laughably generic group for Minato. As the female lead, Musubi\'s naivete brings in a few good chuckles as she wrestles with modesty, but her eagerness to please and penchant for violence quickly grow stale when she does not develop at all during the first season. The rest of his Sekirei come straight out of central casting: Tsukiumi fell of the truck on the way from the tsundere factory, Kusano follows the textbook definition of imouto to a ""T"", and Kazehana presents like Shakugan no Shana\'s Margery Daw with all of the interesting parts removed (but all of her lady-parts intact). Furthermore, the series substitutes mystery in the place of complexity at every opportunity, purposefully obscuring characters\' histories so that they can act in unpredictable ways. Luckily, the low episode count both provides a convenient excuse and mitigates the characters\' lack of development and unoriginality.Overall 5/10: Far from being painfully average, Sekirei entertains so long as it remains on the screen, but doesn\'t rise above the low bar it sets for itself. Watching the show for the first time, the viewer can applaud himself on recognizing moe archetypes and marvel at the nifty super powers on display, but the unoriginal premise and middling execution means the show hardly warrants a second viewing. Bouncing along like the chests of its female leads, this anime shoves to the side any and all plot threads that don\'t directly concern Minato and his coven of comely combatants. Straightjacketed by the supposed demands of its target demographic, the series remains unfailingly true to its setup and modest goals, and in so doing loses a shot at being something memorable.~WhiteBakemono will only become more complicated.

Finally found out how to review. Good, Good. Sorry, you\'re not reading this to find that out, right? You came here to hear my thoughts on this so i\'ll stop rambling and get to it then, okay? (Sorry about that, just trying to be fresh, and easy to read, for lack of a better word.)Ahem, Sekirei...where to start. Well i\'ll just follow the layput already established, that seems to work.Story: I quite liked it, It has a (mostly) unique idea behind it that was really fun to be along on the ride. I mean come on who doesn\'t like the idea of having powers....Course on another note, the idea\'s sorta like a mature almost sexual version of pokemon...PLease don\'t take this the wrong way! Anyway the story was good enough to entertain me all throughout without making me ""stress"" over it like code geass or something would.Art: He he...The art... it\'s very...open about stuff...like females shirts. of course there\'s also the obligatory well endowed female cast. By the end you\'ll have your fill of naked women and big tatas whether you want it or not. I strongly feel that this didn\'t take away from the show at all...it just made me hope to god that my parents didn\'t walk in the room and get the wrong idea. ( No seriously mom, it\'s not what it looks like!) Anyway i wouldn\'t let that ruin this show, if it does for you. while there are scenes that have this in almost every episode, it isn\'t the whole episode maybe a scene of two? Anyway,  actual animation ( Artstyle) was very clean ( Boobs really move like that?... No...) and crisp the whole way through.Sound: The music was very nice, some good songs in there. None felt like they were overused and everyone of them really helped with the mood for scenes. The voice acting ( I watched in english...and some japanese, when megavideo decided to give out on me. stupid 70 minute timer thing...) was alot better in english than japanese for me. Not because it\'s my native tongue ( Though it is...) but i felt like the characters were more...lively, as hard as that may be for some to believe. Course it\'s my opinion, you do what you want!Character:All the main characters were very solid and easy to get along with. It felt like i was there goofing off with them or in the action fighting alongside them. All of them were likeable which is nice in a harem like anime, cause in some ways that makes it easier to watch. Never fun to have the one character you hate keep popping in and ruin the fun. This really didn\'t have one of those which made it that much better.Enjoyment: Not much to say, It was very enjoyable. My thoughts on the previous four categories can attest to my saying that I throughly enjoyed watching this.Overall: Alright I won\'t be as bland as I was on the last one (My english teacher always said my fourth paragraph was the weakest...). Overall I really enjoyed this anime. Some might say the length was a downer for it or the...ecchi aspects to it made it weird. But I, someone who never watches ecchi or the like found this to be a lovely anime. The length was fine with me...after all the second season is out ( Though i\'m waiting for the english dub...I quite liked all of the voice actors in this one, so i\'m gonna support my team.) I\'d definetely recommend this to anyone looking for a good action, ecchi, or romantic comedy. Course if you\'re looking for all of those in one package then here you go! ( Gift wrapped with my seal of approval and all!)Well that\'s my two sense, hopefully i didn\'t ramble too much and my lame jokes at least caused a smirk. Thanks for reading and I hope this helped!-Eriad Eternas- Course on another note, the idea\'s sorta like a mature almost sexual version of pokemon...PLease don\'t take this the wrong way!

Thanks for reading and I hope this helped!-Eriad Eternas-', ""Quite a so so anime.The plot is relativly alright, sort of Highlander meets Tenchi.The way it is carried out thouh...just awful.Sure. Otaku like scantily clad girls with big tits but they go really over the top with the booby sizes here so that it just looks silly.And the art style in general is pretty crappy and cheap looking too.Oh, and the main villain just looks simply rubbish. Terrible. They've tried to go for a nerd who thinks himself cool look I think there but have just got...something awful as the end result.On the positive though it does have its funny moments with the Tenchi like...'hes mine hes mine'. Something to watch if theres nothing else. It is only 12 episodes afterall. 'hes mine hes mine'. Something to watch if theres nothing else. It is only 12 episodes afterall."", 'Sekirei showed some promise early on. The idea seemed pretty solid, the fights were pretty fun to watch, and there actually seemed to be a decent romance blooming. Sure, there was some pretty flagrant ecchi involved, but generally, that should be expected whenever you see the genre tagged with any show. Unfortunately, just as soon as Sekirei starts looking to be a pretty decent show, everything just falls apart.A lot of people seem to like comparing this show to Pokemon, and while I can agree the concept of a single person who has a group of beings fighting for them is similar to the trainer/Pokemon...relationship, I\'d say that\'s where the similarities end. Unlike Pokemon, the show does not put a huge emphasis in ""collecting"" Sekirei. Sure, there are Ashikabi (humans with unique genes that allow Sekirei to ""emerge""; I\'ll be getting into it later) that have more than one, but there\'s never a point where you feel it\'s better, or even necessary to have multiples. Even Minato, the male lead, rarely openly expresses an interest in actively searching out for more Sekirei, and in the end only has four. Sekirei also can, and do, act independently, some to the point where we rarely ever see their Ashikabi.Regardless, I actually liked the concept of the show. It might not be a completely unique idea, but there is a certain degree of depth added by the fact that each Sekirei has a unique ability they can utilize during battle, as well as the presence of a sort of tier system that indicates a Sekirei\'s overall power. Basically, the girls are all given a number. The closer that number is to being #1, the more powerful the are considered. It\'s a simple concept to be sure, but the show does place a lot of importance on it, in much the same way Claymore did.Unfortunately, as much as I like the concept, its also what enables my least favorite part of the show, the whole harem aspect. While Sekirei can fight on their own, they become much stronger after they ""emerge"". The only way they can achieve this is to form a bond with an Ashikabi. There\'s no limit as to how many Sekirei can undergo this bond with an Ashikabi, so long as each of them undergoes the contract, which requires the two to swap mucous. In other words, (surprise, surprise) kiss. As horribly cliche as that is, it\'s not the part I hate the most. No, that distinction lies with the group of Sekirei that follow around Minato, our resident failure of a human turned ultra-stud for no apparent reason.To understand my dislike, let me shed some light on my feelings about the harem genre. While it would be easy to say if you\'re watching a show tagged with harem, you should know what to expect, that is in no way true. Sure, there are those shows which contain the stereotypical harems which involve a group of several women who all are in love with the one man. Think: Campione! Girls Bravo. Those are the types I typically dislike. Then there are the shows where the girls are actually realistic enough to see that the guy is a tool and/or simply isn\'t interested in them. Think: Is This a Zombie?, Love Hina. Those I do actually like since the girls generally aren\'t living with or around him because they want to, and for the most part, there is only one main love interest the lead has.Sekirei falls into the former, in the worst way. Minato is quite possibly the most useless of all the male leads I\'ve seen in a harem show. He\'s failed his entrance exams twice, and evidently that\'s enough for him to outright give up on trying to further his education. But after losing his apartment, and getting his allowance cut from mommy, he\'s got to get a job...which he is fired from. But hey, he\'s living in an evidently rent-free apartment that takes in Sekirei, and who can be bothered with things like responsibility what with giant, unclothed tits flying around all over Tokyo?Speaking of giant breasts, let\'s go into the art for this show. For what it\'s worth, this is a pretty well animated show. The environments all look surprisingly clean and are generally pretty colorful. The rather impressive level of detail given to the effects tied to the Sekirei\'s unique powers make the battle scenes pretty flashy and fun to watch too. Character design is...inconsistent in general. It\'s really wierd; one moment, the girls bodies look pretty much realistic (aside from their impossibly gargantuan racks of course), and the next they\'ll look like walking, talking hourglasses. And I mean that literally, there are several moments in the show where one character will go from having a believably proportioned body in one scene, to having a six inch waiste the next, only to go back to normal later. It\'s actually creepy in a way...But I digress; you may be wondering why boobs made me think of the art? Well...I can\'t lie, the boobs in this show are shockingly detailed in comparison to those I\'ve seen in other ecchi shows. And with mixed shame and pride, I have to say, I\'ve seen my fair share of animated boobies as the ecchi genre is a guilty pleasure of mine. There\'s just something about their nipples, it\'s kind of hard to explain really. You\'d have to actually see it to really know what I\'m talking about.Sooo...ahem...yeah...ANYWAY, back on track, sound isn\'t special really. Aside from the op, which is actually really uplifting and pretty epic sounding. I\'ve heard a lot about the Japanese vo work being pretty bad despite having some pretty big names attatched, and while I can\'t comment on that, I can say that the English dub isn\'t bad, though it\'s not great either. There\'s a few well known names involved, and they do decently, but that\'s really about it. If you\'re trying to figure out which way to watch, I\'d recommend you just go with what you usually prefer.The worst part of this show is hands down the characters. To sum them all up in one word, I would say ""generic"" would fit the bill nicely. You have the overly devoted, and overly loyal airheaded boobs, the hard-ass, pushy boobs, the nerdy boobs who for some reason wants to fondle all the other boobs, the catty twin set of boobs, the tomboyish boobs, the loli (and that\'s as awkward as it sounds when you consider she\'s a Sekirei that becomes emerged during the course of the show and that means her and her Ashikabi kissed in a way that enabled their mucous to come in contact), and the utter drones of men they serve (except the tomboy, who\'s Ashikabi is actually a girl).And the girls all adhere to those labels to a tee. There\'s absolutely nothing dynamic about them and there\'s really no depth to any of them, in fact, in the case of the loli, she actually degraded as a character in my opinion. Before emerging she\'s depicted in an almost mystic way, reaching out and speaking to Minato in his thoughts, yet once she becomes one of his Sekirei she suddenly barely speaks and starts randomly wearing animal costumes, communicating in what is supposed to be cute sounds and facial expressions.Overall, I\'d really have a hard time recommending this show to anyone; there\'s simply not enough going for it. Sure, the concept behind the Sekirei Plan is kind of interesting, and the fights are enjoyable to watch, but in every aspect of this show, I could easily recommend other series that does it much better. In fact, if you\'re into the whole harem thing, I\'d actually recommend the previously mentioned Campione!; as much as I disliked that show, it still has a lot more going for it than this show does, and it\'s got more than a few similarities. relationship, I\'d say that\'s where the similarities end. Unlike Pokemon, the show does not put a huge emphasis in ""collecting"" Sekirei. Sure, there are Ashikabi (humans with unique genes that allow Sekirei to ""emerge""; I\'ll be getting into it later) that have more than one, but there\'s never a point where you feel it\'s better, or even necessary to have multiples.

He\'s failed his entrance exams twice, and evidently that\'s enough for him to outright give up on trying to further his education. But after losing his apartment, and getting his allowance cut from mommy, he\'s got to get a job...which he is fired from. But hey, he\'s living in an evidently rent-free apartment that takes in Sekirei, and who can be bothered with things like responsibility what with giant, unclothed tits flying around all over Tokyo?Speaking of giant breasts, let\'s go into the art for this show. For what it\'s worth, this is a pretty well animated show. The environments all look surprisingly clean and are generally pretty colorful. The rather impressive level of detail given to the effects tied to the Sekirei\'s unique powers make the battle scenes pretty flashy and fun to watch too. Character design is...inconsistent in general. It\'s really wierd; one moment, the girls bodies look pretty much realistic (aside from their impossibly gargantuan racks of course), and the next they\'ll look like walking, talking hourglasses. And I mean that literally, there are several moments in the show where one character will go from having a believably proportioned body in one scene, to having a six inch waiste the next, only to go back to normal later. It\'s actually creepy in a way...But I digress; you may be wondering why boobs made me think of the art? Well...I can\'t lie, the boobs in this show are shockingly detailed in comparison to those I\'ve seen in other ecchi shows. And with mixed shame and pride, I have to say, I\'ve seen my fair share of animated boobies as the ecchi genre is a guilty pleasure of mine. There\'s just something about their nipples, it\'s kind of hard to explain really. You\'d have to actually see it to really know what I\'m talking about.Sooo...ahem...yeah...ANYWAY, back on track, sound isn\'t special really. Aside from the op, which is actually really uplifting and pretty epic sounding. I\'ve heard a lot about the Japanese vo work being pretty bad despite having some pretty big names attatched, and while I can\'t comment on that, I can say that the English dub isn\'t bad, though it\'s not great either. There\'s a few well known names involved, and they do decently, but that\'s really about it. If you\'re trying to figure out which way to watch, I\'d recommend you just go with what you usually prefer.The worst part of this show is hands down the characters. To sum them all up in one word, I would say ""generic"" would fit the bill nicely. You have the overly devoted, and overly loyal airheaded boobs, the hard-ass, pushy boobs, the nerdy boobs who for some reason wants to fondle all the other boobs, the catty twin set of boobs, the tomboyish boobs, the loli (and that\'s as awkward as it sounds when you consider she\'s a Sekirei that becomes emerged during the course of the show and that means her and her Ashikabi kissed in a way that enabled their mucous to come in contact), and the utter drones of men they serve (except the tomboy, who\'s Ashikabi is actually a girl).And the girls all adhere to those labels to a tee. There\'s absolutely nothing dynamic about them and there\'s really no depth to any of them, in fact, in the case of the loli, she actually degraded as a character in my opinion. Before emerging she\'s depicted in an almost mystic way, reaching out and speaking to Minato in his thoughts, yet once she becomes one of his Sekirei she suddenly barely speaks and starts randomly wearing animal costumes, communicating in what is supposed to be cute sounds and facial expressions.Overall, I\'d really have a hard time recommending this show to anyone; there\'s simply not enough going for it. Sure, the concept behind the Sekirei Plan is kind of interesting, and the fights are enjoyable to watch, but in every aspect of this show, I could easily recommend other series that does it much better. In fact, if you\'re into the whole harem thing, I\'d actually recommend the previously mentioned Campione!; as much as I disliked that show, it still has a lot more going for it than this show does, and it\'s got more than a few similarities.', 'Spoiler\'s Ahead!!!!!!!!!!!!!Quick Overview-----------------------Very pointless the people who made this just realised its going to be 2 series and all the did for series 1 is introduce characters and a bit about the powers, if i was you if you get to grips on whos who on here watch the last 2 episodes and thats it the rest feel like fillers and are sooooo boring!Story---------To sum it up there is a girl with Powers she is called Musubi,so she needs someone with her so she can become a full ""Sekirei""Once she found her partner he will be her Ashikabi, the main guy doesnt have any powers...but is a sidekick in a game, this game centers around one city which is blocked off and they basically have to kill everyones other Ashikabi and Sekirei to become number one and win the game.It resembles Battle Royal in a wierd way the story does (which isnt a bad thing)Graphics------------Very nicely done not the best i\'ve seen before the enviroments are good the best thing is the expressions that happen there very well done but other than that very good graphics.Sound/Voice----------------Musubi\'s voice becomes quite annoying but other than that the voices fit each character type they have, one who seems nice but underneath very angry etc... very good jobOverall----------Well the story at first sounded very cool but it just was frozen after that it didnt progress at all, most of the episodes fill like ""fillers"" most of them are meeting new people and other people who they help but most of the time apart from the main 4 ish characters you dont care for the others who usually pop in and out of episodes,to me the story could of drove this to a great series but it seems they were told its going to be atleast 2 series so in the 1st all they do is introduce characters and just get you into the powers (a bit) to me they could of made this interesting and showed more backlog and info on the powers but they didnt and to me it makes this anime series boring, near the end it gets better but still its quite jumpy and you see things and characters for a bit for no reason,the whole ending was pointless just to say it doesnt end :( atleast leave it on a cliffhanger or something!-------------------This review is based on me watching it TWICE, the first was back when it was released and the second was because i did see the ending so thought i would revisit it. but is a sidekick in a game, this game centers around one city which is blocked off and they basically have to kill everyones other Ashikabi and Sekirei to become number one and win the game.It resembles Battle Royal in a wierd way the story does (which isnt a bad thing)Graphics------------Very nicely done not the best i\'ve seen before the enviroments are good the best thing is the expressions that happen there very well done but other than that very good graphics.Sound/Voice----------------Musubi\'s voice becomes quite annoying but other than that the voices fit each character type they have, one who seems nice but underneath very angry etc... very good jobOverall----------Well the story at first sounded very cool but it just was frozen after that it didnt progress at all, most of the episodes fill like ""fillers"" most of them are meeting new people and other people who they help but most of the time apart from the main 4 ish characters you dont care for the others who usually pop in and out of episodes,to me the story could of drove this to a great series but it seems they were told its going to be atleast 2 series so in the 1st all they do is introduce characters and just get you into the powers (a bit) to me they could of made this interesting and showed more backlog and info on the powers but they didnt and to me it makes this anime series boring, near the end it gets better but still its quite jumpy and you see things and characters for a bit for no reason,the whole ending was pointless just to say it doesnt end :( atleast leave it on a cliffhanger or something!-------------------This review is based on me watching it TWICE, the first was back when it was released and the second was because i did see the ending so thought i would revisit it.', 'If you need something to kill time watch this.

When I review anime, a 7 is a 70% which means the anime was average but nothing special. I noticed most people would say that was worth a 5, or a 50%, but that is an F. If an anime didn't have any obvious flaws other than being nothing special, then I don't think it failed. So please read my reviews with this in mind. This is why most of my ratings seem on the high end. If I enjoyed it enough to finish it, it should be getting a C, not any lower.I will...also be saying the exact same thing about the other season, because I watched them as though they were one.Sekirei was one of my first anime, sadly. At the time I really enjoyed it but now, after watching a significant amount of anime, I look back with a better idea of what 'good' anime is. The main issue with sekirei was the mediocre story and characters.Story(6/10)I will say that the story is acceptable at best. Th main issue I have with reviewing the story is that there is little to no story that I can actually critique. However, the premise wan't too bad, and there was a steady progression in the show where the characters uncover more truths about the origins of themselves. All of that is well and good, but that is hardly enough plot for about 25 episodes of a show. There is little development, but it does still exist and it is rather interesting.Art(7/10)I have no complaints about the art itself; the art is decent and the animation is pretty nice. Though, absolutely nothing about it is special in any way, so it sits at a 7 (good) art. I will complain about the character design, though. It is surprisingly distracting to have so many women with gigantic chests. The anime almost tried to work it in like some kind of plot device, but it was forced. Since many of the side characters didn't have giant chests, it was uncalled for to have the main characters so...round. Sekirei may have even benefited by getting some breast reduction surgery.Sound(6/10)Again, hardly anything that stood out. Th voice acting and sound was decent enough, nothing in particular that was bad about it. However, it is nothing to remember, and wasn't anything interesting.Character(5/10)I'll keep this limited, since you already read my main complaint here. I don't feel like any of the characters developed. Sometimes the anime almost forced development in, but in the end it made no difference. Th characters had little impact on the story and world around them.Enjoyment(6/10)Th show was fun enough to watch, and interesting enough, to watch it until the end. That gets it a 7 in my book. The issue is that so much of it was either too much boob, or just boring. There were a couple of episodes that were hard to get through because of it.So in the end, Sekirei is a 6, fair. It had an interesting, though under developed story, and was funny enough to hold my attention. I would recommend this to anyone who likes boobs, butts, and harem. If you enjoy a story that won't keep you busy thinking about the characters or story, but just take up some free time, I think you would enjoy this show. However, I would not recommend it beyond that.

The story was more about getting to meet the the character and a little smudge of fighting which I personally was looking forward to the fighting parts since they...always tease the ""main"" girl always wanting to fight and yet they hardly do any fighting.Art 8 - Very good art, usually for me the art of an anime is the make it or break it for me to watch it unless it has a great story and decent art, but like again most echhi/harem all have good art and this is no exception.Sound 7 - This anime has pretty decent music, decent enough to sit through the opening and ending.Character 7 - All the characters are great, they are very likable and they all have somewhat different stories and motives.Enjoyment 7 - I liked the anime in general, they kinda didnt progress too much in my opinion and i hope this is all just a set-up for the second season and i hope the mc grows a spine.Overall 7 - Don\'t expect too much, just enjoy the anime for what it tries to be and go into it with a open mind and medium expectations.Thanks for reading this is my second review so im still new to this and my English isn\'t as strong as i\'d like it to be but thank you for reading this again. always tease the ""main"" girl always wanting to fight and yet they hardly do any fighting.Art 8 - Very good art, usually for me the art of an anime is the make it or break it for me to watch it unless it has a great story and decent art, but like again most echhi/harem all have good art and this is no exception.Sound 7 - This anime has pretty decent music, decent enough to sit through the opening and ending.Character 7 - All the characters are great, they are very likable and they all have somewhat different stories and motives.Enjoyment 7 - I liked the anime in general, they kinda didnt progress too much in my opinion and i hope this is all just a set-up for the second season and i hope the mc grows a spine.Overall 7 - Don\'t expect too much, just enjoy the anime for what it tries to be and go into it with a open mind and medium expectations.Thanks for reading this is my second review so im still new to this and my English isn\'t as strong as i\'d like it to be but thank you for reading this again.', ""My first Review, so why not start with one of my personal favorites, Sekirei?Okay, to start, if you don't like quite extreme nudity or the harem genre, you should search for another anime to watch. Even if you like panty shots or stuff like that, but don't like nude boobs etc. you shouldn't watch this Anime.Personally i loved Sekirei, cause the plot of most Harem/Ecchi anime is terrible, however in Sekirei, the plot is well-thought and exciting. The story starts right of the bat, and doesn't stop at any point.I won't go around spoiling the whole Anime, but you should be prepared for a lot...of girls fighting for 1 guy, a guy who can be a douchebag at some point. That is the only thing I didn't like about it.So, You should watch it if you like bouncing boobs for no reason, and if you like an anime with a good plot line, i highly recommend you this one. of girls fighting for 1 guy, a guy who can be a douchebag at some point.

However, that really wouldn\'t do it justice, since it\'s so much more than a typical harem or another ""There Can Be Only One"" story. It centers around Minato Sahashi who, after having a beautiful girl LITERALLY fall into his life, discover that he is an Ashikabi, the destined partner of this girl and others like her known as Sekirei.Minato himself is the best male lead for a harem anime you could ask for. While being physically weak and having a tendency to crumple under pressure, he is very likable and doesn\'t fall to...the harem trope of being a lecherous pervert or a namby pamby with a deus ex machina on stand by. He does eventually become an selfless hero who puts his girls first and himself second (yeah, I know, that\'s a tired harem cliché of the weak male protagonist archtype), however this change is only introduced during the second season. And, believe me, it\'s given a very legitimate reason for happening.The harem girls have diverse characters that allow for a balanced mix of comedy and drama, and they\'re really what makes the show work as well as it does. The writers seem to know just which dramatic moments between them to kill with comedy and which ones to let play out, resulting in a tone reminiscent of Glen Murakami\'s Teen Titans cartoon. Each member of the harem has a different kind of relationship with the hero and with each other, so they all feel like real people. These are not things you say about a dumb fan-service show, this was clearly something that someone put a lot of thought and care into crafting.What sets Sekirei above most other harem anime is how it goes out of its way to trample nearly every harem cliché that people like me are sick of. There\'s an actual villain this time around who by all means I should hate but for some reason can\'t stay mad at whenever he\'s on screen. There\'s no perverted male lead to facilitate fan service, nor any contrived high school scenario. In fact, they kick THAT cliché in the happy sack from the get-go. None of the Sekirei are one-note nor are any of the other characters, with the exception of some of the lesser mentioned.The other thing that separates Sekirei from other harem anime is its maturity. The show always find diegetic reasons for fan service and never has the main character cop a feel for no reason. The fan service is never the focus of a scene, the focus is always on fun character interaction or moving the story forward. And the one time Minato DOES accidentally cop a feel, the show uses it as a rather unique plot point dealing with a character\'s dual-identity. ""Grabbing a woman\'s breast leads to a revelation about their identity and the psychological crisis they are currently having."" How many shows can you say THAT about? It sounds so stupid on paper, and yet in execution it\'s not. That\'s this show in a nutshell, come to think of it.On that note, I\'m sure you\'ve probably started asking questions about the credibility of the show\'s ""destined romantic partner"" thing. That idea that these girls are bound to whomever wins a genetic lottery regardless of character or moral fiber. Well, the show addresses that. Yeah, in Season 2 there\'s an episode that points out just how f**ked up an Ashikabi can be and what a sickening relationship it leads to. How many other shows do you know of that do that? How often has a show deconstructed its own premise like that? I certainly can\'t think of any that do. And said confrontation ends not with any kind of moral analysis or deep philosophical comment on the matter, it ends with a simple statement of, ""This is why Minato is our main man: because he\'s a big damn hero with a big damn heart who always tries to do the right thing no matter what."" It\'s just so refreshing to see that kind of attitude in a meek and vulnerable character like Minato instead of a powerhouse like Goku or Superman.Don\'t be fooled by this show\'s appearances on the surface. This is one the smartest, best-paced, best-written shows I\'ve ever seen, harem or action or animated or otherwise. It directs all of its elements and resources towards engaging and entertaining the audience, and it never resorts to cheap anime gimmicks to do so. While the show isn\'t flawless as there are one or two scenes that I feel go on a bit too long for where they take the story, I still have no qualms about calling this my all-time favorite anime, beating out such acclaimed series like Cowboy Bebop, Trigun and Fullmetal Alchemist.Why? Because I am a huge sucker for shows featuring multiple kick- ass lady protagonists living under one roof, which this show is entirely responsible for doing to me. I\'ve watched it four times already and am not even close to getting sick of it. Just for context, I watch most anime once and then never go back to them, even those other three I mentioned, far more than any of the bad harem shows I\'ve seen.

Sekirei delivers that! 10/10 for this show, all I can really say is.. wow! This series mixes Martial-art hand-to-hand combat with great 'powers' and abilities. The fact that the girls are the ones fighting really adds a different element to a series. On top of that, the fact that most of them are all busty babes is an obvious plus for viewers, and the fact that these girls get naked on occasion...really gives the series a 'real' feeling, nothing held back etc.For those viewers who'd normally disagree with nudity, the simple fact is that even though there is a descent amount of it and alot of 'fanservice', the story is so strong that it just fits into the 'flow' of each episode, so you don't really notice it unless you're one of those types that pause it to have a 'good look' at the girls. All said, this show will be my favourite for a long time, and I can't wait for Sekirei Pure Engagement or 'Season 2' to be released here is Australia! ^_^ really gives the series a 'real' feeling, nothing held back etc.For those viewers who'd normally disagree with nudity, the simple fact is that even though there is a descent amount of it and alot of 'fanservice', the story is so strong that it just fits into the 'flow' of each episode, so you don't really notice it unless you're one of those types that pause it to have a 'good look' at the girls.

Where there are more than few players who all fight each other depending on the rules and way defined how to fight and the one who survives till the end and  still stands is called the battle royale WINNER. There are many projects running using this one as their base concept but each have their own world, story, ability, skills and play concept.Sekirei is also a story based on this concept but with a different play concept...in which there are total 108 Sekireis in this world. But To awaken their true power they need to find themselves a master who is compatible with them and have to form a pact with him/her. And there is one catch point is that more than one Sekirei can make pact with a single master which makes their master more powerful but how and in which way is yet to be seen.Story : Sahashi, Minato, a normal guy who has failed twice to get into a university which he is aiming for. After getting his 2nd try result in which he has failed. On his way home thinking about what he will do from now on suddenly a girl fell from sky on him ""Musubi"" who is chased by 2 other girls.Fortunately or Unfortunately he got involved in a situation which is unknowns to him, later he learns that there is a Battle Royale game going to be start between 108 Sekireis and She is one of them. But to bring out her true power ""Musubi"" need to find herself a compatible master and form a pact with him/her by kissing. It turns out that ""Sahashi Minato"" is one the she was looking for. After getting involved in all out battle royal he got surrounded by more Sekireis (4 for now). He learns that a master can have more than 1 Sekirei. Now to achieve the goal which ""Musubi"" aims for he needs to get ready to give all his support to his Sekireis and have to create a strong bond between them, also he need to become strong if he wants to protect them.While the story concept is really good, the way battle royale is conducted and the super power and abilities which are given to Sekireis are all different for each one but still for some reason the impact we should be getting is not that strong. Plus even though it is a battle royal there are no any serious fight scenes till the end.While the rom-com, fan-service and harem stuff is still good enough to entertain one. But let\'s say the things are just getting started, for the first season it\'s still decent enough.Story, Character - 8/10Art, Sound, Enjoyment - 7/10Overall - 7/10Even though i said that this is a decent anime but i will say that if you have seen some other harem, rom-com, fan-service anime than you will definitely like this Oppai anime also which is pretty enjoyable. in which there are total 108 Sekireis in this world.

I haven't really engaged with, nor enjoyed for that matter this sort of show for years (for a good reason too). However, usually with shows such as 'The Asterix War' or 'Chivalry of a Failed Knight' you get some semblance of plot or interesting action. All this show has to offer is 'plot', pestiferous voice acting, and pretty appalling animation.The interactions between Minato, Musubi, and all the other women who make up this harem are fake even when judged by the criteria of this genre....Now, we are all aware of the trope that the male mc falls on top of the FMC and she subsequently becomes angry, only for the two of them to end up in the same class or accommodation. However, Sekirei's cliched method of bringing the two MCs together is horrifically contrived to say the very least. It doesn't even place them in the same school or equivalent, instead the show asks us to simply believe they ran into each other in the street by chance.The main conflict and villainous force in this anime are hilariously lousy tooStay away from this show at all costs or risk losing any chance of a woman approaching you Now, we are all aware of the trope that the male mc falls on top of the FMC and she subsequently becomes angry, only for the two of them to end up in the same class or accommodation.

Now, my reviews are shit due to my superficial watching style, so if you find it helpful, then you'll probably like Sekirei; anyhow onto reviewing.This anime is painfully mediocre and I mean painfully; although I watched seven (or six) episodes, I couldn't discover anything interesting or enjoying about this anime. My main issues are as follows: the protagonist sucks dick, the plot/story isn't compelling in the slightest, it's not comedic,...it fails at harem and it's presentation is mediocre. Firstly, the I hate the protagonist; he's so boring, bland, uninteresting, and a pussy; he's literally the embodiment of a shut in loser and I mean loser, and what's irritating is that he stays this way throughout the majority of the series. He offers absolutely nothing, he's unrelatable because he's just so worthless, and it just adds to the nonsense that is the showcase of the harem aspect of this show.Now, throughout the series, I attempted to piece together some kind of story or idea of what was going on and what the anime was about, but all that I could put together was that apparently these Sekirei things exist and are apart of some cliche evil battle royale scheme by some cliche evil scientist dude. This wouldn't be an issue if the show was executed well, but it's not; the presentation of the show is just uninteresting, bland, and completely meaningless thus leading to a boring plot.The harem part is especially meaningless; I understand that harems are kind of supposed to be dumb and whatnot, but the harem in this show is literally just flat out fucking stupid I mean my braindead dog can take a shit that's more unique and reasonable. The Sekirei bitches (besides the child) flock toward the protagonist for literally no reason, and his first harem person thing is a great example of that; LITERALLY, FOR NO REASON, she just like falls in love with him and views him as this great man meanwhile he's nothing but an empty loser. The rest of the Sekireis he gets are just as dumb to I mean there's literally nothing to love about this guy and the girls have no reasonable motivation to love him. I can get profoundly fucking baked off a nice sativa Mad Labs and come up with better material. It's not even funny either it's just flat out stupid and not in a good way. I couldn't even enjoy the whole sexual shit either as it was just so stupid it was completely meaningless.The characters are one-dimensional and add to the mediocrity; they're not good but they're not bad and add to the destruction of the harem in this anime.Overall, I tried to enjoy this show; I tried looking for a single reason to watch it, but none were present. The anime is completely devoid of all meaning, it's not funny at all, it's way too braindead, it's boring, it's mediocre, etc. I definitely wouldn't recommend this show at all as it's a disgrace of a harem anime and painfully mediocre. it fails at harem and it's presentation is mediocre.

Which for me is on the same level as the animation of naruto against pain or nanatsu.In the...end I still like the anime and only these last two episodes disappointed me (in terms of animation) otherwise I still see it as a good anime.I hope the animation improves, because I gave seven for this first season because it really is good, but I almost gave 6 because of this animation, and look I don\'t even care much about animation!!!!Note: What is the problem with this anime that every character has white hair? end I still like the anime and only these last two episodes disappointed me (in terms of animation) otherwise I still see it as a good anime.I hope the animation improves, because I gave seven for this first season because it really is good, but I almost gave 6 because of this animation, and look I don\'t even care much about animation!!!!Note: What is the problem with this anime that every character has white hair?', ""RECOMMENDEDThis is exactly what I expect from this kind of anime: Plot and PLOT. The music is fantastic, the voice acting is amazing, also helps that the voice of the main heroine is one of my favourites I guess xD.

I'm talking about you To-Love -Ru >.<Firsts things firsts, the plot, even if it's not incredible complicated, is compelling and simple enough, lots of waifus fighting in a battle royal with their masters... Nothing amazing but, interesting enough. Second, and incredible...important... The characters can talk more than 5 minutes straight without making a stupid joke with no sense, it happens from time to time but, it's not every fucking damn 2 seconds... Yes I'm talking about you, again, To-Love-Ru. That helps carying about the characters and, even if they're not incredibly complex, again, they're nice and you get to enjoy them with their personal short stories. The plot make sense, which also helps. And the fighting scenes, even if simple, they're pretty nicely done..As I said before, the music is going to sound in my head for some time, it was pretty good tbf, the artistic, even if old, great. So yes, if you want to have a good time and don't think too much, you can watch it and enjoy it. It's not a master piece, don't get me wrong, but after all the crap that I watched on this genre, it gets the top 3 spot, just behind Sora no Otoshimono and Fruit of Grisaia...

I have to say, the comparison was pretty spot on in a lot of areas. I enjoyed Sekirei a lot to be honest, and I feel bad I had to give it a 7. But I couldn\'t in good conscience give it an 8, as it has some glaring flaws. Looking at it...critically, It\'s undeserving of a rating that high. That said, a lower rating does not mean I enjoyed it less.Starting off, the animation for season 1 is incredibly inconsistent in its art style. The female characters are drawn thicker than a Snicker for the first few episodes, then weirdly broad shouldered for the next few, and finally very ""hippy"" for the last bit (like overly-hourglass shaped). It gets distracting at times, and I found it difficult to overlook. Season 2 doesn\'t share this issue.The characters are all enjoyable, and likeable, albeit very much tropes. The only character I didn\'t like, apart from the main antagonist (for reasons not involving the *quality* of the character itself) was the main character Minato. He is an unbearable pussbag, and has little to no character development. He exists as a dated ""viewer avatar"" character. More effort was definitely needed in his character, he is the definition of forgettable, and throwaway. Other than that, the only minor irritant I had with the characters was they way overdid the ""Scary-Innkeeper"" gag.Alright so spoiler warning:This series is ultimately incomplete. It ends on a cliffhanger, which assumed there was going to be a season 3 - Which never happened.Although there are rumors of a third season getting announced soon, it has been 10 years now, so I think it\'s fair to judge this show based on the assumption it will never be completed.I wanted to see the main antagonist meet a horrible fate, there are several plotlines that never got a sense of closure. An anime\'s ending can make or break your overall impression of the whole experience, and this ending was a standard: ""Just read the manga if you want to finish the story.""I likely will end up reading the manga, because I do want to finish the story. But this review is for the anime, not the manga. My opinions are based on the anime alone, as someone who has just seen the series for the first time, and never read the manga.Ultimately this show needs, and frankly deserves a proper ending. It\'s by no means a masterpiece, or even anything that special.

It\'s got this vibe that might remind you of ""East of Eden,"" but what sets it apart is how real it feels. You\'re following these characters who are basically bonded with these alien-like warriors, each with their own set of skills. But here\'s the twist - not everyone\'s on board with this game, and the show dives into some pretty deep moral questions about their involvement.Now, fair warning, there\'s a lot of those flashy, offensive girl bits moments scattered throughout, but if...you can look past that, there\'s some really enjoyable stuff here. The interactions between these warrior girls are surprisingly entertaining. Although, I gotta say, there are moments where certain plotlines, like the whole pseudo-blackmail thing, start feeling a bit repetitive and drag the excitement down a notch. And don\'t even get me started on some of the characters like the boxer girl - they could definitely use more depth.One thing about Sekirei is that it\'s not afraid to take its time revealing what\'s really going on. Sometimes it feels like it\'s dragging its feet a bit with the subplot and backstory, but just when you start feeling impatient, bam! It hits you with some unexpected plot twist that reels you right back in. Sure, there are some characters who could use more development, but overall, it\'s a pretty solid watch. you can look past that, there\'s some really enjoyable stuff here.

So, does Sekirei still hold up? Well, let\'s hop on and find out, shall we?StoryMinato Sahashi\'s life is forever changed when he meets a group of beautiful warrior women called Sekirei and he gets involved in a struggle to decide the most powerful Sekirei in the city. Action-harem anime aren\'t exactly new these days, but Sekirei does put a new spin on this concept by forcing the protagonist to make his own harem and win what is basically a battle royale, the specifics...of which are never really elaborated on. All we now is that a special prize awaits the winner of the contest.Let me be honest about this: Sekirei thrives on the outlandish and silly. Every one in a while, you hear about the Sekirei talking about the importance of love and how their love for ther partner, or Ashikabi, gives them the strength to fight. It can be silly and hard to take seriously, but that is what makes this show so entertaining. (7/10)CharactersLike so many harem protagonists, Minato has no complex personality and is merely an everyman that exists to facilitate the viewers\' immersion into the story and it\'s the supporting cast who truly push the emotional component of the story forward. His Sekirei harem consists on the cheerful Musubi, the young Kusano, the standoffish Tsukiumi and the nerdy Matsu. The evolution of the Sekirei\'s relationships with their Ashikabi is actually important to the story because their strength is tied to their love. The stronger their love is towards the Ashikabi, the more powerful Sekirei become in battle.If I had to pick a favorite character, I\'d choose Tsukiumi. The other girls are fine, but Tsukiumi feels like the only character with a true sense of evolution throughout the show. She\'s basically a female Han Solo, and she goes from refusing to find a partner to becoming one of Minato\'s best Sekirei. She\'s basically the only character in the narrative with something to prove and something to work for.While the character development on Sekirei isn\'t as good as, say, Date A Live, it still does more right than wrong. It probably won\'t rewrite the book on how characters are developed in harem anime, but the on their own right, the characters are fun and memorable. (7/10)ArtSekirei really loves fanservice. No, really, this anime is all about breasts and panties. Not only are the characters outfitted with clothes that leave little to the imagination, but if there\'s an excuse for the girls to be naked or at least in their underwear, this show will find it.Unfortunately, the action aspect becomes mildly neglected, especially in the final two episodes. There are scenes where the animation quality decreases significantly and the characters look badly drawn and their movements look awkward, which is sad, because in the earlier part of the series, the action was holding up pretty well. (6/10)SoundThe soundtrack in Sekirei wouldn\'t be out of place in a 90\'s soap opera, what with all the characters talking about love and relationships. The opening song isn\'t that special, but the ending song is amazing. Both the Japanese and English version of Sekirei definitely benefitted from their casts of talented voice actors. Some of my favorite voice actress participated in the Japanese version, like Saori Hayami, Marina Inoue, Kana Hanazawa and Aya Endou, while the English version featured strong performances from Alexis Tipton, Colleen Clinkenbeard, Monica Rial and Lydia Mackay. No matter which version you choose, you\'ll definitely have fun. (8/10)OverallSekirei is a good show. No, it\'s not perfect and it definitely goes overboard with its all ""power of love"" stuff, but it\'s silly, unprententious and a lot of fun, which is what really matters at the end of the day.

While it still has plenty of flaws and quite a few things it could do better, if you want to watch an exciting, hilarious and often touching tale about badass women fighting for the ones they love, ""Sekirei"" is an anime that\'s definitely worth your time.Story (7.5/10):Set in Tokyo in the year 2020...(the current present year), ""Sekirei"" follows two extremely different individuals: Minato Sahashi, a very smart but deeply insecure young man who\'s just after failing a college entrance exam for the second year in a row, and Musubi, a perpetually cheerful but not very bright girl with massive strength and equally massive breasts. Just when Minato is wondering what he\'s going to do with his life, Musubi falls VERY literally into his life, and she ends up taking refuge in his apartment. Soon after, he discovers that she is an alien called a Sekirei, and he is her Akshikabi, the \'special one\' that she\'s been looking for all this time who helps awaken her true power, known as \'winging\'. Soon after, Minato discovers that he has become part of a battle royale known as the Sekirei Plan, which has all 108 Sekirei compete against each other for the sick entertainment of Hiroto Minaka, a madman who runs the mega-corporation Mid Bio Informatics (M.B.I. for short). Further complicating matters is that Minato is forbidden from telling any normal person about the plan, and he ends up being kicked out of his old apartment for being with a girl, though thankfully he finds himself at a local inn called the Izumo Inn not long after, which serves as his and Musubi\'s new home and base of operations from then on, with them also adding more Sekirei to their group along the way.One thing I really liked about the story is that it goes out of its way to avoid most stereotypes associated with the genre, only keeping the bare minimum that makes the genre what it is. For starters, there\'s the setting. Throughout the whole series, there is no high school to be found, with our male lead being a young adult who works part-time jobs to support himself. This makes for some very interesting set-pieces throughout the series, as the heroes often patrol the city fighting other Sekirei or getting attacked by them. Overtime, though, we learn that while there are plenty of jerks among the Ashikabi and even the Sekirei, there are others who deserve to win the Plan just as much as Minato and his Sekirei do, and the idea that only one person can get a happy ending is something that Minato becomes more and more unwilling to accept as time goes on. And while the premise has some definite ""Date A Live"" vibes to it (see my recommendation regarding the two for more information), one should note that this series aired before that one did, and the story is different enough to make it its own. The story also moves at a brisk pace, with each season having a great pay-off.Unfortunately, the story does have quite a few problems. For starters, even though it never really stays in the same place for too long, there\'s hardly any real progression of the plot, with the focus instead being on Minato adding more and more Sekirei to his harem as well as his and the Sekirei\'s character development. While this is compelling in its own right, the story does spend a little too long with Minato figuring out exactly how he\'s going to deal with the crazy situation he\'s found himself in, and the second season ends up ending on a huge cliffhanger that, considering it first aired a decade ago, will most likely never get resolved.Art & Animation (8/10):There really isn\'t much to say about the visuals. While there are some great character designs, with each character looking distinct, as well as some really nice attack effects, the art is definitely not anything to write home about, with the series looking no different from several other anime of its time. And while the fanservice is mostly at a tolerable level, there are a few times when it\'s really in your face when it definitely shouldn\'t be, which is not helped by the frequent clothing damage during fights. One thing that looks REALLY good, however, is the scenes whenever a new Sekirei is winged, as well as the effects of what happens as a result.Sound & Dialogue (8.5/10):""Sekirei""\'s soundtrack is pretty generic for the most part, with the vast majority of the tracks just blending into the background. The only memorable tracks I can think of are the two opening themes, and even they aren\'t fantastic. The voice acting is brilliant, however, with Joel McDonald and Alexis Tipton delivering fantastic performances as the main pair, and the cast featuring other great talents such as Colleen Clinkenbeard, Tia Ballard and Stephanie Young as main characters, as well as Todd Haberkorn, Brina Palencia and Monica Rial in supporting roles. The dialogue is mostly very good, but what\'s notable about it is Tsukiumi speaking in Shakespearean English, which fits her surprisingly well. Overall, I would say that this category is the highlight of the series.Characters (7.5/10):While Minato isn\'t the most interesting main character, he\'s nothing if not relatable. Having failed the college entrance exam not once but twice, he is incredibly insecure, believing himself to be a completely ordinary person with no distinguishable qualities. As such, he initially can\'t understand how he\'s an Ashikabi, believing it should be someone special and he\'s anything but that. In reality, he\'s extremely intelligent, and his failures stem largely from an inability to cope under pressure, and overtime he starts to attempt to make himself worthy of not only Musubi, but every Sekirei he wings. As a current college student who\'s had quite a few setbacks over the years, his character resonated with me very strongly, which along with his unfailing kindness (while he does become a harem seeker, it\'s either to help a certain Sekirei or because they seek out him first) makes him a very likable character despite him not doing much in the way of action. Despite this, I found myself liking the other lead, Musubi, even more. To sum her up, she\'s incredibly strong, not very bright, always eager for a fight, very naive and childlike and incredibly optimistic, to the point that she\'s almost always smiling even when sad. While one could argue this makes her the opposite of Minato, she\'s also just as kind as him, if not more so, often comforting Minato whenever he\'s down or promising to keep him safe, showing a surprisingly insightful side despite not being very smart. She\'s also pretty damn badass to boot, though by no means invincible.Ultimately, though, my favourite character was not either of the leads, but Kusano, the second Sekirei Minato wings and the youngest of all of them. While some may be disgusted at the idea of a young man having a little girl in his harem, it surprisingly works very well, in no small part thanks to Minato being the perfect gentleman he is. Not only is she impossibly cute, but she is also easily the nicest of Minato\'s Sekirei after Musubi, having absolutely no moments of being a brat, which gave me a feeling I can\'t even describe (I would call it refreshing, but I don\'t think that does it justice). She\'s also surprisingly wise for her age, which is especially shown during the build-up to the climax of the first season. The third Sekirei we get introduced to is Matsu, the main brains of the group along with Minato as well as a huge pervert, though thankfully she knows there\'s a time and a place... most of the time. She\'s also probably the most encouraging of Minato\'s Sekirei, often getting him to believe in himself more, though she\'s ultimately not quite as fleshed out as Kusano, Musubi or Minato.The rest of the main cast is quite good as well. One example is Kazehana, a Sekirei who drinks a lot and serves as the kind-hearted big sister of the team, and is also probably the most powerful of the bunch. While she\'s only a supporting character in the first season, she takes a far more active role in the second, especially when Minato wings her. There\'s also Tsukiumi, the tsundere of the group who acts very much like a Saiyan from ""Dragon Ball"" or krogan from ""Mass Effect"", in that she\'s very prideful and loves fighting. While she\'s definitely violent and short-tempered, she tends to be an even mixture of \'tsun\' and \'dere\', which keeps her from being insufferable. Last of all, we have Homura, a rare male Sekirei who nevertheless has a very feminine appearance, who is the most stoic and grounded out of all of them, though it would be a stretch to call him the voice of reason since he can also be very ruthless and cold-hearted. One notable thing about the Sekirei\'s personalities is that they go against what you\'d expect from someone with the powers they have. This is especially the case with Tsukiumi and Homura, who are short-tempered and stoic respectively, except that Tsukiumi has water powers while Homura has fire.Sadly, as good as the main cast is, the supporting cast doesn\'t quite come up to snuff. While there are some good characters, such as Miya Asama, the widowed landlady of Izumo Inn who is as kind as she is scary, and Kaoru Seo, the best friend of Miya\'s late husband with scoundrel tendencies, most of the cast just don\'t get all that much focus or development, if any at all. Notably, there are two antagonists who suffer probably the fastest case of villain decay in anime history, going from legitimately terrifying villains in their first appearance to complete jokes in their second, with little outside circumstances to justify this sudden change.Enjoyment (7.5/10):For a series that revolves around a battle royale, ""Sekirei"" is surprisingly light on action. We don\'t get a complete fight until episode 3, and a good bit of the series is spent with Minato and the others just hanging around Izumo Inn or making some sort of big plan, the latter of which can take place over an entire episode. This isn\'t to say the show is boring, but the relatively small number of fights does somewhat hurt the otherwise very good pacing. That being said, there is some good comedy as well, even if there were only a few parts that really made me laugh out loud.Overall:""Sekirei"" manages to be both one of the lesser known harem anime out there and one of the better of the genre. While it is underdeveloped in some areas, it nevertheless has a very likable main cast, great voice acting and some awesome special effects. While you definitely shouldn\'t go in expecting a masterpiece, I believe that anyone who likes harem anime will definitely enjoy this series, and even some who don\'t should at least give it a go.Score:7.5+8+8.5+7.5+7.5=39/50=7.8/10 (the current present year), ""Sekirei"" follows two extremely different individuals: Minato Sahashi, a very smart but deeply insecure young man who\'s just after failing a college entrance exam for the second year in a row, and Musubi, a perpetually cheerful but not very bright girl with massive strength and equally massive breasts.

I literally just finished watching Sekirei, and the story is about the only thing I really enjoyed about it. Basically, ""Sekirei"" are girls who have an ""Ashikabi."" The Ashikabi are somewhat like the Sekirei\'s ""master"" and they must fulfill the wishes of their Ashikabi at all times. The rules of Sekirei is that they have to fight every other Sekirei they come in contact with.Minato Sahashi is an intelligent boy living in Tokyo. However, Minato crumbles under pressure which has resulted in two failed college entrance exams.One day, Minato is walking somewhere when suddenly a girl literally falls from the sky. Minato learns...that the girl\'s name is Misubu, but doesn\'t have time to learn much else because Misubu is being chased by two other women, Minato later finds out are Sekirei.The plot then progresses when Misubu has to stay with Minato, and announces that he is her Ashikabi, sealing the deal with a kiss. As the story goes on, Minato accidentally gathers a harem of Sekirei at his command, which almost brings more trouble than it\'s worth.Interesting, right? Wrong. The story would have been all it could have been if there WASN\'T SO MUCH DAMN FANSERVICE. A bit of ecchi, I don\'t mind. THIS, however, I can barely deal with. It wasn\'t as bad as HOTD or Highschool DxD, becayse this I actually managed to finish, but wow. Do you know how much time they wasted with panty shots? Unbelievable.ART (6)The art, well.. meh. It was meh and I don\'t know how else to describe it. There wasn\'t anything particularly \'wow\' about it, but nothing that bad either.SOUND (5)I watched the dubbed version, and let me just say I didn\'t enjoy it. The supporting characters were alright, but DON\'T GET THE VOICE OF THE MAIN CHARACTER WRONG OR THE WHOLE THING GOES DOWN IN SMOKE. Jeez.CHARACTER (5)There wasn\'t much time for character development when all that was focused on was boobs and ass. In fact, the most character development was in the last episode, which is no good to anybody because it\'s a bit late to show the characters in a relatable way then. You mainly only get to see the characters bickering and fighting over Minato, which is amusing at times, but when it\'s half of every single episode, it\'s not so much fun to watch. It gets pretty boring.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL (5.5)The story was good, but everything else was either average or just plain bad. So unfortunately, I can\'t score any higher than 5.5.. Although it was a good anime with some interesting ideas, there was too much time spent on fanservice for them to actually develop anything interesting.I guess it just isn\'t my type of anime. that the girl\'s name is Misubu, but doesn\'t have time to learn much else because Misubu is being chased by two other women, Minato later finds out are Sekirei.The plot then progresses when Misubu has to stay with Minato, and announces that he is her Ashikabi, sealing the deal with a kiss.

Other reviewers have done this to death, and inspired themselves more than enough !Secondly, I will also not talk about the surface plot; it has also been done into the ground by others.There are however, matters that have not been discussed; that I think needs some words.1).  The SekireiThese people are off-world aliens, in cold-storage. Some back-story about them, in their own right; would have been nice. But there is none. Their aged vessel is discovered by...college students. Were the Sekirei sent to help the Mankind they found? Were they sent here to conquer us? Or did they just crash-land, and just never get woke up, by the onboard computer (which is shown still running)? More importantly, in the vein of the resurrecting of the Sekirei, by Minaka Hiroko and others; what would the Sekirei have been if they were never ""adjusted""? We will never know. Is there any larger lost opportunity?2). The descent into pure evil.Minaka Hiroko is not the genius he is portrayed. Anyone can back-engineer someone else\'s technology, and then become a profiteer on the backs of the superior creators of the technology, in the first place. Did Minaka create anything new? No. Did he use the gene-pool he discovered, to advance the intelligence and capabilities of Mankind (including himself)? No. When we realize that genetic modifications not only change the living, in their own time; they also change the next generation and the next. The changes tend to be permanent.But Minaka had a better idea. Let\'s use the modified Sekirei to promote a game, which ultimately ends in the death of all Sekirei. They die, for a purpose that is obviously a huge lie. The viewer should not accept Minaka\'s premise. There is no prize, he knows they\'re all going to die. No win, no way out, pain and suffering for everybody connected.WHAT A WASTE!----------------------------------------------In other words, Sekirei is a snuff-anime. It\'s not about Life. It\'s all about Death. Heroic moments in the story line do not forgive the fact that ultimately, Minaka Hiroko will find a way to force the Sekirei to kill each other. That was his original aim, his process during the game, and his plan for the ultimate outcome. It\'s all about the Game, for his amusement. He might as well have been a audience member at a Roman Circus, Gladiators murdering each other and all. No other value is possible, for Minaka. He even hands out strange gifts, to the viewers and participants; like the Roman Emperor used to do when he offers Bread and Wine to the viewing throng, for their amusement and edification.The artwork is quite good. The music is mediocre at best; I would have expected other reviewers to have higher standards. The interior music, in support of plot points, is more than adequate.The acting dialog is above average. For some anime, I like sub-english, because the Japanese actors fit the characters well. But in this particular case; both the sub and dub versions are more than adequate. I happen to be a fan of several dub-actors: Colleen Clinkenbeard, Stephanie Young, Jamie Marchi, Clarine Harp, Brittany Karbowski; and many others. All are in attendance, in Sekirei. And all are inspired.In the end however, Heroic deeds, and Heroic strains of Music; cannot take away from the basic component of Sekirei.A sadness beyond all description.I give Sekirei, and it\'s second season ""Pure Engagement"" a 7. college students.

Senki Zesshou Symphogear,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11751/Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear,"['If you hate inconsistencies, stupid plot devices, a horribly flawed setting, and poor characterization, the first season of Senki Zesshou Symphogear is your worst nightmare.The opening episode is deceptively good. We see a concert that\'s animated brilliantly, and it lays out a high-stake story; we witness Kanade die in the past, and Miku crying over Hibiki\'s grave in the future. This image the anime painted itself in the first episode is one of the greatest deceptions I\'ve witnessed in any form of media.After the first episode, the animation quality drops dramatically. Epitomizing this is a scene as early as episode 3 where Tsubasa is walking...along the corridor with her manager, which looks like a GIF pasted on top of a moving background. It\'s obvious that most of the animation time went to the first episode, leaving them to cut back as much as they could throughout the rest of the series. In fairness, the consistency of the animation recovered in the second half, and it did not detract from the finale.The soundtrack is quite enjoyable, and goes some way to make up for the animation. The songs they sing as they fight are solid and it can bring an atmosphere to fights that is otherwise missing. The Opening is fine and fits the series very well, but I personally preferred the ED, ""Meteor Light"" by Takagaki Ayahi. It took a while for it to grow on me, but it\'s a track that sounds dark and traumatic, which fits the atmosphere the series and the character it represents.The characterization of the protagonists is done poorly, and their development is haphazard and oftentimes bizarre. There\'s an instance where a character hates another one so much she\'s tried to kill her, but her hate is instantly forgotten when the other character points out that her room is messy.  However, whilst the protagonist is annoying, the majority of the cast are actually likeable, particularly as the series finds its identity along the way.Unsurprisingly, the plot is also lacking. It\'s a very simple, the one plot twist the series has is so obvious that you can identify it 5 episode before. The simplicity works for Symphogear though, as it manages to avoid being too disastrous throughout most the series. However, in the final few episodes, the tone and scope of the story go beyond previous proportion to such a ridiculous extent that you will be blindsided. In hindsight of later series, this ridiculousness becomes a strength of the franchise, but in this first season where the expectations of a more serious and gritty tone have been set, this causes straight up whiplash.The setting is also so tremendously flawed that whilst you can happily ignore it if you so wish, even minor probing will expose questions to which there are no answers. For example, with the frequent attacks by the Noise, which you cannot defend yourself against and kill everyone in the areas they attack, why do people go outside so casually? Much as I like the outdoors, I can\'t hep but think that I like living more. Also, much as I love my current house, if there was constantly the threat of death, I think I\'d move.With this all in mind, this is a very bad first season. However, there is one thing that works in Symphogear\'s favour that saves it from the worst, and that is that it\'s earnest in it\'s stupidity. Whilst at the beginning it has pretensions of being taken seriously, by the end all pretention is lost, which means it is very hard to hate. The characters that I hated at the start of the series grew on me, to the point I liked almost all of them. Take the girl who\'s lines almost solely consist of failed meta-comedy attempts like ""If this were an anime"" which infuriated me at the start, towards the end I almost found her habits endearing.It\'s a strange quality of an anime like Symphogear, which whilst terrible, is still enjoyable to the extent where I looked forward to the last few episodes. I wanted to see if the episodes could outdo themselves in their silliness, but more importantly, in their fun. In future seasons, the franchise found it\'s identity as a ridiculous tongue-in-cheek show, with plenty of characters to root for. It\'s a shame that the first entry so badly mistook the tone it should be going for.So, if you are happy to ignore all that is wrong with this anime, then you will be able to enjoy it.

It\'s obvious that most of the animation time went to the first episode, leaving them to cut back as much as they could throughout the rest of the series. In fairness, the consistency of the animation recovered in the second half, and it did not detract from the finale.The soundtrack is quite enjoyable, and goes some way to make up for the animation. The songs they sing as they fight are solid and it can bring an atmosphere to fights that is otherwise missing. The Opening is fine and fits the series very well, but I personally preferred the ED, ""Meteor Light"" by Takagaki Ayahi.

This is pretty much action-y, but at the same time, it has a pretty deep story to it, and is kind of entertaining. For people that love action, I think you guys may or may not like this anime, since the action isn\'t really the main focus, cuz they focus more on the plot I would say..Story 8/10Started of pretty good on how they kind of went to the future, and then goes back to what happen to get there, like a lot of anime I know. It...moves at a good pace, and that\'s good since in my opinion it explained to me more about what\'s going on. Mostly this anime probably wants the watcher to be sad when they watch it, but it turns out to be a pretty happy story after watching all the episodes.Art 7/10They could make some more improvements on the way the made the characters, since in some scenes, after they got beaten up pretty badly. They came back fighting looking fresh as new in so little time. Of course, they have quick regeneration skills, but still I don\'t think it\'s suppose to be that quick. Sometimes, the motion when the character walks seems kinda unrealistic and that\'s, for me, a disturbing thing.Sound 8/10Not bad at the sound. The pitch when the characters scream, sweep, or are cheerful is very good. The best part of the sound I liked is the part where they make the crying of some characters pretty short. In some anime they just made the crying very long, which is pretty annoying, maybe because they want to waste time cuz they can\'t think of anything.Character 8/10It\'s great to find anime were the character doesn\'t piss you off so much that you just wanna smash your head into your keyboard. The characters are well made. The way they act, and talk to each other seems pretty much like real life. On top of that, a character tries to make this anime sounds like it\'s really ""not"" an anime, and that it was real life for them.Enjoyment 9/10I don\'t really think I could say much, since I saw the rating on this anime, and it\'s not that good at all. For me, it was a nice experience watching this, and I don\'t really think a fan of a serious action would wanna watch this, since the action in this anime is not quite that great, and the moves the characters have are repeated a lot of times, and there a not a lot of new moves.Overall 8/10I guess this is my final say on how good the anime was during my time watching it. This is, I think, a pretty girly anime.... I say that cuz of the not so violence parts ( even though there was a lot of blood ) in this anime. Maybe if they increased the intensity of the fights, that might have helped to give it a higher rating.. moves at a good pace, and that\'s good since in my opinion it explained to me more about what\'s going on.

The storyline felt like someone decided to animate a fanfic for a much better series. There were these honest traces of something better in the storyline. It fell flat because of the cliches within the series and because of how much of a Mary Sue the main character is.In the first episode I was left asking why Hibiki was so special compared to all the other people who exist in this world. She's not special because she has any sort of talent, something she constantly admits. Her childhood is bland...and uneventful, yet Kanade sings her Swan song in the first episode sacrificing herself just so Hibiki can live despite the fact it doesn't feel as if Kanade needed to sing her Swan song to save Hibiki's life. Instead, Kanade's death is simply a tool the writer used to give Hibiki her amazing powers so that she can be the heroine of the series.The theme of sacrifice is another place where this series falls flat. At the beginning of the series it is played up as being a very important theme but by the end it honestly feels like a joke. It is instead replaced by the theme that everyone can get along by everyone talking things out. Everyone else has a mind frame that violence will solve everything, but Hibiki is difference because Hibiki is so innocent and naïve that she honestly believes there is a better way when people are human. In the long run, it is Hibiki's character that destroys the storyline.Of course, Hibiki does have a few flaws up her sleeves to make the viewers not think she is a Mary Sue. She is at the beginning of the series horribly klutzy and she can't do anything right. This is fine when she first gains her powers because she has problems in her first fight. However, after this she receives no training from the government so she can fight the noise, she is allowed to run around on her own letting her klutziness in the way.Added to this, Tsubasa wants nothing to do with her because Hibiki reminds her too much about Kanade, and yet it would make more sense for Tsubasa to protect the one thing of Kanade she has left. Many of the characters don't get fleshed out and the way Hibiki gets over her flaw is just ridiculous. Her naivity also isn't played up as a flaw either, but it is actually her strong point as it allows her an innocent outlook on life that is willing to accept everyone who is human with no qualms what-so-ever.The art is really good and the sound is good at points, but they also like to play the main characters songs as being more special then anyone elses, including the other students from a music academy of all things. and uneventful, yet Kanade sings her Swan song in the first episode sacrificing herself just so Hibiki can live despite the fact it doesn't feel as if Kanade needed to sing her Swan song to save Hibiki's life.

Have you ever seen a new series not based off anything else where it\'s simply stand alone and thought it would be good? I had these impressions only to be gunned down at point blank.One does not simply fail to execute new.Yes, I took that gag straight out of Mordor but seriously though. How do you fail to execute a rare or new idea? You make something like this, I myself thought this would have been interesting but was found on the wrong end of the spectrum. Essentially what we...have here are robotic hybrids pummeling non existent creatures while singing extremely poorly. The pacing of the story jumps back and forth too often. It\'s just another one of those hero super power themes that the average fanboy/fangirl can add to their fantasies.An approach on the story is pretty poor, you get a glimpse of what happens from the beginning as we hear of misfortune and death. This high-tech organization forces artifacts onto young girls so they can transform into these robotic hybrids and fight the evil known as ""Noise"". That\'s the rare or new idea but its executed all wrong. The themes from the plot line like friendship and hard times are cooked over done so not even a bit of juice remains. It has a bit of government espionage but that\'s rubbish and over done as well.Now the art and music are more on the flashy side and distract quite too often, so much that I\'m not really paying attention to whats happening. The art style is definitely flashy with the unique transformations that occur throughout scenes. Another thing that distracts me is the horrible English lines that are spat and literally translated so it makes virtually no sense. Stick to the Japanese guys, sorry if we butcher your Japanese but now we know how you feel. Another poor thing to point out would be the singing. Almost each and every one of these girls cannot sing worth a damn and its ear grinding to hear English verses.Now the characters are about generic as you come. The main heroines trying to save the world from evil is definitely not new by and aspect, look at things like Sailor Moon. The characters themselves almost have a shoujo-ai feeling to them and the hints are fairly obvious to anyone into the genre.

This is because, I find the combination of the following genres; action, fantasy, magical girl, music and sci-fi doesn\'t seem to be properly combined, in fact the genres seem to cancel out each other, this thing can be compared to a good movie being turned into some sissy musical stage theatrics. Ok, so there other animes that do feature songs and actions in them, true, co\'z in those animes the musical is not the main genre, here on the other hand the main genres sci-fi and musical seem...to don\'t mix at all. So for the story, I give it a ""Fair"" number 6, since the sci-fi genre could have made this anime good, but combined with the musical genre and magical girl actually puts the story down.Art: Mediocre number 5.Don\'t ask, I always rate it like that.Sound: Poor number 3.Co\'z I don\'t like any of the songs and it inculdes both the opening and closing.Character: Decent number 4.I much rather prefer to see Hibiki and Tsubasa fighting those Noise things, than have them singing while fighting them Noise.Enjoyment and Overall: Poor number 3.I just don\'t like the poorly combined musical and sci-fi things that goes with this anime.By the way, in most anime/manga social sites the sci-fi genre is inculded for this anime.

I dunno why all the other scores for this show are so low or what kind of no-nonsense all-business attitudes people had while watching this air, but holy crap are you missing out on a fun time if you judge this based on conventional merits.Let me give you a few tips about watching Symphogear:1. Get a drink. not a hardcore drink. Nothing with vodka. Just throw some peppermint schnopps...into a smoothie. Or grab a hard cider. Just make sure it\'s fruity or sugary and that it tastes good.2. Set up a BIG SCREEN. Get a projector, or a massive flat-screen TV. Make sure this thing covers an entire wall.3. Turn UP the volume. Don\'t worry about your ears, they\'ll be dead soon anyways with the way our generation listens to music. Within a minute you won\'t care about the pounding pressure on your eardrums because the singing from the first scene will be like an enchanting siren luring you away from the confines of reality.4. Don\'t stop to think about anything unless that thought is incredibly stupid.Senki Zesshou Symphogear, a title I just shamelessly crl+c\'d from the top of this page, is one of the absolutely dumbest shows out there. The show has about 3000 different tones crammed into each episode, the characters spew incomprehensible muddled philosophy and nonsense from long-forgotten action movies, the plot was seemingly written by the same guy who spearheaded Mars of Destruction, and the direction can\'t decide if this is an idol show or a horror movie. However, in spite of all this, Symphogear is not bad. Yes, you heard me, SYMPHOGEAR IS A GOOD SHOW, because what Symphogear is is fun, and fun is good. There is only one way to watch a show like this: to throw yourself into it completely, to get wildly over-invested in the petty drama and bullshit character turns. You can\'t half-ass it. I repeat, you CANNOT HALF-ASS THIS SHOW. You cannot wait for it to come to you, to entertain you through your one-in headphone and half-closed eyes. You must cast yourself into the ABYSS, and there you will discover new, nonsensical truths, such as the truth that Hibiki is in fact a Bear Grylls-Ghandi hybrid and a fucking BEAST or the truth that MY GIRL MIKU has all of the chaotic emotional complexity of an especially tormented FAULKNER PROTAGONIST and that she will go down in history as a LEGEND and a TRIUMPH over the darkness of human nature.It\'s actually a very difficult thing to achieve, to hit the \'so stupid and nonsensical that it\'s hilarious\' button while also holding down the \'actually care about the characters\' lever, but I believe that the key lies in a couple of rather important choices Symphogear makes. First of all, it\'s not ALL stupid. It doesn\'t reinvent itself every episode or try to just spam random for kicks. It tries to stick to a central story and some cohesive character arcs that it takes very seriously, and it\'s the fact that Symphogear is actually tied together by something earnest and traditional that makes all of its dumb, off-the-wall moments so much more effective. Its shockingly out-of-place side plots ARE actually out of place, which makes them MUCH funnier, and the fact that it doesn\'t take things to the very extremes of ""wtf"" TOO often means that when it does, it\'s a golden chocolate treat rather than an overused device. There\'s an ample amount of petty melodrama in the show that keeps the overarching plot from ever being the backbone the series is resting on, which is very much a good thing. Also, the fact that the show saves all of its biggest cards for the end means that it has a legitimate build with an insane payoff, and you\'ll likely find yourself cheering and screaming at the screen all at once for the last four episodes straight if you\'re watching the show properly (as described above.) Finally though, Symphogear\'s greatest asset is simple and easy: clean, honest positivity. The show never gets nasty or negative, nor does it descend into the world of cheap gimmicks like questionable fan-service or out-of-nowhere dark twists. In an era polluted by cynicism, Symphogear just wants to have a good time with the characters that it loves so dearly, and THAT is invaluable.So, yeah. Don\'t listen to the haters. Don\'t worry about the details. Just jump around, yell at the screen, and aggressively cheer for Chris. This show has no deep message or profound moments or original plot devices.It just wants to see you grinning like an idiot. into a smoothie. Or grab a hard cider. Just make sure it\'s fruity or sugary and that it tastes good.2. Set up a BIG SCREEN. Get a projector, or a massive flat-screen TV. Make sure this thing covers an entire wall.3. Turn UP the volume.

The show has about 3000 different tones crammed into each episode, the characters spew incomprehensible muddled philosophy and nonsense from long-forgotten action movies, the plot was seemingly written by the same guy who spearheaded Mars of Destruction, and the direction can\'t decide if this is an idol show or a horror movie. However, in spite of all this, Symphogear is not bad. Yes, you heard me, SYMPHOGEAR IS A GOOD SHOW, because what Symphogear is is fun, and fun is good. There is only one way to watch a show like this: to throw yourself into it completely, to get wildly over-invested in the petty drama and bullshit character turns. You can\'t half-ass it. I repeat, you CANNOT HALF-ASS THIS SHOW. You cannot wait for it to come to you, to entertain you through your one-in headphone and half-closed eyes. You must cast yourself into the ABYSS, and there you will discover new, nonsensical truths, such as the truth that Hibiki is in fact a Bear Grylls-Ghandi hybrid and a fucking BEAST or the truth that MY GIRL MIKU has all of the chaotic emotional complexity of an especially tormented FAULKNER PROTAGONIST and that she will go down in history as a LEGEND and a TRIUMPH over the darkness of human nature.It\'s actually a very difficult thing to achieve, to hit the \'so stupid and nonsensical that it\'s hilarious\' button while also holding down the \'actually care about the characters\' lever, but I believe that the key lies in a couple of rather important choices Symphogear makes. First of all, it\'s not ALL stupid. It doesn\'t reinvent itself every episode or try to just spam random for kicks. It tries to stick to a central story and some cohesive character arcs that it takes very seriously, and it\'s the fact that Symphogear is actually tied together by something earnest and traditional that makes all of its dumb, off-the-wall moments so much more effective. Its shockingly out-of-place side plots ARE actually out of place, which makes them MUCH funnier, and the fact that it doesn\'t take things to the very extremes of ""wtf"" TOO often means that when it does, it\'s a golden chocolate treat rather than an overused device. There\'s an ample amount of petty melodrama in the show that keeps the overarching plot from ever being the backbone the series is resting on, which is very much a good thing. Also, the fact that the show saves all of its biggest cards for the end means that it has a legitimate build with an insane payoff, and you\'ll likely find yourself cheering and screaming at the screen all at once for the last four episodes straight if you\'re watching the show properly (as described above.) Finally though, Symphogear\'s greatest asset is simple and easy: clean, honest positivity. The show never gets nasty or negative, nor does it descend into the world of cheap gimmicks like questionable fan-service or out-of-nowhere dark twists. In an era polluted by cynicism, Symphogear just wants to have a good time with the characters that it loves so dearly, and THAT is invaluable.So, yeah. Don\'t listen to the haters. Don\'t worry about the details. Just jump around, yell at the screen, and aggressively cheer for Chris. This show has no deep message or profound moments or original plot devices.It just wants to see you grinning like an idiot.', ""Despite a weak start and a weak team of writers, Symphogear still manages to be somewhat enjoyable if just for the absurdity of it all.Unfortunately it doesn't seem to deliver the type of dark story we are shown in the first episode, rather the show is riddled with Dues Ex Machinas and plot holes. The characters and their backgrounds are written at a barely passable quality, but fortunately this seems to get better as the show goes on (except for the background characters who remain terrible the entire show).Fortunately I found the music, gear design and battle scenes made up for the rest of the...weakness - the songs are beautiful (especially in the last episode) and full of energy and the Symphogear units remain fun to watch the entire time.If you're willing to let the poor writing slide and enjoy the show for it's good qualities you'll find it enjoyable. On the other hand if plot holes, flat characters and contrived backstories are a pet peeve of yours you will probably want to avoid the show.The amazingly ridiculous, absurd battles in the last three episodes made the entire show worth it for me in the end. weakness - the songs are beautiful (especially in the last episode) and full of energy and the Symphogear units remain fun to watch the entire time.If you're willing to let the poor writing slide and enjoy the show for it's good qualities you'll find it enjoyable.

I gave an overall score of 8, which could come from my love for the music of Nana Mizuki, but I do believe there are serious flaws in this anime.Story:The story is the main flaw in Senki Zesshou Symphogear. I actually am impressed that they made an anime of 13 episodes which doesn\'t feel rushed even though quite some things happen. But the ""why"" in why are things happening is explained but when you hear it, it\'s kind of lame. Though the concept around...the ""true reason"" is actually nice. I believe they should have made is 26 episodes and not 13, this way they could have made the plot better.Art:The art is not especially impressive, but (and I\'m trying not to spoil here) the art while fighting is different and I like it =) Though understand that while I\'m saying that the art is not especially impressive, it\'s just that the art is at a level that I\'ve come to expect and hope from anime. The series is well animated.Sound:Well, you\'ve got me there. Nana Mizuki for the win! But seriously, the music is good and it gives something extra to certain scenes. They re-use songs in the anime, but what I also noticed is that some songs actually represent the growth in the characters. So besides the fact that I just like this kind of music, it was also very well chosen.Characters:Surprisingly for an anime with only 13 episodes, the characters go through quite some growth without feeling rushed. The feelings they portray are also quite understandable and when you think how you would feel in that person\'s place, you usually come to the conclusion you would probably feel the same (well, at least a part. I will never end up in the situations they end up in).Enjoyment:For some brainless entertainment with good music, I say yes I enjoyed it quite a lot. I found myself craving for the next episode because I just wanted to know how it would go on, but constantly had to wait another week.Overall:Like i mentioned before, for some brainless entertainment with good music and without too much going on that you won\'t understand: it\'s good. I suppose you have to like this kind of anime, but if you do you will enjoy it. If you want an anime that\'s very wel thought through, with an in depth story line: this is not your anime. Since I like to have some easier animes once in a while, I enjoyed it quite a lot and perhaps even rewatch it sometime. Even though the rewatch value is quite low, as you will understand after the last episode. ;)Well that was my opinion on Senki Zesshou Symphogear, hope it helped =)cheers! the ""true reason"" is actually nice.

In order to use the relics that power their Symphogear suits, the girls must sing certain songs. The different songs they sing give them different powers ranging from charging up their suit to unleashing their strongest attack which has a recoil effect on them when used.Despite a visually promising concert scene in the beginning of the first episode, the story falls to pieces almost immediately. It seems almost as if the organization working with the Symphogear girls...expected the Noise to attack the concert where the girls were singing in order to revive a powerful relic. So why risk the lives of thousands of eager concert-goers who get caught in the fray when the Noise do show up? This may seem like a minor plot problem (aside from the hundreds of carbonized dead bodies), but similar plot issues like this build up after a while and become difficult to ignore. The two girls, Kanade and Tsubasa, who had been performing then change their songs and begin fighting the Noise in order to save the frantic mass of people who are all scrambling for the exits. However, our main protagonist, Hibiki, gets trapped while trying to get away and ends up getting injured despite the singers\' efforts to save her. Since mentioning some things that happen in the first episode would be a spoiler, I\'ll stop the initial summary there.There are many more problems with the story, but most of them occur with several sudden changes in characters\' personalities in addition to the nonsensical ending. The characters in this show get over their anger at others in the most illogical ways ranging from having someone clean their room to just deciding out of nowhere that they should be friends again. The Swan Songs (which are the girls\' ultimate attacks) also deal less and less of a self-damaging recoil every time they occur in the anime for some unexplained reason.As for the characters themselves, they are hardly unique at all. Hibiki is basically a weaker and more annoying version of Kaname Madoka who accepts her power a bit faster (they are also both voiced by Aoi Yuki). As for the other main characters, they are a girl who likes to fight alone and dislikes Hibiki for reasons in their past and a tsuntsun girl who has a hard time understanding other people\'s perspectives of the world. The villain is just an annoying sadist who enjoys being nude and has no appeal aside from her excellent voice actor (who still couldn\'t save her from being annoying).Being an anime with a heavy focus on music, you would expect a great soundtrack. While this is the strongest category, it\'s only barely above average. For much of the earlier episodes, the music plays almost non-stop switching from track to track with hardly any break. It got to the point where I was grateful for some of the scenes later on when they finally paused the soundtrack for part of a scene. None of the tracks stood out much either aside from one hard rock track that was used to accompany Yukine\'s fights. Much of the rest of the music consists of the j-pop/techno combinations used for both the songs sung by the characters\' as well as the background music. There were also some problems with the volume of the music/singing when used while characters were speaking at times.Oh, and this anime has some of the worst Engrish I\'ve ever heard to the point where the subbers provided subs for it and even fixed the grammar at some points to make it more understandable.The animation is the most inconsistent category. It looks like a quarter of the entire animation budget for this show was used during the two concert scenes. Compared to these scenes (especially around episode 3 and 4) the animation takes a nosedive. That\'s not to say it\'s all bad aside from those two scenes, however there are some moments where a single motionless shot will stay for almost twenty seconds or the animation just looks like a couple gifs pasted on top of each other. There is also one scene where a character is looking down out of a library window and sees two characters in a hospital room, but when you see out of the window from the hospital room, there is no library (or any buildings at all) in sight. Similarly to Evangelion, this anime also reuses the same shots of the main organization\'s headquarters many times.Story - 3/10Animation - 5/10Sound - 6/10Characters - 3/10Enjoyment - 3/10Overall - 4/10The many faults in this series build up over time and prevent it from being very enjoyable. It\'s uncreative premise of saving the world from mysterious creatures which has been done much better hundreds of times doesn\'t allow for much right from the start. The bland characters, mediocre soundtrack despite being a music anime, and the inconsistent animation don\'t do much to save it either. I recommend skipping this anime and watching something like Gurren Lagann, Evangelion, or Madoka Magica if you want something similar but much better. expected the Noise to attack the concert where the girls were singing in order to revive a powerful relic.

So you  wait for the 1st to debut.So you watch the 1st episode and if you can tell a crappy anime by from just watching the 1st 5 minutes like me, you high expectations are dropped really low. Basically what you got is...Gundam meet's magical girls....or so you thought. What really get's under my skin about this anime is that not that's it cliche, but the singing while their fighting. SO instead of Gundam meet;s magical girls, you get K-On meet's Infinte Stratos with a dash of Mega Man Starforce 3.Story-6- Aliens or some mystical being's called noise (rip off from Mega Man Star force) randomly kill people for no reason and the only way to defend yourself against these monsters is sing, have faith and armor will randomly manifest from your body 0.o.Art-8- as always the seasonl anime art is very good and i was impressed :).  BUT! that's the only thing good about this anime and that's not even much.Sound-4- sounds like wanting to shove a fork through my eardrums. The singing while fighting is probably the reason why i dropped this (no seriously the have to sing to power up....)Character-4- cliche female protagonist, nothing special, not even bothering.Enjoyment-1- pathetic, i tried my best to enjoy this piece of crap but couldn't.So yeah, this anime at the very least is not what your going to expect period. Whether if ou expected to be good or bad. But when you try to mix moe and action, will singing and fighting you get a epic fail. Dont watch this.... unless your horny.

Dont watch this.... unless your horny."", ""A hidden gem that shines tremendously bright.Symphogear is pretty much the best Anime I have seen to date, and my immediate pick when asked for an absolute favorite.There are simply so many things done so well, I couldn't hope to cover even half talking for days on end. The show feels powerful to watch, and was absolutely mesmerizing when turned on for the very first time. It genuinely blew me away so far and so fast, it'll be a very tough act to follow. And yet, it does, 4 more times.----Symphogear has a good plot, but it doesn't spell out the conflict immediately, and instead...prepares what may appear to be unrelated story elements. It does take a little while before the villains, Finé and Chris, are properly introduced, until which point the B plot is focused on a lot more. Said B plot is still good, but being primarily non-combat-performance segments there isn't much opportunity to use the precise style that make the rest of Symphogear so exceptional. I would say, though, that this hesitance to get going pays off, as it allows for the escalation in the last act to have a much bigger payoff. At the same time, the elements i mentioned being setup each have a logical purpose in the climax, making for very satisfying viewing.As for characters, there are each written very well. A great part of this is because, I'm led to believe, the central few take inspiration from their actual VAs, most notably Tsubasa and Hibiki. Such a technique isn't too common, but it does work nicely toward making the characters and their actions feel realistic. These two, along with Hibiki's companion Miku and the already mentioned Chris form the most integral characters, and they are given enough time to establish arcs, as well as all to reach toward the same conclusion, which is paced very well, especially as they coincide with the culmination of the plot.The side characters are also really fun. They're given a lot less screentime, but use it well. Commander Genjuuro in particular is a charm to watch, and he thankfully gets expanded on a lot more in later seasons. Yumi, another of Hibiki's friends, also makes for decent comic relief, and even gets a small joke arc of her own near the end. The final villain Finé is perhaps the weakest significant character, and the large bulk of her defining moments come later in the series.----Then, there is Symphogear's greatest asset: the music. It's absolutely godlike, to put it mildly. The only place I've been able to find a better soundtrack is the sequels. Symphogear unveils a new song almost every episode, and the talent behind them is incredible. Each character has a distinct and easily recalled theme, that not only synchronizes with their fighting style but actually represents it. Not only that, but the singing, all expert of course, is integrated really well by being fully diegetic. The VAs stumble a lyric when their characters fall, and just scream the line when performing a powerful move. It manages to fully realise the logistics of singing while fighting and make it believable that the music exists in-universe. And that's not even addressing the OP and ED, a pair of songs that fit the show perfectly and are excellent themselves to boot.Regretfully, Symphogear has rather sub-par art and animation. I've always attested these are the least important aspects to an Anime, despite the name, and considering how good Symphogear is in all other areas I'm only reinforced of this thought. Nevertheless, I should cover it. While the designs of the characters and especially the Symphogears themselves are really good, they are best seen in the artstyle of the sequels. Critical scenes do maintain reasonable animation, and despite the sparse lighting there are a lot of good set designs.Which segues of course into the world design. There are a surprising amount of superstructures in Symphogear, and far more show up on the sequels. They do look pretty good, and are distinct enough to be easily recognisable. The Noise are a mixed bag, as I thought the designs of the most common Noise were great, but some of the larger, rarer types I didn't too much of a shine to. Their abilities were very unique, however, making them a suddenly much more formidable force. That just about leaves the lore of the Relics and Symphogears themselves, and as something of a mythology buff I can attest that research was done. The abilities and forms some take match the stories behind them, and others are creatively re-imagined.I'd also want to take a moment to mention the stylisation of the combat. Most noticeably is the use of showing the attack name on screen rather than shouting it out. After all, it would interrupt the song. Every character has their own individual font, audio cue and naming convention, not to mention a unique way of using their weapons. Just flashing the name long enough to read it is a very good way of keeping the flow of a fight intact while still giving the intended impact to powerful moves, and something that I'd like to see other series do more often. The pacing is also absolutely exquisite. Tying each battle to a song makes a lot of sense, as the structure of verse and chorus translates surprising effectively. It prevents anything from being too drawn out, and makes an unexpectedly good tracker of when a character is gearing up for a powerful move just from where they are in their lyrics.---And that's the crux, I think. Singing and fighting go together far better than anyone would think, and bringing them together along with fun characters, a great world, lots of style and making sure that said fighting and singing is just a sight, or rather sound, to behold, makes a show that's as close to perfect as can be.I would absolutely, in case it wasn't profusely obvious already, recommend Symphogear. prepares what may appear to be unrelated story elements.

A good head-start to gain fans\' attention. This anime can combine two different anime fields : shojo with music and shonen with battle and mecha. This makes the whole anime became Divine InterventionThe story is scored A, thanks to radically different story compared to any other anime. All anime have their unique stories, but this anime featuring music and battle simultaneously instead of mere music competition. This item makes the SZS anime stands out compared to any other anime as an intersection of battle anime and music anime. Whole anime...themselves is already radically different from any similar anime.The story swings from fighting against enemy (creep in DotA) then internal conflict. After the conflict resolved, encountering the real boss and case closed. All this in 13 episodes, less than adequate for the whole three major arcs while normally three major arcs will require two periods (one period == one season).Art is rated as A. Nothing much different from any other mecha anime. The design is somewhere a mixture of futuristic and present design. All futuristic anime usually discard the present technology, saving spaces for hi-tech which is included in the far future sub-chapter or even not written in ""Physics of the Future"" book written by Michio Kaku. This balances the penalty given in the fields of character design due to overly standard.The armor is quite similar to Infinite Stratos with minimum torso protection and good extremities protection while differs only in size and capability. With this armor, it should be easy to re-draw the characters (excluding the other class of armor which provides extra armor).One can easily distinguish the differences between concert scene and street pursuit scene from the side of animation itself. The concert scene (only twice in whole anime) is very well-drawn, almost divine intervention. On other hand, the street pursuit scene is very similar to almost identical to GTA San Andreas-era video game. Those two aspects are offsetting each other with advantage in the concert which is the main theme for the anime.Sound is rated A. Guaranteed by Elements Garden and Nana Mizuki, Synchrogazer stands out a lot for any other anime Opening track. The other songs featured varies in type, from upbeat in \'Gyakkou no Flugel\' or something likely to an aria song which is the Zesshou.Other songs also gained high value because of the interest of those song (proven by high traffic in my blog for those entries). Say like \'FLIGHT FEATHERS\' by Nana Mizuki and \'Tsunaida Te Dake ga Tsumugu Mono\' by Ayahi Takagaki that is very well-sung.Characters is rated A due to the standard design. Play it safe, S.S.D.D.. On the one hand, there is a characters dead early in the anime which can be a severe penalty. This penalty is offset by further development which result in more or less idealistic characters.Enjoyment is also rated A. Nothing much to be commented except the elegant battle. In some parts, there are yuri scene which can raise the score for enjoyment or reduce, depends on how one sees yuri scene. This enjoyment is also offset by partial nudity and NSFW (for some countries) battle dress. themselves is already radically different from any similar anime.The story swings from fighting against enemy (creep in DotA) then internal conflict. After the conflict resolved, encountering the real boss and case closed. All this in 13 episodes, less than adequate for the whole three major arcs while normally three major arcs will require two periods (one period == one season).Art is rated as A. Nothing much different from any other mecha anime. The design is somewhere a mixture of futuristic and present design. All futuristic anime usually discard the present technology, saving spaces for hi-tech which is included in the far future sub-chapter or even not written in ""Physics of the Future"" book written by Michio Kaku. This balances the penalty given in the fields of character design due to overly standard.The armor is quite similar to Infinite Stratos with minimum torso protection and good extremities protection while differs only in size and capability. With this armor, it should be easy to re-draw the characters (excluding the other class of armor which provides extra armor).One can easily distinguish the differences between concert scene and street pursuit scene from the side of animation itself. The concert scene (only twice in whole anime) is very well-drawn, almost divine intervention. On other hand, the street pursuit scene is very similar to almost identical to GTA San Andreas-era video game. Those two aspects are offsetting each other with advantage in the concert which is the main theme for the anime.Sound is rated A.

Not gonna spoil what happens because i am gonna give you my depth of what happened in the production. Also, keep in mind that i will explain why it was badly subbed since that is like a total red flag for me because i know one guy who is that dumb to talk about translations you know him well as he is- the problem is why I don't consider it's translation to be the fault, but rather it's hellish production to make it a final...good product.So, what do you call a magical girl anime that mixed multiple genres, but has the nerve to be bonkers with flaws and well-balanced lore? You get Symphogear or what i call shojo in a nutshell.''This is like an anime!'' - Meme Girl.You know I am gonna be completely fair with everyone. I hated Magical Girls a lot while i was in High School and hated them a lot, this one, however, opens itself to me during it's original broadcast but it took me years to complete only to find out it's last two seasons (AXZ and XV) sucked like dog shit. Here is the thing. Magical girls are more of a sub-genre than a main one since most of them tend to be just silly and stupid depending on what it happens. While i am aware of Toei did to the Precure series over the years becoming it's cash cow like Super Sentai and Kamen Rider. Madoka and Nanoha are edgier twisted to put it politely. But, here is something i never expected to watch. A magical anime that actually has good writing for once. Symphogear is a well-made magical girl anime that took it's own in the industry and loves to be creative, but over the years it's fandom has become too annoying to tolerate and i don't want to into the full details i will not explain why.Origin:Around the time my final year in year in middle school started in 2011 and this was in development so i decide to check it out, since my favorite anime Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D's came to a conclusion one year before this premiered which they share no connection since Zexal around it's time made me want to just rage quite at it's terrible MC who i still to this day hate i gave Symphogear a chance, but to be clear this was years ago so my memory is not 100% since it's been years. Anyway, it made developed by Studio Satelight. It was written by Akifumi Kaneko and directed by Tatsumi Ito. But here is where it's real problem begins.Production hell:For years, Symphogear has been thru mostly bad production hell and it took them about 7 years to complete it not that it was bad, but mostly the fault came in the production since it's the staff was passionate but mostly lazy to start work, it leads to it's first season knowing the most mix-bag in terms of production and yet Attack On Titan is so overhyped and turned to crap in the end! Anyway, when it came to Season it had mostly sub-par animation, pacing problems, plot holes and mostly bad writing left and right, so why do people blame it for it's translation but doesn't explain it's production hell? Because people always point out the most obvious shit. Blame whatever it's trending. Hell, i wasn't even sure why the fault always gets blamed on the sub-translation in a modern society where everything is just incomplete. To make a small list of reasons why production hell is a thing i got plenty of reasons because it either depends on the length of the show or it's success. Any hiccups before or after is common (Looking at you Pokemon Journeys), but what really makes it feel flawed it's it's staff understanding it to be what it's supposed to be and not some mainstream anime like EVA who turns out to be complete garbage or something like One Piece that doesn't ever end because pointless filler. Heck, what happens in a show's development is mostly animation problems and writing problems and not endless hell holes left and right, but to make it so good have people come back to it. The actual problem with most anime in terms of production is the whole ''miss information'' which is often the problem why anime can't be accepted with open arms. One can pinpoint the origin of anime production, but never accept it and only resolve to lie and lie about it - getting people made and accepting the false truth. Hell, people being mad at Symphogear is mostly Season 1 for it's bad production and late completion deadline since it was in development hell for months and unlike the later seasons, this one was in fact the most honest.Let's divide this into smaller topics to understand what i am referring to, despite it can get messy from here.- Plots are mostly bad because of writing problems in the staff due to budget cuts or heavy laking elements.- Pacing problems are mostly made to be that way because it depends on the script and the writing as a while- Animation is based off its resources and not it's money since most newer projects start off with less production quality- Writing issues can be from either goofing off or being too pretentious and not lacking fundamentals to keep your staff in check- Narrative problems can from mostly what the pacing or writing tends to become and not be allowed free staff- Storyboard comes off either half-baked or semi-limited because it makes it more clear why it has to be sorta polished over time to not let it stagnant with lower C-tier productionThe sole fault of a show depends on whether the writers or the director are not doing their job right can resolve in a show being made into literal shit in the end unless it's proven to be handmade by its producer.Tatsumi Ito. Before his death in 2020 never worked on Symphogear again because he left due to his own reason or was hired prior to G because he kinda fucked up the first season due a rumor i first heard in 2019 he got into a fight with Katsumi Ono who also worked on the show and made things looks worse but it was either clear or confirmed since i can't tell if this true or not. Two if it's good episodes are the only thing that stand-out from the rest in terms of production quality. Heck, Ono Katsumi was original gonna be the director, but Ito was first.

Heck, you thought Metal Gear Rising had peak music, so why not get a load of Symphogear's music?Final Verdict: Decent and well-made.

When I saw the summary I thought ""Hmm they sing and fight this is a silly plot, I may try it though. I don\'t realy have allot of animes to watch this season .""  Then I learned that Nana Mizuki(wich is one of my favorite singers) will...be one of the VA\'s I decided to check it out since it won\'t be that bad if she is perfectly matched with her character.It turned to be better than I originaly expected. The songs were perfectly matched with the fight scenes and characters. It also didn\'t have those long a*s(couldn\'t find a better expression) transformantion scenes wich show EVERY SINGLE CURVE(not that I hate it, it\'s kind of annoying and embarrasing to watch) of the body while transfering to the next piece of clothing they kept them short and relatively fast. They decided to bet more on the songs than fanservice wich magical/sci-fi fighter gril animes have. Aoi Yuuki and Ayahi Takagaki aren\'t as good singers as Nana Mizuki they still had enjoyable songs for their characters.Thanks to those things the stuff I was able to ignore the generic elements that made up the rest of the anime like monsters and big baddies. Personaly I think they should have concentrated more on the reason they need to be kept secret and the quarrels with America but then they would have needed more episodes. It ended like every other anime like it though with a big monster bad guy.The main characters were realy likeable but the personalities are not that unique. Miku felt like the producers were trolling and thinking ""Kekeke! We will make you think that we will develop her more but that won\'t happen!"" Genjirou was a badass but get\'s a bit overdramatic and felt like he is here only to add some diversity from the all girl fighter atmosphere. The other supporting characters were realy annoying I\'m glad they didn\'t give a bigger role than they already had.Overral a realy enjoyable anime despite the major flaws that magical/sci-fi fighter girl types make me ususaly stray from them.PS: This is my first review and since English isn\'t my mother\'s language I may have spelling gramatical mistakes and typos. be one of the VA\'s I decided to check it out since it won\'t be that bad if she is perfectly matched with her character.It turned to be better than I originaly expected.

I\'ve never been so happy to have accidentally stumbled upon an anime in my life. Also, I will be speaking mainly of this anime, but I will be mentioning the following 2 seasons as well.Now, before we get going, I\'d like to make it clear that this anime is nowhere near perfect. It most definitely has it\'s flaws, some bad animation here, some poor plot choices there, plot armor galore over yonder, I could go on. But that doesn\'t change the fact that this anime does one thing, and it does...it incredibly well:FUN.When a lot of people complain about Symphogear, I always see that they seem to take it too seriously. With that, I tell you, that you should watch this anime for pure, unadulterated, fun, explosions, and a kickass soundtrack that you\'re probably going to be wanting to locate and download. Which I have. All of it. So good.Anyways, on to the actual review.Story:It\'s certainly not a bad story, there are worse ones out there, however you will see that it\'s rather cliche once you start getting a few episodes in. One of the worst parts about Symphogear, is it\'s rather cliche story, and this applies to the following seasons as well, since they all follow the same rough format that season 1 does. However, while looking at it by me saying that, it may seem rather uhh... ""meh"". But, I should also mention, that Symphogear KNOWS that it\'s bad. It knows that it\'s cliche, and it uses that to it\'s advantage. Yes, it\'s a cookie cutter that was built out of the body of season 1, and yes, seasons 2 and 3 were made with that exact same cookie cutter, but DAYUM is that a nice cookie cutter. Normally, if an anime is too cliche, it dies because the audience has seen it before (which admittedly, may very well still apply to some people when they decide to watch this) however, the other aspects of the show are what genuinely carry this anime to glory, the characters, the music, the important animation, all of that combines to patch up those nasty things that the plot just literally can\'t even. I should also mention that the overlying plot is only affected by this. There are a bunch of sub-plots which are actually quite unique and well thought out, for example, the backstories of the main characters.Overall, you\'ve seen this plot before, and you\'ll know it when you see it. But the rest of the anime will more than make up for it, which is impressive considering how important plot tends to be.Art: 7I admit, the animation for this anime kinda dies at points. There\'s a scene where Tsubasa and her Manager are walking down a hall and rather than an animated walking animation, it is merely their unmoving bodies swaying in a small figure 8 pattern. Now, remember what I said about this series being fun? Yeah. It is. ""Bu-but, HOW could it POSSIBLY be fun with animation like THAT!?"" you may ask. Well I\'ll tell you, the animation for unimportant things like that walking scene, or someone writing something down on a piece of paper, THOSE are animated quite poorly sometimes. HOWEVER. The producers of this anime were smart, and funneled most of what little budget they had into the action scenes, and other important scenes. A lot of anime, even high budget anime that have all-round great animation, tend to have action scenes that are simply just as good as the rest of the anime, and when you\'re expecting MORE from an action scene, it can be a little underwhelming. Symphogear, with it\'s poor budget, knocks up the budget big time for their action scenes, making amazing looking scenes that are animated fluidly. I should also add that this anime liked to have it\'s action scenes on the go. While a lot of anime take a lot of camera cuts and angles in rapid succession to show a fight, which works well don\'t get me wrong, Symphogear does it itself a whole bunch, but they ALSO love to follow the action as it moves, meaning you\'ll get panning action sequences at high speed that look simply amazing (not to mention badass as hell) and really gives the viewer an impression of the speed at which the Symphogear users are fighting. While they obviously don\'t do this all the time, you\'ll see it used quite a bit, and it\'s a nice addition. Back to that bad animation for a moment, and also referring to when I said that people always take this anime too seriously if they hate the anime. The bad animation that pops up? It\'s reaally bad. So bad in fact, that it\'s laughable. I actually laugh at this animation, it is so bad. Now I can\'t forgive it for these atrocities of animation, but hey, you can always get a chuckle out of it! I should also mention that while this anime DOES have some very bad animation issues, those absolutely horrendous only pop up around 3 or 4 times in the entire anime, so they don\'t overly take away from it as a whole. Seasons 2 and 3 undergo a SERIOUS budget boost however, and nearly every issue that season one had in regards to animation was fixed, or improved past that.Overall, while this anime has some undeniable animation issues, it isn\'t bad enough to take away from the series enough to ruin the experience.Sound: 10I\'m including the soundtrack in this, it\'s a must. This anime is one that is in the ""Music"" genre, and normally, when you see ""Music"" tagged on to an anime, with a premise like that of Symphogear, you get frilly cute J-Pop songs, or at least, expect them. That is far from what you\'ll be getting out of Symphogear. Let\'s lead in to the  music by starting with the voice actors! Tsubasa is voiced by Nana Mizuki, whom is a very well-off musical artist in Japan. Not only does she do an excellent job of voicing the stoic Tsubasa, she carries that voice into her songs which all have an oriental theme. Nana Mizuki also created and sings the OP of each of the seasons, season 1 being ""Synchrogazer"". Aoi Yuuki voices our main Character, Hibiki Tachibana. Perhaps you\'ve heard Aoi before, she\'s done quite a few roles. Tornado from One Punch Man, Madoka from Madoka Magica, Victorique from Gosick, the list goes on. Aoi isn\'t a song artist, however in this series, she sings all of her own songs, which is a rather impressive feat for anyone. This adds to the immersion of the series, since there is no clear difference in voice, unlike when another person sings a song in place of a voice actor. This applies to every single character in the entire Symphogear anime. Each voice actor does all of their own singing, and they do a damn fine job. Each character even has songs that are styled towards them. As mentioned, Tsubasa sings what I call ""Technoriental""  and Hibiki sings ""Electroceltic"" technobagpipes included. Other characters are introduced later on, one of which sings aggressive rock, and in season 2, another which sings pure electronic, as well as another that sings perhaps a more punk-style of rock. Mentioning the characters further would be too large a spoiler however. Back to the actual music. Every song was crafted FOR the anime, none were taken from elsewhere. The producers made it a priority to make the music as excellent as they possibly could, as the anime revolves around music, and make it well they did indeed. I should now mention that all of these amazing songs are placed in as character songs (songs which are sung by the characters) and of course, since having characters singing all of the time would be stupid, there is regular soundtrack to go alongside it. Nothing too special about it, in all honesty. The background music you hear in scenes without characters singing is just sorta there, nothing too memorable, but not bad either. Just there. As far as voice acting goes... really well done! They got a very solid cast of voice actors, they didn\'t lose out anywhere there, however I should mention that ONLY the first season... has the most horrendous case of Engrish that I\'ve ever heard. Thank god for subtitles. They gave up on attempting English in the following seasons, for good reason. As for the Japanese voice acting, emotions are portrayed very well, Hibiki always sounds like she should, cheery and upbeat, Tsubasa sounds like a strong ""don\'t mess with her"" type, the list goes on.Overall, the character songs make this anime absolutely amazing, and are one of it\'s biggest selling points. The background music and such isn\'t so up to par, but the sheer quality of the character songs truly outshine the little problems that the background music brings forth. While there was a bit of laughably bad Engrish, the voice acting was excellently done, especially with how each voice actor sings their own songs.Characters: 9Each character is very well made, and while maybe cliche in a sense, they use cliches that haven\'t been milked to death. Hibiki is outgoing and cheery, which is the worst offender, however Tsubasa is a strong, stoic type, with more behind her exterior than first meets the eye. Another character may simply be passed off as a bit of a tsundere, but actually isn\'t, far more complex than that. Each main character has a backstory, not all of which are fully gone into in-depth, but all are at least mentioned at one point or another. Furthermore, these backstories can do a great job of defining why a character acts the way they do, and if this process ins\'t the one that explains it, you\'ll simply find out later on. Every character has a unique purpose, and each characters continues to fulfill that unique purpose effectively, without giving too much attention to any singular character. Even the side characters are well thought out, they don\'t FEEL like complete side characters because they actually get quite a lot of interaction with the true main characters as well as major plot elements. The villain however, is quite cliche. Like mentioned previously though, this hardly counts since the producers did this on purpose. This anime is supposed to be stupid, but handled well.Overall, the characters are all well thought out, and despite being less-used cliches, they have reasoning to back themselves up. Every characters does exactly what they\'re supposed to do, with a high degree of effectiveness, no single character could replace another. Even the side characters are given a good amount of attention. The villain is rather cliche, but it doesn\'t hurt too much.Enjoyment: 10As I have been consistently mentioning, this anime is FUN. Don\'t go into it for serious plot developments and incredible levels of character development, go and watch it to watch your favourite heroes beat the crap out of a bad guy. With music. I have given this anime a nickname, as have other people. ""Micheal Bay: The Musical"" There isn\'t a whole lot of down time in this anime, for the most part it splits up action and comedy, however it also has a few much darker elements in store for you to keep you on the edge of your seat. Drama is a thing as well, it may have been kind of forced, but it changes up the pace, so see that as you will. Regardless, the main point of this anime is lots of bright colors, explosions, awesome fight scenes, badass soundtracks, hell, even moments that could make you tear up a little bit.Overall, watch this for fun! If you go in expecting something serious from an anime about magical girls blowing up monsters with the power of songs and friendship, you\'re gonna be sad. You\'ll be happy to know that if you enjoyed this series the first time, it doesn\'t get boring easily either. So feel free to rewatch it!Overall: 9Culminating everything I\'ve mentioned... this anime is just jolly good fun. Over-the-top fight scenes, an incredibly enjoyable soundtrack, equally likeable main characters, which all excel at doing their own thing. It\'s a giant blob of stupidity and cliches, yes, but it knows that and uses that as a grounds for making itself more awesome. ""Ah well, we\'ve already used this many cliches, let\'s overcome this insurmountable feat with an attack powered by friendship and unicorn souls!"" and as dumb as that sounds, it doesn\'t get boring, it is truly something you just have to experience for yourself to understand. This anime is a great watch for practically any age, as it covers a lot of things, however, there\'s no real nice pretty age to acceptable watch it at. If a kid tries to watch it, there\'s some pretty bloody stuff that happens, if an adult watches it... it\'s an anime filled with magical girls! Perhaps teens can get away with it. Disregarding social standards however, this anime IS a great, fun watch, for all ages!Extra note:While this anime may seem to be the type, it VERY rarely sexualizes it\'s characters, I can recall a total of 5 scenes throughout all 3 seasons, one of which was a beach episode, another was a bath scene, both of which are anime staples. Even during transformation sequences, season 1 has next to no sexualization at all, the camera doesn\'t even zoom in on the characters body. Season 2, with their updated budget, opted to have a fancy camera-spinning close-up transformation scene, but even still, the camera never clearly focused on anywhere such as the butt or breasts, it just panned over them as though they were any other body part such as an elbow or a foot. Season 3 starts getting to borderline as it adds in a bit of jiggle to some characters during these sequences, but thinking realistically... I think some jiggle may happen... they certainly didn\'t blow it out of proportion, and even further, they kept the camera moving with no clear fanservice shots. As for actul in-fight scenes, the rules apply as if it were anime men fighting, nothing is sexualized or focused upon, if you want to see something you can look for it obviously, but it isn\'t shoved into your face. There are a few instances of blatant fanservice as I previously mentioned, but that count is very low. A good job goes to the producers for that decision as well, the quality of this anime would have dropped big time were it made as an ecchi. it incredibly well:FUN.When a lot of people complain about Symphogear, I always see that they seem to take it too seriously. With that, I tell you, that you should watch this anime for pure, unadulterated, fun, explosions, and a kickass soundtrack that you\'re probably going to be wanting to locate and download. Which I have. All of it. So good.Anyways, on to the actual review.Story:It\'s certainly not a bad story, there are worse ones out there, however you will see that it\'s rather cliche once you start getting a few episodes in. One of the worst parts about Symphogear, is it\'s rather cliche story, and this applies to the following seasons as well, since they all follow the same rough format that season 1 does. However, while looking at it by me saying that, it may seem rather uhh... ""meh"". But, I should also mention, that Symphogear KNOWS that it\'s bad. It knows that it\'s cliche, and it uses that to it\'s advantage. Yes, it\'s a cookie cutter that was built out of the body of season 1, and yes, seasons 2 and 3 were made with that exact same cookie cutter, but DAYUM is that a nice cookie cutter. Normally, if an anime is too cliche, it dies because the audience has seen it before (which admittedly, may very well still apply to some people when they decide to watch this) however, the other aspects of the show are what genuinely carry this anime to glory, the characters, the music, the important animation, all of that combines to patch up those nasty things that the plot just literally can\'t even. I should also mention that the overlying plot is only affected by this. There are a bunch of sub-plots which are actually quite unique and well thought out, for example, the backstories of the main characters.Overall, you\'ve seen this plot before, and you\'ll know it when you see it. But the rest of the anime will more than make up for it, which is impressive considering how important plot tends to be.Art: 7I admit, the animation for this anime kinda dies at points. There\'s a scene where Tsubasa and her Manager are walking down a hall and rather than an animated walking animation, it is merely their unmoving bodies swaying in a small figure 8 pattern. Now, remember what I said about this series being fun? Yeah. It is. ""Bu-but, HOW could it POSSIBLY be fun with animation like THAT!?"" you may ask. Well I\'ll tell you, the animation for unimportant things like that walking scene, or someone writing something down on a piece of paper, THOSE are animated quite poorly sometimes. HOWEVER. The producers of this anime were smart, and funneled most of what little budget they had into the action scenes, and other important scenes. A lot of anime, even high budget anime that have all-round great animation, tend to have action scenes that are simply just as good as the rest of the anime, and when you\'re expecting MORE from an action scene, it can be a little underwhelming. Symphogear, with it\'s poor budget, knocks up the budget big time for their action scenes, making amazing looking scenes that are animated fluidly. I should also add that this anime liked to have it\'s action scenes on the go. While a lot of anime take a lot of camera cuts and angles in rapid succession to show a fight, which works well don\'t get me wrong, Symphogear does it itself a whole bunch, but they ALSO love to follow the action as it moves, meaning you\'ll get panning action sequences at high speed that look simply amazing (not to mention badass as hell) and really gives the viewer an impression of the speed at which the Symphogear users are fighting. While they obviously don\'t do this all the time, you\'ll see it used quite a bit, and it\'s a nice addition. Back to that bad animation for a moment, and also referring to when I said that people always take this anime too seriously if they hate the anime. The bad animation that pops up? It\'s reaally bad. So bad in fact, that it\'s laughable. I actually laugh at this animation, it is so bad. Now I can\'t forgive it for these atrocities of animation, but hey, you can always get a chuckle out of it! I should also mention that while this anime DOES have some very bad animation issues, those absolutely horrendous only pop up around 3 or 4 times in the entire anime, so they don\'t overly take away from it as a whole. Seasons 2 and 3 undergo a SERIOUS budget boost however, and nearly every issue that season one had in regards to animation was fixed, or improved past that.Overall, while this anime has some undeniable animation issues, it isn\'t bad enough to take away from the series enough to ruin the experience.Sound: 10I\'m including the soundtrack in this, it\'s a must. This anime is one that is in the ""Music"" genre, and normally, when you see ""Music"" tagged on to an anime, with a premise like that of Symphogear, you get frilly cute J-Pop songs, or at least, expect them. That is far from what you\'ll be getting out of Symphogear. Let\'s lead in to the  music by starting with the voice actors! Tsubasa is voiced by Nana Mizuki, whom is a very well-off musical artist in Japan. Not only does she do an excellent job of voicing the stoic Tsubasa, she carries that voice into her songs which all have an oriental theme. Nana Mizuki also created and sings the OP of each of the seasons, season 1 being ""Synchrogazer"". Aoi Yuuki voices our main Character, Hibiki Tachibana. Perhaps you\'ve heard Aoi before, she\'s done quite a few roles. Tornado from One Punch Man, Madoka from Madoka Magica, Victorique from Gosick, the list goes on. Aoi isn\'t a song artist, however in this series, she sings all of her own songs, which is a rather impressive feat for anyone. This adds to the immersion of the series, since there is no clear difference in voice, unlike when another person sings a song in place of a voice actor. This applies to every single character in the entire Symphogear anime. Each voice actor does all of their own singing, and they do a damn fine job. Each character even has songs that are styled towards them. As mentioned, Tsubasa sings what I call ""Technoriental""  and Hibiki sings ""Electroceltic"" technobagpipes included. Other characters are introduced later on, one of which sings aggressive rock, and in season 2, another which sings pure electronic, as well as another that sings perhaps a more punk-style of rock. Mentioning the characters further would be too large a spoiler however. Back to the actual music. Every song was crafted FOR the anime, none were taken from elsewhere. The producers made it a priority to make the music as excellent as they possibly could, as the anime revolves around music, and make it well they did indeed. I should now mention that all of these amazing songs are placed in as character songs (songs which are sung by the characters) and of course, since having characters singing all of the time would be stupid, there is regular soundtrack to go alongside it. Nothing too special about it, in all honesty. The background music you hear in scenes without characters singing is just sorta there, nothing too memorable, but not bad either. Just there. As far as voice acting goes... really well done! They got a very solid cast of voice actors, they didn\'t lose out anywhere there, however I should mention that ONLY the first season... has the most horrendous case of Engrish that I\'ve ever heard. Thank god for subtitles. They gave up on attempting English in the following seasons, for good reason. As for the Japanese voice acting, emotions are portrayed very well, Hibiki always sounds like she should, cheery and upbeat, Tsubasa sounds like a strong ""don\'t mess with her"" type, the list goes on.Overall, the character songs make this anime absolutely amazing, and are one of it\'s biggest selling points. The background music and such isn\'t so up to par, but the sheer quality of the character songs truly outshine the little problems that the background music brings forth. While there was a bit of laughably bad Engrish, the voice acting was excellently done, especially with how each voice actor sings their own songs.Characters: 9Each character is very well made, and while maybe cliche in a sense, they use cliches that haven\'t been milked to death. Hibiki is outgoing and cheery, which is the worst offender, however Tsubasa is a strong, stoic type, with more behind her exterior than first meets the eye. Another character may simply be passed off as a bit of a tsundere, but actually isn\'t, far more complex than that. Each main character has a backstory, not all of which are fully gone into in-depth, but all are at least mentioned at one point or another. Furthermore, these backstories can do a great job of defining why a character acts the way they do, and if this process ins\'t the one that explains it, you\'ll simply find out later on. Every character has a unique purpose, and each characters continues to fulfill that unique purpose effectively, without giving too much attention to any singular character. Even the side characters are well thought out, they don\'t FEEL like complete side characters because they actually get quite a lot of interaction with the true main characters as well as major plot elements. The villain however, is quite cliche. Like mentioned previously though, this hardly counts since the producers did this on purpose. This anime is supposed to be stupid, but handled well.Overall, the characters are all well thought out, and despite being less-used cliches, they have reasoning to back themselves up. Every characters does exactly what they\'re supposed to do, with a high degree of effectiveness, no single character could replace another. Even the side characters are given a good amount of attention. The villain is rather cliche, but it doesn\'t hurt too much.Enjoyment: 10As I have been consistently mentioning, this anime is FUN. Don\'t go into it for serious plot developments and incredible levels of character development, go and watch it to watch your favourite heroes beat the crap out of a bad guy. With music. I have given this anime a nickname, as have other people. ""Micheal Bay: The Musical"" There isn\'t a whole lot of down time in this anime, for the most part it splits up action and comedy, however it also has a few much darker elements in store for you to keep you on the edge of your seat. Drama is a thing as well, it may have been kind of forced, but it changes up the pace, so see that as you will. Regardless, the main point of this anime is lots of bright colors, explosions, awesome fight scenes, badass soundtracks, hell, even moments that could make you tear up a little bit.Overall, watch this for fun! If you go in expecting something serious from an anime about magical girls blowing up monsters with the power of songs and friendship, you\'re gonna be sad. You\'ll be happy to know that if you enjoyed this series the first time, it doesn\'t get boring easily either. So feel free to rewatch it!Overall: 9Culminating everything I\'ve mentioned... this anime is just jolly good fun. Over-the-top fight scenes, an incredibly enjoyable soundtrack, equally likeable main characters, which all excel at doing their own thing. It\'s a giant blob of stupidity and cliches, yes, but it knows that and uses that as a grounds for making itself more awesome. ""Ah well, we\'ve already used this many cliches, let\'s overcome this insurmountable feat with an attack powered by friendship and unicorn souls!"" and as dumb as that sounds, it doesn\'t get boring, it is truly something you just have to experience for yourself to understand. This anime is a great watch for practically any age, as it covers a lot of things, however, there\'s no real nice pretty age to acceptable watch it at. If a kid tries to watch it, there\'s some pretty bloody stuff that happens, if an adult watches it... it\'s an anime filled with magical girls! Perhaps teens can get away with it. Disregarding social standards however, this anime IS a great, fun watch, for all ages!Extra note:While this anime may seem to be the type, it VERY rarely sexualizes it\'s characters, I can recall a total of 5 scenes throughout all 3 seasons, one of which was a beach episode, another was a bath scene, both of which are anime staples. Even during transformation sequences, season 1 has next to no sexualization at all, the camera doesn\'t even zoom in on the characters body. Season 2, with their updated budget, opted to have a fancy camera-spinning close-up transformation scene, but even still, the camera never clearly focused on anywhere such as the butt or breasts, it just panned over them as though they were any other body part such as an elbow or a foot. Season 3 starts getting to borderline as it adds in a bit of jiggle to some characters during these sequences, but thinking realistically... I think some jiggle may happen... they certainly didn\'t blow it out of proportion, and even further, they kept the camera moving with no clear fanservice shots. As for actul in-fight scenes, the rules apply as if it were anime men fighting, nothing is sexualized or focused upon, if you want to see something you can look for it obviously, but it isn\'t shoved into your face. There are a few instances of blatant fanservice as I previously mentioned, but that count is very low. A good job goes to the producers for that decision as well, the quality of this anime would have dropped big time were it made as an ecchi.', 'Symphogear is cheesy. It’s a story where at it’s core is about friendship, protecting your loved ones and believing in your own strength. Like I said in my previous post about it, Symphogear is like animated Tokusatsu with music as the main motif. It’s silly, but frankly a lot of shows could learn a lot of things from Symphogear. You know what? I feel like breaking this down in the classic way by categories. Let’s start with the most important/the best part about Symphogear.The sound department. You know how music can affect a story greatly? Sad music will make you feel sad, happy music will...make you feel happy, but it can also affect the tone of the story. Spooky music will make the scene/story spooky, intense music will make a battle intense and so on. Well, thanks to one Motoyama Satoshi Symphogear has one of the best music uses I’ve seen in a show my entire life. Everything about the music and it’s execution made this show way better than it could/should be. Because of the music and it’s execution all other elements of the show that are affected by it get this boost of energy and tone which they wouldn’t necessarily achieve solely by themselves. The voice acting is also worth mentioning. The VA’s in this show give some of the best performances I’ve seen them give. It’s easy to forget how important sound can be in a show. Symphogear does well to remember it’s importance.The art department. I’m just going to outright say it: The art in this show is beyond superb. Whether it’s the amazing Symphogear designs (shoutout to my favorite desgin: Yukine Chris) or the detailed backgrounds. It’s amazing. Even the simple enemies are unique and stand out on their own. And the animation in this show is downright fantastic especially in battles. For a modern anime this has some of the best fights I have seen. The art department in this show have done an amazing job and barely cut any corners.The story. This one here is a mixed bag. On the one hand the story is similar to a cheesy B movie, but because of the important role the music has and how much it supports the story, the story ends up being better than what it actually is, which is a cheesy B movie plot, but in the end of the show the whole story comes together in an enjoyable way and it actually feels like something was accomplished by the end of it. And despite it being so cheesy in it’s way Symphogear ends up being a lot better than quite a few AAA/S titles. A lot of the story elements in Symphogear are just the right enough amount of cheesy to make me smile with joy. I like cheesy/silly stories, they are the ones that end up being the most enjoyable. So, yeah despite being cheesy Symphogear has a very good story, with some slight pacing issues.The characters. The characters in Symphogear is another one of my favorite parts. A lot of the ideals that the characters represent are ideals I can get behind. Friendship? I’m all for friendship. Protecting your loved ones? Heck yeah I can get behind protecting one’s loved ones. Believing in your own strength? At this point it could be considered pandering. Sure you might call them cheesy, but these characters are in the end loveable. The main villain is one of the best villains I’ve seen in a B movie esque story. The whole “What is giving you your strength” lack of comprehension on the villains part is so incredible. And of course I can’t go talking about the characters without mentioning the one, the only Kazanari Genjurou!. One of the most likeable side characters I’ve had the pleasure of liking.Symphogear may not be for everyone. But it is for me. I like, no I love Symphogear a lot, and I love it enough to consider it one of my favorite shows. So, as per usual, do I recommend Symphogear? Absolutely. Go watch it. If it doesn’t click with you completely right away the same thing that was with me, but you still want to give it a try episode 6 is where it finally clicked with me, and it was only uphill from there. make you feel happy, but it can also affect the tone of the story.

The only counter to these strange creatures is the Symphogear weapon system which the female protagonists equip themselves for battle.  While this formula for a battle anime has been done a countless number of times, what really matters is ""how"" it is done, rather than the ""what"".  Unfortunately, Symphogear clearly lacks the direction and the refinement seen in other series such as Madoka.Firstly, there is the...matter of the story which is fairly average on the whole, but is destroyed by a major plot hole and the lack of refinement in the direction.  We are greeted with a significant death in the first episode, which we fully know about from the summary of this anime.  This death is caused by Kanade using ""Zesshou"", the final attack available that uses up all of one\'s life energy.  Unfortunately, this significance is cheapened in later episodes.  Therefore, Kanade\'s death becomes a rather forced plot device to get the ball rolling, rather than a necessary and significant event.Then there\'s the clear lack of refinement in the direction, as there are occasions where we get bombarded with the most terrible ENGRISH.  I mean absolutely horrific.  While the context of including the English was justified (Japanese dealing with Americans), the catastrophic lack of care in its execution just goes to show a lot.  Surely, Microsoft Word would have come up with a whole load of green wriggly lines in the planning phase of the script.Then we move onto the art.  Symphogear\'s characters have a fairly retro look with the use of strong colour shading for the hair, unlike the lighter colour tones that is more prevalent today.  While this is not bad in itself, there are issues with the use of shading, which gives an incorrect perception of a lack of detail.  Mouretsu Pirates, whose character art is far from groundbreaking uses a very simple, but effective style that shows the detailing in the character\'s hair.  While I am not expecting something crazy on the level of Key/KyoAni collaborations, Symphogear\'s shading deficiency was clearly evident in the first episode where production values was at their highest.  The fluid animation, combined with the excellent camera angles and background art looked a little odd when it was just hard to notice the character detailing.  Then we have the main character whom we of course spend a long time staring at her.  Her eyes seemed just too narrow and horizontally challenged.  This just makes it a little hard to stare at the screen, because the level of distortion was beyond tolerances that is usually seen.To make it all up though, the background scenery was extremely well done with plenty of detailing and shading.  The weapon and attack design and choreography was excellent and fun to watch.  The stills, showing the main attacks of the character was a nice touch, using differing art styles that represented the character in question.Characterisation.  We love seeing great characters.  Now, a significant number of teenagers tend to have mood swings and can be unstable due to the sudden rush of hormones during puberty.  Symphogear\'s representations of teenagers in distress seemed highly plausible.  The way they interacted and reacted were extremely appropriate and on the whole, done fairly well.  While Mary Sues on the one hand are boring, there is also unfortunately the case of annoying naivety which we see with the main character.  This naivety causes grief for the sake of it.  Her thoughts seems to mature though, and her sense of empathy is highly improved after receiving appropriate information.(Personal Opinion: While I don\'t mind seeing naive supporting characters giving the slightly more mature main character annoyance, I cannot stand it being the other way around.  Simply because the main character gets most of the screen time.  Having to live with it is just painful.)The villain\'s characterisation unfortunately left much more to be desired.  The behaviour, course of action, and reaction felt highly amateurish, considering the number of years\' life experience the villain has had.  Even the highly egotistical and corrupted Gilgamesh from the Fate universe knew when to do Ego and when to do serious battle.  Gender not revealed to prevent spoiling.The sounds are the strongest point of Symphogear.  This is especially exaggerated in my case as I click extremely well with Nana Mizuki\'s music.  The way the music was composed suited Nana\'s singing style perfectly and was built around the character exceptionally well.  (I seriously believe Symphogear was made solely to make some cash out of Nana\'s talent).  The ending result was Macross F on steroids with highly enjoyable battles.   Not only that, but Yukine\'s ""badass rock"" also suited her character and attack mode extremely well.  Battle sounds were generically good, and nothing seemed amiss.  Unfortunately, the main character\'s music, battles and singing was just weak.  It is rather loli-ish, something which really has its place in Lucky Star, rather than a battle.At the end of the day, Symphogear was built on a highly average premise.  While they did a good job with the music and weapon design, the aforementioned plot inconsistency and unpalatable main character destroys much of the viewing experience.For those who click with Nana\'s music, her outstanding performance is more than capable of temporarily taking the viewer\'s attention away from the glaring flaws.  However, for those of other taste, the sound and enjoyment score would surely be lower and therefore, Symphogear is essentially 3 or 4/10 material.  Which goes back to the TL;DR version of the review - if you don\'t like Nana\'s music, don\'t bother with Symphogear. matter of the story which is fairly average on the whole, but is destroyed by a major plot hole and the lack of refinement in the direction.

Which goes back to the TL;DR version of the review - if you don\'t like Nana\'s music, don\'t bother with Symphogear.', 'I am just here trying to balance out the amount of negative reviews of this anime.Senki Zesshou Symphogear (I am just gonna call it Symphogear) wasn\'t a very bad anime, if you want sci-fi action based anime, Symphogear is worth trying out.My first experience watching the first episode of the anime was like ""Wow, this is the real stuff people needs to watch these days."" Of course it was quite a let down as animation quality was dropping episode by episode but it was still watch-able to the point that you can still cope with the animation. The art style in some point would change...drastically but I think it was to create visual effects to cope with the music.Speaking about music, apparently the characters sing songs when they are fighting, it was quite a hilarious concept where you\'re with an angry face and still managed to somewhat sing songs while fighting. The naming of the enemy units, Noise, also gave me a good laugh. The first thing in mind was that the human races doesn\'t like ""noises"" which was quite a pun but of course you\'ll get what I mean as the anime moves on.Body proportions in the anime are quite realistic as well each character are able to represent their personality and motive quite well. Colour can be interpreted as a strong theme as it really represents something which I would prefer the watchers to see by themselves. The animation was mind-blasting if any of you watched the 1st episode. Though don\'t get discouraged by the degrading of animation quality as episodes come by or so. It is still a pretty good anime with its cool moments as well as tragic touching moments.The story is quite well-created in my point of view. Although it didn\'t reveal too much background information but it was enough to allow the story to continue. Though there are moments in the anime where there was too much talking that you pretty much made yourself to skip ahead and see if there\'s any more mind-blasting battle scenes. Its been hilarious everytime a character uses a special move, its like one of those Fighter games where the gameplay freezes and a banner of the move name comes flying onto the screen.The music and songs are quite good. I especially liked the daft punk genre musics used in Symphogear. Generally the music is good to a point its worth downloading the character albums and put them into your iPod.Story - 6Art - 7Sound - 9Character - 8Enjoyment - 8Overall - 7The reason why I gave Symphogear a 7 was really because of its downfall in its animation degradation as well as ""plot-killer"" moments where everything becomes boring that makes you want to skip ahead. Otherwise all other aspects were quite fascinating to watch. Though I would love to give Symphogear a rate of 8/10 due to the fact after finish watching it, it certainly does make you feel like asking ""Is there Season 2?"" (which I don\'t think there will be) as it left quite an imprint in memory. drastically but I think it was to create visual effects to cope with the music.Speaking about music, apparently the characters sing songs when they are fighting, it was quite a hilarious concept where you\'re with an angry face and still managed to somewhat sing songs while fighting. The naming of the enemy units, Noise, also gave me a good laugh. The first thing in mind was that the human races doesn\'t like ""noises"" which was quite a pun but of course you\'ll get what I mean as the anime moves on.Body proportions in the anime are quite realistic as well each character are able to represent their personality and motive quite well. Colour can be interpreted as a strong theme as it really represents something which I would prefer the watchers to see by themselves. The animation was mind-blasting if any of you watched the 1st episode. Though don\'t get discouraged by the degrading of animation quality as episodes come by or so. It is still a pretty good anime with its cool moments as well as tragic touching moments.The story is quite well-created in my point of view. Although it didn\'t reveal too much background information but it was enough to allow the story to continue. Though there are moments in the anime where there was too much talking that you pretty much made yourself to skip ahead and see if there\'s any more mind-blasting battle scenes. Its been hilarious everytime a character uses a special move, its like one of those Fighter games where the gameplay freezes and a banner of the move name comes flying onto the screen.The music and songs are quite good. I especially liked the daft punk genre musics used in Symphogear. Generally the music is good to a point its worth downloading the character albums and put them into your iPod.Story - 6Art - 7Sound - 9Character - 8Enjoyment - 8Overall - 7The reason why I gave Symphogear a 7 was really because of its downfall in its animation degradation as well as ""plot-killer"" moments where everything becomes boring that makes you want to skip ahead.

It's interesting in that it seems like the show changed story lanes a couple of times and ultimately failed to hit a perfect medium, while still hitting a nice somewhat-below that. Basically if you just pay attention to the action, you'll enjoy.Story (6/10): If you break up the show into thirds, you can clearly see that they show's writing changed slightly. The first half was much more 'darker and trying to be realistic', the middle became the 'school drama and getting to know you' stage, while the ending...was the 'free for all battles'. Was this a good idea? ...meh? There are a lot of places where the story falters (especially with no real definition of the relics that we can follow so as not to allow the inevitable Deus Ex Machina), but it does have it's moments.Art (7/10): The best art is very obviously used on the battles, which all look interesting and are fun and all that, along with giving the Symphogears their awesome appearances (save for Tsubasa's weird leg-blade things). There is some wonky perspectives here and there, but overall the show looks pretty nice.Sound (6/10): For being a show with music as the vehicle...I kinda didn't like the songs. The opening is the best out of the bunch, with the music in the last 3 episodes redeeming the weaker bits that persisted though the whole thing (for sure when we finally get to hear all three main protagonists sing). One thing I noticed is that I liked the actual music of the songs, with the singers voices actually taking away from my enjoyment of the songs. Weird, I know. But like I said, the opening is easily my favorite bit of music in the whole show.Character (7/10): This is slightly hard to talk about. On one hand, the 3 main girls are interesting to watch and have some good development over the course of the show, along with Genjiro and some of the staff that works for him just being some good stable characters. On the other...our main villain is a little confusing, with her having some REALLY weird mood swings throughout her existence. The girls at the school are also pretty flat and have no real connection to the story until, again, the last 2 or so episodes. Miku is also kinda useless as a character, since she just falls flat as the 'magical girls best friend'.Enjoyment (8/10): Even with all the problems that the show has, it's fairly entertaining to watch. Well...at least all the battles were. Seriously, the last 3 episodes (yes, I've been singling them out as the best parts of the show, even with the weaker story) are just so cool and fun to watch that I rushed through them as fast as I could. To go with the thirds example that I brought up in the Story section, the first third and ending third are the best, with the second just being really weak.Overall, Senki is a fun little show, though I wouldn't try and follow the story by any stretch of the word. Watch it for the fun fight scenes and the main girls just being interesting. Would I recommend it? I'd say no unless you really like the magical girl genre, and even then that's kinda pushing it.

I have become interested in writing a review as it was something I didn't really expect to happen. To be completely honest my impression of the show was pretty much just your average mahou shoujo show, but lets take a closer look shall we?Symphogear was fun to watch: It had high eyecandy value. The action scenes weren't half bad, and the music was decent as it should being an integral part of the show. However, I think the fact of the matter is its lack of...originality.

The only way to rid of them of this world is by using symphogear - song powered armor equipment.

However, while a show can be good for having such things just having them isn't enough. The execution is somewhat poorly done, in that you feel as if you should be interested in what is happening, but it doesn't quite affect you as intended. To rephrase, there does exist a story, but it is too hard to emotionally connect to it.

Unfortunately, Symphogear is unable to do so.The characters aren't bad.

What makes this special is that the girls power up by singing, which means they sing while fighting, and most of the sound track is the same including the op and ed, which makes watching any episode like jamming to music, with the bonus that cool shit is happening at the same time.Second is the cool...transformations, special attacks, and just in general non stop action. All of the character designs look super cool, and because there are random Noise (sort of alien like creatures) out breaks almost every episode you constantly get to see Tsubasa summoning giant swords, Chris summoning thousands of rockets (MEGADEATH PARTY is a pretty sweet name for an attack too), and Hibiki just punching shit.Third is in the down time it\'s a super heartfelt cute girls friendship show with Hibiki having a very strong relationship with her best friend Miku, and a good development between Hibiki and Tsubasa, and later Chris. There are lots of sweet moments with Hibiki and Miku sleeping in the same bunk in their dorm, Miku being upset that Hibiki hid her powers from her, and Miku encouraging Hibiki giving her strength to win some fights later on.Really any of those elements by themselves are nothing special but the way this show combines all of them, and all the sheer tempo of the show with the non stop action really syncs with the soundtrack and watching this was like a flow state just zoned in having a great time.As far as negatives the plot was pretty stereotypical, but not offensive, the animation towards the middle of the show was lower quality (but the first episode was outstanding), so what could make this show better would mostly be just more consistent animation.

The plot is really a side note because it almost doesn\'t matter for the enjoyment I\'m getting out of this show, and as I said it wasn\'t necessarily bad or offensive.If you watch the first episode and think ""this it sweet"" and are just zoned in head bobbing to the music, then you will likely love the show; if you feel sort of iffy and looking for more after the first episode this show is likely not for you is my guess.', ""I will start with my criticisms before my praise. First of all, don't come into here expecting the deepest plot. It's not. Second of all, the animation does get better. But where it excels is being able to watch the hype. Even if not every character is developed well, they are likable from the start. Now onto what is the best part by far. The music of every part of this whole series is top tier. The OP and character songs slap on their own, and are made better by the main characters sometimes singing duets or triplets. may grunt or go off the note...they should if they get hit or do something strenuous. This makes the voice acting a lot better. Just mind the engrish in that one episode. Just suspend some disbelief and it will be amazing. they should if they get hit or do something strenuous.

That's my kind of genre.When I found about this anime, coming for 2012, I was like 'hey! I'm looking forward for this one' for I was captured by the teasers, plus not to mention Nana Mizuki was one of the dubbers. So I was like really expecting BIG for this one.Okay, to be honest, I was fascinated by the opening song! The soundtracks were good, and they can bring up a good fighting atmosphere, giving the main characters a 'tough' aura.Then the first episode showed a...lot of stuff leaving the audience wanting more. The fighting scenes were awesome, though I find it annoying how they jump from one scene to another without giving much detail how they got up into that scene. Anyway, the flashblacks were a bit helpful to hold their audiences, like in the first episode where we can see Miku crying and the city was ruined by unknown causes, then a flashblack from 2 years before that catastrophe happened.The animation wasn't that bad, the characters were not that bad either.And also there are strong hints of shoujo-ai here. The plot was very predictable, or maybe, we can say, the 13 episodes didn't suffice the whole idea of the story. I can say that the idea of using this ancient relics activated by a song, and then used as a powerful weapon through the help technology, is very creative and simply astonishing. But they didn't give an awesome plot for this awesome idea. Too bad.The ending. Oh god! twas really horrible. Everything  happened in a very fast manner that they fail to give a splendid and satisfying finale.But hey! I'm not saying you should pass on this one, people had diff'rent points and ideas.

All of the emotions and action that they put into such a small amount of time in each episode (only 1 so far out of a total of 13). I love the two women of Zwei Wing, Tsubasa (blue hair) and Kanade (red hair). They're like the musical version Panty & Stocking (who are both so amazing).The story for this show consists of various elements to achieve a sense of loss but then of gain from the viewer. It does seem to be a bit confusing at times with how much it jumps around the time line from present...to past to present to past and so on so forth. Because of this I am forced to give the story an 8.The art and animation are pretty good. Everything seems so soft and pretty until you get to the Noise monsters. They are so not kawaii at all and it feels like they don't belong! What were they thinking?! The concert looked okay but I would have preferred something more along the lines of a Glee concert ^_~. Art gets a 6, my favorite number! desuNow sound, the most important part of this show because it seems to have a huge focus on music! I thought the lyrics in the song that Zwei Wing sang towards the beginning of the first episode were kind of cliche and lame. But then using songs to battle enemies in their robotic suits? Infinite Stratos (yay!) meets Macross (boo!). Sound gets a 5 from me! Too bad they don't do uber kawaii versions of known pop songs that have actual meaning to them! But maybe there will be better songs in the next 12 episodes, but who can say for sure? It's not like waiting to hear them to write my review is going to change anything! Wa ha ha!Characters! Like I said before, Tsubasa and Kanade are awesome! Panty & Stocking who can sing and fight monsters are so awesome! But the main character girl, whatever her name is ( I could easily look it up but I'm too lazy teehee), she seems pretty average. Nothing special about her except that she's dead or something. But not. It's so confusing all this jumping around through time! I'd rather watch The Girl Who Leapt Through Time! Characters gets a 9 out of 10!This series seems to be chock-full of sorrow and loss and dark humor. Lots of people start dying all the time and cry a lot. A couple of the songs were pretty sad too. So I'd have to say that this show will be a very sad one and not enjoyable at all. Everyone knows that if the first episode of a show is bad, the entire show is bad (Bokurano = PROOF)!. 3/10 for enjoyment!Overall I will have to give this show a 9! The characters are clearly the best part, and that can be said about any show! That's the most important part! Not the story, and clearly not the art or sound.

Overall  I shall give Senki Zesshou Symphogear a 7!"", 'I\'m going to be honest in that I\'m writing this after having also watched Symphogear G, so I will admit I am more willing to forgive some of the weaknesses in the plot, as a lot of them were solved.Symphogear\'s first episode, like much of the advertising for the show, was misleading. It makes the show out to be a lot darker than it is, the show isn\'t another Madoka in terms of how dark it is, but the first episode certainly does paint it that way. The show as a whole is about communication, which shows when the only human antagonists we get...are characters who refuse to, can\'t, or find it worthless to communicate with others. If you want to stop reading now I\'ll say in short that I believe Symphogear is a fun magical girl romp with well written characters, good design and music, with it\'s main weaknesses being that the art can sometimes falter, and that if you\'re not paying attention you can lose the plot fairly fast.Symphogear has a simple enough story when you strip away the specifics of the characters. The cast is what makes the show worth watching, Hibiki on her own is a wonderful protagonist, she\'s overly kind and fond of food, and is only balanced out by her (girl)best friend Kohinata Miku. Hibiki\'s history is what makes her overly kind nature work, as other members of the cast say ""A girl who\'s willing to throw herself into the frontlines just to help others seems twisted"" and she is. Hibiki\'s happiness and kindness is her shield and her sword, it protects her from the things that scare her most, and allows her to fight to her fullest, or to take the time to talk. Her powers grow and grow to ridiculous levels, and unfortunately in the first season we only get scraps as to why, but that idea is completely fleshed out in the second season, as are many other things that make Hibiki one of my favorite characters. Not only that but her relationships with the other characters helps to make the show what it is. Her interactions with Tsubasa and Miku in particular brings development to all of the characters involved, and helps them flesh out.Tsubasa is our second magical girl, a cold and unfeeling character at first. The first episode shows us what Tsubasa was like before the start of the show, she was sweet and shy, but  after those events Tsubasa considers herself nothing but a sword. She sees herself as a weapon to fight the Noise, and holds with her guilt and feelings of loss that drive her character to grow and change. As she grows she further proves her worth as a mentor to Hibiki, changing from a sword to a warrior, and learning that she\'s more than just a weapon. Her development is natural, and the change only occurs after a period of introspection.The other characters are no less well done, but for the sake of keeping this review at a readable length I\'ll cut the details and say that any characters who matters is given the development they need.As a show that\'s plot is music heavy Symphogear sports a fantastic sound, with each character getting a unique character song that highlights each characters personality.  They\'re all unique and good in their own rights, and as the characters change, hearing the songs really relates how far they\'ve come.This show really brought a breath of fresh air into my watching schedule, and gave me a female protagonist to point at when people ask me what I think makes a protagonist good. The art wasn\'t up to snuff when it was broadcasting, and I chalk that up to budget, but with the DVD release those issues have been solved. I leave the art rating relatively low because there was a lot that needed to be fixed after the original broadcast.Overall I think Symphogear is under appreciated, it has it\'s issues, but each pitfall is followed by a mountain of reasons to let it slide. It\'s not perfect, far from it actually, but the shows stands well, and is enjoyable. are characters who refuse to, can\'t, or find it worthless to communicate with others.

This is intense, dark and dramatic!"" and then you watch the rest of the show and think: ""Okay... what?""The first episode is the best episode in this entire franchise and you cannot prove me wrong, afterwards it just turns so incredibly bland and boring, with a predictable plot, some semi-interesting fight sequences and songs that are at best...comparable to an average idol show and characters like you\'ve seen them 1000 times in anime before. Shush, don\'t come at me like ""But this anime is from 2012!"", that doesn\'t change the fact that there isn\'t one(1!) character in this entire series, that is so extremely different from the rest, that they make a memorable impression on you.It is honestly hilarious how this show feels like it\'s originally aiming for kids, not even teenagers, just kids and then someone in the production team thought: ""hey let\'s add some dark elements"", because this is essentially what this show is. A story written for an audience that does not expect a deep plot and deep plot twists.While the first episode was indeed the best episode, the show still managed to absolutely ruin it for me by the end of this season.When for no reason ever Hibiki had to pretend she\'s dead for solid 3 minutes at the very end of the season, followed by everyone being happy and blah blah blah. Like what do you even tease that sad grave moment in the beginning of the series when it has the worst conclusion I\'ve ever seen in anime?Now let\'s get back to one of the initial selling points of the show: The dark aspect.We saw in episode 1 Kanade dying a tragic death, after protecting a stranger (Hibiki), because apparently that\'s the kinda person she is.Kanade died from using her Climax song, which is the strongest ability a Symphogear has with great destructive, but self-sacrificing power. Wouldn\'t you imagine that this makes indeed for a ""climax"" situation in the anime? No, because after Kanade died, the writer of this series made it so it\'s incredibly inconsequential using this ability, like absolutely every supposedly risk in this show turned out inconsequential and essentially boring, because the heroines just win and win and win and whenever they\'re on their knees, someone sings a song, they power up and just defeat the enemy, like no big deal ever.I wouldn\'t even have to be so critical about this show if they hadn\'t given us episode 1 and absolutely ruin my expectations for it. Don\'t pretend your show is dark, if all you want, is to sell a half-assed wholesome story to the viewer.To this day I don\'t understand why this anime was greenlit for so many seasons, especially because I went into it thinking they are all coherent in a way, but turns out they\'re all own original stories. I\'ve watched 3 seasons and I\'ve given it way enough episodes to turn into something that I now know I will never expect to see.The producer must have seen Madoka\'s success and thought they could replicate it, especially seeing Hibiki and Madoka share the same voice actress, there\'s no other reasonable explanation. comparable to an average idol show and characters like you\'ve seen them 1000 times in anime before.

For what they do give us as explanations, I will admit, it is a little shaky, especially the final blurb they try throwing in at the end (watch it and find out). Overall, I give the story a 6.5, but rounded up.Art & Sound 10/10: Very well drawn and animated; interesting abilities for each of the characters are executed nicely. Very music driven anime with original songs (to the point...where each character has their own CD), each character has their own style, so the chances of finding one you like goes up. Almost worth the watch based on these two factors alone. Only comment about the art is the occasional accentuation (you can guess of what), but it\'s nice that it isn\'t turned into the focus with excessive bouncing or anything of the sort, it\'s solely just the art style (except for maybe one scene).Character 7/10: Just your average characters with prescribed roles. Despite any character development that may take place, at least 90% of it is predictable. I won\'t fault an anime for doing this (since it\'s tough to be original), I will only find fault with HOW they did it. Of the three main characters, you have: the friendship uguu one (as a friend of mine described her to me); the ""I locked my emotions away after a tragic loss"" character that starts with ""you\'ll never replace my last partner""; and the ""I was taken by a villain as a child and lied to my whole life"" character that comes to find out the truth about what she was told.Enjoyment 8/10: Good fight scenes will always add to the enjoyment factor for me, even if some of the weapons/attacks seem to appear out of nowhere (again, drawn/animated very well). Hibiki and Miku are the purest of unofficial lesbians. The music is a great addition/necessity of the show that aids the fight scenes.I had heard the name of this show tossed around a bit, so when I expressed interest in it, it came with regards from a friend whose opinions/reviews of anime I respect. I can say I do not regret the decision to watch this show because I did enjoy it, and I do recommend it myself. where each character has their own CD), each character has their own style, so the chances of finding one you like goes up.

Monsters attacking humans and humans having to fight them with special armor. Although i like the twist that music is alot involved in how they fight and that every episode is filled with nice tones. It might get confusing from times but i think most people familiar with these kind of action animes and will know that story isnt always the biggest plot in the world. Specially if they decide to bomb you with boob service or...half naked girls. This is a common type of things in anime that sounds promising that they make the mistake of packing alot of fan service in it but with no meaning or progress behind it.What drew me into the anime wasnt the story or art it was the music and songs combined with the everything else. The sounds in this anime makes it alot better than what it would be had less of it been in it.Over to the character there its typical and fairly cliche type of characters. The main or one of them Tachibana hibiki is the typical everyone should be friends you and if you hurt her i will kill you and so on. What im happy about is that when i watched this i didnt have to wait until the final episode until she became usefull there is actuall progress in this character. The second or kinda first you will get to now is Kazanari Tsubasa the cold and beautiful like character. I would say she also share a cliche fault personality about lost love and that she can never get it back and it haunts her. But she isnt overly annoying.I enjoyed this thanks to the music to a 7 which is in every meaning true because it made the anime alot more fun to watch and listen to.Overall i would say this anime floats between a 7 and 6 but with my bias music love i chose 7 since i felt that helped bringing the anime a little higher and to a better point.

Repeat.I mean, this show has kept me coming back every week, but it\'s not the best of the season by far.To start clearly. Senki Zesshou Symphogear does what it aimed to do fairly well- but falls apart due to weak characters and, in my opinion, average music. I\'ve scored the music a 7 due to the fact that i know some people will love the whole ""singing while fighting"" thing and that the music will appeal to them in some way; it\'s not for me though.One thing i must praise about this series...however- the fight scenes are colourful and well made. it\'s always nice to see an episode where there is an emphasis on fighting as it\'s gloriously OTT and frantic and saves this anime from the oblivion of mediocrity.The story itself is average and the characters forbid me from getting too interested in it. This anime has failed to really make me feel anything for the characters or the emotional trauma they seem to constantly be faced with; whats left is nothing but forced emotion and melodrama, something which when presented to me usually ends in me giving a show a lower score.The story can be summed up as easily as ""girls in mechasuits sing and fight noise"". Everything else is secondary. The reason the noise is there is ambigious and yet to be explained- and perhaps if it gets explained in more detail in the next 4 episodes i\'ll reconsider giving the story a 6/10.The art itself is standard anime fare- the highlights lie in the wonderfully colourful fight scenes and the music concerts. The designs of the mechasuits are quite nice and Hibikis sudden... ""primal"" outburst after a couple episodes of uncertainty was quite nice and i\'d like to see more of it. You get a bit of insanohibiki with a black face and bright eyes for a couple minutes but you never really see it again, which is a shame. I\'d like to see more of that, Hibiki became slightly more likable when she started fighting the ""noise"", and not simply crying in the corner the whole time.Story - 6Art - 6Sound - 7 (personally, i\'d give it a 5)Character - 5Enjoyment - 6Overall - 6These ratings aren\'t carved in stone; the show is far from over and i\'m expecting something to start happening very soon. I anticipate a clash between the lady with the great engrish skills and our blue and blonde haired heroines very soon. The show at the moment, however, is undisputably average; but still has some potential i hope it uses fully in the final episodes. however- the fight scenes are colourful and well made. it\'s always nice to see an episode where there is an emphasis on fighting as it\'s gloriously OTT and frantic and saves this anime from the oblivion of mediocrity.The story itself is average and the characters forbid me from getting too interested in it.

I\'d like to see more of that, Hibiki became slightly more likable when she started fighting the ""noise"", and not simply crying in the corner the whole time.Story - 6Art - 6Sound - 7 (personally, i\'d give it a 5)Character - 5Enjoyment - 6Overall - 6These ratings aren\'t carved in stone; the show is far from over and i\'m expecting something to start happening very soon. I anticipate a clash between the lady with the great engrish skills and our blue and blonde haired heroines very soon. The show at the moment, however, is undisputably average; but still has some potential i hope it uses fully in the final episodes.', ""Welcome to part 1 out of 5 of my Symphogear review series. This post will cover the first season of Symphogear.Symphogear is a magical girl action series that was released in 2012. It has gained five seasons over the course of the decade and all of the seasons were done by Studio Satelight, the same studio that gave us Macross Frontier, Bodicous Space Pirates and Noein. When the series first debuted it had mixed reception towards casuals and critics, however, as the years went by the series had gained a big positive reception towards casuals and critics. It also gained a big following over the...years and some of the fans state that Symphogear is the anime underdog of 2010s era of anime.Naturally, I decided to check out the series just to see what all that fuzz about as well as seeing if the series is as good as people it is.If I had two words to describe Symphogear Season 1 it would be fun, and predictable.Before I talk about the problems of Season 1 I will be going over the things that I liked about the season.Right out the gate, I was amazing how the show presented itself. It does a great job of establishing its world and tone to the viewer. I liked how the first episode had the guts to hint the main character Hibiki in the season but it also how brutal this series would be. The Tsubasa and Kanade concert was a fun and a depressing sight to watch as it did a nice job of setting up character development for Hibiki and Tsubasa. I honestly tear up when Kanade died as she was a brave and cheerful person who supported Tsubasa.The music was top-notch. The music does an outstanding job at capturing the high energy of Symphogear with its rock and pop tracks that fit the anime. The insert songs were top-notch as not they were amazing songs in their own but they had a lot of substance to them.Finally, the best thing to come out from season 1 is Chris Yukine. I absolutely adore her because not only she was a badass but she was a well written and compelling character. Seeing her developed and change over the season was fascinating to watch as she becomes a better person.Sadly it’s time to talk about what didn’t work starting with the visuals.I honestly don’t know what Studio Statelight was thinking in the winter anime season of 2011 but Symphogear Season 1 was frankly unpolished. The fight choreography ranges from mediocre to subpar. There were constant still frames in every episode, and characters often go off-model, especially in fight scenes and the camerawork feels cheap.As much I love Tsubasa as a character to a point she became my favourite character in the series her debut season was very rough.I found her to be kinda annoying in this season. I understand she lost her best friend in a tragedy is sad and all but she didn’t have to unleash her angst and frustration on Hibiki like that. She just came off as unpleasant for the majorly for the season even if her character development in this season was goodAnother character I had a problem in season 1 is the main character Hibiki. She’s a textbook definition of a Mary Sue as well as an annoying brat in this. She might be worse than Tsubasa because at least Tsubasa has a justifiable reason for being the way she. Sure I may not like her mean-spirited attitude but I could understand her. Not to mention she had brilliant character development from this season and onwards. Hibiki barely felt like a character in this season.She’s more for the ride if anything and as a result, she was bland despite having good moments especially with her childhood friend Miku.Remember when I said that the first episode does a great job at setting. Well, that great setup gets thrown out the window as the season from that point on devolves into a cookie-cutter shockingly magical girl series. The Chris stuff may still be unique but everything else that this season has to offer has been done in other magical girl anime.It doesn’t try to take any risk, it’s way too safe for its own good and boringly predictable. Themes of moving on, sacrifice and friendship were not executed well due to the messy direction. The Noise as well Finé were one dimensional and the writing overall degraded as it progressed.The worst thing about Symphogear Season 1 is the show is full of plot holes. Granted Symphogear as a whole has never its strongest aspect and each season is filled with holes but least the following seasons had brilliant character writing as well as excellent production values that overshadow the questionable writing. Symphogear Season 1 rarely does any of this and as a result of the season sadly became a slog to get through especially with the countless plot holes.This is not to say I had no fun watching this season whatsoever, in fact, I had a lot of fun watching this season.Season 1 when it's competent is very entertaining to watch that is filled with great moments. The pacing minus the first few episodes was well-paced and the season was shockingly fun despite its glaring flaws.I feel the creators behind this season did the best. Even if the season ended up being mediocre I felt a sense of passion and determination from the people who worked on this season and I will believe they will learn from their mistakes and failures in future seasons of Symphogear,Stay tuned for part 2 where I go over Symphogear G.The season that made me love Symphogear. years and some of the fans state that Symphogear is the anime underdog of 2010s era of anime.Naturally, I decided to check out the series just to see what all that fuzz about as well as seeing if the series is as good as people it is.If I had two words to describe Symphogear Season 1 it would be fun, and predictable.Before I talk about the problems of Season 1 I will be going over the things that I liked about the season.Right out the gate, I was amazing how the show presented itself.

Pacing and development-wise, it felt like we paradoxically go through 3 light novels worth of content and only 1 at the same time. Some things feel like they developed really sluggishly while others suddenly develop abruptly.The best moments of the show visually are fantastic and sometimes quite inventive. The bgm soundtrack was pretty strong, and the vocal tracks were really great and well-used.The peak of the show is definitely the episode where Tsubasa uses the zesshou, episode 4, as I thought it was the...only episode where every strong quality is present and fully synergetic. The resolution of that episode is really fantastic too.Overall, the show doesn't comparable favorably to many other battle shoujo works such as Nanoha (even the first season alone) or the Madoka children such as Yuuki Yuuna, but it shows very strong potential to develop in the sequels with characters and a setting with tons of room to grow. only episode where every strong quality is present and fully synergetic.

Personally, i managed to ignore most of it and make it through the whole anime, and I\'m looking forward to season 2. Lemme give a quick opinion of it before i go in depth.This is probably the most cliche anime i have ever seen. It has everything: A super suit based on ancient technology that is superior to current technology and can be activated...by singing. A cold character with a tragic loss who hates the main character at first. A useless best friend who somehow manages to appear as important, and is heartbroken that her best friend kept a government secret from her. A evil tsundere character who is first evil and them becomes friends with the protagonist, after being abandoned by the psychotic villain whose motivations and back story don\'t come into play until the last three episodes, and even then make little to no sense. And best of all, its got clumsy, completely average, not really smart protagonist who got dragged into some major problem by accident, and values friendship above everything else. Couple that with the fact that the cannon fodder villains (the Noise -how is that for a creative name in an anime about singing?) are actually pretty cool looking, and not really all that scary, and you have Senki Zesshou Symphogear.Now for the real review.Story: 8I give it an 8 because it is actually a really good story line, if somewhat horribly executed and cliched. Sure, its been over done, but i like to think of it as a classical anime around which all generalizations are based. There quite a few discontinuitiesbut none of them are really major enough to make think ""the heck?"" Aside from their suit weapons, and their attacks. Basically, Hibiki, protagonist, goes to a concert, where the Noise attack. The concert singers, Kanade and Tsubasa, are users of Symphogear, a government secret, and the only weapon that can defeat the Noise, and its activated by singing. In trying to protect Hibiki, Kanade is killed, and a piece of her Gear is stuck in Hibiki\'s heart. This is what makes Tsubasa resent Hibiki at first. Now here is the weird part. The school that Hibiki and tsubasa, and everyone attends is for singing, yet the only time Hibiki really ever sings is when she fights. its not like she has a passion for it all or anything. She just can. Anyway, Plot gradually progresses, after several fights with the Noise, the first of which is incredibly dramatic and activates Hibiki\'s Symphogear embedded in her heart. Eventaully, you meet the thrid Gear user Yukine Chris, and her boss Fine, who is the main evil villain. I am not going to explain anymore for the sake of spoiling, however, from then on it does have some good story. There are detailed explanations of quite a few things, and almost nothing is left to chance. It is pretty good.Art:10The only reason this got a 10 was because i love the Noise and the Symphogear. The designs are very ingenious especially for the way some of the weapons on the suits are used, particularly Hibiki\'s. The art of the concerts great, especially with the lights. However, the Noise take the cake. Though they all kind of look the same, i love the color schemes and the way they shimmer. The Elevator Shaft lead to Sector 2 is also very artistic. The only thing that bugged me was how big and overused the explosions were and the fact that so many things still survived inside the blast radii.Sound: 9Sound is based on the noise the Noise make and of course, the singing. To be honest, some of the songs, to me, particularly Tsubasa\'s, are kind of lame. I especially hate the way that even after they activate their gear, they keep singing, their mouths moving and everything. If the song wanted to continue thats fine, but them singing it is a bit too far. However, the theme song, and the gear activation songs are really good. I particularly like Yukine\'s song.Characters:8The reason for the eight is in the first over view. They are cliche, and some of them are just plot devices. However, the concept behind them i liked, despite their being overused. My favorite character is Hibiki for her hyper active stupidity. I think her relation with Miku is great, even if somewhat over emotional. I love the way one of their friends keeps yelling ""this isn\'t an anime"" *sigh* if only you knew.Enjoyment: 9Despite all my hates, i really did enjoy watching this. It wouldn\'t surprise me if most people disagreed, and hated it, but i think it was okay. It definitely wasn\'t the best, but it was way better than some other anime. The fights were really good, if somewhat over dramatic. And there is some good laughs to be had.Overall: 9But hey, that\'s just me. by singing.

Every scene they weren't in their super suits was dreadful. The forced drama and over the top reactions clashed wildly with jpop idols in skimpy song-powered mecha suits. Why does this show have a torture scene that comes out of nowhere and is never referred to again? Who thought that was a good idea?That being said the fights are over the top BADASS and really capitalize on the silly concept. The jpop is solid, but if thats not your thing then you're missing out on a huge part of this anime.Overall I'd suggest...this only if you want to shut your mind off and have some braindead fun this only if you want to shut your mind off and have some braindead fun"", ""If you think this series is about girls with armors fighting while singing, you're absolutely right. Unfortunately, that's all that worth praising (assuming that this idea is original as I'm quite new to anime).1. Concept - 5The near-future setting is quite common for anime these days, but what grabs me to check out this show is the interesting idea as stated above. Despite the unique idea, this show fails by throwing in numerous bad inconsistent ideas such as deforming armors and weapons that beat the shit out of your common sense and of course the retarded logic of a national defense HQ located right below...a local high school.The ideas aside, the way this series handle the concept is poor. Although they make time to explain the important rules and bits with pretty much nonsensical bullshits, they are unable to follow them decently throughout the series.2. Plot - 6The plot of this series is somewhat disappointing as it starts with a promising serious tone but ends up as one of those forced nonsense of a plot. basically this series is trying to tell us about the story of high school girls saving the world with their own personal issues in the way. There are also horrible cliched plots and moments that I passionately despise such as the infamous bad guy turns good plot device. Despite the horrible story, pacing and the storytelling aspect is done quite decently.3. Art - 7Most of the scenes in this series even the action scenes are hand-drawn without expensive visual effects. Though the semi-CG concert scenes at the start of the series are done well, they are unable to maintain the quality to the rest of the series. The art style used is quite common for anime these days with decent shading despite the inconsistencies. There are not much background detail given though the characters are drawn well with good details.4. Character - 6Characters in this series are visually designed well however their characteristics and actions doesn't resemble that of a human I can empathize. If you think this is a pure sci-fi series like Infinite Stratos or Gundam, you're wrong because there are characters that stomps on physics laws and common sense without any sci-fi reasons or explanations at all. This might be a mistake on the studio for not explaining things or just a poor case of character designs. The relationships between the characters are laughable, an example would be the implied love relationship between the possessed main antagonist and the chief of the organization.5. Animation - 7The first episode is animated surprisingly well with good particle simulations and fine CG animations though that is not the case for the rest of the series. The animation style of this series' action scenes resembles TTGL though with lower quality. As for the non-action scenes animation are done decently bad with inconsistent detailed movements and poorly animated backgrounds.6. Sound/Music - 8This series is about girls fighting while singing so there's bound to be a whole list of songs, some are bad, some are decent, and some are actually good. I am no judge for this particular aspect, so this might be more of an opinion. My favorite would be the OP for some reason that I cannot explain. Music are mostly played on action scenes therefore it brings down the emotional value when played on emotional scenes. Sound effects are quite good in this series as they have a slight variation for every sound effects they use.7. Enjoyment - 3I find a bit of a pain while following this series as the main plot twist is as obvious as the nose in Voldemort's face. The only thing that managed to surprise me is the last plot twist, and not in a good way.final score= (5+6+7+6+7+8+3)/7 = 68. Others- Good Directing (+0.25) : There are times that this series managed to impress me by good camera angles, movements, and screen composition.- Forced End (-0.2) : The ending of a series is the most dominant factor to leave an impression on the viewer. If its done badly, it would be remembered as a bad series overall.- QUALITY issues (-0.1) : Those who followed series week-to-week and discussed it must have known the corridor scene at episode 3.Final Score = 6 + 0.25 - 0.2 - 0.1 = 5.95 = 6If you happen to pick this series, I advise you not to take this series seriously despite the first episode... a local high school.The ideas aside, the way this series handle the concept is poor.

Half badass action, half emotional character-building journey, the first arc of Symphogear was impressive for something in 2012. I'm writing this from 9 years in the future to ask 3 important questions: Does Season 1 set a good base for what Symphogear eventually became? Is it worth watching Symphogear season 1 again? And do I recommend the series in 2021? The answer to all three is yes. But there are caveats. The first is that you must...at the very least TOLERATE if not ENJOY Japanese pop. While Nana Mizuki is a  powerhouse in the soundtrack department, even I will admit, not all the fight songs in season one are bangers. That said, Tsubasa's character development is worth sticking around for, in my opinion. On the one hand, Hibiki is a Mary Sue and very much the 'Goku' of this show. On the other hand, it's a total blast to watch Hibiki, Tsubasa and Chris grow throughout this first part of the Symphogear saga. That said, if you hate 'power of friendship' deus ex machinas, you'd best look elsewhere. For me personally, as someone who loves sci-fi tones in magical girl action anime, I couldn't ask for anything better to fill the void left by Nanoha. at the very least TOLERATE if not ENJOY Japanese pop.

Not bad at all, but I lost myself a few times while watching because the singing ability threw me off track. I did not expect it characters to rely on musical elements to attack enemies.

The sound also isn't that spectacular based on commercial standards but sound design does change when the characters are...singing.Character Development:Not the best but could definitely find places to improve on.

That never happens.  This is a very basic story about friendship between little girls and fighting to save the lives of others.  I think I would have enjoyed this show a bit more if I didn't have any expectations for it.  I do remember there were a couple action scenes that were pretty good, and the characters aren't *horrible*I don't like that it sucks you in by presenting an epic struggle between these powered up songstresses and an overwhelming...alien force, and then just kind of puts that in the background and focuses on little girls and friendship.  It's that kind of bait-and-switch that has turned me off to several shows. alien force, and then just kind of puts that in the background and focuses on little girls and friendship.  It's that kind of bait-and-switch that has turned me off to several shows."", ""Some spoilers for S1, but not major spoilers. Heavy spoilers for Episode 1 tho.I think I can say with complete confidence that I have never seen a show quite like Symphogear, and I do mean that every way possible. Despite the tags it has on MAL and Anilist, it is technically not a mahou shoujo in the traditional sense. Its technical term is mecha musume, where mechanical elements are used to enhance the transformations of the girls, which makes sense because we see all these kinds of machines and different weapons be used constantly throughout the series. From sawblades, to a giant scythe, to giant...swords with boosters on them, and so on. One of the girls even uses guns and rockets as weapons, but you can also give monsters the middle finger by just punching them good. The gears that the girls use is called Symphogears, or relics that can be used by singing to activate them and even increase their powers, even if it could lead to their own death if the situation calls for it.The reason why I decided to watch this show from beginning to end is because after I finished the wonderfully tranquil and emotional Aria series, I was itching for some action, and after my Discord buddies recommended it and I saw the protagonist Hibiki Tachibana punch an actual mountain on YouTube, I became convinced that I needed to watch this show. Plus, AMQ (Anime Music Quiz) kept screwing me over by using the openings in the show, so I figured that watching it would help me out. But the point is that I wanted some dumb fun action show, and while it can be a bit frustrating, I think I got that and more out of this series overall. Despite some issues that I have with it, I can say that I really enjoyed this series throughout its run, and it’s quite impressive that it spanned throughout the 2010’s from 2012 to as recent as 2019, even though that clearly wasn’t the intention at first.So, before I begin talking about the first season, I should mention a few background details. First of all, this show was literally just made to promote Tsubasa’s seiyuu's singing career and there wasn’t really a plan for the rest of the seasons. This is obvious when you finish S1 where it ends on a pretty happy and conclusive note. Thing is, the OST did so well that the show continued, even with an entirely different studio. Encourage Films was the studio that made S1, and then the show was continued by Satelight. Satelight also co-produced Fairy Tail, and made Log Horizon as well, and they may have been somewhat involved in the production of S1.The other thing is that the director for S1, Tatsufumi Itou, also sadly passed away due to brainstem hemorrhage and died on May 23rd. However, his death was not officially announced until July 1st because of the request of his wife Mariko Itou. He was only 55 years old when he passed away. He was a key animator and has storyboarded for many different anime, such as Princess Tutu, The Aria Series, Casshern Sins, and many more. He also directed Shugo Chara! Party. Regardless of my opinions or anyone else’s opinions on S1, the fact of the matter is that he helped create this series, and the result was something that flourished and became popular in Japan and has grown some popularity in the West. My point being is that he deserves respect for his work, and I can only hope that his wife and friends are doing well and that he can rest in peace.To begin with this series, Miku Kohinata goes through a destroyed city, caused by some kind of disaster. She’s carrying some kind of flowers in the rain, symbolizing that she lost someone important to her. After getting off of a bus, she goes to a grave with the name “Hibiki Tachibana”, which also has a photo right above it. She starts crying over the loss of her best friend, and while all of this was going on, an ominous poem about a little bird continued to sing until it coughed up blood, and she also mentions how her friend continued to sing until her last breath, hinting at what’s to come.Two years earlier, we met our protagonist, who is a high school girl named Hibiki Tachibana, a fairly normal high school girl who goes to a concert by herself because her best friend Miku Kohinata invited her but couldn’t actually make it to the concert due to her aunt getting in an accident. Hibiki doesn’t really follow the two idols that are about to sing, but she goes anyways because a free concert ticket is a free concert ticket. In the background, one of the idols and a main character, Tsubasa Kazanari, is a bit worried about how the concert will play out. Her best friend Kanade Amou tells her to be more open minded and optimistic, telling her that singing is fun, and they should just enjoy singing. Kanade is the more extroverted and outgoing of the two while Tsubasa is the more introverted girl of the Zwei Wing idol duo. They also seem to work for the government, and Section 2, a government agency who specializes in saving people from disasters led by Genjurou Kazanari, who’s Tsubasa’s uncle and Hibiki’s eventually martial arts teacher as well as action movie bro with her.So, the concert begins, but the duo can only sing one song before the concert is attacked by Noise, monsters that are capable of reducing a living organism to nothing more than ash. They kill a lot of people in the concert, and of course, this is where the singing magical girl fights come into play. Kanade and Tsubasa transform and use their weapons to stop the Noise, but they’re quickly overwhelmed by the sheer number of them, and Hibiki, who seems to be the only survivor from the audience (this comes into play later), is attacked and is unable to escape. Eventually, one of Kanade’s armor pieces is damaged and is lodged right into Hibiki’s chest (Again, this comes into play, very soon might I add). Kanade chooses to save her by singing her climax song, a song that pushes the wielder to their absolute limits, and past them. To the point where it can cause either severe internal damage, or even death, which is exactly what was mentioned right at the start. All the Noise are destroyed, and Tsubasa loses her best friend. This causes Tsubasa to become a solo idol, causes her to have an internal struggle throughout this season and later on, and Hibiki to eventually become a Symphogear two years later at the end of episode 1 to save a child.Needless to say, this show starts off pretty dark. Darker than I had expected, and this does work in S1’s favor…. sometimes. Other times, it can be quite frustrating to watch it drag on with drama, especially the drama involving Miku. For what it’s worth, I was interested in seeing how the rest of this season would play out, especially since people often claim this is the worst one.After Hibiki saves the kid from Noise, the kid is reunited with her mother and Hibiki is now a Symphogear girl working with Tsubasa, with Hibiki’s special ability is punching everything in sight, and Tsubasa can conjure swords, make it rain with smaller laser beam swords, and make giant swords that fall from the sky. Tsubasa butts’ heads with Hibiki because at first, she doesn’t really want to work with someone else, and when it’s revealed that Kanade’s Gungnir is the same as Hibiki’s, which is still stored in her chest unlike Tsubasa who uses a pendant to transform, it causes Tsubasa to further put up walls, calling herself a sword that cannot feel anything. Eventually, Tsubasa fights Hibiki and she refuses because she doesn’t want to fight the person she’s working with and is trying to be friends with. Genjurou stops Tsubasa, and Hibiki says that she’ll work hard to replace Kanade, which is the worst thing you could say to her given her situation. If nothing else, I certainly feel for Tsubasa’s plight and can sympathize with her. At the same time, Hibiki is trying to be friends with Tsubasa, but is continuously denied. I do like their dynamic and Hibiki is at least endearing, if nothing else (aside from GX, that was awful). Tsubasa eventually does admit that she loves singing to a concert that she’s doing in episode 9 and decides to go on a tour around the world, but that happens later on.What does annoy me about Hibiki in this season is that she keeps saying that she really wants to save people, which is repetitive. Miku even calls it a hobby, which is really dumb, and not in the fun way. Do fire fighters save people because it’s a hobby or is it because it’s their job? This is a reoccurring plot point, which is frankly done better in G, but is done worse in GX. Outside of that, she’s an optimistic and energetic girl, despite all of the harassment and nonsense she had to deal due to the concert attack, which is also a reoccurring plot point I’ll talk about more in later seasons. She also doesn’t want to fight other people, and would rather talk things out with her enemies, which is more focused on in the later seasons as well. This can either cause endless frustration like in GX or can actually be a well defined part of her character like in G, XV, and especially in AXZ. In this season, it’s not a big focus aside from when she fights Yukine Chris, the fourth and final Symphogear girl in this season.Yukine Chris is a unique girl to say the least. Despite her angry attitude and somewhat violent outbursts against her enemies, she is the kind big sister type of character, especially when it comes to two different girls who are introduced in G. Before she becomes that girl, she is initially hostile towards the other two Symphogear girls, particularly Hibiki, who doesn’t want to fight against her. Eventually, her Symphogear transforms into Ichaival, a gear which is capable of shooting bullets, laser arrows, and giant missiles. After getting defated and later saved by Hibiki, the villain of S1, Finé, decides to leave her behind and steal the Nehushtan armor from Chris. What’s interesting about Chris is that she suffers from self loathing due to the destruction that she blames herself for and claims that she hates singing because of that. She grows as a character in later seasons and resolves her inner demons with the help of the other girls. She eventually helps fighting the Noise and Fine in this season and becomes one of the three main Symphogear girls.Next character is Miku Kohinata, Hibiki’s best friend and roommate in high school. She’s generally a cheery and helps Hibiki with her homework, but as the season goes on, she worries about Hibiki’s consistent disappearances due to her new double life. She eventually discovers that Hibiki is a Symphogear when Hibiki saved her life during a fight. What annoys me is that Miku is angry with Hibiki about keeping it a secret, when Hibiki was obviously operating under basic superhero rules of a secret identity and had to keep it a secret because the government told her too. This gets resolved in the episode afterwards, and I genuinely think this drama could’ve been cut out from S1 without much change. It just feels pointless and annoying. Beyond that, Miku’s relationship with Hibiki does get the spotlight in other seasons like G and especially in XV, but we’ll talk more about that later.I don’t have too much to say about Genjurou Kazanari, but he is Tsubasa’s uncle and commander of Section 2, a government agency responsible for dealing with disasters for the Japanese government, including issues that have to be dealt with by the gears, like the Noise and other supernatural threats. He’s portrayed as the caring and levelheaded commander of the group, and often guides the gears to defeat their enemies. Despite being a human unable to fight Noise, he’s also capable of training the gears and he’s even action movie buddies with Hibiki, which is something I find charming. There’s also Ryoko Sakurai, the head scientist of Section 2 and is responsible for a lot of research of the gears, which she calls the Sakurai theory. She also speaks some hilariously awful Engrish to American soldiers, and it’s so unintentionally funny to hear it. She’s portrayed as a mysterious, but also very cunning scientist that knows more than she lets on.Finally, there’s the main villain, Finé. She’s a character that gets referenced in every season following this one (except for GX), and beyond some interesting lore that gets explored in AXZ and XV, I found her character to be uninteresting and shallow. She wants to destroy the moon to remove the Curse of Balal, a curse that apparently makes it difficult for humans to understand one another, although the true purpose of the curse wouldn’t be revealed until the final season, XV. Eventually, Fine is defeated in a pretty cool final fight for the season. It’s also nice that there’s a little song with all three of the girls right at the end of the season to reflect on what has happened and what they learned.Next, we’ll talk about the art and animation for this season. The character designs are very different in the next four seasons in comparison to this one, and honestly, I prefer the character designs in the next couple of seasons, because the character designs in S1 look a little too…simple. Characters go off model at times, and the fights are generally uninteresting aside from the final fight. There’s a good amount of still frames too, so maybe the success of the OST for this season allowed the team to improve upon the other four seasons visually, especially in regard to XV, which looks amazing.Last but certainly not least, we have the voice acting and OST. I love Hibiki’s voice actress in particular, Aoi Yukki, who is a prolific voice actress and seiyuu. She brings so much energy and optimism to her role, and when she sings and screams, it feels really natural. I feel the same way for all of the characters, and I feel like they did great on the songs as well. Speaking of the songs, the entire show is filled with really good rock and pop songs throughout the series. They’re jams to listen too, and I enjoy all of them for one reason or another.All in all, S1 is a bit of a mixed bag. While I found Tsubasa and Chris’s arcs to be compelling enough to follow, I found the villain to be bland, and I was annoyed by the drama surrounding Hibiki and Miku. There’s not too much to this season that hasn’t been done before by other magical girl shows, but the foundation is there. It took itself too seriously, but I thought S1 was an ok start to a series that I ended up loving. We’ll talk about that more in the next review for G and possibly GX as well. swords with boosters on them, and so on. One of the girls even uses guns and rockets as weapons, but you can also give monsters the middle finger by just punching them good. The gears that the girls use is called Symphogears, or relics that can be used by singing to activate them and even increase their powers, even if it could lead to their own death if the situation calls for it.The reason why I decided to watch this show from beginning to end is because after I finished the wonderfully tranquil and emotional Aria series, I was itching for some action, and after my Discord buddies recommended it and I saw the protagonist Hibiki Tachibana punch an actual mountain on YouTube, I became convinced that I needed to watch this show.

We’ll talk about that more in the next review for G and possibly GX as well."", 'I believe in this one tenet: the most important aspect of any show is how it makes you feel. That\'s the reason why I rate Symphogear with a 6 instead of a 4. In the more technical aspects, it\'s frustratingly inconsistent: the majority of scenes, sounds, and plot developments have obvious flaws, but despite that, some moments are well crafted enough to send shivers across your body or make you tear up.For that reason, I\'ll tell ya, if you\'re the sort of person whose enjoyment stems from immersing yourself in the technical aspects of a show - teasing out every detail of the plot,...wondering at the authors\' purpose for story beats or plot devices, examining the background of each scene for hidden details, etc. - Symphogear will irritate you. Symphogear is a show about magical girls who control ancient relics with the power of songs and, yes, friendship; it\'s an unapologetically 90s-vibin\' yuri highschool drama slice-of-action-life with a tongue-in-cheek attitude that rivals the English dub of Highschool DxD. Seriously. Why men can\'t use Symphogears as well? Not important, not explained. Why the Commander can punch a bridge in two? Well, he watches a lot of Bruce Lee films. Why the Terminator is here? -garbled Engrish-So, how did this show make me feel? Optimistic! Light-hearted. The main character is a typical dunce-for-friendship, which makes me smile. Having multiple episodes with the most appalling Engrish I\'ve ever heard and a character whose only goal in life is to make meta-jokes about being an anime character couldn\'t possibly fail to make me giggle. I\'ve seen some folks complain about characters having bipolar mood swings, but that\'s par for the course with a Yuri high school drama show. Plus, some of these characters have backstories that genuinely justify it - yes, I\'m a sucker, and yes, I genuinely teared up a few times. There were several \'advice moments\' mixed in that genuinely made me think. And, finally, the premise of this show is undeniable. You sing to fight your enemies. Watching the main character punch the all-organic gelatin-based crap out of some sentient onaholes while singing her adorable head in two was grand fun.But, I wouldn\'t recommend Symphogear to a friend. While the first episode is one of the best I\'ve seen, promising a surprisingly gritty world with real consequences, genuine characters, cinematic flair, and an intriguing mystery, the show doesn\'t follow up. Most importantly, the real threat consistently implied by the writers is undermined by a \'friendship is magic\' attitude. You can do both - have optimistic characters reconcile with heavy blows in an emotional fashion - but once a character is dead, golly, they need to stay dead. Otherwise, scenes meant to be emotional just make you think, ""Get on with it, already!"". As for the sound and art. I don\'t care greatly about those aspects, so I won\'t say much - they spent most of it on the fights. The music is gripping, but the novelty does wear off, and they don\'t do much to break up the formula. Lastly, regarding the plot, I won\'t shortchange the writers and say that there were no interesting twists. But there are some developments which fall outside the realm of tongue-in-cheek breaks - like, who is the Terminator working for? What\'s that power?All in all, the inconsistency is enough to sour good memories. In order to take a show\'s message to heart, you have to hold a respect for it. By virtue of its cinematically orgasmic premise alone, Symphogear had the potential to rake that in, but I think mixed messages and inconsistent production quality ruin the respect its message deserves. That won\'t stop me from watching the next season, though - there\'s just enough silliness, action, dumb drama, and maybe a sliver of mystery to keep me interested. Not to mention, impending higher production quality! Woohoo! wondering at the authors\' purpose for story beats or plot devices, examining the background of each scene for hidden details, etc. - Symphogear will irritate you.

I\'ve seen some folks complain about characters having bipolar mood swings, but that\'s par for the course with a Yuri high school drama show. Plus, some of these characters have backstories that genuinely justify it - yes, I\'m a sucker, and yes, I genuinely teared up a few times. There were several \'advice moments\' mixed in that genuinely made me think. And, finally, the premise of this show is undeniable. You sing to fight your enemies. Watching the main character punch the all-organic gelatin-based crap out of some sentient onaholes while singing her adorable head in two was grand fun.But, I wouldn\'t recommend Symphogear to a friend. While the first episode is one of the best I\'ve seen, promising a surprisingly gritty world with real consequences, genuine characters, cinematic flair, and an intriguing mystery, the show doesn\'t follow up. Most importantly, the real threat consistently implied by the writers is undermined by a \'friendship is magic\' attitude. You can do both - have optimistic characters reconcile with heavy blows in an emotional fashion - but once a character is dead, golly, they need to stay dead. Otherwise, scenes meant to be emotional just make you think, ""Get on with it, already!"". As for the sound and art. I don\'t care greatly about those aspects, so I won\'t say much - they spent most of it on the fights. The music is gripping, but the novelty does wear off, and they don\'t do much to break up the formula. Lastly, regarding the plot, I won\'t shortchange the writers and say that there were no interesting twists. But there are some developments which fall outside the realm of tongue-in-cheek breaks - like, who is the Terminator working for? What\'s that power?All in all, the inconsistency is enough to sour good memories. In order to take a show\'s message to heart, you have to hold a respect for it. By virtue of its cinematically orgasmic premise alone, Symphogear had the potential to rake that in, but I think mixed messages and inconsistent production quality ruin the respect its message deserves. That won\'t stop me from watching the next season, though - there\'s just enough silliness, action, dumb drama, and maybe a sliver of mystery to keep me interested. Not to mention, impending higher production quality! Woohoo!', 'The biggest reason to watch this show is the action. That and the music if you are so inclined.For a show that seems to have an emphasis of music, its really just what the girls use to transform into their gundam-esc power suits to destroy all the enemies in their path. Its really just a theme the show uses as a backdrop, but nothing really gets explored with it.The characters are pretty bland overall. Don\'t go in thinking it\'ll have too much character development. Its usually just enough to get the characters to work together to destroy the ""noise,"" which are the enemies.You...can even see the plot twists coming from miles away too. So yeah, plot isnt too big of a deal. Its a pretty, by-the-numbers, affair.As far as the action goes though, it\'s superb! Even from ep 1, you see alot of great animation throughout the fight scenes. Throughout the show, the fights just get better, as the stakes get bigger and the main girl starts to get better at fighting. Especially in the final ep where it gets as epic as possible for a final battle.This show isnt great at anything but action honestly, but if you want to see girl punch through monsters, and have special moves and whatnot, give this show a shot. Otherwise, its just a bland show with bland characters that look pretty cool, or silly, when they are suited up. can even see the plot twists coming from miles away too.

The animation, while not spectacular, is at least good if not above par in most areas. The music is used skillfully to compliment the show, as well as being the basis for it. The plot is not leakproof and the writing could be better, but there are moments where the writers clearly knew what they were doing, and I feel that it's enough to salvage the show into the “good” category. There are much more poorly written shows out there. It could have been...great, but they just didn't quite make it there. Ultimately, the setup for season 2 probably hurt the show a bit. The characters are likable for the most part, and not so extreme or overbearing as to be obnoxious. Along the journey, there are even some good laughs.If you like Macross, mecha and mahou shoujo, give it a go.The extended version;First the honest truth; I dropped the show after one episode. Later, I gave it a second go and found that I had misjudged it, but I still wanted to turn a critical eye to it since it was a show that at two different times, I had totally different reactions to.The music; the core and its application;It may seem obvious, but a show about music, had better have good music, right? It does. Don't worry about that. The folks handling the show know how to use that music, too – scores and tracks are cued at the right moment and lend a great impact to what's going on, right from the get-go with the opening sequence. The final scene  of episode one I find very memorable thanks to the use of the opening theme and the sound effects used with the visuals. The MC's debut is handled in a similar fashion, matching up with her music.The animation;Initially it seems that the quality drops off after episode 1, but after further review I simply don't think that's true. The animation in the opening concert is of a completely different nature – not skill – than the rest of the show. The concert consists of wide-angle views with very little drastic camera motion, in contrast to typical anime camera movements. What you're seeing the characters do (a choreographed performance lacking complicated camera angles/cuts) is too hard to compare to a hectic fight scene. The fighting in episode 1 is pretty well the same quality as the rest of the show, perhaps being more concentrated in a bid for viewers.The rest of the show, while not animated to Gainax levels of splendor, is not done poorly. Fights have fluidity, good cuts and use of the characters. There are some stills and reuse. Now, I don't necessarily condone re-using animation, but I can't really crucify a series for having some it of – it's pretty common in a lot of older shows that I hold dear and even some newer ones. Attacks are executed with a sort of retro/classic take on things, with stylized themes that are presented relaying the name of the attack. Usually these come mid-way through execution, but it's not like they're a still frame that is being slid around to replace character motion. They're a stylized flourish.The show flexes its animation muscles several times, and each time it's a little different. For example, a fight between two Attuned (symphogear users) early on is very different from the MC's debut fight. The former is executed with wide-angle shots that the characters move rapidly and fluidly around in, rather than the latter which contained a lot of rapid cuts, impact and extreme camera shots.The show manages to avoid those weird in-between frames too, where characters look downright wrong as they transition. They also get bonus points for not using CG that stands out like a sore thumb for the Noise – it would have been so easy to do.Let's talk about likability;The show pays some amusing homage to cultural icons. Using familiar things in this way is a pretty classic way to get people on board, and I had no problems with it. I actually love it when shows reference things like this. (Like Slayers showing up on the magazine cover in Full Metal Panic, or Love, Elections and Chocolate being referenced in Sasami-san@ganbaranai)This show happens to be one of the rare instances for me where the MC is my favorite. It's also a rare show because I actually like most of the characters, save for one. Hibiki is not exactly original, but she is cute and her design and writing paired with Aoi Yuuki as her voice actress manages to pull off the clumsy, unsure but determined and headstrong character (at least she isn't useless as well, as that archetype can tend to be). Tsubasa does well supporting with her cold, emotionless exterior. The whole second branch crew, from Genjuro to Sakurai and Ogawa are likable and have an air of mystery about them. Especially Genjuro, who has an unexplained strength that the writers manage not to abuse as a convenient plot resolution device.I mentioned earlier that there was only one character I didn't like; that would be Chris. I felt she was the only one that was a bit too much of the typical. She was trying so hard to be that kind of character that it was sort of obnoxious.Let's talk about the writing;Symphogear is guilty of introducing new elements a bit too late into the plot, but I hazard a guess that this is due to their hope for a second season. The writing, while not great, is passable for a fresh franchise. It could have been great, if they had done just a few things differently. But, they managed to salvage it. I can't say how since it's ultra-spoilery, but if you decide to watch the show, just look for the specific events that connect the beginning, middle and end of the show in a symbolic way and you will see what I mean.One of the great lines of the show has to be, “the heels are in the way!”.  I know other people have noted this particular line, too. It seemed to me like a stab at the impracticality of having what are essentially high heels on your battle armor or mech. How do you solve that problem, anyways? Well, if you're Hibiki, you just break them right the hell off and go about your business. If this is the female writer in charge of the show trying to say something, then it's even more awesome.Symphogear also touches on a few things that I thought were important to its quality as a show. It poses a question that's been asked before; if there was a common enemy, would humanity unite against it, or would they keep fighting each other?The other topic is survivor's guilt. It's a pretty serious thing to bring up in a show that bounces between the sad and happy, being related to PTSD and all. Thankfully it doesn't weigh too heavy on the show and take the fun out of it, but it is a nice bit of writing/insight into the characters.Let's talk about... fanservice;Well, I'm not really a fan of fanservice, and thankfully it's limited to a small handful of unflattering camera angles of the heroines. I count this as a net positive for the show. If you're looking for that sort of stuff, this show probably isn't for you.Let's talk about the usually ill-conceived romance that plagues a lot of anime;There is none! (I feel like we dodged a bullet with this one)I'm happy about the total lack of romance, largely because in anime romance tends to be very transparent, poorly done and predictable. You could argue that there's a romance between Hibiki and Miku of the platonic sort, but I'm inclined to just call that a very long friendship. While it can be fun to see your favorite character go through the (often painful and hilarious) trials of love, I think that unless the series is more or less centered around that element, it should be avoided because it will be poorly done.Besides, the Attuned gals of Symphogear don't have time for that shit, to put it frankly.I feel like the show received a lot of harsh criticism that wasn't entirely warranted. Other shows skate by with many more egregious offenses and are still lauded and loved by many. I'm not excusing the things that the show did wrong, but most of them weren't so blatant or in-your-face as some of the crap that the big name shows pull on the viewers. Also, being an anime original with a manga accompaniment, I feel you have to give them some credit – the show was not directionless and the pacing was decent, which is more than you can say for a show like Occult Academy. Plus, for Symphogear, we're talking about a show that has a staff with very little credited to them as far as director, writer and Encourage Films are concerned. Their production was backed up by the veteran Satelite.The last thing I want to touch on is the absurdity of the show; in both the setting, mythos and design. Yes, they are magical robo-amored girls that fight colorful, amorphous blobs with music and holy relics – when hasn't mahou shoujo and mecha been pretty well ridiculous? Throw in a dash of fight them with music”, and the party is ready to start. Just go with it. Don't start comparing it to down to earth shows, because it's not really a comparison that you can make. It's probably one of those shows that's best left to people already familiar with Anime, because it's pretty far out there.All things considered, I think it came out well. I'm looking forward to season 2 (which has picked up some veteran staff apparently), and I hope that the franchise expands to give us even more than that. great, but they just didn't quite make it there.

Maybe the suits of the main characters are the only interesting. The design of the Noise are attractive but strange.The songs are...the only interesting thing of the anime.

It certainly has its highs, but it also carries with it a variety of lows... that said, I don\'t think they actually harm the show that much. It\'s not the kind of anime you turn on for an overly complex or deep plot, though I can see why people who are searching for that would be disappointed.The first episode hits like a truck, with a dramatic opening and a much darker-than-expected first half. The energy starts to calm down by episodes 2 and 3,...but it never really hits zero again, as the writers\' concept of a good plot appears to be ""throw as many twists as possible at the wall to see what sticks."" And, while a bit of a gambit, it\'s pulled off fantastically, as the show\'s almost too frantic to let its inconsistencies set in. The breakneck pacing definitely works to keep you engaged; the first time I watched it, I was almost constantly in a state of whiplash! As stated, the plot isn\'t particularly *deep,* and you have most of the major pieces of it by episode 5 or 6, it\'s still enough to make an interesting story with an overall satisfying climax.Also some people seem to have problems with characterization, but... honestly? Reading those critiques seems they completely missed the actual characterization. While I\'m hesitant to say the characters are all *particularly* deep, they do all go through some development, 2/3 of the main cast gets a satisfying arc (though the MC herself doesn\'t quite yet, I wouldn\'t say she\'s as two-dimensional as others have claimed), the villain is interesting in motive if generic in execution, and the supporting cast are all entertaining in their own ways.I will say, the fact that a particular power gets power-crept within a single season of the show is quite annoying, and I feel they should have given it more weight, I overall don\'t think it\'s that much of a flaw. Additionally, while a surface-level explanation of the Noise and the Symphogears is given, the... ""system,"" for lack of a better word, isn\'t really fully explained that well. There\'s glimpses of a deeper lore (some of which is expanded upon in later seasons), though if you\'re looking for specifics you better get used to explanations like ""I\'m just holding the door open for a once-in-a-decade event.""This anime also suffers from an occasional problem of showing, and then later (sometimes within 2-3 minutes) telling you exactly what happened anyways. There is an instance of this that particularly irks me in that there\'s a really well done conversation where you don\'t hear most of it, but you see the result, and the emotion and actions of the characters really just sell it in a way you don\'t have to know what exactly was said... and then they tell you exactly what was said anyway. Thankfully, it\'s not *too* prevalent, but it does happen. Another little gripe I have is that, like seemingly every anime with a high-school-aged cast, they saw it was necessary to include a bath scene. So, like, be ready for that if you\'re watching with someone else or just generally find those scenes icky.Animation is... fine. There are a couple parts (particularly in backgrounds) that are really jpeg-y, and a couple awkward animation segments, though those are usually not particularly egregious, and quality generally holds up more consistently than some more modern anime. It\'s still obvious more of the budget went to the first episode and finale, but less so than in other examples, and the sometimes-iffy animation is more than made up for by the absolutely amazing soundtrack, the good sound design, and the surprisingly good vocal performances in some key moments.Despite some of the show\'s little flaws, it all comes together in a package that makes the most of its strengths and weaknesses. It\'s high-energy, action-packed, turn-your-brain-off fun with one of the better anime soundtracks out there!

If it\'s your bag, you\'re going to like it and feel like it was worth the watch. Not for everyone. The fight scenes present themselves as short music videos with original music for that fight alone, and they get away with huge swings in quality of animation and direction because of that - or not, if you\'re unwilling to take that trade. Whacky plot, and female-Naruto-but-without-a-nindo (Hibiki or ""Bikkie"", our female MC) might be too silly for your palette as well. Her arc outside of the main conflict is far better than her portrayal as the hero of said conflict. There...are some, but probably not enough mature interpersonal dynamics and acceptable comedy in the rest of the show to entertain you, but if the main conflict and MC irk you (understandable) skip Symphogear. If you are a creative, optimistic person that\'s fine with wading through a dumpster fire to find little bits of treasure, you have a better shot at enjoying Symphogear than the rest of the world does - I do not claim that you will enjoy it.Overall 7A high-concept magical girl show with a dumb plot, weak characters, and good bits worth a watch sprinkled about. Symphogear highlights the cross-cultural appeal of song, exploring one interpretation of what it means. The world of Symphogear is a sci-fi fantasy present-day Japan where the ""attuned"" use ancient weapons activated by songs to defend humanity from ""the noise"" - dark spirits that thanos snap any unattuned human beings they touch. First episode is the highlight, but there are other highlights. The way in which the series is opened and closed is powerful and worthy of praise, IFF you pretend the last 2 minutes of the last episode didn\'t happen.Story 6Trash. Nothing that happens makes any sense, really. While the events as they unfold can be enjoyed for what they are, the way they are shot puts the owness on you to reflect and say ""yeah, actually I guess that is/was pretty cool direction to take it - don\'t recall a sense of immersion or appreciation when it happend..."" and thus my sense overall is one of wasted potential.Some slack is deserved as gov\'t officials are assasinated by the USA, and a failed follow-up assasination by ""childish Uncle Sam"" (lol what a line, uttered in broken English no less) does kick off the climax of the season. The relationship between the female lead and her ""best friend"" is thankfully mature in some aspects which redeems the screentime devoted. A dead character is one of the better ones, making appearences throughout the season in the memories of her closest friend and influencing events through her legacy - that was handled well. The symbolism, as far as it goes, is alright.Art 7It\'s different in key areas, and has moments of quality. Tip of the hat to the dance sequences and stage performances, which are choreographed and animated better than most live performances I\'ve seen. Unfortunately the quality is inconsistent in the extreme, and where the first episode might be a 9 much of the series might be a 4, with several episodes in between and a few good bits towards the end. The relics, transformations, and energy blasts are better than average.Sound 9You may not be into the fast-paced drum machine or 8-bit cocaine-synth, but even if that isn\'t your thing there are some truly good vocal tracks laid down all over the place in this show. The sounds of Symphogear are a large part of the experience, and though ""stylized"" and not for everyone they are a cut above in effort and quality as compared to other Anime if only because of the music and rhythmic fight sequences set to that music. The vocals in particular are haunting, powerful tracks engineered beautifully - they often save a fight scene that might cause you to simply turn the channel or go to bed if it were not set to these vocal tracks.Character 6Meh. Unfortunatley the strongest character is a dead girl. Her surviving love interest is the second strongest character. The main character, villain, and rest of the supporting cast are inconsistent at best. Character development is such standard fare I consider it non-existent in Symphogear. The show does have a few notable interactions between shitty characters, such as a scene where a covert operative tracks an asset that had been an enemy soldier until recently to a barren foxhole of an apartment. He takes a bite of the food he brought over and hands it to the asset, saying ""so you know it\'s not poisoned"", then continues to take one small bite or sip of the takeout he brought over before passing it to the asset as they discuss terms. For her part, the asset he is trying to bring in continues to maintain a combat stance even as they accept the food and drink offered and engage in a somewhat hostile discussion. The idea that she would rather starve herself than steal food until necessary, and the implication that by surveillance the operative noted this fact and brought food at exacly the moment she was probably going to go do just that rather than wither and die, was conveyed non-verbally.Also worthy is an out of place interpersonal drama between the main character and her partner, who puts up with broken plans and lame excuses as the main character begins her secret life as a power ranger/Symphogear user. Hopeful it will just stop but knowing deep down that something is going on, her partner finally finds out for a fact she\'s being lied to and dumps the main character. The way they show this to the audience is compelling and realistic. We feel the pain of the relationship slipping between the fingers of both parties despite how much it means to each of them and their attempts to stop the process. The way that all the dark thoughts and misgivings supressed by the partner whose been putting up with all this like a champ come out as anger and resentment, not understanding, and she does not forgive her or let her get away with it, was a welcome surprise. Kudos. Unfortunately they walk back their own quality writing shortly thereafter - much like the ending.Enjoyment 7Had a great time. The story had more potential than was realized, the animation was sometimes astounding but often bad, and the characters experience virtually no development and leave no impression. Forgiving the silly stuff to enjoy the show isn\'t hard, but it is too bad because it could have been replaced with easy wins. The main villain only required 5-10 minutes of additional exposition to make her a sympathetic villain, which in retrospect she ought to have been. Another 5-10 minutes of flashbacks for best-dead-girl and her living foil could have left a mark on the audience. Screentime for the American black ops unit plotting assasinations of key Japanese officials to get their hands in the Symphogear cookie jar would have been a straightforward way to do some world building around the geopolitical conflicts ancient superweapons like the Symphogear create.Not bad, but not great either. are some, but probably not enough mature interpersonal dynamics and acceptable comedy in the rest of the show to entertain you, but if the main conflict and MC irk you (understandable) skip Symphogear.

Screentime for the American black ops unit plotting assasinations of key Japanese officials to get their hands in the Symphogear cookie jar would have been a straightforward way to do some world building around the geopolitical conflicts ancient superweapons like the Symphogear create.Not bad, but not great either.', 'Symphogear is a show I respect for trying to do something most modern anime don’t anymore: Combining elements from various genres in an attempt to create an uncommon result. This is how genres evolve and eventually split to subcategories after all. Nicely going Symphogear! But respect aside… Um… Well, combining elements is not that easy. In fact, it is hard and takes talent to bridge the aesthetic differences and gap whatever expectations people from different audiences may have if watching them as separate standard genres. I have seen several attempts at this over the decades and the results are usually bad (but ground shaking the...few times they are done right). Symphogear belongs to the failed category for not managing to make that nasty bonding plausible. Why? The directing is horrible.Watching this show is like seeing cheery and scary things happening at the same time, without proper time invested into smoothly moving from one genre to another. It feels like a mismatch of a mahou shoujo for little girls, superpower action for teenage boys, and pop idol moe fluff for late teens/adults, and it all happens in a few minutes of contrived action. To put it in a more straightforward way, it combined a lot of high spirited ideology (which is meant to be cool for being unreal) with cruel down-to-earth reality (which is meant to feel brutal for being unfair). And it did it with a few seconds apart from each other. You just can’t have both; it has to be either too much of one or too much of the other.Although there have been many mahou shoujo which successful combined the standard formula with other types, such as action (established in all following similar shows by Sailor Moon ), or pop idols ( Looking for the Full Moon did a great job here) this is not a case where you feel the storyboard makes sense when they combined action and pop idols, and tragic elements. Let me give you a few examples from the first episodes just to make all that more clear.a) The heroines are pop idols and after their concert is over, evil monsters attack. Oh, how convenient for that to happen so they can show off their powers right there. And lazy script-wise too, which gives you bad first impressions. It’s like they said “Hey we don’t have time to waste so let’s just throw in the action right after the song.”b) So they transform and move to the offence. This is done in quite an unorthodox way, since they retain their power by singing DURING the battle. Their clothes are not cute uniforms with ribbons but high teck battle suits. And their form of attacks is not fluffy pink rays from magic wands but huge swords and axes which cut the monsters to pieces. So imagine a scene where they sing a pop song while butchering to pieces weird looking creatures. Sounds original and cool doesn’t it? Sure, I admit it myself; I haven’t seen something exactly like that anywhere else. I have seen fighting pop idols in Bubblegum Crisis and there was singing during battles, but it was just a recorded song playing in the background purely for aesthetic flavouring. They weren’t singing it at THAT moment nor was it relevant to the way they fight. So in Symphogear singing is essential part of their battles and not just flavouring. This is theoretically making it far more plausible/original/important and should offer the series a boost in interest.And THIS is the part where it feels stupid instead of cool. The way the heroines talk in battle is completely immature, like this is a show aimed at little girls. The battles are far from childish though because many people are killed by being literally turned to dust by the monsters. It may look cartoony but it is still deaths. And then the monsters are cut to pieces by the heroines, again in a cartoony way but still count as deaths. All this time the girls are singing a pop song, which sounds too off with the whole situation. THEY ARE SINGING A SILLY SONG WHILE PEOPLE ARE BEING KILLED! And how do they even manage to sing so well during battle anyway? All those acrobatics don’t affect their singing performance in the least and it sounds like a well planned studio recording.c) One of the heroines sacrifices herself in order to save a girl in the crowd. Why did she do that specifically for her and not anyone else? Did she sense anything? We are not told.d) That girl has a similar power and knows how to sing perfectly even when she suddenly transformed for the first time and was completely shocked with the whole thing. HOW DID SHE KNOW? This is not plausible at all; in fact it feels completely retarded.e) Lots of other events take place, such as more monster attacks and the new heroine trying to save a kid. It feels like they tried to cram in a single episode a plot worth for 4 episodes, and that resulted to rushing through everything. You are hardly given a minute to see something before something different happens out of nowhere. It would be easy to have all those events happening at the same time during the concert attack. This way it wouldn’t feel like there are three different timeskips taking place IN THE SAME EPISODE! But instead of that you are given the impression you are watching a summary instead of a normal show.It all comes down to giving each scene enough time to let the viewer savour and be absorbed by it. If I read this correctly, the original script was planned to be much longer in episodes but then because of duration restrictions the animators had to cram as much plot as possible in each episode. As a result the pacing is so fast that you are not allowed to enjoy the show. Things blow up, people die, and you are not made to care because no time was invested in getting to care or know any of all that. So what if a thousand civilians get killed by monsters? Do you know anything about them? What if a heroine dies in the pilot episode? Did you know anything about her? Or are you made to be afraid of those faceless things they are fighting? WE ARE NOT MADE TO FEEL ANYTHING!Other shows like Clannad or Lucky Star are so lovable for so many people only because a great deal of duration and effort is given on getting to like the characters. They don’t need epic battles or a complicating story; they just manage to be cute and fuzzy with simple everyday actions. No amount of action scenes or funky visuals can replace such simple and fundamental elements. And this is what Symphogear lacks completely; it just runs through the plot without letting you enjoy it.f) Having to rush thing though does not mean they can’t make a good show out of it. Others did something similar with Vision of Escaflowne but the result was still wonderful. Here, it is one big mess because the director was incapable of adjusting to the crammed plot.- The scenes change in a chaotic pace and we see lots of battles being shown on the run like a summary.- We are being fed most of the mysteries with dull forced explanatory monologues and without actually seeing anything to confirm all that. A proper director would have shown all that instead of just having some people standing still and talking about it. Anyone who doesn’t know what they are saying wouldn’t get anything but the imagery alone is enough to cross language barriers.- The background music is completely random. They just throw some tune to play and don’t care if it fits with whatever happens in the foreground.- The action scenes look like a videogame (you even see the names of the special attacks), so I am made to think this is all some sort of silly action game and not a living, breathing world I should (that’s right) care about. It’s like “Oh no, they killed a dozen civilians, how many points do I lose for that?”g) This pacing issue eventually crawls all the way to the characters and trashes them as well, since they are doing lots of things without the viewer understanding the reasons or being made to care about them. So what if the heroine cries for the loss of her comrade and wants to avenge her death by attacking her replacement? It all happens in few minutes around people you hardly know and while an out-of-place song plays in the background. You are left wondering why you should care when a few minutes later something completely different happens and they have completely changed emotions.And skip that, without time invested on the characters, they are just stereotypes you will forget fast. Instead of trying to flavour them, the directors simply chose to over-sexualize them to the point you care only for their bodies and not their personalities. I mean seriously, there is a lot of sexual foreplay in this show which is almost worrisome if you think how young the girls are. This takes away all respect from them and again, this wouldn’t happen if the directors had invested more time on them.Aside from the characters, I don’t care about their antagonists either, those weird monsters. They don’t have a personality or a clear ulterior motive and are drawn goddamn ugly. Plus, in just a few episodes they are already defeated by the hundreds and pass as nothing more than brainless bullies chasing around defenceless people for fun, instead of having a masterplan or something to consider them anything more than mooks.And even the monsters are just peons of other evil magical girls, who appear to be fond of sadism and love to torture others for really childish reasons. Even those don’t give any more colours to the show because their motives are again thin, the pacing is horrible, and they are presented as nothing more than horny sluts.And even after that, there are actually tanks firing at the monsters and black ops assassinating high officials. It feels completely off-topic to see that military/conspiracy element in the context of this show. Can you imagine a Man In Black next to a magical girl? I can’t.h) So technically, this mess is the result of bad aesthetics, something which most people don’t notice and can easily pass as great. And why wouldn’t it, the actual production values are not bad. The songs are dynamic, the battles are spectacular, the setting is a blend of our present with partially futuristic weaponry and epic fantasy elements. This is of course not a first in anime; just in recent history to this show we had lots of other famous anime doing something similar, such as Madoka Magica and Toaru Majutsu no Index. Those shows are again famous thanks to their AESTHETICS AND CHARACTERS and not because they look cool or plausible. So again, the show is not inflicting you with enough emotions to love it despite looking cool. You can still of course feel like hating it or loathing it exactly because it didn’t manage to win you over.It’s not the main idea that it’s at fault here. I really liked the premise despite sounding weird. Other shows managed to present weirdness in a far more likable way and gained great respect thanks to it. Some examples include:- Macross by fighting an interstellar armada of war-like aliens with a pop song- Princess Tutu by fighting monsters through ballet dance- Lyrical Nanoha by making all the magical weapons to work like computerized military weaponry- Rahxephon by having huge robots which work and attack with monotonous sounds/wave frequencies- Hell, I will even include a live action series called Kamen Rider Hibiki. The hero was fighting monsters with musical instruments.I really loved the weird way the characters were fighting in the above examples, even though they sound equally stupid as this one. The difference is, they presented it NICELY and invested time into making it look plausible and entertaining. So no, it is a very bad show for failing to achieve even the most fundamental element of any good show: Making you care.p.s. Honourable mentioning of other music-battle-themed titles I failed to throw in somewhere in this text: Panty & Stocking, Black Heaven, Detroit Metal City, Ar Tonelico, The World Ends With You.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 8/10General Artwork 2/2 (looks nice)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 2/2 (nice sci-fi overtones)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 2/2 (lots of pretty colours)SOUND SECTION: 5/10Voice Acting 2/3 (silly but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (the songs aren’t bad but they are throwing them randomly at a scene)Sound Effects 1/3 (they sing very fake while fighting)STORY SECTION: 4/10Premise 2/2 (interesting)Pacing 0/2 (very messy)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 1/2 (cheesy)CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 1/2 (cheesy)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 0/2 (messy because of the directing)Catharsis 1/2 (overblown but there)VALUE SECTION: 2/10Historical Value 0/3 (none)Rewatchability 0/3 (I will never rewatch it)Memorability 2/4 (it had nice ideas but that’s it)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10I wasn’t made to care about it right from the start.VERDICT: 4/10 few times they are done right).

I really really thought it was trash. When I first watched 4-5 episodes of it I really thought this anime was garbage. Then it started to get better. I thought of course this anime is garbage it has a 7.04 rating on Myanimelist! So.. what made this anime so bad for the first 7 episodes? The fact that everything they did was wrong besides the action scenes. The music was really annoying and went against the mood of the series and it was paced way too fast making it seem like there was little to no depth, and there...is depth, but they could have improved in that area. This show could have gone more the attack on titan route, but this has its own unique charm. Not to mention, the art makes this show look like modern day pokemon and that is not good. So that is why I thought this anime was nothing entertaining and was only targeted towards girls below 10 years old.However, we actually start to see the characters develop after episode 7 and not just some stupid people with no logic actually driving conflicts. We see the characters develop and with good reason. Something that MOST animes actually fail on. The characterization and plot driving forward is actually natural it is not forced, although yes, the entire series is rushed. If you can get over the outdated art and the stupid 24/7 music in every cutscene that goes against the mood of the anime which to the point that cannot be taken seriously, then this anime is good.Just keep in mind the anime takes awhile to get good. It's a slow burner, which I'm not sure if that's normal in anime. The other good part about this anime is that it's really comedic and it makes up for all its flaws in the action department. It just brightens my day how childish the action scenes can really be. I recommend this show over other shows that are listed above 8+ on MAL. If you're expecting a plot driven story, this isn't for you. is depth, but they could have improved in that area.

I\'ve been told that it\'s a hidden gem and that it\'s underrated, but this.... this is not what I\'m expecting at all. I was hooked at the beginning because of the concept about girls wearing battle armor with songs to power it. Honestly it\'s a good concept.  I\'ll try my best to avoid much spoiler but don\'t expect too much.The story starts of strong and quickly draws my attention because the main character, Hibiki suddenly shown dead. It shows flashbacks of how it happened and it...did pretty well imo. The tone that they are going to show is dark at the beginning, but as it go on, I can\'t even make a difference between this and a kid\'s show. The writing in this show is horrible, they don\'t even explain what Symphogears are and only tell that it\'s an ancient relic or some sort. The Noise, the enemies on this anime also didn\'t have much explanation about them other than they kill humans and turn them to dust. Hell, even the main antagonist have a very poor motivation as to why they\'re evil. like the story is all over the place. You don\'t get an explanation about symphogears, the Noises, how Tsubasa\'s uncle can FREAKIN\' DEFLECT Tsubasa\'s symphogear weapon and go toe to toe with the main antagonist is beyond me. When they try to explain anything they done it very poorly. Instead, they added useless scenes about stuff that don\'t need to be a scene. They poorly explain important plot points and feel like they rushed everything, hoping the viewers will understand something. Eventually.The characters... oh man... They have so much potential to be great. if only they were written well. Hibiki is your average normal girl who likes to help people and be all cheery and shit. Until she WASN\'T. Turns out, in the beginning she almost DIED and then Kanade, a symphogear user, instead of getting her to safety, YELLED at her to keep living. WTF. Bro, she\'s literally DYING of blood loss atm. Hibiki\'s character could become more interesting if they made her character similair to how Emiya Shirou is handled in UBW because how similair they are imo but nope, she\'s just like a typical happy go lucky main character that has no depth. There\'s a lot of this stuff that\'s like this in the anime and i mean A LOT. What grinds my gears are the relationship between Kanade and Tsubasa are not explored enough. I think it might be interesting to show more than merely a glimpse of it.  There\'s a lot that i want to complain about the characters but that\'ll make it too damn long. As if this review isn\'t long enough lmao.The animation is mediocre, bu it sometimes show good animation like the one that they show in episode 01. But most of the time, the animation can look stiff and derpy. I don\'t like how in certain scenes they add fan service as much as they can fit in the fight scenes and on normal scenes. It can be very annoying for meThe sound is the one of the good parts of symphogear. the opening and ending songs are catchy and the symphogear activation song is very nice. i can\'t tell much about the SFX and the BGM but i guess they were ok?Overall i somewhat(?) enjoyed watching it. The concept is nice but the execution of the story is very poor, with mediocre animation, bland characters but a somewhat good sound, you can at least kinda enjoy it. But not much. I wouldn\'t really recommend watching it with logic, might as well shut your brains off and enjoy it anyways. I\'m still going to watch more of it to get the appeal of this anime but idk, I might not make it to season 5. Thanks for reading this review. See ya did pretty well imo.

See ya', '♬ ""Listen to my song"" ♬ The first opening theme in Senki Zesshō Symphogear is one of those catchy tunes, that from merely seeing the lyrics written out, Nana Mizuki\'s voice will immediately start playing in your head! Truly, a banger of a song! Welcome to Symphogear, where singing can be converted into phonic waves, which is then used to take down a bunch of aliens, mutants, and every other mythological destruction device imaginable! The fighting system is very similar to the technical magic that is employed in ""Mahō Shōjo Lyrical Nanoha"" but, with the hyperbolic meter cranked up to two-hundred! Senki Zesshō Symphogear is...like a fusion of the ""Macross"" idol ""deculturization"" — fused with the magical, science fiction in ""Yūki Yūna wa Yūsha de Aru""! An amalgam of everything cool in fictional realities, but this aspect is sometimes overused, and causes a bit of a detriment to the plot.⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThe series starts out with a battle that costs Tsubasa Kazanari\'s girlfriend, Kanade Amō, her life. And of course, to up the ante, Hibiki Tachibana (the girl her girlfriend risked her life to save) is then recruited as a new trainee, because a piece of Amō\'s symphogear (""Gungnir"") is embedded inside of the young girl\'s chest. Naturally, Tsubasa is a bit bitter towards Hibiki, but—like every buddy cop trope in existence, they eventually become friends! Chris Yukine is an antagonist/rival character that works for the megalomaniacal, Finé, before having a change of heart; many of Chris\' reasons for being evil, her parents\' deaths/being sold into sex trafficking, are very vague in the first season and it\'s difficult to discern any of the characters\' real motives.Since some of the staff from the first season are swapped when Senki Zesshō Symphogear G comes around, that season exfoliates a lot of the head-scratching moments from the first season and is less about ""Yū-Gi-Ō""-like, prisma-colored abilities and more about the internal struggles that each character bears; and how, despite the odds, they fight against an enemy with unfettered strength. And because of this, Hibiki Tachibana\'s famous catchphrase is, when asked ""what if [insert problem here] is impossible to solve""—she says ""even so"" and usually ends the statement with punching a bad guy into oblivion!Yes, the side-plot about Finé using ancient relics to resurrect ""The Tower of Babel"" and getting Gold Saint (""Saint Seiya"") armor was cool! Yes, the fight choreography, after Chris uses ""Ichaival"" for the first time, was cool! But, that isn\'t enough to sustain the story! The first season would have benefited more from having more character moments with Hibiki, Miku, Tsubasa, and Chris! There\'s an endless onslaught of battles and then the big reveal that Ryōko Sakurai was Finé all along, which really isn\'t a surprise at all! If you\'re new to the Symphogear series, and you don\'t like the first series, keep in mind that the sequel productions are much better—think of the first season as just an introduction into the world.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Tatsufumi Itō (director, episode director, storyboard, key animation), notable works:* Mahō Sensei Negima!: Mō Hitotsu no Sekai Extra  — Mahō Shōjo Yue♥* Shugo Chara! Party!Commentary: Mr. Itō passed away last May (2020). It\'s a shame, because even though the first season of Symphogear isn\'t the greatest, there could have been another series or OVA that he could have finished with excellence. While he was alive, Mr. Itō did the storyboards and key animation for a good number of popular series. The direction seems a bit disoriented in this particular show, but since the man recently passed away, giving too harsh of criticism would feel like stomping on his grave.

I don\'t think I\'ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she\'s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too!

Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they\'re not ecstatic, they\'re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from ""Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu""!

Her most famous role is obviously her performance as Conan Edogawa (""Detective Conan""), and she does such an enigmatic job as portraying a genius in a child\'s body!

Wonderful job!Conclusively, I wish the first season of Senki Zesshō Symphogear was a little bit better, so more people would get into the whole series. The directing in the first act is a little bit slipshod and the characters aren\'t really revealed to have as much of a personality, until G. The crutch that Season One leans on, are the multiplicity of the characters\' romantic relationships: Tsubasa with Kanade, Hibiki and Miku, and Genjūrō with Ryōko! But, the sentimentality of these relationships cannot be fully realized, unless the character writing is stronger, which is does eventually get to be, in the succeeding seasons! I give Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) a 4/10, but highly recommend Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two)!Rankings:Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) ★★☆☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) ★★★★☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) ★★★☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear AXZ (Season Four) ★★★★★Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV (Season Five) ★★★☆☆ like a fusion of the ""Macross"" idol ""deculturization"" — fused with the magical, science fiction in ""Yūki Yūna wa Yūsha de Aru""! An amalgam of everything cool in fictional realities, but this aspect is sometimes overused, and causes a bit of a detriment to the plot.⚠️ This review will have spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersThe series starts out with a battle that costs Tsubasa Kazanari\'s girlfriend, Kanade Amō, her life. And of course, to up the ante, Hibiki Tachibana (the girl her girlfriend risked her life to save) is then recruited as a new trainee, because a piece of Amō\'s symphogear (""Gungnir"") is embedded inside of the young girl\'s chest. Naturally, Tsubasa is a bit bitter towards Hibiki, but—like every buddy cop trope in existence, they eventually become friends! Chris Yukine is an antagonist/rival character that works for the megalomaniacal, Finé, before having a change of heart; many of Chris\' reasons for being evil, her parents\' deaths/being sold into sex trafficking, are very vague in the first season and it\'s difficult to discern any of the characters\' real motives.Since some of the staff from the first season are swapped when Senki Zesshō Symphogear G comes around, that season exfoliates a lot of the head-scratching moments from the first season and is less about ""Yū-Gi-Ō""-like, prisma-colored abilities and more about the internal struggles that each character bears; and how, despite the odds, they fight against an enemy with unfettered strength. And because of this, Hibiki Tachibana\'s famous catchphrase is, when asked ""what if [insert problem here] is impossible to solve""—she says ""even so"" and usually ends the statement with punching a bad guy into oblivion!Yes, the side-plot about Finé using ancient relics to resurrect ""The Tower of Babel"" and getting Gold Saint (""Saint Seiya"") armor was cool! Yes, the fight choreography, after Chris uses ""Ichaival"" for the first time, was cool! But, that isn\'t enough to sustain the story! The first season would have benefited more from having more character moments with Hibiki, Miku, Tsubasa, and Chris! There\'s an endless onslaught of battles and then the big reveal that Ryōko Sakurai was Finé all along, which really isn\'t a surprise at all! If you\'re new to the Symphogear series, and you don\'t like the first series, keep in mind that the sequel productions are much better—think of the first season as just an introduction into the world.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Tatsufumi Itō (director, episode director, storyboard, key animation), notable works:* Mahō Sensei Negima!: Mō Hitotsu no Sekai Extra  — Mahō Shōjo Yue♥* Shugo Chara! Party!Commentary: Mr. Itō passed away last May (2020). It\'s a shame, because even though the first season of Symphogear isn\'t the greatest, there could have been another series or OVA that he could have finished with excellence. While he was alive, Mr. Itō did the storyboards and key animation for a good number of popular series. The direction seems a bit disoriented in this particular show, but since the man recently passed away, giving too harsh of criticism would feel like stomping on his grave.

I don\'t think I\'ve ever met one person who has remotely disliked her character! While being a hardcore tsundere, she\'s also very caring, kind, and empathetic; despite, her backstory and immense trauma during her stead as a villainess, in the first season! In my opinion, Chris is one of the best examples of a reformed adversary, and she kicks a lot of butt, too!

Her role as Miku Kohinata is doting and maternal, and it reminded me of her roles as Tsukihi Araragi in the ""Monogatari"" series! She has a very charming, earthly aura when she plays certain characters — when they\'re not ecstatic, they\'re often very practical like Crusch Karsten from ""Re:Zero kara Hajimeru Isekai Seikatsu""!

Her most famous role is obviously her performance as Conan Edogawa (""Detective Conan""), and she does such an enigmatic job as portraying a genius in a child\'s body!

Wonderful job!Conclusively, I wish the first season of Senki Zesshō Symphogear was a little bit better, so more people would get into the whole series. The directing in the first act is a little bit slipshod and the characters aren\'t really revealed to have as much of a personality, until G. The crutch that Season One leans on, are the multiplicity of the characters\' romantic relationships: Tsubasa with Kanade, Hibiki and Miku, and Genjūrō with Ryōko! But, the sentimentality of these relationships cannot be fully realized, unless the character writing is stronger, which is does eventually get to be, in the succeeding seasons! I give Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) a 4/10, but highly recommend Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two)!Rankings:Senki Zesshō Symphogear (Season One) ★★☆☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear G (Season Two) ★★★★☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear GX (Season Three) ★★★☆☆Senki Zesshō Symphogear AXZ (Season Four) ★★★★★Senki Zesshō Symphogear XV (Season Five) ★★★☆☆', ""I had pretty decent hopes for Symphogear, and even stuck it out through some of the sillier episodes in hope that the darker aspects of the show would become more developed.However, unlike Madoka, this show fails to deliver on a deeper level.Basically, it's a cheaper, less aesthetically and mentally pleasing version of Madoka; if you want entertainment, go with the real deal. "", 'Saving humanity through song!...no seriously this is a thing.Ok, LA knows this anime\'s premise sounds weird and this anime knows it and embraces it in all it\'s weirdness and seriousness. Yes this anime does take itself too seriously at times with some over dramatized melodrama at times (mainly through characters lying to some character not liking each other for backstory reasons) and too laxxed at times considering the mood it wants giving us a bit of mood whiplash from time to time.Ok enough about the weirdness of this anime, let\'s move onto to characters. The characters are your stereotypical characters, we have the passionate...one who\'s also OP as hell, the cold-hearted one but opens up later and ANOTHER cold-hearted one but is an anti-villain but opens up later on. There does seem to be some inconsistency towards some of the characters sudden change in behaviour ""because plot"" this especially goes to Tsubasa.LA\'s favourite character would actually go to Chris Yukine voiced by \'\'Ayahi Takagaki\'\' as although her backstory is dramatized as hell, once she comes around she\'s the least annoying. In terms of character development it does bounce from character backstory to character backstory to reinforce the ""bonds"" of the main cast in some way. However on speaking of backstory, the main villain of this season\'s backstory was rather rushed in an info dump kind of way as the reveal of the villain did come rather late. The ""reveal"" of the villain however is blatantly obvious by the Episode 4 mark though so see the obvious clues!.There are deaths in this anime, however beside the only one that mattered to the plot, the rest of the supposed deaths is more for melodramatic purposes and to be frank cop outs especially by the ending.The main cast do become extremely badass by the end of series (heck even some of the minor characters like Tsubasa\'s uncle Genjuurou voiced by \'\'Hideo Ishikawa\'\' even gets his shining moment) however most of the cast have A LOT of plot armor (or the obvious there are more seasons of this series thus they CANNOT die).This anime has a weird habit of ""fighting to befriend"" tactic which reminds LA of Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha\'s first season right down to the plot beats just instead of magical talking mech staves, we have mech suits that activate through singing. The mech suits themselves have some inconsistencies themselves especially in the Swan Song, one time it\'s fatal then it only mildly hurts you by the end of it...seems like plot convenience than anything else especially for the ending.In terms of animation by Satelight and Encourage Films, they did do a decent job at it, especially in the fight scenes however in-between them, it had some janky facial animation to just low quality standards and really as vibrant and flashy the backgrounding and battle scenes are, the janky animation was rather blatant.Now since this is a singing show, LA will talk about voice acting and singing, Aoi Yuuki, Ayahi Takagaki and Nana Mizuki were actually pretty good as both vocalist for singing as well as for the more dramatized scenes of acting with Nana Mizuki being the most natural, Aoi Yuuki was pretty moe throghout though she has times where she went full berserk with the vocals to match and Ayahi Takagaki was the spunky tsundere one with some dramatic times here and there. The music sung as both battle OST and a part of the plot itself, does help with the battle scenes although if you don\'t like auto-tune with techno beats you might see this as more of an annoyance than anything else, but with Nana Mizuki singing?..well that\'s one of the appeals to OST in the first place, not to mention the OP done by her was awesome as hell.The ending did get rushed as LA mentioned before however for what the penultimate episode leading to the ending was rather invigorating to watch, the actual ending however had too much plot armor to it as LA mentioned before, it was an ending to watch as to how batshit crazy and badass the three main Symphogear users are, but again the ""melodrama"" does come out to be a cop out with NO explanation whatsoever.Senki Zesshou Symphogear: Meteoroid-Falling, Burning, and Disappear, Then... is an anime filled with inconsistencies, however with that it does give some character development to the main cast for their love of singing (in order to save humanity...that too), and even though the blatant main villain of this season does take the show away from the main cast.Senki Zesshou Symphogear you may be a season filled with and built on a foundation of inconsistency, but if anything the appeal to this season and in the future by in large this series\' appeal is for it\'s wacky batshit crazy mech-suited idol battles and of course...it\'s music. one who\'s also OP as hell, the cold-hearted one but opens up later and ANOTHER cold-hearted one but is an anti-villain but opens up later on.

They gain their power from singing which is a unique concept, and the show has a lot of songs in it because of it. It's interesting.The characters are an average cast and show good character development, but there are significant developments that are forgotten between episodes and seasons which makes a lot of it pointless.minor spoilers:The story starts okay, then every season basically re-hashes the same thing with a different flavor. Over all of the seasons there's a significant event from S1 that gets rehashed--not just once, but twice--which makes it...lose the impact that it had in the first place and becomes comically lazy writing.Once you've seen one season you've basically seen every season since plot devices are reused and they're constantly learning the same lessons. lose the impact that it had in the first place and becomes comically lazy writing.Once you've seen one season you've basically seen every season since plot devices are reused and they're constantly learning the same lessons."", ""I finished watching the first two seasons of Symphogear.In Symphogear nearly all of the drama is ham-fisted but in a way it matches the over-the-top nature of the entire series. I say this affectionately.The plot can be described simply as 'epic,' with plenty of interspersed drama. There are a lot of exciting climactic moments where you can feel the hype.Symphogear is very creative in general with rich artistic flavour. The series just oozes creativity and this is one of my favourite aspects of it. Very creative outfits and character designs too.The OST is pretty great with loads of vocal songs by the...female cast. I've relistened to some of the albums many times and put some of them on my portable music device. The music of the series is definitely a positive in my mind but I recognize that this is highly subjective. I always like it when a franchise puts out lots of character songs and other musical content.I generally don't enjoy action in cinematic works but in this case the action scenes are entertaining and engaging to me. Both because of how they are portrayed artistically and because of the songs that accompany them.I watched the BDs and didn't perceive any technical production issues. Animation quality was fine; no complaints.Yuri romance is served as a (also ham-fisted) side dish. I really like yuri romance so this was a plus for me. It doesn't dominate the screentime so don't let that deter you from watching.Overall 7/10 and I think the series deserves praise mainly on the basis of creativity and artistic merit.

As was the case for me, and especially because it was with minors. But if you can tolerate it, then you\'re in for a surprise.This first season has heart, and a god-damn lot of it. It\'s earnest in what it tries to do, even though it trips and stumbles on the way there. But it\'s not without glaring flaws like mentioned about. Being an original anime, it has no source material to base itself on. Everything in the anime is...just as the writer\'s intend it to be. And you can tell a lot of it is a first try for some of the writing team. While I believe their efforts bore fruit, it\'s worth mentioning what parts of this anime succeeded and what flopped hard.Firstly, the music. It\'s probably what this anime is most known for. It all comes down to preference. A lot of the voice actresses for this anime are idols in Japanese media. Tsubasa Kazanari\'s actress in particular is the one I found myself enjoying the most. All of the songs were enjoyable, and the finale song especially had some good tie-ins. But music is very preferential. And it\'s the premise of the anime, so hopefully it\'s up your alley should you decide to dive in. Or you might be focusing more on the subtitles and boob physics than you will enjoying the OST.To start off with, the premise of Symphogear isn\'t unique. But it\'s got unique traits, and that\'s where the charm comes from. Magical girl anime about the power of friendship, or as Hibiki Tachibana puts it, the power to hold hands and sing songs, and how that\'s strong enough to stop aliens from turning everyone into charcoal. How is that possible? It\'s not the most clean cut definition, but the anime makes earnest attempts to drag you into the world and the logic of Symphogears, the weapons used by the main cast, and guide you through it\'s oddball story.Story spoilers for the entirety of season one ahead.Hibiki Tachibana is the only kind of protagonist I\'ve seen in recent media that will completely refuse to fight and have a very good reason to. The value of life, of communication, that Hibiki holds is believable. Having survived a deadly Noise attacked that slaughtered thousands of people, including one of the cast\'s Symphogear users, Kanade, Hibiki Tachibana almost seems to fill in the Shirou Emiya role. Wishing to help others through survivors guilt. But it goes beyond that premise. Showing her grief in the most painful of ways later down the line, where the once blessed remnants of Gungnir in her chest suddenly captivate and alter Hibiki into a monster of her own making. It\'s a heart-breaking scene as you come to enjoy the young girl and the goofy nonsense she spouts throughout the season up to that point. And it\'s believable, too.The story woven around Hibiki is one of simplicity. While it goes off the rails towards the final episodes in its premise, it remains grounded in this simple fact: Hibiki is now a Symphogear user who has to keep living her life as a normal girl at the same time. After being attacked by Noise on a fateful day, and having her relic painfully awakened inside her chest, the sink is right there. The physical torture, painful as it is to watch, is captivating to someone who might wonder what the full extent of a Symphogear is capable of. How a little gem with some tunes playing next to it can infuse a girl with robotic-like limbs, mechanical parts sprouting out of her back and tearing apart her insides, is even feasible. It\'s interesting, to say the least.The show delivers on its messages in simple ways, even into the wild finale. Take Cris Yukine, one of the antagonists turned protag. Her main drive is to stop the needless fighting, under the guidance of Fine. What\'s the thing that made her turn to Hibiki in the end? The simple idea that Hibiki just wanted to talk. Instead of fighting, just talking instead.Or the way that Miku, one of the supporting protagonists, aids people in fleeing from the Noise? Just by running as fast as she can to lure the monsters away, and let others escape. No fighting needed, no weapon. Just herself to let others keep living, her own way of protecting people.The finale\'s ending, Hibiki being rendered powerless even with her own songs. Yet the song of her classmates being projected over some nearby loud speakers was more than enough to activate her god-like mode and let her keep fighting. And not just her, but Tsubasa and the now-allied Cris. Strong enough to punch a piece of the moon out of existence in a ridiculous, over-the-top way of saying ""we do not care how ridiculous we look, look at how STRONG THEY ARE WITH FRIENDSHIP.""It\'s ridiculous, but in an endearing way. It reminds me of Gurren Lagann in some ways. Not saying this anime is Gurren, but the heart is there.Alas, this anime is not without faults. And some egregious ones, I might add.As mentioned before, the show features sexual images and has a strong theme of it. In the first few episodes, there are some very prominent scenes involving a nude woman, torture, it\'s disturbing. It\'s all painted in a bad light, of course. But it is bothersome just how ""evil"" they needed to make this main villain. It feels unnecessary.Hibiki and Tsubasa have very tame designs, but characters like Cris and Fine are very skimpily clad. There\'s a lot of close-up shots of breasts and butts and all of it. It\'s eye-candy to a pretty big extreme. In my eyes, it was a red flag for a while. But anime in general tends towards these themes. If you\'re used to this kinda stuff, it won\'t bother you much more than it would in another anime.As mentioned before, the story is absurd. It\'s relentless in how much information it will feed you and then ask you to just accept and go along with. Suspension of disbelief is the phrase here. If it happens in the show, just roll with it. If it looks like it\'s leading somewhere, jot it down. And if it doesn\'t go much anywhere, just leave it be.The main enemy force, I will say, seems poorly designed. The Noise follow up with their name quite directly. They appear to be chaotic wavelengths that remind me heavily of the Angels from Neon Genesis: Evangelion. They do not have a singular defining feature besides being colourful to the extreme and making squeaky noises when they move. Far from my favourite enemy design, but their purpose in the story is to be punched and stabbed to death anyways.The story isn\'t slow to start, not at all. But it will have moments of being grounded. If you\'re here for the music and the action and the cute girls, you\'ll get that last one for sure, but season one takes its time. It has honest attempts at mature character arcs for a lot of the main cast. And while some of the arcs are great, I personally think, you may not have much love for them if you\'re just wanting to watch Hibiki punch things and scream about holding hands.Overall, this is a pretty decent anime. I consider season one to be better than season two, in terms of how earnest it is. Season two improves on some of the things that season one fails on. But it is far from a terrible anime. So long as you can be lax about the sexual nature of it. Symphogear season one is a fairly alright stand-alone watch. If you find yourself enamored by the first two episodes, go ahead and see what\'s up. just as the writer\'s intend it to be. And you can tell a lot of it is a first try for some of the writing team.

If you find yourself enamored by the first two episodes, go ahead and see what\'s up.', 'Symphogear, or Senki Zesshou Symphogear, or if you want to call it by its ridiculously long ""well this is certainly an anime title"" name, ""Symphogear: Meteoroid-Falling, Burning, and Disappear then..."" (I\'m not making this up, this subtitle is literally featured in the opening and is completely official) is a magical girl (?) action anime from 2012. It has 5 seasons, along with a new project which was recently announced, but this review is only about the first season.I wanted to watch this because I was interested in watching some magical girl anime, and saw this had the tag. I watched one of the later season’s...OPs and thought it looked pretty cool. This isn’t really a typical “Magical Girl” anime, as it’s also a sci-fi show.To describe it, it’s about a group of girls who protect the world from creatures called the “Noise” with the power of singing and friendship using weapons called “Symphogears”. If that sounds ridiculous, that’s because it is. Without getting into spoilers, expect plot twists, mostly towards the end.The main character, Hibiki Tachibana, is an ordinary girl who’s at a music school called Lydian Academy with her friend Miku. Hibiki is one of the 3 Symphogear wielders in the show. The second one is Tsubasa, a pop idol who Hibiki is a fan of. The start of the show also has a concert of hers where the other member of Zwei Wing (Kanade) is killed by the noise. Tsubasa describes herself as a “Blade” and uses a sword. The third member who only really appears about halfway through the season is Chris, who’s  like an slightly angry character with a dark backstory. She uses guns, and although Tsubasa is my favourite character overall her attacks are a lot of fun to watch.The action scenes themselves are really enjoyable. They’re completely over the top and ridiculous, which is exactly why they’re good. Like, they literally BREAK THE MOON, it might as well be a super robot anime.The art and animation in this show is… not the best a lot of the time. It’s kind of cheap looking and there’s a good amount of typical “QUALITY” anime moments. It’s not horrendous or anything, but I’ve definitely seen much better. It does seem to improve in the later seasons. The series also has some fanservice, but I don’t really have a problem with it and it generally didn’t get in the way of anything.Another flaw this show has is the more “dramatic” stuff. Throughout the show there seem to be some attempts to be really dramatic and serious, but most of it is honestly just stupid and it sometimes feels out of place.Overall I enjoyed this anime quite a lot and I’d recommend this anime if you like ridiculous action shows. 8/10 OPs and thought it looked pretty cool.

The series also has some fanservice, but I don’t really have a problem with it and it generally didn’t get in the way of anything.Another flaw this show has is the more “dramatic” stuff. Throughout the show there seem to be some attempts to be really dramatic and serious, but most of it is honestly just stupid and it sometimes feels out of place.Overall I enjoyed this anime quite a lot and I’d recommend this anime if you like ridiculous action shows. 8/10', '""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""Spoiler warning""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""What is words? What meaning does words have? Well words have an incredible power! Words can kill! Words can heal a loved one! Words can destroy .Words can bring happiness and joy.Words bring us together.

Fuck all this power ups because through the power of singing you can beat everything and everyone and yes you heard right now we have it all.There are two kinds of anime with stupid plotlines, at first we have anime that are stupid but are still good because they are stupid and we have anime that are stupid and you're just thinking what the fuck I watching right now.Senki Zesshou  Symphogear is one of the second one. It has one of the most stupid plotline I ever seen. Even...if you could possible like the stupid idea of gaining power through singing, the whole story is just bad. They have just throw some words from sagas like gungir and singing and voila you have an anime like Senki Zesshou Symphogear.Even this review isn't worth my time for a shitty anime like this but because I was clueless how bad it is and how stupid the character's are I don't want people waste their time like I did. if you could possible like the stupid idea of gaining power through singing, the whole story is just bad.

It takes 4 episodes to do a story beat it set up in the first 10 minutes. It goes from questionable yuri to actually gross, it has action sequences but they don't have weight because they get drowned out by music and don't grab your intention and worst of all it feels like a waste of time.This is what happens when you take insert songs, usually a treat for high-impact moments and try to build a whole magical girl hybrid with super robot elements. It should be good but its just nothing.Also I...couldn't even make out the music as well as maybe I should have. something about the sound mixing didn't mesh couldn't even make out the music as well as maybe I should have. something about the sound mixing didn't mesh"", 'Senki Zesshou Symphogear is an original anime by Satelight and Encourage. Which, honestly, does not inspire that much confidence. Out of the four Satelight anime I\'ve reviewed, the best has been Heat Guy J which was just okay. As for Encourage, the only thing I\'ve seen from them was Zetsumetsu Kigu Shoujo: Amazing Twins. Which was better than any of Satelight\'s offerings, but not by much. But maybe this will be the best thing I\'ve seen from Satelight.Story:We open with a concert by the duo Zwei Wing being attacked by monsters called ""Noise."" They work their way through the crowd disintegrating anyone they...touch. Fortunately, the members of Zwei Wing, Kanade and Tsubasa, summon their Symphogear and fight against the creatures. They\'re able to save some people from the crowd, including the young Tachibana Hibiki, but only at the cost of Kanade\'s life. We cut to a later date where Hibiki gains her own Symphogear and joins with an organisation designed to protect against the Noise alongside Tsubasa but there may be something in the shadows that\'s responsible for the Noise.Let\'s start with the big problem this series has. There are a lot of stupid elements. To start with, the commander of the defence unit is able to fight Noise and even stand toe to toe against the powerful Symphogear because he\'s a good martial artist. The creatures that disintegrate normal humans on contact, the girls who can destroy entire city blocks with ease and this asshole who can punch things well. What, were the writers afraid that not having a big strong man in the story would make it less appealing? They had to break the rules of their own universe to make this guy relevant? Fuck off with that shit. The ending is the worst in that regard. Not only is the main antagonist\'s plan and motivation absurdly dumb, but there\'s a big deus ex machina bit to let the protagonists handle it.On the positive side, the series does have some good ideas. The whole concept of using music to activate powerful relics and the reveal of where exactly the Noise originated could have been interesting in a better written series. The series is also pretty good at foreshadowing so that it\'s major twists don\'t feel like they\'re coming out of nowhere. A pity they have no sense of subtlety so you can easily figure out where they\'re going the instant they put in that first piece of foreshadowing.Characters:The main girls all have concepts that should be fairly compelling. We have Tsubasa, who\'s tried hard not to feel anything since losing Kanade and resents Hibiki for taking her place. Hibiki who feels like it\'s her duty to help others based on her past trauma & Chris, who went through a lot of shit and has trouble connecting with other human beings. The problem is that the series doesn\'t execute any of these ideas very well. A lot of the character change we do get feels very awkward and like we\'re missing half the character growth arc. It\'s almost as bad as Squall\'s character changing completely in the last disc for no adequately explored reason to make the rubbish romance work.The dynamics between the characters are kind of similar. The main girls could have had some really interesting dynamics but the awkward and abrupt changes really weaken them. The best dynamic is definitely the one betwixt Hibiki and her roommate Miku which isn\'t that complex but it is kind of cute.The side characters are largely just bland. Except for the commander. The way they push him as a badass martial artist but give him no personality just makes him a terrible character. Then we have the antagonist. The antagonist in this is complete rubbish. At first, they seem to have a solid concept behind them. But then we learn what their actual plan is and see how ludicrously dumb it is. Then we learn their brain dead motivation behind everything and we\'re left with a worse villain than Silver Age Lex Luthor. You know, when his only motivation was to rule the world and his plans included things like stealing 40 cakes.Art:The artwork s pretty decent. The character designs are solid. The backgrounds are pretty well detailed and the Noise do have interesting designs. The biggest problem is with the action sequences. They made the baffling decision to interrupt the action on a regular basis so that they could have a freeze frame with a little scroll telling you the attack names. This results in the battles being choppy and kind of shite.Sound:The acting is solid Yuuki Aoi, Mizuki Nana, Takagaki Ayahi, Iguchi Yuka and the rest of the cast all do a good job. Especially considering how little they have to work with in terms of characterisation. The music is, by far, the best element of the series. Though there is an issue with it. During battles they\'ll have the girls sing while fighting and the sound mixing is awkward. They\'ll put dialogue and loud explosives over the music. I\'m not going to lie, I would have greatly preferred seeing the scenes play out with just the music playing for audio while the action speaks for itself. But I guess you can\'t do that when your action scenes are rubbish.Ho-yay:There is a lot of it. Hibiki has les-yay with Miku, Tsubasa and Chris. Tsubasa is heavily implied to have been more than just friends with Kanade. Chris and Miku develop a dynamic that doesn\'t seem hetero-normative. There\'s also a scientist at their headquarters, Ryouko, who gets flirty with several of the girls.Areas of Improvement:Your antagonist needs a strong motivation.Take the time to actually develop your characters and let their dynamics evolve naturally. Don\'t just skip awkwardly over parts of that development.A regular ass human who\'s good at martial arts should never be able to stand up against powerful entities that can dissolve humans on contact or girls with powerful relics that enable them to cause massive destruction. That\'s fucking imbecilic.Final Thoughts:Senki Zesshou Symphogear is a series with a promising premise, strong music, a good cast and some cute les-yay moments. Unfortunately, it also has a lot of insanely stupid elements, poor characterisation, weak action sequences and one of the worst antagonists out there. I\'m going to give it a 4/10. I did consider going lower, but I do think its positive elements are sufficient to make it sub-par rather than outright bad. touch.

But TDLR; My personal opinion has much bigger weight than “critical” novel length “objective” mumbo jumbo.Review layout: Minimal/Lazy MAL non-hReview type: AnimeNote: Still testing review layouts. This line will be removed when I’m satisfied with the layout.#Review (short ver):In a nutshell: Song powered magical girls with cool transformations.NOTE: Franchise review....#PROS+Great transformation+Vocal music power/magic presentation is great+Story starts strong+Plenty of fun characters with pre-set stereotypes*Cute nakama power presentations-CONS-Songs become a bit lazy thus waning in their effect-Season 3-4 pretty weak (story)-Odd art quality drops#Review (comments/longer ver):Review is overall thoughts up to XV (season 5)I’ve always enjoyed a great vocal powered magic, Anime. (Remember watching mermaid melody back in days) and this Anime does such genre a fairly great justice. Let me get the main complaint out of the way, the story starts well but sadly season 3-4 were pretty dull story and character ‘wise. Didn’t simply generate the same amazing emotions as first 2 seasons, but thankfully season 5 turned up the notch again.Anyhow, whilst the story presents the usual magical girl tropes. Character drama, growth, new villains, new powers, new transformations, this one orientates more of mecha’ish designs. Drama itself for most part is enjoyable but sadly most villains’ storytelling and drama is pretty disappointing, but in the end still enjoyable. It’s quite a rollercoaster to be honest, you get moments where you kinda support villains but then you get disappointed how silly it will seem to you and so on.As far as character cast go, we have tons of fun stereotypes, a bit of everything for everyone. Their growth and development? I guess it does exist, but I didn’t really pay attention to it as it wasn’t focus for me. They did go through various drama scenes thus growing emotionally, but I don’t remember there being anything overly serious. At least for me.Art, animation is good if it comes to combat and transformations. Very flashy, lot of cool looking moves & powers, but art of everything else is pretty random. I remember some scenes looking like at some sort of paint art whilst other scenes are poser art quality. But overall, it was still good enough to be called good.Music, OST is great in this Anime, probably the strongest point. But ey, music queen Nana Mizuki has lot of tracks here, so vocal part of their magic songs are beautiful. Openings and ending as also fairly good and other OST is noticeable, thus overall I think the Audio element was amazing in this Anime. Obviously had some tracks I didn’t like, but in the end as whole, I loved music.Finishing words, if you like “power of music/songs” type of trope, then this Anime is great. Offers you plenty of music, transformations and emotions packed in “important fight songs”. If you also like modern take on magical girls with semi machinery transformations, then it’s also solid Anime. But if you seek for some sort of high tier story writing & depth then you won’t be enjoying this show as much.I did enjoy 3 out of 5 seasons quite a bit. Season 1-2 were absolutely stunning for me when I first watched them years ago, now I finished season 3-5 and yeah as mentioned season 3-4 was pretty dull for me in comparison, but season 5 returned the charm.#Total Score 7/10 #PROS+Great transformation+Vocal music power/magic presentation is great+Story starts strong+Plenty of fun characters with pre-set stereotypes*Cute nakama power presentations-CONS-Songs become a bit lazy thus waning in their effect-Season 3-4 pretty weak (story)-Odd art quality drops#Review (comments/longer ver):Review is overall thoughts up to XV (season 5)I’ve always enjoyed a great vocal powered magic, Anime.

Obviously had some tracks I didn’t like, but in the end as whole, I loved music.Finishing words, if you like “power of music/songs” type of trope, then this Anime is great. Offers you plenty of music, transformations and emotions packed in “important fight songs”. If you also like modern take on magical girls with semi machinery transformations, then it’s also solid Anime. But if you seek for some sort of high tier story writing & depth then you won’t be enjoying this show as much.I did enjoy 3 out of 5 seasons quite a bit. Season 1-2 were absolutely stunning for me when I first watched them years ago, now I finished season 3-5 and yeah as mentioned season 3-4 was pretty dull for me in comparison, but season 5 returned the charm.#Total Score 7/10']"

I forget which, and since it’s Japan, they’re practically the same thing anyway. They discover a cutesy little monstrosity that is half adowabubble little girl and half giant spider, which treads this perfect line between the ka/owaii oh man see what I did there I’m so weeaboo it hurts. In my humble opinion, Wasurenagumo is the standout of all the young animator training projects so far. The two lead characters have actual personality and...their relationship is pretty well realised, with an awful lot not being said but implied through their actions. The slapstick with the spider girl is genuinely funny, and that line they tread with her creepiness is so perfect it’s eerie.

The first of these ""one shots"" I will be reviewing is Wasurenagumo, which roughly translates to Little Spider Girl.Before I review the anime, I feel it is necessary to give a tiny bit of background info. In traditional Japanese folklore, there is a creature called the Jurogumo which has the body of a spider and the torso of a beautiful woman. The Jurogumo will attract men looking for love, only to quickly devour them...after mating just like a real spider. This animal bottom/woman top that lures men to their doom is very similar to the Siren from Greek mythology. It is interesting that people in 2 cultures completely isolated across the world both thought this was a cool concept and independently created their own versions of basically the same creature.WARNING! HERE THERE BE SPOILERS!The anime begins with a narrator telling what is supposed to be an old Japanese folk tale. A giant spider demon attacks a village only to be badly wounded and chased off by a powerful samurai. While fleeing, the spider dropped some of its hatchlings and the samurai discovers a baby spider demon with the torso of a little girl. It is simply too cute for the samurai to kill, so he takes it home and raises her. He is later horrified to discover the spider girl has been eating people behind his back, so he seals her away. In the present day, a bimbo highschool girl is working at her grandfather\'s used book store and decides to open a book that clearly states it has a demon sealed inside it. Seems like a good idea to me! The demon is released and it is of course the spider demon with the torso of an adorable little girl. The assistant shop keeper instantly falls under her spell because I guess he likes lolis. Eventually the bimbo and minimum wage cashier Humbert Humbert decide to take the little spider girl back to the temple depicted in the story. Inside the temple, the giant mother spider from the story attacks them and sends the shopkeeper and bimbo flying off a cliff. The little spider girl saves them by catching them with her web...only to pull a Goldeneye and let the bimbo drop towards a grisly death. The shopkeeper doesn\'t mind this though, and takes the spider girl home where she will inevitably devour him soon. The End.The art and animation was pretty decent considering this was made with an extremely low budget. This anime didn\'t win the 2011 contest, but I don\'t think that was due to poor animation.The only question I had after watching this was, ""What the hell was the point?"" It didn\'t really work as a comedy. It didn\'t work as a horror story. It didn\'t have engaging characters. I guess the director just thought it would be amusing to inject modern Japanese pop culture like ""moe art"" and ""lolis"" into a modern variant of a traditional Japanese folktale. The concept of injecting modern pop culture gags into traditional fairy tales CAN work if done right. After all, Shrek is one of the most beloved heroes of the internet! Although 99.9% of that is due to 4chan rather than a genuine admiration for the quality of the Shrek Franchise. after mating just like a real spider.

I've looked at some of these before including Harmonie, Aki no Kanade and Ojisan no Lamp. There have also been some major anime like Death Parade and Little Witch Academia that started from these projects. So, I do have some hope for this one. Especially since I've liked most of these.Story:We open with a young bookworm, Suzuri, telling the story of when giant spiders invaded only to get fended off by an Onmyoji. For some reason he's telling this story to a girl, Mizuki, who just came to collect rent for her grandfather. She...accidentally breaks the seal on the book that supposedly contains the spider. This results in a little spider girl breaking out. Suzuri isn't concerned about her as she's very adorable but Mizuki has a bad feeling about the situation.This short has kind of a weird aesthetic. There are comedic elements but also a lot of light horror elements. So, it's one of those comedies that's a bit macabre. Which I actually really like. I would say the only real issue I have with it is that it needed some more time to develop things.On the positive side, I do like the light-hearted but macabre and kind of dark aesthetic. For me, the comedy lands pretty strongly. This is also one that I would definitely watch a longer series based on because it is entertaining and interesting.Characters:Given the length, the characters are pretty strong. The arachne girl is adorable. Mizuki's more cautious and shrewd way of viewing the arachne contrasts well with Suzuri's more optimistic and naïve approach. And I do appreciate that they don't try to have far too many characters, sticking instead to the ones they absolutely need. Which is largely the main three with one supporting character.Art:This little film looks very good. The artwork is well done. The balance between cute slice of life with interspersed horror elements works nicely. The film also does have a lot of good details for the backgrounds.Sound:Shimoda Asami, Tsuchida Hiroshi and Kaneda Tomoko all have strong performances. It's especially impressive the way Kaneda expresses emotion and establishes character while barely actually saying a word since our arachne heroine mostly communicates with strange clicks and hisses. The music is fine. Nothing special, but functional. Basically very standard.Ho-yay:There isn't any.Areas of Improvement:1. A little more effort into the music. Yeah, it works but it could definitely use more of a unique flavour.2. This could really benefit from extending the main narrative. You could cut out some of the beginning stuff with the Onmyoji. You could have some extra content during the ending theme tune. Either way, the main narrative would benefit from a little extra attention.3. The opening credits could have been done better. Here's the thing, they have that style where there's a little action, then a freeze frame with some names and then that repeats. Which really interrupts the flow of action and drags out the whole opening sequence unnecessarily. The film would have been better if they just rolled the credits on the side while the action was happening.Final Thoughts:I actually enjoyed this short film quite a bit. I understand that its aesthetic might not work for everyone and some people will definitely be turned off by the macabre elements. But for me, this was great. I'm giving it a very solid 8/10. accidentally breaks the seal on the book that supposedly contains the spider. This results in a little spider girl breaking out.

It's one of the best shows I've seen lately, but I guess maybe the humor doesn't work for everyone.  Admittedly, this show is much funnier if you understand Chinese and also Chinese pop culture/slang.Story - so...the initial part of the show is mostly humor-focused, but it does build up toward an actual story.  I feel like it actually sets you up in the first half for a lighthearted comedy, and then by about the halfway point you suddenly realize there's actually a storyline and you're already super invested in...these characters.  But basically, the main story takes a while to actually take shape, so have some patience.  It also does a really good job of storyboarding, something that is a struggle in other Chinese animations sometimes (like Legend of Exorcist), where each episode's structure clearly has a lot of thought put into the order and where it ends, and the season itself ends in a cliffhanger in a way that makes a lot of sense.Art - I really loved the character designs, the hilarious references and modern-ancient fusions.  The art is quite good for being CG-based.Sound - the music is also quite good.  The OP is very unique and well-suited to the comedic aspect of the show, and the ED is very good, albeit more on the emotional side.Character - oh man, everyone is great??

In the novel, the story was told through different characters having arcs of their own. (Like, chapters 1-4 would have one main character, then chapters 5-8 would have another, etc.) Each arc could be treated as a stand-alone story, and they all seemed unrelated, only making sense in the end.But in the donghua, instead of showing each character’s story separately, they combined everything. It ended up being a plotty political-scheme mystery show in contrast to the more lighthearted and episodic novel,...but the heart of the original was still there. This makes the donghua more seamless while still being very hilarious.And for an adaptation with several original characters, for once I actually don’t mind it. I usually find such additions annoying, but in this show they really serve a purpose and also add to the enjoyment.Another thing I like about it is how the donghua develops the characters even more. Lou Zhu’s worries and motivations are highlighted, and Lin Kai is also given more screen time.I also like the choice of animating it in 3D, like the one in video games. It fits the genre well and also adds more to the comedy. The donghua also plays around a lot. In one episode, they had one character sing and dance like in a musical, with the beginning of the song sounding like “Do you wanna build a snowman?” from Frozen 😂Moreover, this is a Boys Love story, and with more than one couple, too! The secondary couple (Zhou Rongqi and Li Ke) even get a very gay ending song that’s all about them. (But since this is from China, expect it to be not explicit on the BL)All in all, it’s a very fun show that doesn’t lack in depth. If you’re in the mood for something light but don’t want to miss out on plot, you should definitely watch this. And if you’ve never watched Chinese anime before, then you’ll definitely find this fresh and intriguing. but the heart of the original was still there.

Under the comedy, there is a serious story that is both intriguing and thought-provoking. I laughed, got annoyed, and even cried.Second, I liked the characters and the relationships.

I can't wait for season 2."", ""This show is so fun. Absolutely hysterical. There is a random musical episode for absolutely no reason or payoff. It's really funny and then shockingly tragic. You don't mean to get invested in this comedy but oops! you did anyway! The characters are really unique and extremely entertaining to watch their hijinks. The romance is not a huge part of the donghua but it's still compelling. Watch if you want a good laugh with some quality feels.Seriously this show has made me laugh hysterically multiple times. I've even showed clips to my friends who laughed because how absurd it is. (The flute playing scene) ""]"
Yuan Long 2nd Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44071/Yuan_Long_2nd_Season,"[""It is great to watch Yuan Long again! Wang Sheng tries to enter a new life in Wuyou city, a place many fugitives can stay, but under that they follow in the lord's absolute rules 1. No fighting in the inner city 2. No killing in the outer city. Immediately an interesting new setting.Though even among the city, the fugitives set their own hierarchy and bully around, taking bounty jobs etc. Wang who started a cooking business with modern cuisine  finds when you ask fugitives to follow rules though, it's literally rumble in the city. Until the BADASS Eunuch serving the lord steps in...to restore law and order. Undeterred by punishment, the five families from Season 1 pursues and still attempts to kill Wang, the Dai family being the ultimate threat!By order of the city lord to Eunuch as bodyguard for Wang after an almost successful assassination attempt on his life, it leads to an amazing BOSS FIST FIGHT between the equally extremely high level and powerful Eunuch and Dai Wuji. The action in Season 2 is SO EPIC and even better than Season 1. Even Wang's guns are not effective and he loses in fight against Dai Wuji's high level chi when Dai Wuji could even use his own weapon against him and take his girls hostages. The young master and anyone that try and help or associate with Wang would also face the consequences of helping him.The characters really developed this season and so has the romance plotline and how it really ravaged our MC, who was just not as strong to protect anyone even Dai pointed out. It's more than just battle now, but the insanity and pain that settles in. Get ready towards the end where you make of everything.The sound is a strict upgrade. The opening is good like always, but Season 2 is just better and ending song is really BEAUTIFUL !!! Yuan Long is slowly moving out from the modern weapon OPness, but in return we got a tale of a legend fighting his way up saving the people he care for in the world of Chi.

I'm glad there's a Season 3, I'll be back to watch it."", 'This season is a direct sequel to the first season, so please watch S1 before watching this season as most of the main characters in this season were introduced in the first season. This review may have spoilers for S1.Also, Yuan Long was originally a novel which has been adapted to both manhua and donghua. I am more familiar with the manhua so I will make an adaptation comparison in the latter half of this review, rating it based on how closely it follows the source.General Plot: After the brief time skip at the end of season 1, Wang Sheng has made it out of...the QianJueDi (Land of infinite danger) to Wuyou City, where he was forced to flee because of the pursuit of the 5 most powerful clans. Once making it to Wuyou City, he is temporarily safe, as this city is free from most influences and has rules to prevent killing. This season follows Wang Sheng while he is at WuYou City.The plot for this season is a mess like most of the other things (explained further down in the review). It feels like characters and plot are changed specifically to make fights happen or create drama. The pacing and tone of the story is also done poorly, it intermixes comedy randomly with the ""serious"" portions of the plot. All the characters are as smart or retarded as the plot requires them to be to move things along to the next fight. It really feels like action/fights first, everything else is negotiable or can be bent to fit this. And what\'s with all the melodramatic stuff in the last third of the season?When it comes to characters, this season of Yuan Long is a mess. Gao Yao was part narrator, part comedic relief in season 1,  but now she\'s also a very annoying damsel in distress when the plot needs her to be so that they could cram in another fight. Then there is Qiang Wei who has some dual personality problem so they can have her be the ""final villain"" of this season and also have some convoluted romantic-subplot with her. A Qi has also clearly shown she is in Wang Sheng\'s harem because of the ""kill or marry the man who sees your face"" rule. Wang Sheng, the MC, is a serious mess. His character is inconsistant; when he\'s threatened, he\'s willing to start fights, but backs down too easily or gets pummelled for plots sake or he\'s willing to lead people into danger so they get killed but won\'t kill them despite the detriment to him, and he sometimes acts like a philatropist when he can\'t even protect himself. All these character problems really hamper enjoyment of the series.Animation and character designs are great, as are the fights, as expected of a high budget production. But like the previous season, alot of it feels like they are trying to ""show off"" their technical prowess. They shoehorn in fights whenever they can, in the first 5 episodes alone, there are like 10 different fights resulting from disagreements, fights for comedy purposes, and even a ""storytelling fight"" from the opening (telling the exaggerated version of Wang Sheng\'s final fight in the previous episode. It really is too much.My final assessment of this is that: this is a barely passable watch, with it\'s only redeeming features being its high budget character models and action, but its problems with the forced plot and inconsistent characters really tank it. There are too many fights forced in, making it seem like the studio is trying to show off their animation prowess.Comparison as an adaptation(will contain novel spoilers):I will give an adaptation score to Yuan Long Season 2, but this doesn\'t really qualify anymore as an adaptation. There are changes to basically everything but the setting. I will break this down into two categories, character changes and plot changes.Character Changes:-Qiang Wei, the new female that has a romantic subplot with Wang Sheng, was originally an important connection that Wang Sheng made. She was supposed to be a main harem member and one of the reasons he gets a 600+ harem later. But in this ""adaptation"" they gave her some contrived dual personality and then killed her off.-A Qi, the assassin, was not a traitor to the Xia family and was a ""death soldier"". Eventually she is ""given"" to Wang Sheng after failing to assassinate him three times as reconciliation as per the clan\'s rules. Here they forced her to join Wang Sheng early by having the retarded ""kill or marry rule"".-Song Yan, the main female lead, somehow loses her memory basically resetting their relationship-Random clan elder/leaders these people got created just to get beat down? Was that even necessary?Plot Changes:-The only original plot elements that were kept the same were the lore/backstory bits like about Lin Xiu/phoenix spirit and the setting of the story. Other than that, almost everything else has been changed.-The modern weapons like guns seem to be a mainstay in this donghua, perhaps the producers want to make this a trademark ""mascot"" for Yuan Long. The new ""enchanted"" bullets are what makes me think so. In the original novel, as Wang Sheng depleted his stock of ammo and equipment, he cultivated alongside that and thus became less reliant on those, making them fade from the story. The research into his equipment was never done, though some people did investigate his methods. The technology/weapons from the modern era were his final trump cards and carefully used by him.-The focus of the plot is intense action and comedy with actual story mixed in. They force in fights, romantic scenes, or comedy wherever they can fit it. It feels almost like the point was to have action or first and story second, which is why I said in the first half that this feels like a showing of animation prowess.Adaptation Score(how faithful to source): 2/10 the QianJueDi (Land of infinite danger) to Wuyou City, where he was forced to flee because of the pursuit of the 5 most powerful clans.

Not all that surprised, either. These shorts don't seem to be very popular....To begin with, this really has no storyline. You can't enjoy this without watching the series and really understanding/knowing all the 'inside' jokes that are kinda running gags throughout. This is by no means a standalone.That being said, for all the returning viewers, this is plenty of fun. The art is alright (there was this giant wavy glittery thing that just looked like a turd that I laughed at more than at the jokes) and the style reminded me of Madoka Magica personally.The sound was alright, nothing impressive. The...voice actors were good, but the background music was pretty amazing.Other than the fact that the characters have already been somewhat developed in the series, there are no changes made whatsoever to the personalities. This is literally a short gag clip.This was pretty engaging and funny, to say the least.I would recommend this if you: like gag anime, liked the first two seasonsI would NOT recommend this if you: like plot, didn't like the first two seasonsHave a great day everyone! voice actors were good, but the background music was pretty amazing.Other than the fact that the characters have already been somewhat developed in the series, there are no changes made whatsoever to the personalities.

Aikatsu on Parade!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40266/Aikatsu_on_Parade,"['Oh, AiParade. I had such high hopes for you! (Please note - this series is one I do NOT recommend for Aikatsu beginners, given it\'s essentially an extended all-stars movie. This review is written with that in mind.)CHARACTER: 6.5The new character, Raki/Lucky is...excessively annoying. She\'s prone to literally repeating back what other characters said, to an extent even Aine can\'t compete with, and says her \'lucky\' catchphrase far, far too often. She\'s compulsive and brainless in a way that\'s less cute airhead, more intentionally ignorant.  It doesn\'t help that almost everything she tries, she excels at  in record time, with minimal effort. It\'s...painful seeing her achieve in a matter of days what took her predecessors weeks or months of desperate struggle to even complete, let alone excel at. I can at least appreciate the fact that she does learn her lessons eventually - but the keyword there is, unfortunately, eventually.Raki\'s sister, the ""mastermind"", barely exists. I can\'t comment on her personality because, while she\'s intended to push the story, really, all she does in hide out and make vague passing comments. She\'s a total waste of air and could have happily been replaced with an existing character.Aine and Mio, a much as I nomrally love them, managed to have both a ton of screen time while also not doing much of anything. It was a misuse of their characters, and of time that could have been used on building a story.I never loved Yume, but at least her character - when on screen - keeps her personality and continues to grow. Poor Akari barely features, and when she does, it\'s usually more as a prop than anything else. At least the original Trio (Soleil) have kept their vibes going, and add a great atmosphere when on screen - though like Aine and Mio, it never adds up to much.The other assorted background cast feature surprisingly often, and mesh well, providing storylines unique to this series. Even the notorious M4 did eventually show up... eventually. Barely. It\'s sad, and they deserved far more screen time as Aikatsu\'s only all-male band (or really, male band period.)STORY : 6.5To be honest, I didn\'t expect much of a story from what is essentially a drawn-out All Stars series. What you see in the trailer is well and truly exactly what it ends up being. It\'s fine - just not particularly unique or engaging. I wish they\'d used Wakaba, who needs a Friend, or had Raki search for a Friend, but instead they threw years of lore into the wind. Oh well.SOUND:  5Sigh. They\'ve literally taken songs from previous series/seasons and had other characters/actors re-do them - or just repeated the literal original and pretended nobody would notice. Some re-dos go down better than others. I wish they\'d actually remixed the songs to suit their new singers, and created more brand-new songs, because I honestly don\'t see the point in re-watching when I can buy the CD or watch clips on youtube. \'There\'s a handful of new songs, but Raki\'s theme in particular just sounds like it wasn\'t made for her, and the others just fall flat of their potential. It\'s particularly unfortunate given we\'re treated to multiple of these lackluster performances every episode.ART: 7There\'s some gorgeous new dresses, Raki\'s uniform is well designed both for her character and the existing leads\' colour pallette, and the CGI has definitely improved over the years. Unfortunately, there\'s been quite a few random mistakes in the 2D animation, like when Yume\'s hair was suddenly her S1 style for no apparent reason.Some of Raki\'s later dress \'designs\' looked like rips of Rare dresses by other characters, which was unfortunate, because they really were quite pretty.Still, they\'ve done a good job of combining the different styles of each season, without making  it looking weird.OVERALL:I\'d have to give it a 6.5 - there\'s nothing epically horrid about it, but I\'d only recommend it to the most loyal of fans. painful seeing her achieve in a matter of days what took her predecessors weeks or months of desperate struggle to even complete, let alone excel at.

I don't see any depth in her character except for her wish to produce a premium dress of her own(?)I don't really see her as someone relevant in the anime. Although some would argue that it was her aikatsu pass that brought their worlds together, that's the only argument I could count as counting her to be a relevant character. All of the characters instantly clicked together and she's just...there... like a newly born chick surrounded by top idols added like an extra in her own show.Or I could be judging it wrong since the standards have been high for Aikatsu since the original. This would've been a far greater series if only the protagonist wasn't so simple-minded and impulsive (and please stop saying 'Kyah' and 'Lucky' all the time). there... like a newly born chick surrounded by top idols added like an extra in her own show.Or I could be judging it wrong since the standards have been high for Aikatsu since the original.

One of the most wholesome story in Blue Archive ever.My only problem I had with this was, some of the Scenes transition are a bit weird,maybe it's storyboard issues or whatever. And that's it.Also, one more thing, since the TV series adaptation was already announced,I really wish we're getting a full Main Story adaptation with Sensei in it.The main story of Blue Archive is unironically very good, really inspiring, and I'm really hyped for it.TLDR; If you're a Blue Archive fans, it's 7+ but else, it's really depends if you're into Moe/Slice of life since it's just an animated-short of a gacha game.Thanks for Reading! to care about the plot, this felt like a short wholesome story for a fan-service.You literally didn't even need to know any of the characters in these short, yet you could tell what they're like in the game, the character design in Blue Archive have always been very good and the Art style just also perfected its nature and makes it very lively.The comedy and humor they're going for here is very game and in-lore accurate, Very meme-able.The Art-style here looks simple, goofy yet that is what I always wanted,Doesn't need to look AAA, Ufotable's standard with 100K VFX all around with a spinning camera.Just makes it appealing and interesting to watch.The Soundtracks are one of the first things people think of when talking about Blue Archive,It's still God-Tier, also the new Ending Theme they've used for this are also very good and have its own charm.(It also being used for Volume 2, Chapter 2 Ending for the game's main story)To me personally, their main story in the game (Volume 2) is one of my favorites.There's something about a group of friends tries to make something and do whatever they like type of story,Their friendship in the main story is also really beautiful too.

They write this novel out of their imaginations or maybe more based on their personal ideologies.

They bring the heat of their rivalry in the novels they write this time around in the form of medieval warfare involving tentacle rape, obese beast, angels, and foot licking. It's hard to take this serious at all considering that it's so generic and commonly seen in most OVAs. Not just that though, the other characters' stories are based on their own imaginations in the most bizarre ways ranging from a girl in the lake to mecha absurdity from outer space. Still though, it was pretty damn funny.The artwork of the special episode retains the same edges and style. There's nothing different really, not even in the novels themselves. One can expect though that Haganai isn't a top contender in the artwork department so don't expect spectacular visuals.On the other hand, the soundtrack features more of a ensemble especially at the end. The OP song still retains its originality though and it's a billboard of saying “the Neighbor Club is still here and we're not going anywhere till we make some friends”. The soundtrack is pretty fun to listen to and an amusing refreshment of the series.Overall, this special episode is like a warmup for the big marathon. By that, I mean a little preview of the comedy and entertainment of what's to come for Season 2. You want some cruelty? Yozora is there. You want some meat? Sena says hi. You want some cosplay? Kobato greets you. Ultimately, special episode like this isn't special but has a lot of humor to it. There's nothing wrong with having a good laugh and Haganai can bring forth a lot of that.

This was spectacular... The music, the sounds, how everything looked, it was all so cool! I'm sure if you're one of those super picky fans that rip anything that's not exactly the original story you will find a lot of things to complain about. Also I know lots of people are not fans of the 3D art style. Quite frankly I think it fits it...well.In any event... I would not watch this until you read all of or some of the manga. To me this is just the icing on the cake to Blame! My one complaint is that I wish it was longer and spent more time around Killy. Time to read the manga again...EDIT: If you have never read Blame!

It\'s a mindless action flick with mediocre CGI and bland characters stuck in a subpar story but the music is atleast nice?[Story: 2/10 , Characters: 4/10, Art: 6/10, Sound: 7/10, Enjoyment: 6/10]If you are thinking the Blame! movie is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi action flick where humanity tries to blame the culprit that led to their society\'s demise, well you can\'t be more wrong. It\'s merely a plot hole filled story about a group of villagers, Electro-Fishers, trying to survive in this post-apocalyptic world where technology has deemed humans as contaminants due to lack of Net Terminal Gene therefore must...be eliminated. Cue in Killy, this strange emotionless robot human cyborg (Terminator) trying to find a human with this Net Terminal Gene to put an end to this chaos and fight against the exterminators. Though the premise might sound interesting, the execution by Hiroyuki Seshita fell flat.There really isn\'t a story to this anime. It\'s just characters moving from one location to another. Due to their naivety they land in problems that needs to be resolved. It\'s understandable that this is testing the water with a different take on the manga adaptation, hence how much the story is open ended. However, leaving something too open results in a hollow experience overall. That\'s what happened watching this anime. Some action sequences were good. Some issues made sense. However, viewers won\'t feel attached to the story and at times would even fast forward because how boring and stale the universe became.If the story wasn\'t stale enough, the characters made it even worse. Apart from the MC Killy, this Terminator-esque emotionless robot, all the other characters are just placeholders that can be replaced at any time. Which is exactly what happened as the movie progresses. You never feel anything for the people that dies in this movie. If there is one word that can sum up their deaths, it\'s ""meh."" The characters don\'t really have a backstory or purpose and lack severe character development. They just exist because they exist. Except Killy, he is pretty badass.Regardless of the movie\'s failure in substantial plot and concrete character development, the art and sound were sort of its saving grace. The CGI animation, though in 10fps, still felt nice after you get used it. The landscape is vibrant with bold colours and the cinematography is quite beautiful. Not to mention, the redesigned Killy with the rugged features really added to his character. They gave Zuru kawaii features to turn her into an eye candy but failed to give other characters distinguishable features to make them stand out. Despite that, the action sequences with the background score, gave it a nice cozy feel and let you somewhat feel the catastrophic dilemma the people are trapped inside this post-apocalyptic run down world ruled by watchtowers (Skynet). The OST is definitely worth listening to on its own.Overall, the movie is fun to watch for fans of the Blame! manga/anime or for anyone who just loves to watch a mindless action flick. The director left the ending open ended so one can assume if this movie receives positive buzz more installments in this franchise are to come in the near future. So if you can get over its subpar plot and confounding character development, give it a watch. Tell me later how you like it!P.S. Thank you for reading.

I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!P.P.S. Blame! is just the Japanese onomatopoeic gun sound *blem*.', 'In 2003, the Blame! manga was adapted into a six-part original network animation by Group TAC, and it was absolutely terrible. Having seen this show many years ago, and hearing nothing but praise for the manga (which I still need to get around to reading) I was more than sceptical to say the least in regards to the movie adaptation, produced by Polygon Pictures (known for their sometimes awkward CGI in the cases of Ajin or Knights of Sidonia) and the fact that it was a film adaptation of a popular manga, which often doesn\'t go too well. I imagined the series would be as...rushed and poorly produced as the Golden Age Berserk Trilogy, but thankfully here, while the characters and narrative aren\'t exactly as great as it could have been, still manages to provide a great setting for its theme execution while also having pretty good CGI animation.Set in a world in which humans have lost access to all of the world\'s technology after an event called the ""infection"" causes all of the machinery to develop multi-levelled structures that repeat infinity creating a huge, never-ending dystopian city in which machines, called the safeguard, kill the humans resulting in only a very small volume of civilisation, tucked away safely in a place in which the safeguard cannot reach. Enter a girl named Zuru, whom, with a group of other young teenagers, venture out into this broken world in hopes of finding food for their starving village. However, things go horribly wrong when the safeguards begin to attack Zuru\'s group and the exterminators, essentially fast as hell killer robots that run on all four legs, kill most of the members of the group and everyone would have died if it were not for a man, or, better yet, a robot (which the movie never actually explains nor do we learn his backstory) by the name of Killy who uses a big damn laser gun to destroy all of the exterminators in one shot. After this, the group take him back to their village after Killy asks them if they have the Net Terminal Gene which, as we learn later, is a gene in which allows humans to control the robots and take back the cities and the world around them. After Killy speaks to the village elder, whom everyone refers to as \'papa\', the elder recalls the term ""Net Terminal Gene"" and takes Killy down to the lower levels to see if they can find any information about it. While there, Killy finds an old and beaten up android who had been laying dormant for hundreds of years, waiting for someone to come and save her, and, with that, Killy, the android called Cibo, Zuru and the rest of the team, set off on a journey in order to gain the Net Terminal Genes in order to restore balance to the world once again.The narrative surrounding this movie is pretty linear and straightforward but that\'s fine. I\'d rather have a simpler narrative done right than a convoluted one that tries to squeeze everything into the time frame of a film. For starters, it doesn\'t take too much to feel a sense of empathy between the last surviving humans and their quest for the Net Terminal Genes and the simpler narrative and set-up definitely does help in this regard. Not only that, but the pacing of the film is pretty decently executed. It felt as if it wasn\'t trying to rush everything into a two hour frame and took its time explaining a few concepts and ideas, although nothing all too substantial as a whole, and that\'s my biggest gripe with the film. The film format doesn\'t allow for fully fleshed out characters or backstories and we don\'t learn anything about Killy in the slightest, or even all too much about Cibo either! We\'re given really vague and uninteresting backstories to Cibo in particular, but other than her motivation for wanting to take back the city, she feels extremely bland and underdeveloped, and this role also extends to Killy too. I understand they\'re both robots, and thus lack emotion or character, but they just felt way too underutilised and underdeveloped. The human characters are a bit better but none of them gets any development either. The film does hint as Zeru\'s anxieties and fears over losing some of her friends while fighting but it never surfaces ever again and lacks development. I could never really feel too attached to these characters, and while, I did feel some tension in some of the action scenes in regards to their life, for the most part, I just didn\'t care who lived or died. It\'s pretty obvious that the anime is trying to make you care since there are plenty of emotional scenes with character deaths but it never really felt all too sad to me since I was not attached enough to the character in order for this to have had any effect on me.The film\'s exposition delivery can also be a little too heavy at times with the main character just telling us the state of the world at the very beginning of the film and I\'ve seen this done so many times before that it ends up leaving no impact on me, and the film does this a couple of other times as well. I believe it would have been more effective if the film opened up with no exposition what so ever and the audience could have seen the state of the world for themselves, it would have been more much more engaging and interesting. However, to be fair, there are a couple of exposition scenes that feel natural and as if they\'re happening in the world such as when the elder is explaining the customs and history of the village to Killy who had never been there before and thus the audience assumes these characters roles. As we learn about their village, as thus Killy, but this technique is never really utilised all too much in the film.If there is one thing the film does well is its setting and attention to detail. I was so immersed into this world they through me into and I loved the broken down, city dystopia setting and the entire design of the world; it was pretty good. Not only that, but the action and even the GCI were also great. The CGI never came across as jarring or awkward and the action scenes were full of high-level movement and were exciting to boot; I felt the hype, and if that\'s what the movie was going for it certainly achieved it on that end. In addition, the final action scene was pretty fun to watch from a visual standpoint, but you may find yourself feeling that the ending was a bit anti-climatic since nothing much was actually achieved by the end, and it leaves on quite an annoying cliffhanger, which just makes me want to go and read the manga. The music does the job, but I never found it too be all too great and there were a few scenes that I found to be completely stupid which I would describe in more detail but I don\'t want to get into spoiler territory. But, despite that, the film is enjoyable and does do a few things right to warrant the praise I gave out in the opening paragraphs. While the characters don\'t get much development, it is easy to feel a sense of empathy for them, which is more than I can say for other films of this nature, and if you\'re looking for a fun, action-packed adventure with a great dystopian setting, than I would recommend this. rushed and poorly produced as the Golden Age Berserk Trilogy, but thankfully here, while the characters and narrative aren\'t exactly as great as it could have been, still manages to provide a great setting for its theme execution while also having pretty good CGI animation.Set in a world in which humans have lost access to all of the world\'s technology after an event called the ""infection"" causes all of the machinery to develop multi-levelled structures that repeat infinity creating a huge, never-ending dystopian city in which machines, called the safeguard, kill the humans resulting in only a very small volume of civilisation, tucked away safely in a place in which the safeguard cannot reach. Enter a girl named Zuru, whom, with a group of other young teenagers, venture out into this broken world in hopes of finding food for their starving village. However, things go horribly wrong when the safeguards begin to attack Zuru\'s group and the exterminators, essentially fast as hell killer robots that run on all four legs, kill most of the members of the group and everyone would have died if it were not for a man, or, better yet, a robot (which the movie never actually explains nor do we learn his backstory) by the name of Killy who uses a big damn laser gun to destroy all of the exterminators in one shot. After this, the group take him back to their village after Killy asks them if they have the Net Terminal Gene which, as we learn later, is a gene in which allows humans to control the robots and take back the cities and the world around them. After Killy speaks to the village elder, whom everyone refers to as \'papa\', the elder recalls the term ""Net Terminal Gene"" and takes Killy down to the lower levels to see if they can find any information about it. While there, Killy finds an old and beaten up android who had been laying dormant for hundreds of years, waiting for someone to come and save her, and, with that, Killy, the android called Cibo, Zuru and the rest of the team, set off on a journey in order to gain the Net Terminal Genes in order to restore balance to the world once again.The narrative surrounding this movie is pretty linear and straightforward but that\'s fine. I\'d rather have a simpler narrative done right than a convoluted one that tries to squeeze everything into the time frame of a film. For starters, it doesn\'t take too much to feel a sense of empathy between the last surviving humans and their quest for the Net Terminal Genes and the simpler narrative and set-up definitely does help in this regard. Not only that, but the pacing of the film is pretty decently executed. It felt as if it wasn\'t trying to rush everything into a two hour frame and took its time explaining a few concepts and ideas, although nothing all too substantial as a whole, and that\'s my biggest gripe with the film. The film format doesn\'t allow for fully fleshed out characters or backstories and we don\'t learn anything about Killy in the slightest, or even all too much about Cibo either! We\'re given really vague and uninteresting backstories to Cibo in particular, but other than her motivation for wanting to take back the city, she feels extremely bland and underdeveloped, and this role also extends to Killy too. I understand they\'re both robots, and thus lack emotion or character, but they just felt way too underutilised and underdeveloped. The human characters are a bit better but none of them gets any development either. The film does hint as Zeru\'s anxieties and fears over losing some of her friends while fighting but it never surfaces ever again and lacks development. I could never really feel too attached to these characters, and while, I did feel some tension in some of the action scenes in regards to their life, for the most part, I just didn\'t care who lived or died. It\'s pretty obvious that the anime is trying to make you care since there are plenty of emotional scenes with character deaths but it never really felt all too sad to me since I was not attached enough to the character in order for this to have had any effect on me.The film\'s exposition delivery can also be a little too heavy at times with the main character just telling us the state of the world at the very beginning of the film and I\'ve seen this done so many times before that it ends up leaving no impact on me, and the film does this a couple of other times as well. I believe it would have been more effective if the film opened up with no exposition what so ever and the audience could have seen the state of the world for themselves, it would have been more much more engaging and interesting. However, to be fair, there are a couple of exposition scenes that feel natural and as if they\'re happening in the world such as when the elder is explaining the customs and history of the village to Killy who had never been there before and thus the audience assumes these characters roles. As we learn about their village, as thus Killy, but this technique is never really utilised all too much in the film.If there is one thing the film does well is its setting and attention to detail. I was so immersed into this world they through me into and I loved the broken down, city dystopia setting and the entire design of the world; it was pretty good.

This is one of the first major arcs of the Blame! series and the first one. But because they only wanted to make the first arc and not finish the entire story of Blame, they added things, changed things, and made it in a way that could make you think Blame! is only this.If you didn't notice it (this is for the manga readers), this story is set from the village girl POV. That...is why they managed to pull of this movie without getting too in-depth with Killy; also the reason why Killy barely talked and we didn't get to hear his thought process and why we got to see more of the villagers when in the manga they barely even matter enough to remember their names.Overall, if you want to start reading the manga, this movie could very well tell you if you should read it or not. This is a great starting point for anyone wanting to get a feel of what Nihei's work is like. I love all of Polygon Picture's works because of their great use of CGI compared to other studios, which made justice for a work that could only work with a background made with great detail which showed how inmense the Blame! world is like.Also, if you can speed up the movie to around x1.25 to x1.5 then it would look and feel even better because they talk slowly and some scenes drag for more than necesarry.PD: Watched this on Netflix (available since the 05/19) so I couldn't use VLC Player to speed up the movie so I wouldn't know if speeding up the movie could feel better. is why they managed to pull of this movie without getting too in-depth with Killy; also the reason why Killy barely talked and we didn't get to hear his thought process and why we got to see more of the villagers when in the manga they barely even matter enough to remember their names.Overall, if you want to start reading the manga, this movie could very well tell you if you should read it or not.

The title should be Lame! the Movie, not Blame! Tsutomu Nihei have proven that he\'s more into moe girls than goth robots these days with Knights of Sidonia, but seriously? Turn Blame! into some stupid relationship drama?!First of all, Killy. He talks five times through out the whole movie, and when he does he sounds like an uninspired robot. With his behavior so illogical and stupid, there should be some kind of explanation to why the young girl gets attached to him (like, was she raised by cold, feelingless robots herself and have some kind of...parent issue? No! She\'s the daughter of the leader, just like Nausicaa!). The ""goth hero with a secret""-image that was cool in the manga turns into some kind of over powered harem manga MC, intentionally made with no personality so one can focus on the girls.Second, the rest of the cast. The first 15 minutes I was in total denial, like, ""Oh, they\'ll die soon so Killy gets a good appearance"", I just couldn\'t believe they\'d puttogether the most unexciting, generic and boring characters imaginable. The person responsible probably did this on the subway on the way to work on the first day of production. Character 1: cute girl, big boobs, forward and heroic personality, but still moe, big boobs, blushes when she shows her face the first time since she\'s a tad tsundere. Character two: clumsy, moe, big boobs. Male characters: just like that kid in Claymore. See?! If they got the Automated Factory (or whatever the name was) to think up such generic characters they\'d think it was malfunctioning. Lame!Third - no monsters. SERIOUSLY!!! No mutants, no goth master monster robot whatever, no tubes and sharp teeth and floating things and shit. Like, the monsters were the coolest in Blame and Bio Mega, and here, they were all lame robots who walked just like that one funny titan in Attack on Titan, with no personalities and quirks, just boring robots.The story is just as generic as the characters. The person who wrote it probably haven\'t even read the manga, instead just looked up a few Amazon reviews and took it from there. Hero, robots, boobs, explosions, bang bang, boobs, a tribe of starving people, how hard can it be? Very hard obviously, even if they didn\'t call it Blame! this would still suck.So the art is cool, and compared to earlier attempts the animation worked pretty well, the bodies didn\'t move just as puppet like as they used to. The only thing really good is the incredible scenery which they really did justice to Tsutomu Nihei\'s original art, and I guess it\'s worth seeing it just because of it, but then again you can read the manga and actually get something out of it more than pretty industrialized landscape.Soooo, seriously. This was a huge disappointment. I\'m going to read the manga again, and forget this ever happened. parent issue? No! She\'s the daughter of the leader, just like Nausicaa!).

The Movie : Review |-------------------------------------Blame! The Movie is an Netflix Original animated by Polygon Studio which is adapted from the hit manga of the same name , written by Tsutomu Nihei.The movie is about a dystopian , post-apocalyptic , Sci-Fi world and even though I haven\'t read the manga , I went into the movie pretty hyped up having heard great things about the manga. Did I like the move ? In a way , yes. But was it any good or worth your time ? Let\'s find out shall we ?-----------Story - 6-----------...Okay , the start of the movie was.., Epic!The world looked and felt atmospheric , dark and it was great. within the first few minutes , we get to see people\'s struggles , desperation to survive. I got immediately interested in world , which seemed to be the main selling point of the show. But as the series movie progressed , I felt more and more disappointed as it failed to explain any of the concepts of the world properly. There was this talk of a netsphere , net terminal gene and all this gibberish which immediately caught my interest but didn\'t put much effort into explaining any of them. And when it reached the ending , everything became even more convoluted and left me wondering ""What the fuck just happened? "" , and not in a good way like Evangelion series.---------Art - 9---------THANK YOU POLYGON !!My previous experience with Polygon was a series called Knights of Sidonia , which was also a Netflix original written by the same author. And that particular series had one of the worst Artworks I\'ve ever come to pass.But this time it\'s different , The movie looked stunning from start to end. Everything from the color palette , lightning and special effects truly captured the feeling of a dark and desperate world.Character models looked and was animated great ! battles scenes truly looked epic and smooth with vibrant reds and blues.So in the Art and Animation department , Polygon really hit it out of the park with this one.-------------Sound - 7-------------Music for the series was composed by Yugo Kanno and he did a great job with it.Everything blended in with the atmosphere quite nicely and specially Killy\'s Soundtrack sounded great. All the sound effects with the battle scenes were on point and sounded good. To cap it off I found no fault with the voice acting either.In short this had a good soundtrack , it could have been better but it\'s lived up to my expectations.------------------Characters - 5------------------Characters of this movie suffered the same fate as the World of the movie did.They immediately caught my attention , but then was left without exploration or depth. Worst part of it was even the main character Killy was treated the same way. Even after finishing watching the movie , I had no idea who Killy was. All the information that was given to us was that his name is Killy , He got a really cool gun and he might be the last hope for humanity. That\'s it.The movie didn\'t really do enough to care about most of the side characters except for a few. It felt like they ran out of time to give the characters much depth.-----------------------------------------------Enjoyment and Overall Experience - 5-----------------------------------------------I didn\'t hate the movie , I loved the atmosphere and visuals of it.I would be really happy if we get a squeal to this and explore the world and characters more , and get answers to all the questions that left unanswered.So all in all , it was a movie that didn\'t give enough but left me wanting more.Do I recommend it ? If we will have good squeals to this movie that builds on this world and characters that was presented in this movie , Then yes.If not , then no , It wasn\'t a good stand alone movie.---------------------------| Recommendations |---------------------------[Attack On Titan] A non Sci-Fi version of Blame! , a dystopian world , humanity under attack and forced to live under shadows.

As such ideas self-replicate, with successes spawning successors and plenty of rip-offs, the thought of something novel grows ever more enticing, to the point that many (myself included) are already drawn to certain mediums like anime simply by their continued willingness to take risks and try new things in their endeavours.Of course, while such ambitions can...result in some of the greatest and most valuable works of art around, they just as frequently fall short. Quite often, the issue is in conceptualization, with familiar and formula-bound setups that aren’t tweaked to allow any “new” elements to mesh well. In other cases, a remarkable concept brings forth genuine potential for a grand and fresh tale, but due to insufficient elaboration, what seems like a showcase of a marvelous new world ultimately produces only a tiny glimpse of what could have been.This brings us to Blame!, a film with a great premise, based on a manga which has already had two prior (and from what I’ve heard, not very successful) attempts to realize it into an anime. This third attempt in film format, on a surface level, actually seems to succeed in taking advantage of the premise through its use of CGI (yes, I’m serious), but it leaves the deeper layers and core mostly untouched.The setting of Blame! is certainly an intriguing one; a rather uncommon take on post-apocalyptic sci-fi despite, on the surface, using familiar elements of machine takeover and isolated humans struggling to survive in a world no longer run by them. It gains its colour through not only the detail of the setting, but the way it literally and figuratively surrounds the entire narrative to a degree seldom seen in this story type. Blame! is not the type to appeal with the usual promise of big explosions and sci-fi lasers and deadly battles between humans and robots both struggling for domination of a setting that amounts to decoration or flavour - an excuse for even more explosions; on the contrary, Blame! thrives on intricacy more than grandeur. It is carried by the appeal of the details of the world, the remaining humans, and the ways in which they interact, or try their best not to interact, all for the sake of control or survival. It’s not a loud spectacle, but a quiet plea for continued existence, within a world teeming with endless danger, yet also endless possibility.In short, Blame is in many ways an atmosphere flick, and here, it finds success. Rendered in full CGI – a typically derided aspect of anime, often for good reason – it strives to put the detailed yet gloomy and intimidating world on full display. Consistently dim or reddish lighting, occasional but strong effects, a dark grey-to-black colour scheme of the world contrasting with the pale suits of humans and exterminators, and an abundance of close and near-claustrophobic shots with only the occasional glimpse of the vast scale of the surrounding semi-darkness, are just some of the elements that combine with the detailed CGI to craft some consistently excellent aesthetics. The film almost never feels dry, despite its frequently dreary tone.Even the character animation – the bane of CGI anime – is much more acceptable here than most TV series, be they full 3D or 2D with some awkward integration. The animation itself could at times stand to be a bit more fluid, but it’s weighty enough and never janky, nor destroyed by overly-stiff movements frequently seen in anime CGI. The model quality is good, and the expressions are acceptable, if minimal, and never uncanny with the exception of certain threats where it actually works in the film’s favour. Never did the CGI break my immersion or ruin the atmosphere it was going for. In fact, the things the CGI enabled were a big part of what initially created the aforementioned atmosphere. With this kind of tone, plus a unique and detailed world, there’s a ton of potential for a great experience and an even greater story.It’s such a shame, then, that this wonder-inducing world only got the luxury of a feature film, and not a full series.In fairness, I can understand why. For creators, the world of anime is already a risky one; an ever-increasing number of studios that seem to self-replicate and spread their influence all gunning for survival in a highly competitive industry. Blame! is the type of project that would require great human and financial resource investment to fully realize – resources growing increasingly scarce with no guarantee of return. But without taking such a risk, by not reaching outside of the safe zone, the product can only get so far.For all the strengths of the movie’s premise, and all its success in creating a detailed setting, suitable tone and atmosphere, as a film, Blame! is pretty average. It offers many tidbits on how the world works, but no deeper exploration of it. References are made to its immense scope, but the film is confined to a tiny fragment. Characters' ways of life are put on display, only for the characters themselves to never be delved into; they show minimal individuality, and lack detail compared to the world around them.In some ways, the cast members feel downplayed to little more than mere resources. To a degree, this still sells the main clan’s sense of desperation and the threat of them dying off, but not why a viewer should care about a particular clan member over any other. Almost nothing separates squad member C from member D, and the only thing standing out about B and A is an impersonal dynamic that amounts to a whole lot of nothing much in particular. There’s just not enough time to really take advantage of everything that gets set up. Any attempt would likely lead to an incredibly rushed and convoluted mess, and while what we got is much better than that, it still feels a bit barebones and superficial. The film creates an atmosphere, shows some characters on a general level, builds the world on a general level, lets an average post-apocalyptic plot of sorts unfold (with some fairly but not unacceptably convenient revelations sprinkled in), and then ends without ever diving into things.And so, as the movie concluded, I became almost saddened, wanting to see more of this huge, detailed but mostly unexplored world along with its similarly unexplored remnants of civilization. If anything, this film’s greatest success was how it made me interested in the source, and in a possible full adaptation. It is my hope that someday, a wandering animation studio with a giant las- err, budget, will stumble upon the world of “Blame!” and decide fully realize its immense potential onscreen. What the film does already is alright as a standalone work, and also a definitive step towards a truly successful adaptation through some fairly strong aesthetics; it just doesn’t do much with its excellent premise. Thus, for now, we’ll have to make do with what feels like a little isolated piece of a much larger story.

Or just read the manga."", ""If you are a fan of sci-fi genres, then you are undoubtedly familiar with the masterpiece and the author, Tsutomu Nihei, and his artwork. This work is one of the pinnacles of his artistic creations and is definitely worth experiencing. Firstly, let us address why I give it a 10/10 rating.Story: The story is exceptional, as I mentioned before, and it is executed flawlessly. There are no clichéd scenes or predictable plot holes. The series is filled with action, and the sci-fi theme is the best I have come across. I particularly appreciate how our main character is not introduced from the beginning but rather...in a dire situation, leaving his actual background a mystery. This ambiguity makes the MC appear suspicious, and for a while, I even entertained the thought of him not being on the side of humanity. However, as the story progresses, everything becomes clear, and the plot twists are mind-blowing.World building: The world building in this series is the best I have seen since One Piece. Initially, the anime may not delve deeply into this aspect, but if you continue with the manga, you will understand why I use such strong words. The world building expands remarkably, adding depth and complexity to the story.Emotional attachment: This was my first foray into the sci-fi genre, and after watching this series four years ago, I became a devoted fan. The desolation of the vast, towering structures, the menacing AI, and the remnants of destruction resonated deeply with me, evoking profound meanings. I understand that there are many similar stories out there, but this particular series stands at the pinnacle of the sci-fi genre. The art style, both in the manga and the anime adaptation, impeccably captures the essence of this grand and captivating series.Drawbacks: When I mention drawbacks, it is not Tsutomu Nihei's fault but rather that of the animators, or more precisely, Netflix. The series was animated in 3D, and although it doesn't bother me personally, there are instances where it can be somewhat annoying. However, this annoyance is bearable, and at times, it even feels like the series was intentionally designed for a 3D presentation once you develop an affection for it.In conclusion, I recommend watching the anime movie before delving into the manga, as it provides an overview of Tsutomu Nihei's thought process. Nobody can truly know what Tsutomu Nihei intends to convey in the manga without exploring the visually stunning empty buildings depicted in the anime. It's important to note that everyone will have a different perspective on this anime, as the author remains silent, allowing each viewer to construct their own interpretation of the story. Tsutomu Nihei merely provides a set of pictures to contemplate. Once you watch this anime and become a fan of the author and this masterpiece, don't forget to explore the original manga as well. in a dire situation, leaving his actual background a mystery.

I still couldn’t tell you whom Aki Toyosaki voiced, but it couldn’t have been for very long anyway.The most interesting character was the one who has apparently been dead for 2,000 years, and then probably due to both the novelty of a desiccated half-corpse conversing in casual Japanese and the talent of Kana Hanazawa, whose delivery managed to make this rotting excuse for an Autopsy album cover seem slightly less tedious...for a few moments here and there.  I’ve seen five-teens-trapped-in-a-murder-cabin B-grade horror movies that devoted more screen time to character development than this movie.  Not only do most of these faces utterly lack emotion and depth behind them, whether realized or merely attempted, but the movie can’t even seem to figure out who the protagonist is supposed to be.  Ostensibly the choice comes down to either Killy or Zuru, but both remain so cryptic, stoic, and withdrawn that they have nothing to offer as supporting players, let alone leads; again, Cibo seems to be the only real human amongst these people.  It would be difficult to overstate the complete absence of character in this movie.It’s a shame that none of the characters have any personality whatsoever, because they were apparently supposed to help drive the plot.  The story isn’t all that bad and moves at a decent pace, but it seems to rely on dramatic tension and character work that just aren’t there.  I wouldn’t bat an eyelid if this pitiable human colony finally did get wiped off the face of the earth, so their eternal danger means nothing to me.  The ending, without getting too specific, isn’t especially satisfying; it feels like things have only been set back to square one.  The movie only adapts a certain portion of the manga, so anyone unsatisfied with the lack of proper closure can presumably find a more fitting conclusion in the source material, but what the movie provides fails to mean anything.Before any story can make sense and satisfy the audience, though, the world needs building.  Blame! throws in a few scenes to explain the situation of our starring village (in brief, very roughly, and sometimes more than once), and provides some scattered glimpses into the current state of the world.  Too many questions remain unaddressed, however, for any of the narrative to really make sense.  There is no sense of scale, no context for any of the events, and too many open-ended aspects; the exposition is so barebones that half of the plot’s main objectives don’t seem to have any purpose, and if you think about the details outside those main objectives for too long, the whole picture gets blurrier.Blame! is nothing special to look at, either.  Some of the designs are distinctive and cool-looking, like the Exterminators and the Electro-Fishers’ suits, but beyond that, everything vanishes into a tapioca-like sea of colorless shadow.  Occasionally you’ll see the orange glow of a fire, a surge of blue electricity, or a red laser beam, but nearly all of this movie is some shade of grey.  There was almost no point in bothering to color Blame! at all, for all the use it gets out of the rainbow.  The film is animated with the same semi-3D computer-generated style that Polygon Pictures has used for Ajin and Knights of Sidonia, so somebody somewhere must find this approach appealing, but, frankly, I think it looks awful.  The CGI is strange enough on its own, but the animation often suffers from a lack of fluidity and clear progression of motion; chalk it up to insufficient frame rate and a general want of visual clarity, but in a few scenes it looks like the movie was filmed using stop-motion animation.  With so few characters who are instantly recognizable, it also doesn’t help that they never emote very much.Blame! is ugly to behold, interminable to sit through, too wrapped up in itself to let the audience in on its proceedings, and populated by a cast of mannequins so utterly devoid of personality that they don’t even correspond to the most basic and overplayed stereotypes.  It’s almost impressive how Blame! managed to do so little with its hour-and-45-minute runtime. for a few moments here and there.

It even has leather-clad, sexy cyborgs to boot. It looks and feels like The Matrix when the characters aren't in fact in the Matrix. It's an apt anecdote because it's got as much point as that: a franchise missing its hook.Blame! looks the part, certainly. In fact, it looks and sounds brilliant. Based in a desolate, underground city, it will never look as interesting as Ghost in the Shell's New Port City or the orange hue of Deus Ex. But the mixture of post-apocalyptic dystopia and cyberpunk dystopia come together,...with a surprising amount of sci-fi technobabble backing it up, and create more than an interesting-enough world to spend a couple of hours in. Perhaps a franchise, if only there was better writing.That's the crux of the problem here. Kiri is the uninteresting, mildly androgynous man-of-few-words dressed in black that you've seen dug up and refitted for generations, only this time the twist that breaks him from stereotype is... awkward line delivery. Having the lead badass talk a word-a-minute in gruff whispers is bizarre, to say the least.The more human characters represent the kind you'd see lining filler episodes in a longer running series - that is to say, archetypal. They give us vague subplots such as hinting at an attempted romance with all of three lines and a caring sister, but unfortunately the time just isn't put in to make these stories believable. The subplots are so time-strained that they are meaningless, and robs the film of feeling, and its not like there is even witty dialogue to push it along.Robotic scripts and cold characters aren't a rarity for the genre. Serial Experiments Lain and Ghost in the Shell get through their runtimes without one-liners and character-drama because they have something interesting to say, but I honestly can't say that Blame! even had a philosophical or thematic aspect. At its best it wanted to be a tense action film, but didn't have the style to back it up, and the story took the most barebones approach to action-adventure that could be mustered up, with inexcusably vague exposition as to why we moved from point-to-point.Even when the hero is facing off against an impressive foe in a ring of flames, with dramatic music blaring loudly and lasers firing off in odd directions, there was no substance. The designs were interesting, with guns shooting spears and the badguys crawling around on all-fours with creepy masks, but I was still scratching my head.

The trailer itself created an hype with the brand name \'NetFlix\' and inculcated me to watch the movie. I thought it would be as hypnotic as it\'s manga. For those of you who don\'t know, BLAME\'s manga uses very less (almost negligible) dialogues, and in this process, our brain have to work hard and jerk. But when I watched the movie, I was disappointed. -_- As if I was looking to an anime version of Terminator.Story (3/10) : You must have figured it out till this point by watching the trailer, that there must have...been a salvation, the machine took control over the humans, and they are about to extinct, and they retaliate to take back what was their. Seriously, a standard story that we have listened or have given a thought so far. Also, they have used some complex terms (Like NTG, Safeguards, WatchTowers,etc. - which you will get after you watch it - Don\'t worry, these were not spoilers), which makes 0 sense, which is just there so that you get amazed. ""Oh wow..its so techy. I love that.."".... BULLSHIT!Art (9.5/10) : It was a treat for an eye watching the movie. The future they have created have some realistic blends & very compelling, I mean, it seriously looks like the future that machines were serious about the Darwin\'s Thoery of Survival of the Fittest.Sound (7/10) : Just because of that one soundtrack that is also available in trailer, you know which one. Overall music and soundtracks is just fine.Character (6/10) : Quick question, what characters you expect?...... Time up! Very obvious! A Retaliation Army, an ambitious human character, some cyborgs, some killing machines, etc.Overall, I would say, just watch it for the visuals, don\'t expect a great story. If you found it great, good for you. been a salvation, the machine took control over the humans, and they are about to extinct, and they retaliate to take back what was their.

The characters are very forgettable and boringly one dimensional. Everyone's personality could be summed up in zero to five words. The story crawled at a snail's pace except for three or four moments- only one of which actually felt like an important moment. There's very little to no build up so everything is completely unexpected in the worst way possible.And the writing and world building... Hoo... It's just downright bad. When you jump into the movie, you have this feeling that there's a...whole world out there that's going to be shown to you. You know what you get? Literal crumbs. By the end of the movie you feel like one of those cartoon characters that forced their way to a mirage of an oasis and got nothing but sand and more sand. So many things are presented to you but absolutely none of it is built on. There are also a few glaring plot holes that completely break what little story there is. On top of that, the writing is so bad that you hardly notice most of the important moments.I'm only giving this a 4/10 because the animation isn't bad (although there could've been more), the music slaps, and I desperately wanted to learn about the world this movie takes place in. I would strongly advise against watching this alone. This is one of those movies that are only entertaining if you have friends to watch and rage with you. whole world out there that's going to be shown to you. You know what you get? Literal crumbs.

The manga is probably the best ‘art book’ in the world so I understood they would have to change some things for a successful movie but I’m disappointed in what we ended up with.The manga ‘Blame!’ follows Killy as he makes his way through the sprawling city focusing on the environment and slowly build up the world. Sometimes there are fights but the people Killy encounters really aren’t important besides showing more of the world. The reason I enjoy Blame! is because it’s different, not...just in setting but also in its tone and characters. The movie feels like they just tossed the typical set of characters onto some establishing shots from the manga.Art(9)They nailed the background art. The locations looked like all they did was color in the manga (which they did some times).The background art is the best thing about this film. I don’t really mind the CG, it did seem like there were some weird framerates with the characters but was ok other than that.Sound(5)The sound effects were great but the soundtrack did not fit at all and they played a weird theme whenever they showed Killy that didn’t really fit.Story (5)The majority of the film is exposition. Most dialog is asking or answering questions and it gets really dull fast. It makes sense why there is so much exposition because they explain a lot of what is explained in the manga only it doesn’t have 66 chapters to do it in. There was too much that they tried to explain and I’d rather they just didn’t explain it, cut it out, or even change it to limit the time people are talking. Also it seems like everyone knows the history of the city and netsphere and it loses its mystery when is explained it 40 minutes. While the first half was mostly exposition, the final 20-25 minutes picked up and was a lot better but it didn’t fix the damage of the first half.Characters (3)I really did not like what they did with the fishermen. It doesn’t seem like they have been living in the world, they just seemed like you typical cast of characters for a mainstream anime. The only enjoyable characters where Killy, Cibo, and Sanakan, but Cibo’s dialog was almost only random lines taken from the manga. Killy was good but he should have been the main character.Enjoyment (3)This is obviously influenced from reading the manga but there were very few moments where I actually wanted to watch this movie. Almost everything is from the fishermen’s point of view and the 1 time I got hyped they kept cutting back to the fishermen while they were yelling each other’s names or yelling at their enemy right before attacking.Overall (6)There are a few moments where you can catch a glimpse of Blame! but it really isn’t enough. This is a good movie to watch if you liked Knights of Sidonia, Nihei has really changed since he wrote Blame! and has tried to become more marketable (switching from majority black to majority white art, focusing on characters over world building and atmosphere). The problem is it feels like everything has become more generic and has lost its original charm. I’m probably a little too harsh on it but they really didn’t take anything from the manga other than about 50 background panels, some dialogue, and Killy. The fishermen really ruined the movie for me but if they had given Killy the main role and made the fishermen a 10th of what they were in the manga I probably would have enjoyed it. There were too many times where I thought it was going to start getting good only to have the focus switch to the fishermen and that’s not really what I want when I watch Blame! just in setting but also in its tone and characters.

Tsutomu Nihei’s debut work was a dark, violent epic featuring a gunman on a quest to restore humanity’s control over the Net. Nihei employed a distinctive art style to depict the labyrinthine city, with its gigantic, towering structures and outlandish inhabitants, and backed it up with sparse, terse dialogue in order to maintain the manga’s nightmarish atmosphere.In 2003, a few ONAs adapting certain scenes of the manga were released, and were deservedly forgotten. Last year, however, Netflix released a feature-length film adaptation, mostly based on the “Electro-Fishers” arc. The...question I want to answer here is this: “Notwithstanding Tsutomu Nihei’s involvement as ‘Creative Consultant’, does the Netflix film do justice to the manga?”The short answer is “No”. And I’ll use the rest of the review to explain my point of view.I want to start by stating that I’m not a purist - my problem with the film isn’t that the filmmakers frequently deviated from the source material, but that some of these deviations have had a very negative effect on the quality of their adaptation.Most of this film’s praise goes to the graphics, which were very impressive. True, the visual design for the characters and their city isn’t as dark or distinctive as the original, but it’s high quality nonetheless. It reminded me of Mamoru Oshii’s 2004 film “Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence”, and sure enough I found out that the same studio (Polygon Pictures) was responsible for both films.KILLY:The main character is given a corny “tough guy” character redesign, complete with a square jaw and pumped-up physique. This is in contrast to the “metalhead highschooler” depiction of the manga, which gives the impression of a man more reliant on inner determination than physical strength. His Western shooting theme adds to the corniness, as does the swirling smoke around him (reminiscent of the swirling dust in old Westerns) which is accompanied by yet another Western heroic theme in the “final farewell” scene.Killy also speaks as if drugged and, aside from combat scenes, moves like a zombie. Enhancing the impression of a reanimated corpse are the unexplained neck injections he administers to himself every now and then, and which are, by the way, nowhere to be found in the manga.Cibo and the Electro-Fishers:The characters of the original manga are custom-made for their world, and what is sacrificed in depth is made up for by an intense focus on the world and its dynamics, delivered using the device of “What would happen if a gunman undertook a mission to look for the key to controlling the Net?” (The “net terminal genes” are, of course, a McGuffin). The filmmakers restructured the source material according to a traditional blueprint: the characters are placed at the forefront, along with the plot, while the world serves as the background.One of the biggest changes introduced in the movie was a shift in perspective: the main point of view became that of the Electro-Fishers instead of Killy. A lot of good effort went into giving them fleshed-out characters, but there were a couple of problems:_The melodrama was sometimes piled on a bit too thick - the tragic scenes milked for all they’re worth. In the manga, the city’s inhabitants rarely show strong emotions, and appear accustomed to the violence and brutality that plague their world. This fosters a feeling of fatalistic dread in the reader. It’s an uncommon style of characterization, and its examples are few and far between (one of them is “Texhnolyze”, another cyberpunk work of art). This contrasts with the emphasis the mainstream places on stirring empathy on behalf of the characters. In principle, there’s nothing wrong with the characters engaging the viewer through the strong emotions they display, as long as they don’t stray far into melodrama territory as we’ve seen happen in this film._In the manga, the most important characters after Killy are Cibo and Sana-kan, who are both strong, influential female characters. However, following the edicts of American identity politics, Netflix also moved the Electro-Fisher female characters to the forefront, in an obvious quota-filling, checkbox-ticking manner.The Plot:A lot of good effort also went into adapting the plot, which was based on the Electro-Fishers arc, while borrowing elements from other arcs and heavily modifying Cibo’s storyline.Unfortunately, it suffers from a major hole. When Killy asks Cibo: “Do you know any humans who have the Net Terminal Gene?”, she answers: “If there were any humans like that, then this city would have been made functional ages ago”. Of course the reasoning in Cibo’s answer renders Killy’s whole journey worthless*. What makes it bizarre is that Killy doesn’t object to or even question her reasoning, but promptly resumes his search for the genes after he parts ways with Cibo and the Electro-Fishers. But I guess that, after all, is what you should expect of a zombie.I don’t regret watching the movie, but I’m not looking forward to its planned sequel. question I want to answer here is this: “Notwithstanding Tsutomu Nihei’s involvement as ‘Creative Consultant’, does the Netflix film do justice to the manga?”The short answer is “No”. And I’ll use the rest of the review to explain my point of view.I want to start by stating that I’m not a purist - my problem with the film isn’t that the filmmakers frequently deviated from the source material, but that some of these deviations have had a very negative effect on the quality of their adaptation.Most of this film’s praise goes to the graphics, which were very impressive. True, the visual design for the characters and their city isn’t as dark or distinctive as the original, but it’s high quality nonetheless. It reminded me of Mamoru Oshii’s 2004 film “Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence”, and sure enough I found out that the same studio (Polygon Pictures) was responsible for both films.KILLY:The main character is given a corny “tough guy” character redesign, complete with a square jaw and pumped-up physique. This is in contrast to the “metalhead highschooler” depiction of the manga, which gives the impression of a man more reliant on inner determination than physical strength. His Western shooting theme adds to the corniness, as does the swirling smoke around him (reminiscent of the swirling dust in old Westerns) which is accompanied by yet another Western heroic theme in the “final farewell” scene.Killy also speaks as if drugged and, aside from combat scenes, moves like a zombie. Enhancing the impression of a reanimated corpse are the unexplained neck injections he administers to himself every now and then, and which are, by the way, nowhere to be found in the manga.Cibo and the Electro-Fishers:The characters of the original manga are custom-made for their world, and what is sacrificed in depth is made up for by an intense focus on the world and its dynamics, delivered using the device of “What would happen if a gunman undertook a mission to look for the key to controlling the Net?” (The “net terminal genes” are, of course, a McGuffin). The filmmakers restructured the source material according to a traditional blueprint: the characters are placed at the forefront, along with the plot, while the world serves as the background.One of the biggest changes introduced in the movie was a shift in perspective: the main point of view became that of the Electro-Fishers instead of Killy. A lot of good effort went into giving them fleshed-out characters, but there were a couple of problems:_The melodrama was sometimes piled on a bit too thick - the tragic scenes milked for all they’re worth. In the manga, the city’s inhabitants rarely show strong emotions, and appear accustomed to the violence and brutality that plague their world. This fosters a feeling of fatalistic dread in the reader. It’s an uncommon style of characterization, and its examples are few and far between (one of them is “Texhnolyze”, another cyberpunk work of art). This contrasts with the emphasis the mainstream places on stirring empathy on behalf of the characters. In principle, there’s nothing wrong with the characters engaging the viewer through the strong emotions they display, as long as they don’t stray far into melodrama territory as we’ve seen happen in this film._In the manga, the most important characters after Killy are Cibo and Sana-kan, who are both strong, influential female characters. However, following the edicts of American identity politics, Netflix also moved the Electro-Fisher female characters to the forefront, in an obvious quota-filling, checkbox-ticking manner.The Plot:A lot of good effort also went into adapting the plot, which was based on the Electro-Fishers arc, while borrowing elements from other arcs and heavily modifying Cibo’s storyline.Unfortunately, it suffers from a major hole. When Killy asks Cibo: “Do you know any humans who have the Net Terminal Gene?”, she answers: “If there were any humans like that, then this city would have been made functional ages ago”. Of course the reasoning in Cibo’s answer renders Killy’s whole journey worthless*. What makes it bizarre is that Killy doesn’t object to or even question her reasoning, but promptly resumes his search for the genes after he parts ways with Cibo and the Electro-Fishers. But I guess that, after all, is what you should expect of a zombie.I don’t regret watching the movie, but I’m not looking forward to its planned sequel.', ""First of all I'd like to point out that I've not read the manga and thus know nothing of the original story.

control now out of nowhere a human named Killy has a resolution for mankind.I thought the story was ok it went at a reasonable pace and it got more interesting the Movie/flim went on, founding out about how the safeguard worked and how mankind was trying to live amongst them was actually pretty interesting,...but past the half way point it goes from interesting to thrilling as the situation

saddened because I didn't know who they were so whenever someone that was human died it didn't really affect me, but Killy and Cibo are pretty much the characters who hold the Movie/film up because they aren't normal Killy apparently has superhuman abilities that also seem a little synthetic plus his personality which is the badass says few words type guy also made his character seem pretty damn

combination.The action was pretty good too it was pretty consistent throughout the show, but it never got boring everytime the humans encountered the Safeguard I was generally worried for them because

Movie basically plays out like a first person shooter video game. We have an almost silent, overpowered protagonist; forgettable bullet fodder enemies and allies; a “protect the stationary hacker” scene. We even get a final boss fight!

It looks ok but I prefer (big shocker) traditional animation. This WILL look dated in a few years. Netflix seems to love CG, which doesn’t really surprise me as they’re trying to attract as many viewers as possible. I guess they think non-anime fans will stumble upon this stuff and be able to watch it without having their bro-pride questioned. “It’s not anime! It’s like CoD! Bro!”They went for a T-For Teen…oops! I mean PG-13 rating. Lots of off-screen kills, blood splashes on the wall type stuff. Again, this is a Netflix, widest audience possible problem.Killy is boring. Cibo is hot and boring.

The manga is full of a sort of nihilistic emptiness that would be difficult to pull off and still rake in that sweet, sweet Netflix cash.

I guess BLAME!’s setting just kind of lends itself to  clichéd sci-fi action. The manga is full of a sort of nihilistic emptiness that would be difficult to pull off and still rake in that sweet, sweet Netflix cash. Luckily there’s robots and guns in it too!“Let’s fill in all this pesky atmosphere with lasers and explosions!” said the man on the committee.And so they did.', 'This genuinely captured the ambience of vast desolation common in Tsutomu Nihei\'s manga, which is a definite recommend if dystopian flicks are right up your alley.The main protagonist has a genuine reason to be broody and silent for once - he roamed a Dyson Sphere for 3000 years by himself. The aloof female char. isn\'t a traitor for once, the girl char. genuinely injects some humanity and warmth without coming cross as immature (unlike his whiny teenage male friend).And the environment, OH THE ENVIRONMENT, is beautiful in its vastness and desolation, it stands in perfect contrast to emphasise the fragility and helplessness of tiny...tribal humans struggling against impossible odds and impending doom. It\'s one of those flicks that have you actually rooting for likeable characters but very likely to be annihilated at any second, keeping you on the edge of your seat.The 2nd act betrayal that sets up for the third act final struggle is the only predictable cliche ruining an otherwise tense and enjoyable story, also, that crybaby teenage boy.The empty, ""mood"" shots actually have a reason to be there, in keeping with the theme of vast desolation, and is an integral element of the story and setting instead of just meaningless concept art, the personalities of characters have genuine reasons integral to the rest of the lore and story, hence the characters are not cliched tropes, but feels like actual parts of the world they\'re from.All of these are done subtly and beautifully to contribute to the overarching theme, which isn\'t as common as it should be.The setting is beautiful, period, what\'s surprising is the character designs and animations do emote genuine humanity and gravitas, warm and serious at the same time, in keeping with the dystopic theme, which is INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT in 3D anime, let alone a dystopian realist story.There are not any singular wow-factors that immediately distinguishes this adaptation, but each component is so well crafted and integral to each other you can genuinely be immersed in a holistic, believable world without the usual cliches and cracks that yank you out of the experience.A must recommend for any dystopian fan, a well-rounded jack-of-all-trades, and certainly better than most anime adaptations of its kind. tribal humans struggling against impossible odds and impending doom.

The plot is quite simple and straightforward: Survival of humanity in a post-apocalyptic settting. The music by Kanno Yuugo is, as always, outstanding. Only downside is that it is based on a manga and, unfortunately, the movie only covers a very small fraction of it, therefore, there are still many questionmarks about the whole setting and the characters that are not fully resolved at the end of the filmAll in all, a very...good and enjoyable watch that fans of sci-fi and post-apocalyptic genres should not miss! good and enjoyable watch that fans of sci-fi and post-apocalyptic genres should not miss!', 'I read a couple of chapters of the manga before I fortuitously discovered that a movie had been released very recently on the manga ""Blame!"".I watched it and came to realize they\'re not really the same story , regardless, although the movie does not really capture the essence of the manga which is INCREDIBLY fast paced compared to the movie adaptation, it\'s still very good.The *Characters* are not very well developed but from what little glimpses we get, they are very interesting and could easily have filled several movies worth of content (Especially Killy and Cibo, which I later discovered , there is a good...reason for that).A lot of the *Plot/Story* is left intentionally vague, we never find out where they are or what the dimensional proportions of the setting  ever is, but this is intentional, the author created the backdrop of the story in this specific fashion in order to make the world always confusing to the audience [We\'re not supposed to know, that\'s a core  element of the story], and it really shows in the movie that this is the case because a lot of times, it\'s just not at all clear where they are relative to another place they\'ve been (aka distance), but I can\'t stress enough that this is fully intentional.Now , based on what I just said, the story and characters sound pretty bad but they really aren\'t, it just needs a little patience from the audience. Bare with it and it will pay off in dividends.That being said, what does not pay off is the animation. I very much disliked the disjointed CGI, sometimes it worked but most of the time it did not. Still I loved the art style and wished I could see more of this, just maybe a little bit more refined.Overall I very much enjoyed watching this and truly wish I could watch it again a-new. I felt the only downside is that it was very confusing but that\'s part of the point of the story and, now having read a lot more of the manga I know that this is the case, you\'re not supposed to know where the story is taking place, when (time) or why a lot of the things are happening, that is simply the nature of ""Blame!"" .... watching the film I kept expecting some type of explanation but it never came, I still enjoyed it but I enjoy it more now in retrospect.Hard to explain but, say, compared to Ghost in the Shell (the original movie) this had better action, was more cohesive in terms of plot and had (in my opinion) better characterization.... the only problem was it was paced somewhat slowly and a lot of questions remained unanswered but still, I still recommend it, solid movie overall.

Very enjoyable.', 'My first thought while watching this movie was:""Oh god, this is some choppy shit.""However, Blame! did not disappoint. Being one of those watchers that viewed the film because it was a ""Netflix Original"", I have never been exposed to any of Tsutomu Nihei\'s works before. Netflix had previously released another one of his works titled ""Knights of Sidonia"", but I was put off by it due to the film being CGI in nature coupled with its mediocre ratings.Blame! takes us into a cyberpunk world, where robots have taken over (quite literally) and humans, now deemed as ""illegal residents"", are forced to survive in a harsh...world where a single misstep in their quest for survival could quite possibly mean their death by creepy robot exterminators. Overall, the film is somewhat... fast-paced. There\'s never a moment allowed for sentimentality and some characters barely even talk at all. I\'m talking about the main man named Killy here, who is so bloody quiet that ""a man of few words"" might actually be the exact phrase to suit him for the entire movie. The film is delicate and detailed, with each environment designed such that it makes us feel like the human survivors- helplessly stuck in the same place for all eternity. But it remains in every right, a true action movie that should be watched by everyone. Some other action movies try to devote time to so-called character development that usually ends up in a heap of garbled and incomprehensible rubbish, but Blame! does not follow suit. This is how an action movie should look like.The film also raises some thoughts about the future of mankind. We are in an age where technology is growing and an increasingly frightening rate, and humans in this era have successfully produced AI, or artificial intelligence, that can serve us. However, Blame! does tackle a topic most of us might have mused before- what will be the state of humanity should we build something that is more intelligent than us, and that entity happens to turn against its own creators? This subject was the point of focus for the recent season of Marvel\'s Agents of Shield as well (which is a 3D American TV series for those who don\'t know). Blame! does incite thinking into this matter. And I guess I enjoy thinking about it, because the time is nearing when humans successfully create artificial intelligences that can think and behave exactly in the way humans do.In spite of the good points of the movie, some might not want to watch it due to the fact that the movie is CGI- some might even argue that in a sense, it isn\'t an anime. However, it doesn\'t ruin the experience too much as you will hardly notice it after awhile if you try not to pay too much attention to that fact. Although I say this, it does irritate me quite a bit, so the sentiment that some viewers might face is quite understandable.This mode of animation does not affect character design. Cibo, Zuru, Killy and the rest are still very good-looking. In both ways. ;)Additionally, some word used in this film such as NetSphere and all these jargon might make the film somewhat hard to wrap your head around. Due to lack of explanation of this terms, I had a difficult time understanding certain parts of the movie, and it definitely wasn\'t very pleasant. People who have already read the manga might understand these terms utilised in the film, but viewers new to Blame might find this slightly unpalatable.Music-wise, the soundtrack does its job. Nothing too shabby or great, since most of the time you\'ll be too immersed in the action to notice the epic music playing the background.All in all, I thoroughly enjoyed Blame!. This adaptation certainly does justice to the manga that is held in high regard, and is a suitable starting point for people who are looking to start on Nihei\'s work, such as me.It\'s subject brings into mind fresh topics for reflection, and the movie will leave you at the edge of the seat during those aimbot sequences.

What if you had the voice acting of a stick and the story flow of a car with broken wheels. The first time I’ve watched this I thought this was pretty great, but now I’ve re-watched this 2 years later it’s hard to see what was so great about it.==slight spoilers==------- ANIMATION --------The animation was not to bad overall considering most of it was done with CGI. The action was okay and the laser beams did a great job at distracting you from the lifeless lip-syncing. Whenever the characters were in action the animation seemed fine. But...when they were just simply talking you could see how awkward the lip-syncing was and how emotionless the faces were animated.------------STORY------------The second factor this movie failed for me is because the story felt like patchwork. The story dives in the middle of the action, barely explains anything to satisfaction and then presents solutions to any giving problem. Just like that. The events which happen feel so haphazard or they happen just because. You’re in trouble being chased by the defective sex-dolls from ghost in the shell? Bam! Hero is here. You’re starving to death? Bam! Food! You need some bland plot where the viewer won’t connection emotionally with? Blame!Another aspect is that you can’t measure the timeflow in the anime. That is important, because it can give you the feeling something happens. If time slows down, some action or some important scene happens. If it speeds up you might feel that there is haste or get to know that you must feel that “something” happened in between time skips. But none of that was apparent in Blame! A great example is the travel from the perimeter to the automated factory and back.There is no climax to built up to and there are no tearjerkers to weep with. They would have done better to title the movie “Bland?”---------VOICE-ACTING------The last factor where this movie failed very very hard is its horrific voice “acting”. It feels like I’m listing to a high school project which was abandoned half way trough and then picked up to rush the rest of the project. The dialogues were boring, they were never connecting and lacked any emotion. On top of that there were to many moments where they repeated phrases or said anything random which didn’t fit in the moment.So when I looked at the characters there was no connection nor was there a feeling I could pleasantly listen to a good dialogue. If you expect to see anything cool from the MC, forget it. He didn’t have his voice box installed.------------MUSIC------------If there was just one thing that was good about Blame! is its music track. It would have done a good job if it was not for the wacky plot and bad facial expressions.------OVERAL-----Besides from a little nostalgia I didn’t like to re-watch Blame! The facial expressions were bad, the plot was not well written, there was no real dialogue, the mc was to edgy. The list goes on. Maybe I give the source material a read. In this movie it simply felt like it was desperately lacking something to make it interesting (and most of all explaining the situation). If you want a modern Beserk fairy tale, then you are to Blame! when they were just simply talking you could see how awkward the lip-syncing was and how emotionless the faces were animated.------------STORY------------The second factor this movie failed for me is because the story felt like patchwork.

If you want a modern Beserk fairy tale, then you are to Blame!', ""Alright, I gave this thing an 7/10 and now I'm going to try to justify it.TL;DR:Interested in BLAME!? Watch this movie. It's a great starting point for newcomers to the franchise, introducing key points, themes, and characters that are more-or-less accurate to the very abstract manga it's adapted from. If you have Netflix, it's one of the better animated series available - and despite being CGI, I promise there are some gorgeous shots, sequences, and scenes in it.PREFACE:BLAME! is a series that's been dormant for almost a decade, which is a shame. To me, this movie is a kick of the figurative BLAME! can,...a movie not really for existing fans - but one made in hopes of drawing new ones to this dormant franchise. To that extent, I say this movie is a success, and does a wonderful job. The story is very self-contained and easily understood, making this movie a nice place to start your dive into the world of BLAME!Speaking of worlds - BLAME! has a very, very good one. If you're a sucker for futuristic, apocalyptic worlds where humans eek out their existence - well, you've struck gold. The world envisioned in this franchise is enormous, bleak, oppressive, and commands your attention. The use of extremely wide-angle shots showing the absolutely massive structure of the city, the ridiculously long amounts of time certain characters have waited, the distances between important locations - everything about the city screams huge and this movie absolutely delivers the scale originally conceived in the manga.STORY:The story itself is... it's okay. It's definitely not a banger, or even that memorable. It's an adaptation/spinoff of the manga, selectively taking some characters and arcs and melding them together into a story that can hold water reasonably well. While 'eh' at best, the story does a decent job at introducing the viewer to the world and its functions, unfortunately this introduction is often through very dialogue-heavy, static scenes (looking at you, Cibo).I feel like the movie catches a lot of flak for the story, so let me put this to rest immediately: if the movie flat out panel-for-panel cloned ANY of the arcs from the manga, any viewer who wasn't deeply invested and familiar with BLAME! would instantly be lost and likely give this movie a 2/10. Sacrifices have to be made to adapt any franchise from one medium (manga) to another (animated), and BLAME!'s source material having such an abstract way of telling a story doesn't lend a hand.CHARACTERS:Character-wise the only two that stood out to me were Killy and Cibo. Both of whom are very well voiced, and Cibo's Japanese and English VAs knock it out of the park (somewhat off-topic, but still worth noting). The other characters (yes, every other character) feel like NPCs at best. I found myself zoning out pretty much any time Killly or Cibo wasn't on screen and the music wasn't commanding my attention. This is probably the weakest part of the movie, and I'm willing to bet is a big reason why people won't like it. The movie isn't a full-length season, you only get ~2 hours to try and care about any of the characters before it ends. And when the very best 2 characters are oftentimes relegated to the backseat, this movie makes its lack of good character focus well-advertised. Not for 1 second did I care about Zuru or the Electro-Fishers in this entire story unless they were actively fighting something. IMO, the movie could have been significantly better if more focus was placed on Killy and Cibo, rather than the Electro-fishers.The story almost flat-out screams at you that Killy and Cibo are part of the 'bigger picture' plot that's happening outside of the movie's screen time, and yet it STILL wants to focus on the party that isn't part of the bigger picture!ART & ANIMATION:The art is actually pretty good, except for literally every human's face looks like they got hit with the 3DCGI shovel and have about 50 eyebrow hairs between them. The robots (Killy, Cibo, Sanakan, Exterminators), somehow, look fine in comparison to the humans. Shots of the city structures are excellent, especially the ultra-wide shots where you feel both claustrophobia from the enclosed space, but also in awe at just how far this absolutely gargantuan city expands. There are some really jaw-dropping scenes and moments of scale, emphasized by the incredible musical score. These are probably some of my favorite shots in the movie, and they really sell the scale the manga so often depicted. Other sequences like the discovery of Cibo are pretty well done, shot in aging, ill-maintained areas that help to hammer in just how long the city has been expanding for, and how long Killy's been working towards his goal without obtaining it.However.. there's the frame rate... oh God, the frame rate. Getting into this movie it's almost like watching a slideshow. While you will adjust to it - it's a painful acclimation. Fortunately the fight scenes are well-done and shot, making them easy to follow and the weight of punches great. The frame rate also feels A LOT smoother during fighting sequences, or the frame rate itself is actually higher during these moments. Either way, the final fight is ... really good. Easily the best I've seen in a CGI animated show.MUSIC:The music is phenomenal, except for the 1 stupid track the play with the flute every time Killy shows up. That gets annoying. So much so that it almost became groan-inducing, you get a shot of Killy making some pissed-off face, followed by the SAME DAMN FLUTE NOTES EVERY TIME. Ugh, I hated it. The stupid flute notes aside, I actively found myself trawling the internet to listen to the OST and add some of the tracks to my favorites. There's really some great, amazing stuff that 100% complements the scenes, tone, and action that's happening - and if it weren't for the STUPID FLUTE (seriously, you'll know why I'm making a fuss about it!) I would easily rate this as some of the best OST I've ever heard in an anime.FINAL VERDICT:Overall: Thumbs-up. It's worth a watch, especially if you've already got Netflix. a movie not really for existing fans - but one made in hopes of drawing new ones to this dormant franchise.

As I\'m finding out after seeing the credits and some of these reviews, this was based on a manga? I doubt I\'ll read the manga since the storyline wasn\'t very interesting to me. So there are a couple of faults I found in the storyline:1. As a viewer, I did not care about this ""Killy"" character. I blame whoever directed this movie for this and the author(s). Killy acts emotionally detached from the other human beings. Thats why the ending feels so awkward to the point where it doesn\'t make sense. I can\'t see him as someone who acts...heroically considering hes Cibo\'s lap dog in the second half of the movie and he clearly doesn\'t prioritize the safety of the humans. He spots the kids at the beginning but he doesn\'t act until much later when half of them have been killed and Suru seems to run his way, setting up his shot. Then when they went to the factory, he prioritized the terminal over the safety of the people (he did not even bat an eye to check on them). Finally, his response to the village getting attacked was so delayed.2. The connection between Suru and Killy was not set-up well in the movie so it felt really weird how she was following him around and that one scene where she talks to him in his room is awkward.3. The plot is so weak and generic to the point where I can\'t let it slide. The author should\'ve been more unique or put more effort into making a better storyline because its basically people who have been oppressed by the machines but then they randomly follow a random cyborg and an AI/robot that comes along. Its such a convenient plot to the point where you would think that if Killy was part of the safeguard, they would\'ve all died once he got into the villageNow aside from the storyline, I have a problem with the frame rate on the animation. Its probably the same company that made the anime Sidonia no Kishi. The animation should not look as laggy as it does here. It should look smooth, not like some game running at 15 frames per second. I had this same problem with Sidonia but its clear they did not fix this. Overall, this movie is forgettable and I wouldn\'t rewatch it when theres better stuff out there. heroically considering hes Cibo\'s lap dog in the second half of the movie and he clearly doesn\'t prioritize the safety of the humans.

I watched this cause PewDiePie rated the whole Blame! manga very very good so I thought I'd try out the film. For me, it was pretty bland throughout the entirety of the film, but I do know theres a lot more to the story via the mangas etc.There was barely any explanation as to what the hell was going on lol and a lot of the characters, especially Killy, didn't have enough explanation behind their character and what they're all about.The CGI was pretty cool but I found the actual animation...of the characters moving was a little choppy so maybe they should've resulted with working in the original anime style.But hey, what do I know bout anime, I've only just gotten into it. of the characters moving was a little choppy so maybe they should've resulted with working in the original anime style.But hey, what do I know bout anime, I've only just gotten into it."", ""Blame! is one of my favorite manga and probably it has the most monumental artsyle i have ever seen in a manga.

You managed to do the most boring, predictable, wannabe-anime/hip garbage, that I can't believe how were you even able to do you goddamn americans.

As long as you understand that, this will be an exciting watch.Blame! is a manga unlike any other. It's absolutely vast in scope. It's shocking, disturbing, thought-provoking, and it's one of those reads you won't ever forget. I have to say this movie absolutely nails the atmosphere of Blame!. Initially, I didn't think the CGI animation would do the manga justice, but I was way off the mark. The City looks cold and haunting. The Safeguard move as inhumanely...as I expected them to and their sound is traumatizing. The movie is beautifully produced and is visually very stunning.So why am I saying this isn't a faithful adaptation? Well, without spoiling anything, the movie centers primarily around Killy and his time with the electrofishers. In the manga, the electrofishers appear pretty briefly and Killy certainly doesn't interact with them as much as in the movie. Still, I understand and respect the decision to inject a bit of a story into the movie. Blame! is a manga that takes place over several millions of years, so it would make sense for them to create a single story for the movie to focus on, and in that regard, it succeeds admirably. It's haunting and tense from beginning to end, but it's nice to see emotion and character -- something the manga pretty much lacked (though that was probably the intention and it's still a masterpiece).The movie also adds a great deal of action over the original source material. Don't get me wrong, Blame! has a lot of epic fight scenes, but I think the movie may have taken it just a step too far. The last fight scene is pretty extended, but it's not inaccurate. The levels of power of the characters is adapted faithfully.Overall, I only really take issue with the soundtrack. It's not bad. It just doesn't quite match at times. Still, this is a great adaptation. It's the best kind of adaptation that will leave fans of the manga in awe, but is also accessible for newcomers to the world of Blame!. Watch the movie.

So much drive to accomplish their goals but no real explanation to what the goals they are trying to accomplish are. This movie left me with more questions than answers. Maybe if I just wanted mindless action, I would have been ok with that, but the story surely wasn't presented in that manner. Kiri had a driving motive and we got little to no understanding of what he's actually looking for, what he is, how he became the way he is, etc. A rich world was presented to the...viewer, but it leaves us with more questions about it than the answers we were actually given.Animation/Design 9/10:I am in no way a huge fan of CGI in anime but if any studio knows how to do it it's Polygon Pictures and they delivered again here in this regard. My one real complaint would be that character designs tend to be very similar and not very unique.

One day, the machines received an infection that caused the machine to eliminate any humans that did not have the net-terminal gene, and the humans were forced into hiding.A unspecified time has passed (read as: a long long time later), Zuru and her squad is seen moving about around the city (which I will refer to as the Complex from now on) in search for food, before they were exposed by the Safeguard (read as: the group that eliminated the humans in the first place). One thing led to another and they were rescued by Killy, and so begins their quest to search for the Net Terminal Gene.The story isn't a happy one. It's kinda hard to say, but if I had to phrase it, it's more towards that I felt rather empty after watching the movie. It felt really one sided, and the conflict wasn't really there and the sudden attack felt like it came totally out of left field. It was less unexpected and more towards asspull. I'm not really satisfied with how shit hit the fan, but that's just my own thoughts. I'll still tell you to watch the movie if you're the kind of person who likes to observe small cornered communities react to the now-hostile environment. Personally, I think it's an interesting show, but it's not exactly my strike zone.Art:Polygon Pictures is one of the anime studios that really know how to use their CGI. Although admittedly, CGI in anime is still relatively young, Polygon Pictures did their best to bring out the charm of the models. Each character looked really great and the menace looked actually menacing, instead of looking like clay dolls. The environment is also displayed in this semi-realistic scheme and it fit really well with the mood of the story. Not once did it feel out of place, nor did it bring any unwanted attention to certain parts. In short, it was a marvelous display.However, if I had to be picky about it, the semi-realistic models are, to be frank, really young so there are some issues I have with it, but it's nothing too big. It's only my personal preference speaking here, so don't get influenced too much.Sound:As expected of a movie quality anime, the sound really is spot on. Each sound effect had this insane amount of depth within them, it's really immersive.To be honest, there really isn't much to say here other than great work. It's a great experience to listen to, but as of writing this review, I'm having a hard time recalling the music, so it kinda loses one point due to the forgettability factor. That probably isn't a word.The voice acting is also acceptable, but I was watching the English dub, and some of them lacked enough kick in their distressed voice, but I'm not going to knock points off just for that. I'll probably rewatch this movie in the unspecified future to fix this comment though.In short, the sound is great, but it's nothing too mindblowing.Character:Killy's character went through a small change which is surprising since he only speaks a handful of lines. He's this awkward dude who's hard to deal with if you're the verbal = good kinda dude. His actions speak much louder than his words, since he is noticeably distressed when the conflict began. He still has his priorities, which shows that as much as he doesn't want to leave, he still has a level head good enough to keep trying to complete his mission.The rest of the cast has a surprisingly large amount of guts. They're not wimps if I were to be frank. They were hard-boiled in this hostile environment that they live in, and it kinda shows, more or less.Similarly to what I said on the sound section though, there's really not much defining features for the cast. They fit well in the environment they preside in, but if I had to write down at least 3 points, I'd say that they had guts. So basically, in my opinion, the cast is suitable, but forgettable. They didn't display anything that caught my attention. A certain character also might or might not have annoyed me a bit.Enjoyment:Also, not much to say here. It's a show that asks you to think about the circumstances that these characters are in and has this show-not-tell kind of vibe. However, I felt like there really wasn't enough information given to me as a viewer so I felt like I was grasping at straws when I was formulating my own theories as to what was going on. This movie invites viewer participation, but this is probably the thing that works better in manga format since the time allowed to think about other things is really slim.Overall:It's a decent movie. It's really pretty and it I finished the movie with a feeling of pride for the cast. They worked hard and risked alot of things for their ending but I felt like things worked a bit too two-dimensionally. There really isn't alot of pondering about what happens next, since it kinda tells you how it ends and what is the future of the cast. Not much is explained about how life used to be in the setting since the story starts with the post-apocalypse. So I was given all the answers, which I don't particularly like. As a viewer, I want to be able to think about the after-story of the cast, but I guess we can't have all of that can we?I'd rewatch this, but only if someone invited me. if you're not looking for this kind of wall of text.==Story:BLAME is a post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie that takes place in a ever expanding city where the humans and the machines lived in a sort-of Master --> Servant society.

Much of what made me love Blame! was lost in this adaptation. The CGI is jarring, causing the characters to become stiff and stale. Emotion is lost through CGI translation - most characters have a single, barely changing facial expression. The story focuses on the electro-fisherman, making Killy a secondary character to his own story. The tone and style also differs from the manga. The original series focused on the vast setting, utilizing little dialogue and showcasing raw intense action. The pacing was dictated by exploration. This adaptation instead is dialogue heavy, removing the...sense of awe and the element of surprise when Killy is wandering aimlessly through the Netsphere. The action was alright, but could have been better animated (again, the CGI). On a positive note, the sound was amazing, adding an eerie component to complement the post apocalyptic, cyber punk world. sense of awe and the element of surprise when Killy is wandering aimlessly through the Netsphere.

They are both set in the future, mankind is split up, monsters/machines are prowling and hunting down humans, and we don\'t get to know much more about the world than we see through the characters\' eyes.The setting of the movie is a very futuristic one, year xxxx(x?) where mankind may have been put close to extinction by their own hands in the form of technological advancement, an autonomous AI system. The system seeks out and kills any humans who do not have a specific gene, a gene that is nowadays a legend that few know of. In other words, the system that mankind created to safeguard and help them, now treats everyone as an illegal citizen of the ""city"" which is the world we are presented to.The animation very closely resemblances that of both Ajin and Knights of Sidonia (same studio, KoS and Blame also has the same authors for the manga).While I say that the animation is similar to that of both Ajin and KoS, the art itself much more resembles that of KoS due to them sharing the same author. The art in Blame!: Movie looks like an upgraded version of KoS, with characters being more diverse, the equipment quality and background art being more detailed. The mysterious characters Killy and Cibo both have very high art quality.The characters in this show are good for the most part, previously mentioned Killy is a mysterious character who acts the part too. He speaks seldomly, very briefly and seems to have problems interacting with people even though he acts to protect and help them several times. He tells us that he is a human, however it is very apparent that there is more to it than that. His eyes and supernatural strength are merely 2 examples of this.My favorite character of the movie would be the village chief. He\'s a rational man who can take risks, always acts with a goal in mind and has the intention of winning. He looks out for his villagers in a way that a chief would, and is deeply respected by them in turn. The reason why I like him is  that he never breaks character and is always upfront and honest with his dialogue.A thing that this show did well with the characters was to not reveal too much, and it doesn\'t allow us to relax amongst Killy and Cibo, since we don\'t get to know their true intentions.Now what did I think of the movie as a whole?I think that it displayed very well things that were ""abnormal"" but never went into depth, leaving the viewer with a feeling of suspense as to what will happen.It showed the urgency of the situation, the village population was declining, the food supplies were running dry, but most importantly: it repeatedly told us that their equipment was vital for their survival but they had a very limited amount of it, and it was all very believable and well displayed.What I didn\'t like about the movie was the character Tae. In the factory she makes a mistake which can\'t really be explained as more than a plot reason, and how the ""infection"" works is something that could have been.. better explained.The sound quality is top notch, everything from weapon sounds to metallical clank sounds and electronical sparkling etc is original and well done.The OSTs are amazing and unlike a movie like the recent Gantz:O it\'s diverse and not only ""11th hour"" music.The VAs can sound a bit strange, and that\'s actually due to an interesting reason: a lot of them using the same voices as for many other popular shows\' MC or other important characters, and the ""age"" of the voices don\'t always match the characters. An example would be Atsuji, who shares VA with AoT\'s Eren, and he definitely looks older than the voice he uses sounds like.I thought this was a great movie, and I believe it\'s worth a 9 as a standalone on my list. resembles a video game: Metro 2033. They are both set in the future, mankind is split up, monsters/machines are prowling and hunting down humans, and we don\'t get to know much more about the world than we see through the characters\' eyes.The setting of the movie is a very futuristic one, year xxxx(x?) where mankind may have been put close to extinction by their own hands in the form of technological advancement, an autonomous AI system. The system seeks out and kills any humans who do not have a specific gene, a gene that is nowadays a legend that few know of. In other words, the system that mankind created to safeguard and help them, now treats everyone as an illegal citizen of the ""city"" which is the world we are presented to.The animation very closely resemblances that of both Ajin and Knights of Sidonia (same studio, KoS and Blame also has the same authors for the manga).While I say that the animation is similar to that of both Ajin and KoS, the art itself much more resembles that of KoS due to them sharing the same author.

It was nice, I'll admit, for some things to be explained because shit took forever to understand in the manga... but I don't know there was something about trying to figure it all out that was really fun about it as well.

They really did a great job translating the themes and world of the manga to an under 2-hour film, and for the most part it really does...it justice.

Here are my thoughts:For the record, I have never seen the older (2003) OVAs nor have I ever read the manga. I knew nothing about the franchise before watching this movie. Obviously this review will not address the faithfulness of this adaptation to the manga; I am only evaluating the movie as a standalone product.Basically, Blame takes place in a sci-fi post-apocalyptic setting because machines took over and blah blah blah reasons. The premise and setting kind of reminded me of the live-action Matrix trilogy.This movie is animated in CGI (well, at least the characters...and machines are). There were moments where the character animation seemed unnatural, but overall the characters looked okay to me. By CGI standards, it looked good. Facial expressions were done surprisingly well, which is unusual for CGI animation. Beyond the characters, the background setting looked terrific. There is tons of detail in the background landscapes, which really complements the post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting. There are lots of screencap-worthy frames in this movie. The muted, mostly grayscale, colour palette is suitable as well.The audio production quality is excellent. Lots of different sound effects really enhanced my immersion. Regardless of the CGI visuals, this movie sounded very realistic to me. Blame's setting is one that can really be enhanced by sound effects, so it's great that this was capitalized upon. The OST is great too, and really well produced. The voice acting is adequate; I liked Cibo's voice.The plot was pretty generic post-apocalyptic sci-fi material, and fairly predictable. In some ways it felt like a generic Hollywood blockbuster film plot. Although at times I felt like I was missing background information, it was overall coherent and competently executed. The plot was also fairly self-contained, meaning that there were no significant loose strings at the end (a common manga-adaptation issue). There was minimal character development, but the characters served their purposes, and none of them were annoying or unpleasant. Some of the character dynamics were a little corny at times, but these instances were short-lived. In terms of sci-fi stuff, there is a decent helping of cool technology in here, although nothing particularly unique.My overall rating: 7/10I found this movie immersive and consistently entertaining. It sounded great and looked good. It was competently directed and didn't have any major flaws. It was a good cinematic experience. Manga readers probably feel differently, but I think this movie did a good job of depicting a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting.If you have a surround-sound setup then I'd recommend using it if you decide to watch this (or at least a decent pair of headphones). and machines are).

Regardless of the CGI visuals, this movie sounded very realistic to me. Blame's setting is one that can really be enhanced by sound effects, so it's great that this was capitalized upon. The OST is great too, and really well produced. The voice acting is adequate; I liked Cibo's voice.The plot was pretty generic post-apocalyptic sci-fi material, and fairly predictable. In some ways it felt like a generic Hollywood blockbuster film plot. Although at times I felt like I was missing background information, it was overall coherent and competently executed. The plot was also fairly self-contained, meaning that there were no significant loose strings at the end (a common manga-adaptation issue). There was minimal character development, but the characters served their purposes, and none of them were annoying or unpleasant. Some of the character dynamics were a little corny at times, but these instances were short-lived. In terms of sci-fi stuff, there is a decent helping of cool technology in here, although nothing particularly unique.My overall rating: 7/10I found this movie immersive and consistently entertaining. It sounded great and looked good. It was competently directed and didn't have any major flaws. It was a good cinematic experience. Manga readers probably feel differently, but I think this movie did a good job of depicting a post-apocalyptic sci-fi setting.If you have a surround-sound setup then I'd recommend using it if you decide to watch this (or at least a decent pair of headphones)."", ""This was my first introduction to BLAME! I saw it, didn't think too much about it. Then I saw the manga show up in spanish in my local magazine store, decided to give it a go and I was absolutely hooked. The manga is so much better.After finishing the manga I decided to re-watch this and it was so much more enjoyable! This is truly a love letter to the manga. You have some of the main characters and the most interesting humans: electro-fishers. In the manga they were a little more badass as you saw how no one else was able to stand up...to the Safeguard and then you saw these guys just pommel them up. The movie makes them look ok, but not great.SPOILERS AHEADSomething that is a bit bad about this is how Killy is constantly tiredtwo shots of the gravity gun and he needs to shoot himself up with some drug just to make a shot. Does not reallly make that much sense. A very cool thing was the factory, loved the idea of how the solution to all their poblems was just a walk away and yet they never printed out one of the collars to keep the safeguard back, they could´ve even printed vehicles, more weapons, automated sentries to take out the safeguard, etc. and all they managed to do was food, a body and the terminal.I give it an 8 with mixed feelings because you truly need to be a fan of the manga to enjoy this, if you've not read the manga then best to stay away from this. I also do not rank it higher because it could've been so much more, the story had the pontential of giving us some more interesting machines/devices but it was pretty limited, probably due to budget. to the Safeguard and then you saw these guys just pommel them up.

While it's impossible for me to pretend I haven't read the manga, I think it's safe to say it's a bad movie on both counts.Some movie 'highlights' regarding the manga:1. It completely ignores the horror genre both in design and in feeling of danger, and that bothered me deeply. The manga succeeds in making you afraid or at least worried. The simplistic design of the safeguards in the movie didn't do it for me. The scariest thing was Cybo's robot body, seriously?2....I don't know if it was to save money but the settings aren't even close to being as grand as in the manga. The manga scenarios overwhelm you, make you feel tiny. In the film, everything seems to be zoomed in, the scenarios are neither big or much detailed. I forgot at times that the characters were supposed to be inside a gigantic structure.3. Dialogs are tell-not-show and feel AI-generated. The characters say everything at the calculated moment so you don't have a single thought while watching it. The movie starts and ends with narration, different from the manga that situates you little by little. And of course, it's worth remembering that the manga has much less dialogue, unlike the super expository film where no one seems able to shut up for a second, and mostly saying obvious things. It amazes me that none of the electrofishers even asked themselves the reason the safeguards hunt the human race.4. The CGI lacks emotion and something about the texture, or the lack of it, made me feel awkward. Crying characters barely change their expression. The uniforms look FLAT. It's weird. Maybe it was just me. I think CGI can be a great option for a Blame! movie but I don't think it was well executed in that one.Some positive points: Sanakan's appearance is kinda cool, VAs were good and OST is decent. In some punctual action scenes, I enjoyed the direction choices, and the conclusion is alright. Honestly, I don't think it was made for who read the manga, but for newcomers. It would be nice to have a reboot made by some crazy director obsessed with the manga. Blame! it's an exceptional work with enough world information to allow interesting creative choices while maintaining the essence of the original. Unfortunately that's not what I saw here.

So, after 4 years, does Blame still hold up? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryI'm not exactly a fan of cyberpunk stories because sometimes they're far too dark and gritty for my own tastes, but I did give Blame a chance for its vocal cast (that's how I navigate throughout the anime landscape, don't judge me). I was pleasantly surprised by how optimistic this movie can be, however. Sure, there are moments of tense battles and...even sudden character deaths, but they all serve to illustrate the importance of surviving against unsurmountable odds and the belief in hope even in the harshest of times. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the struggle of protagonist Killy to find someone, anyone, who could find him end the machines' reign over the city in which humans are little more than scavengers and fugitives. (7/10)CharactersI've always believed that characters are the lifeblood of the story. You can have all the epic music, intense battles and interesting world-building you want, but they won't ultimately matter if you don't have characters your viewers can sympathize with and get behind.I've really enjoyed the relationship between Killy and Cibo, who are merely allies of convenience at first, but they save each other's lives over the course of the movie, which also features a lot of interesting secondary characters like Fusata, who tries to look after his love interest Tae, Sutezo, who doesn't immediately trust Killy, and Oyassan, an elderly leader who does his best to keep his community from falling apart.If I had to pick a favorite character in this movie, however, I'd pick Zuru. While Killy's relationship with Cibo does make him something of a compelling character, the stoic archetype really feels played out at this point, so it's nice having a character that tries to remain optimistic in such difficult times. (8/10)ArtSay what you will about Polygon Pictures, but they do know how to combine anime aesthetics with CGI. I do admit that it's difficult to tell some characters apart, especially with that lighting, but the action scenes looks amazing and Killy and Cibo manage to be the most distinctive characters in the movie, at least from a visual perspective. (8/10)SoundsThe soundtrack of this movie is beautiful and I really enjoyed the piece used for Killy's battle with Sanakan. The vocal performances are the sound department's real standout, however, with both versions of the movie boasting incredibly talented voice actors.The Japanese version features the talents of Takahiro Sakurai (Killy), Kana Hanazawa (Cibo), Sora Amamiya (Zuru) and Nobunaga Shimazaki (Fusata). While all the actors deserve praise for their work, I think Sora delivered the standout performance of the Japanese version.As for the English version, well, I'm not familiar with the career of Kyle McCarley but I think he did a fine job as Killy. I've also enjoyed the performances of Christine Marie Cabanos (Zuru) and Bryce Papenbrook (Fusata) and this was the first time I listened to Kira Buckland (Sanakan) perform as an antagonist. Still, I think the best performance of the English version was delivered by Cristina Valenzuela (Cibo), who has fine chemistry with McCarley.ConclusionIn closing here, Blame is an entertaining and action-packed story that teaches the importance of believing in hope, even in the harshest of times. Even after 4 years, this movie still holds up pretty well and I highly recommend it.

Devilman: Yochou Sirene-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2355/Devilman__Yochou_Sirene-hen,"['Okay remember how the first Devilman movie had a lot of explaining and build up until the last 15 minutes before the awesome gore fest began…well this movie does not follow that same formula. Mostly, it just gets straight to the point.StorylineThis movie to me feels like three separate action sequences crammed into one great movie. The first involving a demon who lures Akira into his hideaway just to torture him with a horrifying revelation about his parents. Second is an ambush attack at home targeting the family that is providing Akira with his temporary accommodation. Then lastly the movies core focus is on the...Demon Bird Silene (pronucened differently) who wants to kill Devilman to make an example out of demons who choose to meld with humans. Actually about 50% of this movie is focused on the bitter grudge match between Devilman and Silene and it turns out to be a great fight to the death!Considering how much things go on in this movie I’d say the pacing is fantastic and the action scenes in this movie are excellent but also when it does slow down a little it usually focuses on some minor character development otherwise it’s pretty much action packed.Near the end of the movie it’s unclear who will come out on top…I mean it looks like Devilman will get the last laugh…but how it actually turns out is actually quite interesting. Everyone I know who has watched this movie really like s the ending in particular. It’s a cool one indeed!AnimationKeeping in mind this is early 90’s animation The animation for the first movie was pretty decent…I mean the character designs looked a bit cutesy at first but when the demons get involved things change quite dramatically.This movie was made a couple years after the first one and things look a lot better. The anime on a whole has a MUCH darker tone and where Akira looked like a sweet kid in the first movie he now looks like a pumped up thug ready to pound anyone that gets in his way.However I’d say overall the animation style looks pretty simplistic but not in a lazy way. A standout point for me is the demon character designs. They really look like morphed, spliced animal creatures…which really feels disturbing…I mean to this day Ginman is one of the most F’ed up demons I’ve EVER seen in any anime. If someone did a live action Ginman costume / CGI effect I would be vomiting all goddamn day, I swear!Anyway, compared to today’s level the animation is pretty average but I still think it’s aged pretty well over the years regardless.SoundI like the music in Devilman…its got a melancholy feel to it. The English dub is really quite comical to me but not in a bad way…I mean, re-watching this now I can understand why some people may find it korny but overall I think it works out very well. Devilman in particular say’s some really funny shite when he’s killing demons…certainly not the sweet boy Akira he was before.Overall sound is pretty decent…compared to the original Jap language it’s a bit spicier which worked out well imho.CharactersDevilman has an extremely small cast, which works in its favour. There’s pretty much Akira / Devilman, Ryo, Miki (barely) and the various demons Akira and Ryo have to face.For such a short anime I think the characters are developed well enough…In particular you get a good foundation for Akira’s character which is the most important thing.Another surprising thing about this movie is that the demons are quite cunning and not just your typical stock throw-aways. Particularly in this movie most of the demons have a connection with Akira’s demon counterpart and often comment on how surprised they are by the fact that the demon (Amon) has joined forces with a human (well that’s not exactly correct but I don’t wanna spoil anything for newcomers).EnjoymentLike I said for the first movie I enjoy this anime on two levels, the first being nostalgia. I remember how confused and weird I felt about rooting for a demon to succeed…..this was way before the more recently accepted anti-hero boom we are surrounded by today.The second level is the action in this anime is pretty hardcore, barebone and enjoyable to watch.Unlike the first movie however the pacing and content is consistently engaging and theres never really a dull moment from start to finish!It’s another short fun crazy ride… I have enjoyed this title for many years and still find it of a high standard even after all these years.Value / Final ThoughtsOver time Demon protagonist’s have become more common place in movies (Hellboy) and especially in anime, to name a few: Hellsing, Vampire hunter D, Inu Yasha, the cast of Saiyuki, Chrono from Chrono Crusade etc. So Devilman kinda loses the shock value it had around the original time it was made.But like I said before being very young and coming from a Christian upbringing made this anime quite the shell-shocker.I was hesitant to write this review at first as I did feel a lot of my praise for it would come down to nostalgia but after re-watching it I am now reassured it is actually a quality title that still holds up to this very dayIt’s short and sweet and many do hail it as an anime cult classic.Surprisingly though I found more reviews for both the Devilman OVA’s on IMDB than on various anime sites….saying that though it seems the manga is vastly more popular than the anime incarnations.As a side note I will say I was disappointed with the third sequel: Amon the Apocalypse of Devilman – which in my mind had a different tone and strayed away from the Manga’s original perfect ending….a total letdown on what could have been a great trilogy.

No Jeet Kune Do, no Chun Kuk Do, no Tae Kwon Do, no nothing.Devilman has very few special powers compared to the demon generals. Ironically, Devilman is known as the strongest. That's not even feasible.Devilman gets his ass kicked like the cover implies. He literally gets tossed around cause he is so skinny and shrimpy. Rather than trying to emphasize the fangs on his face, he could use some wide, broad shoulders.Devilman's fights are corny, cheesy, and also a drag. There is obviously no equal footing.Conclusion -4 cons outnumber 1 pro. Every 1 minute watched is 3 minutes wasted. This movie could not live up to its prequel. I'd say a score of 4 is just about right.Scoreboard -Story - 3Art - 5Sound - 6Character - 3Enjoyment - 3Overall - 4 Devilman is useless and not a good fighter.

However, the animation and action of this OVA cannot be beat for the time it was created (except of course by AKIRA).If you have seen the first episode you already know the story as this episode is a continuation of that.The animation is very fluid (it was actually better than what I was expecting) and there were no instances of repeated animation that I could see.If you want an anime movie that you can just sit back and watch while drinking a...beer a two, this series is it. beer a two, this series is it."", 'Part 2 of the 80\'s/90\'s OVA Devilman trilogy is Devilman: The Demon Bird. As the title implies, this anime is largely just about the fight between Devilman and the ""harpie lady"" known as Sirene. It\'s funny because this fight doesn\'t even happen until like halfway through the hour long OVA, with the first half consisting of Akira battling 2 other demons. That\'s it. There\'s really no story or character development to speak of here. The art/animation is once again very detailed, far surpassing the Netflix Devilman Crybaby in that department. I\'ll also praise the sound design here, since the ""buzzsaw sound effect"" when Sirene shot...her homing missile arm was very effective. I do think it\'s beyond dumb that she can detach her arm and use it as a projectile when she\'s purely organic--and it always comes back to her somehow---and I need to stop thinking so much about this anime!!Akira and Ryou have lost all sympathetic traits from part 1 and are now just hungry for battle alpha males. I will say that Miki\'s personality is better here than in her Crybaby version, where she was just the perfect ""good girl."" This Miki doesn\'t take shit from ANYONE, and is even willing to punch Akira in the nose if she thinks he deserves it! She\'s got spunk and that goes a long way with me (I just hope she has a better fate in store for her than her ending in Crybaby). Sirene herself has a cool, sexy design, I admit, but she\'s just a monster of the week, nothing more. I really don\'t remember much about her personality. We don\'t know why she hates Akira so much, or how she even tracked him down in the first place for that matter. When her friend the rhino guy sacrifices himself so they can combine, we don\'t really know why. They had an off-screen romance I guess? Instead of killing himself so an already-dying Sirene could use his body, why couldn\'t rhino guy just finish off Akira himself? Also who was this Xenon guy teleporting monsters in to help Sirene at the end? Couldn\'t he just fight Akira himself (and probably win)? Will Xenon be showing up in part 3? I feel like the show will forget about him, even though he seemed important. So yeah I had a lot of issues with the Sirene fight, mainly that went on WAY TOO DAMN LONG! Literally the last half hour of this OVA is the 2 of them fighting back and forth changing location like 10 times, no joke.Out of the two earlier fight scenes (this anime is just a collection of fights btw, no exposition this time) we have one against Jinmen and one against a pervy water demon. The water demon fight was OK but clearly just an excuse to see Miki naked in the bath. I liked the part where a possessed Miki attacked Akira, but he back-handed her and knocked her out almost immediately. So anti-climactic! Why couldn\'t they drag out THAT fight!? And the Jinmen fight was just terrible. They make the same mistake as the Crybaby version, where Jinmen just shows up out of nowhere and has absorbed Akira\'s mom somehow and we\'re supposed to give a shit even though we\'ve literally never had a scene of Akira with his parents until now. Wait, didn\'t Akira\'s mom die in the Arctic? What was Jinmen doing there?! How did he travel from the Arctic to Japan and track down Akira so quick!? Also there\'s a super cringe moment where Akira starts crying after killing Jinmen and his tears drip down through a hole in the floor and JUST SO HAPPEN to land right on his mom\'s face on Jinmen\'s shell on the lower level. Oh my God WHAT A COINCIDENCE! Ughh.Devilman: The Demon Bird is a poor anime, 3/10. Oh boy, I just CAN\'T WAIT to see how they wrap up this mess with part 3... her homing missile arm was very effective.

Oh my God WHAT A COINCIDENCE! Ughh.Devilman: The Demon Bird is a poor anime, 3/10. Oh boy, I just CAN\'T WAIT to see how they wrap up this mess with part 3...', 'While the first installment of Devilman was mostly centered around Akira Fudō\'s ascension (or ""descent"") into his powers, ""Yochō Sirene-hen"" is more of a look into the psyches of the pure-blooded demons that seek him out, because of the latent spirit that he possesses, that of the insidious, Amon! This volume of the series is more profound because it portrays demons in a very human way, they have similar souls to those who are broken, or have fallen away from God. ""Yochō Sirene-hen"" gets a little more psychological and deep than the primitive power fantasy of ""The Birth"" episode!⚠️ This review of Devilman: Yochō Sirene-hen...will contain spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersI didn\'t enjoy ""Yochō Sirene-hen"" as much on my first viewing, because there\'s some really risqué shots of Miki Makimura. It\'s so overtly sexual, that even though the animation is impressive, it distracts from the whole fight with Gelmar! I would say that it was probably the weakest part of the OVA, even though Miki\'s nudity was important in a way, because it kept interspersing scenes of her bathing with images of Sirene, bitter and agonizing over Amon. The nudity showed both of these women laid bare, and while Sirene\'s heart is cold and bitter as she stands in the rain — Miki is surrounded by warm colors and is more chaste with her feelings for Akira Fudō.Though, I thought it was a little bit excessive to have Akira\'s blood spray all over Miki\'s nude body, when he is torn out of his home by the bird-like Sirene! The only interpretation that I could get from that is... it being a sexual euphemism! Before Akira battles against Sirene, he has to suffer the inhuman torment of Jinmen. To this day, I think that Jinmen is among one of the scariest cartoon villains! When I was reading the ""Devilman Tai Yami no Teiō"" (""Devilman VS Hades"") manga, even apart from the original story, Jinmen\'s appearance had shivers crawling up and down my spine! The idea of a pure evil demon turtle that swims in a sewer with screaming human heads on his shell is a big ""no""! Maybe the iteration of the Penguin in ""Batman Returns"" had too heavy of an influence on my childhood, but animalistic creatures swimming in a sewage system gives me the willies!That\'s part of the reason that ""Yochō Sirene-hen"" was so great: Jinmen is subjectively the most terrifying Devilman villain and Sirene is the most misguided, not to mention that she\'s beautiful and iconic in her appearance! Jinmen is degenerate soul that tortures humans, because it\'s the only thing that is able to bring his pitch-black soul joy, as opposed to Sirene, an ""Übermenschen"" figure that solely feels satisfaction from the desire to defeat the strongest demon, Amon, to claim the throne as the most powerful creature in Hell. Both can be reflective of how single-minded and greedy corrupted humans can become. At the end of ""The Demon Bird"" OVA, even though Kaim decapitated himself, so that she could use his corpse as vessel to defeat Devilman — Sirene is able to have a pure look of elation on her face, because nothing (no life) is more important to her than her own triumph.I won\'t explain why this is significant, but the dichotomy between Ryō Asuka and the demons is important, as the plot progresses. The idea of what it means to be human, or what one becomes when they completely forfeit their humanity. The last shot of Sirene\'s effigy of a corpse, is an elegy for a soul led astray. One who confuses a lust for power and the feeling of love. Her complexity versus the simplicity of Akira\'s childhood friend, Miki. The deterioration of humans (into debased monsters) is what Devilman is all about — Go Nagai\'s plot declares that you don\'t have to be born a folklorish monster, in order to become a demon.—TechnicalLuna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Umanosuke Iida (director), notable works:* CB Chara Go Nagai World ✅* Devilman: Yochō Sirene-hen ✅* Hellsing (2001) ✅* Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team (eps 6 to 11) ✅* Mobile Suit Gundam: The 08th MS Team — Miller\'s Report* Tide-Line Blue* Towa no Quon 1: Utakata no KabenCommentary: Brilliant director, Mr. Iida had a real eye for saturating colors together and has used color theory to his advantage throughout his filmography.

He IS Devilman to me! He has such a powerful, masculine voice! I would compare his performance as Akira Fudō to his roles in ""Boku no Chikyū wo Mamotte"" (""Please Save My Earth"") as Shion and in ""Trigun"" as Nicholas D. Wolfwood! Truth be told, he was my favorite actor in ""Serial Experiments Lain"" — his performance as the megalomaniacal, Masami Eiri, is both horrifying and the peak of excellence!

He has a very commanding presence; so much so, that I ended up paying more attention to his character in ""Creamy Mami"" than to the lead love interest! I would compare his performance as Ryō Asuka to his characterizations of Toshio Ōtomo (in the aforementioned ""Creamy Mami"") and Clow Reed (""Tsubasa Chronicles""), both are more of his bishōnen-archetype roles! Great job!Jun Kōyamaki as Miki Makimura, notable roles:* noneCommentary: Ms. Kōyamaki isn\'t credited to any other anime role, that I could find, but she has acted in live action roles (under the stage name: ""Makoto Sumikawa""). I have conflicting information on whether she was Marina in ""Anderson Dōwa: Ningyo-hime"" or not — some sources have Ms. Kōyamaki credited in the role and others have Fumie Kashiyama listed. She is known for her live action roles in shows like ""Kamen Rider Black RX"" and ""Jikū Senshi Spielban"" — her career was more centered around television dramas, with a foot slightly dipped into the anime pool. Her version of Miki Makimura is the best, in my opinion, she gives off the aura of a wholesome, everyday girl... this characterization of Miki even reminded me of some of the pure-spirited Ghibli girls, like Nausicaä. Great job, it\'s a shame that she didn\'t get a chance to voice in more anime productions!Yoshiko Sakakibara as Sirene (or ""Silene""), notable roles:* Reika Ryūzaki, Ace wo Nerae! 2 — originally voiced by Masako Ikeda* Meichi Yuri, Akuma no Riddle ✅✅* Queen Nehellenia, Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS and Sailor Stars ✅✅✅* Sybel, Black Magic M-66* Azusa Matsudaira, Blue Seed* Sylia Stingray, Bubblegum Crisis ✅✅* Mitsuko Asatani, Cat\'s Eye ✅✅✅* Silene (""Sirene""), CB Chara Go Nagai World ✅✅✅* Miran, Chōjikū Seiki Orguss 02 ✅* Silene (""Sirene""), Devilman: Yochō Sirene-hen ✅✅✅* Frederica Greenhill, Ginga Eiyū Densetsu ✅✅✅* Aila Mu, God Mazinger* Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate ✅✅✅* Sesshōmaru\'s Mother, InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen* Princess Airfield, Kantai Collection (""KanColle"") ✅✅✅* Shinobu Nagumo, Kidō Keisatsu Patlabor* Project 2501, Kōkaku Kidōtai 2.0 (""Ghost in the Shell 2.0"")* Haman Karn and Mōar Pharoah, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam ✅✅✅* Jōshū Kasei, Psycho-Pass (series) ✅✅* Karura-Ō, RG Veda* Flore, Rokushin Gattai GodMars* Medea, Saint Seiya Omega ✅✅✅* Tomiko Asahina, Shinsekai yori ✅✅* Feb Fall, Sol Bianca: Taiyō no Fune* Tekka\'s Maki-chan, Sore Ike!

The downcast, jaded ice queen with an aura that has a complete and utter thirst for power. The two characters that I would compare the performance to is Ms. Sakakibara\'s acting as Haman Karn (""Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam"") and Queen Nehellenia (""Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon""), both are icebound vixens with sad backstories. I would even go so far as to say that Haman Karn\'s relationship with Char Aznable (or ""Quattro Bajeena"") is similar to Sirene\'s dynamic with Amon, though Sirene worships Amon and desperately struggles to defeat him, as a show of veneration for him.

I would compare his role as Kaim to his performances as Zabuza Momochi (""Naruto"") and Quent Yaiden (""Wolf\'s Rain""), because in these roles, we\'re able to see a more vulnerable side of his character, tragic as it may be!

Mr. Aono made Jinmen one of the most skin-crawling villains of all-time! Amazing performance, rest in peace, Takeshi Aono, you will be missed!I wish Mr. Iida had adapted the rest of the manga, the man had a strong vision, and did exceptionally well with the animation of the source material for Go Nagai\'s ""Devilman""! Having the bittersweet conclusion to Sirene\'s imaginary triumph, may have been more powerful than what may have come from trying to adapt the war against Satan, that spanned for years and years! Sirene\'s fate was swift and vigorous, and I would even say that her demise may be even stronger in this version than it is in the original manga! ""Yochō Sirene-hen"" gets a solid 8/10!Rating: ★★★★☆ will contain spoilers ⚠️—Story/CharactersI didn\'t enjoy ""Yochō Sirene-hen"" as much on my first viewing, because there\'s some really risqué shots of Miki Makimura.

He IS Devilman to me! He has such a powerful, masculine voice! I would compare his performance as Akira Fudō to his roles in ""Boku no Chikyū wo Mamotte"" (""Please Save My Earth"") as Shion and in ""Trigun"" as Nicholas D. Wolfwood! Truth be told, he was my favorite actor in ""Serial Experiments Lain"" — his performance as the megalomaniacal, Masami Eiri, is both horrifying and the peak of excellence!

He has a very commanding presence; so much so, that I ended up paying more attention to his character in ""Creamy Mami"" than to the lead love interest! I would compare his performance as Ryō Asuka to his characterizations of Toshio Ōtomo (in the aforementioned ""Creamy Mami"") and Clow Reed (""Tsubasa Chronicles""), both are more of his bishōnen-archetype roles! Great job!Jun Kōyamaki as Miki Makimura, notable roles:* noneCommentary: Ms. Kōyamaki isn\'t credited to any other anime role, that I could find, but she has acted in live action roles (under the stage name: ""Makoto Sumikawa""). I have conflicting information on whether she was Marina in ""Anderson Dōwa: Ningyo-hime"" or not — some sources have Ms. Kōyamaki credited in the role and others have Fumie Kashiyama listed. She is known for her live action roles in shows like ""Kamen Rider Black RX"" and ""Jikū Senshi Spielban"" — her career was more centered around television dramas, with a foot slightly dipped into the anime pool. Her version of Miki Makimura is the best, in my opinion, she gives off the aura of a wholesome, everyday girl... this characterization of Miki even reminded me of some of the pure-spirited Ghibli girls, like Nausicaä. Great job, it\'s a shame that she didn\'t get a chance to voice in more anime productions!Yoshiko Sakakibara as Sirene (or ""Silene""), notable roles:* Reika Ryūzaki, Ace wo Nerae! 2 — originally voiced by Masako Ikeda* Meichi Yuri, Akuma no Riddle ✅✅* Queen Nehellenia, Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon SuperS and Sailor Stars ✅✅✅* Sybel, Black Magic M-66* Azusa Matsudaira, Blue Seed* Sylia Stingray, Bubblegum Crisis ✅✅* Mitsuko Asatani, Cat\'s Eye ✅✅✅* Silene (""Sirene""), CB Chara Go Nagai World ✅✅✅* Miran, Chōjikū Seiki Orguss 02 ✅* Silene (""Sirene""), Devilman: Yochō Sirene-hen ✅✅✅* Frederica Greenhill, Ginga Eiyū Densetsu ✅✅✅* Aila Mu, God Mazinger* Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, Hellsing and Hellsing Ultimate ✅✅✅* Sesshōmaru\'s Mother, InuYasha: Kanketsu-hen* Princess Airfield, Kantai Collection (""KanColle"") ✅✅✅* Shinobu Nagumo, Kidō Keisatsu Patlabor* Project 2501, Kōkaku Kidōtai 2.0 (""Ghost in the Shell 2.0"")* Haman Karn and Mōar Pharoah, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam ✅✅✅* Jōshū Kasei, Psycho-Pass (series) ✅✅* Karura-Ō, RG Veda* Flore, Rokushin Gattai GodMars* Medea, Saint Seiya Omega ✅✅✅* Tomiko Asahina, Shinsekai yori ✅✅* Feb Fall, Sol Bianca: Taiyō no Fune* Tekka\'s Maki-chan, Sore Ike!

The downcast, jaded ice queen with an aura that has a complete and utter thirst for power. The two characters that I would compare the performance to is Ms. Sakakibara\'s acting as Haman Karn (""Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam"") and Queen Nehellenia (""Bishōjo Senshi Sailor Moon""), both are icebound vixens with sad backstories. I would even go so far as to say that Haman Karn\'s relationship with Char Aznable (or ""Quattro Bajeena"") is similar to Sirene\'s dynamic with Amon, though Sirene worships Amon and desperately struggles to defeat him, as a show of veneration for him. Impeccable performance, as always!

I would compare his role as Kaim to his performances as Zabuza Momochi (""Naruto"") and Quent Yaiden (""Wolf\'s Rain""), because in these roles, we\'re able to see a more vulnerable side of his character, tragic as it may be!

Many of the roles that I love him as, like Yōshō (""Tenchi Muyō!"") and Shirō Sanada (""Uchū Senkan Yamato"") are more genial and stoic, so I had no idea that he had this kind of dimension to his acting! Mr. Aono made Jinmen one of the most skin-crawling villains of all-time! Amazing performance, rest in peace, Takeshi Aono, you will be missed!I wish Mr. Iida had adapted the rest of the manga, the man had a strong vision, and did exceptionally well with the animation of the source material for Go Nagai\'s ""Devilman""! Having the bittersweet conclusion to Sirene\'s imaginary triumph, may have been more powerful than what may have come from trying to adapt the war against Satan, that spanned for years and years! Sirene\'s fate was swift and vigorous, and I would even say that her demise may be even stronger in this version than it is in the original manga! ""Yochō Sirene-hen"" gets a solid 8/10!Rating: ★★★★☆', '“Devilman: Yochou Sirene-hen” looks and sounds good, and is an entertaining watch, although it’s lacking in terms of plot and setup.The biggest issue with this OVA is that it’s not a direct continuation of its prequel. Characters are introduced that the main character seems to know, but the audience doesn’t, as they weren’t in the first OVA. Also, the timeline isn’t clear: the events here definitely happen after those in “Devilman: Tanjou-hen,” but it’s vague as to how much time has passed since then. And the characters look different here, particularly Akira, even though the designer is the same.There isn’t much of a plot in...“Yochou Sirene-hen,” just a series of battles with demons, roughly divided into 3 of them. The OVA just kind of throws you in there and expects you to know what’s going on, and it’s all a bit jarring and confusing. It has a proper conclusion, but it’s underwhelming.The characters don’t get much development because it’s just one episode, and some of them, especially Akira and Miki, act differently from the way they did in the first OVA.The animation and art look good; the demon designs in particular are intriguing. The direction is good, and the fight scenes are entertaining. The voice acting is decent. The music is good.Regarding objectionable content, there is a lot of nudity in this one; the main antagonist, in particular, is topless throughout the whole episode. There are also some gratuitous scenes with Miki completely nude, and a slight amount of perverted dialogue. And of course, there’s some graphic gore and death, but it’s surprisingly tame here for a Go Nagai work.Overall, “Devilman: Yochou Sirene-hen” was probably made with manga readers in mind, since it’s difficult to understand what’s going on and why if you’ve just seen the prequel. However, if you can accept the lack of explanations (or have read the manga) and can handle the nudity, it’s a decent watch. “Yochou Sirene-hen,” just a series of battles with demons, roughly divided into 3 of them.

The central themes of Devilman are horror and the spectacle of watching the protagonist battle demons, both of which are executed perfectly in this second OVA.Initially, we encounter Jinmen - an unsightly demon turtle that feeds on its victims while displaying their faces on its shell as if they were trophies. The prey, including Akira's mother, suffer and plead for assistance without realizing their inevitable fate. Next, a demon invasion...occurs at the home where Akira is being cared for due to the absence of his house and relatives. Finally, the movie's main event is a fight against the notorious Demon Bird Silene, which occupies most of the film's end.The animation and fight scenes are solid, and the quality is better than what was seen in most TV series of that time. It even looks marginally better than its predecessor. Speaking of content, it would be remiss of me not to mention that this movie is filled with blood, gore, and nudity, so it's not suitable for sensitive people.Devilman: Demon Bird Silene is definitely a product of its time - it's violent, in your face, and purely existed as a marketing tool to entice people to buy manga. It's entertaining, and I enjoyed it. It's worth checking out, especially if you're into classic anime and want to explore other Devilman stuff. occurs at the home where Akira is being cared for due to the absence of his house and relatives.

Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/53421/Dosanko_Gal_wa_Namara_Menkoi,"['The studio censored the ecchi from an ecchi anime lol. This must be one of the stupidest decisions I’ve ever seen i suppose they did it because they thought that way the anime would reach a wider audience (as if My Dress-Up Darling didn’t exist).They even removed a reference to Shokugeki no Soma another legendary ecchi manga. I highly recommend reading the manga since, besides not being censored, Ikada Kai’s art is very good and has nothing to envy of the anime style.In an anime where the main attraction is seeing beautiful girls,they simply cannot cut shots and scenes that show the girls’ sensuality....It’s stupid in every sense It’s stupid in every sense', 'You ever watch something you think is going to wind you in, but it just doesn\'t?You ever watch something you believe you should really like but it fails at showing you anything that would intrigue you?This is the epitome of ""Hokkaido Gals Are Super Adorable!"", it never goes the extra mile to actually get the watcher to fully care for the characters, besides basically showing the viewer women that are the most beautiful ones in class and having them fall for the MC like a harem, without actually giving them a full personality.What I mean is that they do have a personality, but it...feels undeveloped to the point that it\'s questionable to why they would fall for the MC. Not in the way that you do not get why the characters like the MC, but to the point that it feels forced and rushed onto the viewer, like it should take itself slower and not push itself through plot points.Next, this show takes itself too seriously most of the time, it plays like it wants to be a serious romance anime, when it should focus more on it\'s comedy, which is lighthearted comedy and doesn\'t always play off of it to what it could, plus it\'s a bit repetitive since most of it is ""Oh no by boobs brushed against you!!!"" or ""Oh no you fell on top of me very suggestively..."" kinda playing itself like an ecchi.This doesn\'t mean that this anime is bad, it just rushes it\'s pace to an abnormal degree, and has a somewhat repetitive lighthearted comedy, plus it is a bit of a harem in some ways.

I didn’t get a chance to see him too often, but at the time, our little tradition was going to GameStop and getting me whatever cheap DS games could fall under their buy 2 used games get 1 half off scheme. It meant a lot to me at the time since I was obsessed with video games and played my DS constantly. Now, the result of this practice was, in reality, just bombarding...me with a deluge of low budget, hardly notable experiences that I ended up selling after a few years anyway.  I love my dad, but half the time those games were so boring that once I got inevitably stuck, I became far too disinterested in continuing—Or, if I did finish them, they clearly weren’t enthralling enough to remember. For much of its run, I was ready to write off Dosanko Gal Wa Namara Menkoi as an experience very akin to the majority of my bloated, turn of the decade DS catalogue. However, I think this show is just a modicum above that—and as such, deserves something longer than a two sentence blurb on my list I’ll read again in two years.Let me start with a factual statement, I fucking love gals. I only recently became aware that I was a devout follower of the gyaru religion, but since then it’s been consistently on my mind. A subculture centered around embracing feminine aesthetics to a holistic extent, obsessed with self-expression and unburdened by the demure shame that’s brute forced onto many Japanese women, what’s not to love about it? While sometimes in real life gyaru are lurid enough as to be unpleasant or even garish, the inevitable self-confidence that comes from constantly oscillating between popular and freakish depending on context and age will always be appealing to me. In short, gyaru dare to be bold. And even though gyaru culture has been bottomed out to the extent where you can’t really consider it a “movement” anymore, gyaru have left enough of an impression on the Japanese psyche to consistently show up in their media.While I can’t necessarily point to when or why, in the last decade gyaru have inundated slice of life anime and manga. There’s this joke referenced in Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu that gals are nice to otaku, and maybe that was alluding to some kind of popular 5channel meme which bubbled to the surface amidst the intellectual discussions about hentai and posting unsolicited comments about the Chinese, who knows? Either way, it’s now manifested to a point where there’s not only one romance anime specifically about gyaru related characters, but like five or something? In this case, gyaru are used as general devices to bridge the “hick” culture of Hokkaido Japan to a greater population, particularly those in metropolitan areas.If Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi wanted to leave me believing that Hokkaido had cool stuff in it by the end of the season’s run, I think it succeeded. The show is filled with enough Hokkaido-oriented product placement and innocuous little cultural tidbits to build a sense of immersion. It can arguably be associated with the kind of exposition that sometimes bogs down a badass action manga like Golden Kamuy, but Dosanko Gals instead seeks to develop a sense of setting and familiarity with that setting, which well integrates into the narrative. When Akino or Fuyuki goes on about Soda or some shit, I’m actually listening and engaged. Because to some extent by learning about this cultural artifact from a region I’ve never been to tells me something about Akino and Fuyuki, and what their “home” means to them.Minami Fuyuki begins the story with a subtly debasing her denizenship of Hokkaido. However, in time with her interactions with the main character Tsubasa Shiki, she gains a greater appreciation for her hometown and herself. This inevitably leads to a greater interest in Tsubasa and the kind of person she wants to be, orienting the overall trajectory of her character arc, and serving as the basis for the budding romance between the main leads.I don’t want to mislead anyone into thinking this is KareKano or some shit, this is a fucking harem manga. Or, more accurately— this is a modern wish-fulfillment Reiwa era romcom contorted into some lethargic wish-fulfillment harem pretzel monster. The original author Kai Ikada, or some semi-shrewd midwit editor, astutely noticed that unless Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi had some kind of narrative direction, the story was quickly going to stagnate lest the main couple got together immediately. The latter would’ve been far too bold for the relatively green mangaka, and the former would’ve inevitably frustrated the readershipbase which would’ve been the primrose expressway towards cancellation. So instead, Dosanko Gals introduces a few more girls that tap into specific gyaru niches to artificially inject “tension” into the narrative. It’s comes off disjointed like, whenever a harem character is introduced some goofy exaggerated manga bullshit happens that doesn’t match the tone of the first episode at all. Reiwa era romcoms tend to keep the actual scenarios relatively down to earth with minor exceptions, this story included. It’s still wish fulfillment—but there’s a dramatic difference between the Fuyuki flirting with Shiki in an igloo, and Rena, the smartest girl in the entire school—hugging the main character in his entry way for no discernable reason other than she thought his fit was super sugoi desu as a history nerd… this was their second interaction. I say all this, but I don’t think Rena is terrible per say. If this was a normal harem manga, I actually think she’d be a pretty decent addition (even if she has no chance of winning.) Additionally, it wouldn’t have been that hard to address my bitching because I don’t think the character writing is uniquely poor.Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi was actually a love triangle between Fuyuki, Tsubasa, and Sayuri Akino, I actually think Ikada could’ve gotten away with murder by completely changing the show’s genre. Call me basic if you want, but Akino is fucking cool. The way her personal arc intertwines with the other characters’ in a greater dramatic scenario is neat, for what it is. A gaming otaku who experiences a glow up and, despite her icy demeanor and awkward personality, stumbles into the popular kid crowd after falling in love with the transfer student from Tokyo whom the most liked girl in class is clearly down bad for. While it probably wouldn’t be on some braindead top 10 romance anime listicle, the scenario would at least be interesting to play out. Unfortunately, because this series shoehorned in a harem along with a sorta-established quasi-subgenre, the show has to dedicate time to characters who shouldn’t matter (except for Fuyuki’s hot ass mom she should get even more attention. Fuck it, put her in the shitty harem, why not). Tsubasa is a pretty decent mc, as far as flaccid and tepid romcom men are concerned, and has good chemistry with both girls that I want to see go somewhere. And unlike with most harem manga, which tend to frontload their protagonists’ characterization so they can focus on the tits, even if Shiki’s backstory is left intentionally ambiguous, whatever happened to him seems like it had a real impact on his personality. And, I actually think there’s going to be follow through, which may or may not suck. And while I wouldn’t necessarily also use terms as harsh to describe other aspects of the show, it isn’t just the writing that’s left me with mixed feelings.While the backgrounds do a decent job at selling the atmosphere of northeastern Hokkaido in the middle of winter, Dosanko Gals visually leaves a lot to be desired. This is a by the numbers, bog standard, hardly passionate or innovative slice of life anime. The animation is never really impressive (if not often stilted), the digital compositing isn’t elevating any of the scenes, and don’t even get me fucking started on the storyboards. While I have definitely seen worse, I would argue the directing is straight up incompetent at times, despite this show having TWO DIRECTORS. While the character designs and their accompanying color choices are pretty appealing, and the girls are attractive, the show’s production is largely unremarkable and dull. It’s a clear product of the modern anime industry’s, and Silver Links’—lack of consistent scheduling and lack of access to outstanding talent. Though, I wouldn’t say the production is completely artless, for example, people complained about the removal of a lot of the original manga’s fanservice. Frankly, I think this decision demonstrates that some people DID care about making an okay product. Since in my ignorant, uncultured ass opinion, from what I’ve seen, a lot of the fanservice in the Dosanko Gals manga doesn’t really fit the show’s tone at all. The accused “censorship” in the anime was likely a creative choice made by the staff to preserve the show’s immersion, since anymore fanservice than the little we got would’ve been stupidly distracting and I’m glad they changed it.By now, I hope it’s clear as to why I have mixed feelings about recommending Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi at all. There’s some decent story construction the despite harem shit, and the characters are likeable, but this is a manga adaptation at the end of the day. Meaning, there’s not going to be any serious catharsis or, god forbid, substantial progression with any of the relationships that fundamentally changes the status quo for the long term. And even if there is a second season, I doubt I’d want to watch it anyway. Because, according to many of the readers, the manga goes to shit for the next like fifty chapters or something which would be around 24-ish episodes. A recent review of the manga even suggested you should just skip a hundred chapters from some point early on until the manga gets back on track. The main reason you would want to watch the anime is to consume the good part of the manga with a pretty decent soundtrack, solid voice acting, and consistent character art (which the early part of the manga is SORELY lacks about from what I could tell at a glance). Even so, what made me decide to give this show a six is, funnily enough, the eleventh episode.The visuals for Dosanko Gals was one of the main contributing factors depreciating my enjoyment, but episode 11, despite all odds, actually looks pretty decent; with one scene in particular having the best animation, storyboards, and digital compositing of the season. After a largely lukewarm reception from my end, I actually watched a scene that, without me overanalyzing and on its own merits, made me feel something. In the two months leading up to that episode’s airing, I largely spent the winter not feeling much of anything, with media being basically the only thing that connected me to the world. In many ways. I’d sunk to much lower emotional depth than I ever had prior, to the point where I couldn’t even muster up the energy to unnecessarily worry anymore. However, right before that episode aired, I’d just started to climb out of that pit where I thought I’d met the bottom, but I still felt this terrible weight on me. And while it’s not even in my favorite anime episodes, not even my favorite slice of life anime episodes, it was one of those few rare moments where a piece of art genuinely impressed me. A sacred moment, where despite watching 10 episodes of a show barely able to meet the standard of “kind of passable” and just inching over the finish line, crafted some moments where I was truly locked in to the character’s emotions, and could finally sense some gravitas from the show’s creative staff. It was like I was lifted out of my chair and into their world, and for the briefest of moments, I didn’t feel so heavy.Maybe I was being dramatic or something, and maybe the episode wasn’t actually that crazy. But, at the very least I’ll remember this show for providing me with those few transient moments where I actually felt somewhat like me.Or maybe I’m just a nerd.Have a nice day. me with a deluge of low budget, hardly notable experiences that I ended up selling after a few years anyway.  I love my dad, but half the time those games were so boring that once I got inevitably stuck, I became far too disinterested in continuing—Or, if I did finish them, they clearly weren’t enthralling enough to remember. For much of its run, I was ready to write off Dosanko Gal Wa Namara Menkoi as an experience very akin to the majority of my bloated, turn of the decade DS catalogue. However, I think this show is just a modicum above that—and as such, deserves something longer than a two sentence blurb on my list I’ll read again in two years.Let me start with a factual statement, I fucking love gals. I only recently became aware that I was a devout follower of the gyaru religion, but since then it’s been consistently on my mind. A subculture centered around embracing feminine aesthetics to a holistic extent, obsessed with self-expression and unburdened by the demure shame that’s brute forced onto many Japanese women, what’s not to love about it? While sometimes in real life gyaru are lurid enough as to be unpleasant or even garish, the inevitable self-confidence that comes from constantly oscillating between popular and freakish depending on context and age will always be appealing to me. In short, gyaru dare to be bold. And even though gyaru culture has been bottomed out to the extent where you can’t really consider it a “movement” anymore, gyaru have left enough of an impression on the Japanese psyche to consistently show up in their media.While I can’t necessarily point to when or why, in the last decade gyaru have inundated slice of life anime and manga. There’s this joke referenced in Boku no Kokoro no Yabai Yatsu that gals are nice to otaku, and maybe that was alluding to some kind of popular 5channel meme which bubbled to the surface amidst the intellectual discussions about hentai and posting unsolicited comments about the Chinese, who knows? Either way, it’s now manifested to a point where there’s not only one romance anime specifically about gyaru related characters, but like five or something? In this case, gyaru are used as general devices to bridge the “hick” culture of Hokkaido Japan to a greater population, particularly those in metropolitan areas.If Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi wanted to leave me believing that Hokkaido had cool stuff in it by the end of the season’s run, I think it succeeded. The show is filled with enough Hokkaido-oriented product placement and innocuous little cultural tidbits to build a sense of immersion. It can arguably be associated with the kind of exposition that sometimes bogs down a badass action manga like Golden Kamuy, but Dosanko Gals instead seeks to develop a sense of setting and familiarity with that setting, which well integrates into the narrative. When Akino or Fuyuki goes on about Soda or some shit, I’m actually listening and engaged. Because to some extent by learning about this cultural artifact from a region I’ve never been to tells me something about Akino and Fuyuki, and what their “home” means to them.Minami Fuyuki begins the story with a subtly debasing her denizenship of Hokkaido. However, in time with her interactions with the main character Tsubasa Shiki, she gains a greater appreciation for her hometown and herself. This inevitably leads to a greater interest in Tsubasa and the kind of person she wants to be, orienting the overall trajectory of her character arc, and serving as the basis for the budding romance between the main leads.I don’t want to mislead anyone into thinking this is KareKano or some shit, this is a fucking harem manga. Or, more accurately— this is a modern wish-fulfillment Reiwa era romcom contorted into some lethargic wish-fulfillment harem pretzel monster. The original author Kai Ikada, or some semi-shrewd midwit editor, astutely noticed that unless Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi had some kind of narrative direction, the story was quickly going to stagnate lest the main couple got together immediately. The latter would’ve been far too bold for the relatively green mangaka, and the former would’ve inevitably frustrated the readershipbase which would’ve been the primrose expressway towards cancellation. So instead, Dosanko Gals introduces a few more girls that tap into specific gyaru niches to artificially inject “tension” into the narrative. It’s comes off disjointed like, whenever a harem character is introduced some goofy exaggerated manga bullshit happens that doesn’t match the tone of the first episode at all. Reiwa era romcoms tend to keep the actual scenarios relatively down to earth with minor exceptions, this story included. It’s still wish fulfillment—but there’s a dramatic difference between the Fuyuki flirting with Shiki in an igloo, and Rena, the smartest girl in the entire school—hugging the main character in his entry way for no discernable reason other than she thought his fit was super sugoi desu as a history nerd… this was their second interaction. I say all this, but I don’t think Rena is terrible per say. If this was a normal harem manga, I actually think she’d be a pretty decent addition (even if she has no chance of winning.) Additionally, it wouldn’t have been that hard to address my bitching because I don’t think the character writing is uniquely poor.Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi was actually a love triangle between Fuyuki, Tsubasa, and Sayuri Akino, I actually think Ikada could’ve gotten away with murder by completely changing the show’s genre. Call me basic if you want, but Akino is fucking cool. The way her personal arc intertwines with the other characters’ in a greater dramatic scenario is neat, for what it is. A gaming otaku who experiences a glow up and, despite her icy demeanor and awkward personality, stumbles into the popular kid crowd after falling in love with the transfer student from Tokyo whom the most liked girl in class is clearly down bad for. While it probably wouldn’t be on some braindead top 10 romance anime listicle, the scenario would at least be interesting to play out. Unfortunately, because this series shoehorned in a harem along with a sorta-established quasi-subgenre, the show has to dedicate time to characters who shouldn’t matter (except for Fuyuki’s hot ass mom she should get even more attention. Fuck it, put her in the shitty harem, why not). Tsubasa is a pretty decent mc, as far as flaccid and tepid romcom men are concerned, and has good chemistry with both girls that I want to see go somewhere. And unlike with most harem manga, which tend to frontload their protagonists’ characterization so they can focus on the tits, even if Shiki’s backstory is left intentionally ambiguous, whatever happened to him seems like it had a real impact on his personality. And, I actually think there’s going to be follow through, which may or may not suck. And while I wouldn’t necessarily also use terms as harsh to describe other aspects of the show, it isn’t just the writing that’s left me with mixed feelings.While the backgrounds do a decent job at selling the atmosphere of northeastern Hokkaido in the middle of winter, Dosanko Gals visually leaves a lot to be desired. This is a by the numbers, bog standard, hardly passionate or innovative slice of life anime. The animation is never really impressive (if not often stilted), the digital compositing isn’t elevating any of the scenes, and don’t even get me fucking started on the storyboards. While I have definitely seen worse, I would argue the directing is straight up incompetent at times, despite this show having TWO DIRECTORS. While the character designs and their accompanying color choices are pretty appealing, and the girls are attractive, the show’s production is largely unremarkable and dull. It’s a clear product of the modern anime industry’s, and Silver Links’—lack of consistent scheduling and lack of access to outstanding talent. Though, I wouldn’t say the production is completely artless, for example, people complained about the removal of a lot of the original manga’s fanservice. Frankly, I think this decision demonstrates that some people DID care about making an okay product. Since in my ignorant, uncultured ass opinion, from what I’ve seen, a lot of the fanservice in the Dosanko Gals manga doesn’t really fit the show’s tone at all. The accused “censorship” in the anime was likely a creative choice made by the staff to preserve the show’s immersion, since anymore fanservice than the little we got would’ve been stupidly distracting and I’m glad they changed it.By now, I hope it’s clear as to why I have mixed feelings about recommending Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi at all. There’s some decent story construction the despite harem shit, and the characters are likeable, but this is a manga adaptation at the end of the day. Meaning, there’s not going to be any serious catharsis or, god forbid, substantial progression with any of the relationships that fundamentally changes the status quo for the long term. And even if there is a second season, I doubt I’d want to watch it anyway. Because, according to many of the readers, the manga goes to shit for the next like fifty chapters or something which would be around 24-ish episodes. A recent review of the manga even suggested you should just skip a hundred chapters from some point early on until the manga gets back on track.

Watching Hokkaido Gals Are Super Adorable made me wonder just how the gals in this show can make a reputation of their own. It begins on a cold freezing day when 16 year old Tsubasa Shiki meets Minami Fuyuki.It seems love at first sight. Unlike some traitional rom-coms, there\'s an overemphasis on their first meeting. The first episode spend a great deal of time on their chemistry. Despite coming from completely different backgrounds, the two are drawn towards each other like two...peas in a pod. Some people may also compare their encounter like red strings of fate, a legend that two people are tied and destined to be together. The author wrote the story with their relationship in mind, and it\'s the core of the show.The creator of the series Kai Ikada is relatively unknown, a fresh face in the manga industry. Translating their work into anime medium should be celebrated as a major accomplishment. The spotlight shines on the super adorable gal konwn to us Minami. With a dazzling smile and sparkling personality, she turns heads from both genders. This is pretty much the anti-thesis of our male protagonist Tsubasa, who despite being an overachiever, tends to keep to himself. What happens when you pair these two up? The simple answer is a relationship based on curiousity and trust. The latter comes later once the two understands each other more. However, the first episode has a spellbinding opening in the cold weather of Hokkaido. It\'s almost bedazzling to see Minami dressed in such cold temperate. Mind you, she\'s in a skirt dressed casually and seemingly embracing the cold weather. My impression is Minami is protrayed as a larger than life character, at least compared to the rest of the cast.While I\'m not entirely convinced how long their relationship can evolve or last, it\'s no understatement that the first episode makes a strong showing. It\'s probably the episode that get the audience hooked because we can find out so much about Minami just from her background and emotional expressions. That is, Tsubasa seems more like the underdog. The show later introduces other main girls such as Rena and Sayuri. To set them apart, Rena is protrayed as the opposite of our adorable gal. Reserved, serious, but can also sensitive, her relationship with Tsubasa starts off rocky but gradually improves. Somewhere in the middle is Rena, who is introduced as a shy yet talented girl. While these two characters are given on-screen time, their presence serve more as main supporting roles. Why you may ask? That\'s because Minami is given the greenlit to be the star. It\'s obvious from the beginning when she\'s protrayed as the poster girl. Sorry folks but if you\'re looking for Tsubasa building a relationship with others on the same level as Minami, then you\'ll be in for a disappointment.Nonetheless, this is a rom-com that doesn\'t take too many risks and settling for delivering an youthful experience. Our main characters are high school students who are just beginning to enter the age of adulthood. The show takes them to places besides the classroom walls and allowing them to experience what relationships are about. It\'s honestly very straighforward that uses common sense to tell its story and relationships. There\'s no deceptive twists or complex plot that throws the viewers off guard. To put it simply, it\'s a rom-com that gets straightforward as it can be. Obviously, you\'re going to see how characters experience human feelings that ranges from insecurity, jealousy, joy, awkwardness, anxiety, among others.The location of the show is part of the anime\'s title and it represents a bit more than just what it sounds. Hokkaido has beautiful scenery that is natural, and a visual feast to the eyes. This is mostly represented by cold climate and snowy weather throughout most of the season. It gets repetitive after awhile but ultimately gives an unique look to the setting. Similarly, each of the gals in the show have feminine features. Minami stands out the most as she has the classic \'gal\' look.

That would be a more accurate title.The writing, to put it succinctly, is godawful. The story begins with a fish out of water premise.

Initially excited by its announcement, my enthusiasm quickly waned after just a few episodes.The protagonist fits the typical simp archetype, blushing after every few sentences for some unknown reason.

The girls don\'t deviate too much from their archetypes but they take extremely out-of-character actions when they try to ""flirt"" and the quick fixation they all have with Tsubasa is typical of this type of anime but I legitimately liked most of them. I may not understand where so much love came from, but I really understand how the friendship came about, especially between Tsubasa, Fuyuki and Sayuri (another friend the protagonist makes in Hokkaido)In short, this anime was a pleasant surprise, not because it was revolutionary but because it did the basics efficiently. The girls are pleasant and the protagonist, despite not having a strong personality, is at least likable because he isn\'t an idiotic pervert with his new friends.', ""I am super happy that I got to write a review for those who are curious about this anime. It's a very good anime to begin with, I started reading the manga before the release of the first episode, and being curious, the narrative thread keeps the order of the manga, it's surprising.The manga caught my attention at the beginning, and it captivated me enormously, it's very cool to see Tsubasa in his new city, Hokkaido, with some good and beautiful girls, who are making fun of the city. It is admirable that the characters are well composed, the dialogues...are not boring, but one more thing, in the manga, some scenes that the anime presents are uncensored, so the manga is a bit more spicy than the anime. Reading the manga,I got attached to the characters and I like that, it gives me a good vibe, I got attached to the fictional world, it simply captivated me to the max. It's the only comedy anime combined with romance, which lets me give it a clear 10, it deserves it, it's very good. There are scenes where you die of laughter, especially Tsubasa's faces, I burst out laughing when I saw them, or the moments when he remains frozen and ashamed, they are the best. This show fascinates me a lot, I love it like crazy and for sure if you like this kind of anime, I'm sure you will like it.

And if there's one thing I can say, is that I am NOT disappointed. I thought this was going to be another basic, 12-episode anime with some filler and Horimiya-like storytelling that jumps all over the place time-wise, but MAN, I'm glad it wasn't.The good:#1: Every character is very well written.#2: The story takes place in a timeframe that is actually reasonable and something that isn't hard to understand.#3: When it comes to locations, this anime doesn't stay in the school like a lot of other...romance animes that are school-related.#4: Has a perfect balance of wholesomeness that isn't overloading like a lot of animes. It's great the MC isn't totally an extremely, unrealistic nice guy like other romance animes. (ex: 100 girls who really like you)#5: All of the girls are very different, yet likeable and unique in their own way.The bad:#1: The ending, at least of the first season if it get's anymore, is not very good. Unlike the rest of the show, which everything made sense, this ending doesn't. It didn't feel very rewarding or satisfying, and it kinda felt like a lot of hype and build up led to nothing.#2: There are a lot of things that do not make sense logic-wise. For example, despite being very close, Shiki doesn't call ANY of his friends by their first name. Not even the person who he is very close to asking out. Shiki also apparently had a very heated argument with his parents, and yet at the end, they seem to have a very good relationship.#3: The writing goes through a lot of tropes, making you be able to guess a lot of things that are going to happen.Was this anime good?Very, I feel like it is in my top 5 for favorite romance animes.Would you recommend this?If someone wanted a good, sweet and short romcom anime, definitely.Tuning in for Season 2? (if it get's one)Probably, I'd like to know where this goes. It's a pretty good watch, so if I remember it exists, I will.Overall rating:8.7/10 romance animes that are school-related.#4: Has a perfect balance of wholesomeness that isn't overloading like a lot of animes.

The winter season pleased us with a lot of great...NO! Great ecchi, but we didn\'t get much romance, although the sequel ""The Dangers in My Heart"" turned out to be great, but that\'s another story.... But according to the laws of universal balance, for every very good show there is on average one not so good show, and...Dosanko Gal was one of them.The main character, Tsubasa Shibi, follows his father to Hokkaido from Tokyo. Cold weather, a different culture, new food, all of this is gradually introduced to him by Minami Fuyuki, a gyaru Tsubasa met at a bus stop. But new conditions are not the only thing she introduces him to, she also introduces him to herself by flirting, which surprises the unhappy young man. Tsubasa is clearly unhappy with Fuyuki\'s easy behaviour, but if he had known that she is not the only girl from Hokkaido who can show interest in him....This show is not rich in interesting characters. Even though it\'s everyday life, Kai Ikada fails to convey the motivation of each character. Seriously, why does Fuyuki like Tsubasa? She\'s a popular girl at school, she has a lot of friends, but at first sight she liked a shy guy who didn\'t stand out at all. When I said ""didn\'t stand out"" I meant didn\'t stand out at all to the audience or the girls on the show. Wakana from My Dress-Up Darling is a skilled craftsman who knows his craft. Naoya from Kanojo mo Kanojo is a straightforward guy, careful to keep his promises, albeit skirting the rules. And what about Tsubasa? He\'s a wastrel who can\'t do anything but blush at common words and faint at a woman\'s touch, and three beautiful girls have shown interest in him? As for them, that is:Minami Fuyuki is the main gyaru of the tittle. Possessor of lush breasts and a lush mum, who became the best woman in the show. A la Marin Kitagawa, but unlike her, she flirts with the main character from the very first seconds of meeting him, rather than the next few days. She has problems with her studies.Sayuri Akino is a sweaty girl who likes to play video games. Disconnected from the group. In general, she is better than Fuyuki, because unlike her, she is more reserved and determined.Rena Natsukawa is an excellent student who loves history and reading books. She is as determined as Akino, but more communicative and quiet.For all their richness, none of them have any real reason to like Tsubasa, but Kai Ikada has other thoughts on the matter that I can\'t share in any way.Every attempt by the author to inject some drama into the story turns out to be a case of beating around the bush more and more intensely each time. The secondary characters, who appear out of nowhere and disappear to nowhere, and, unlike the main characters, they are not only unmotivated, but also unremembered. What was the name of Sayuri\'s friend, anyone remember?I commend Mirai Minato and Misuzu Hoshino for the fresh breath of adaptation, but the animation and music are worthy of praise. The ""Namaramenkoi Gyaru"" endings are energetic and moving, if the adaptation had been more successful these dances could have really blown up TikTok like the dances from the Wotaku endings. The ""Wayawayawa-!"" ending shows each of the three heroines in turn, looking at the audience as if breaking through a fourth wall.After watching this show I decided to compare it to the manga so that I wouldn\'t be disappointed in the directing of the adaptation, and my verdict is that Mirai and Misuzu did a great job, but their work has a weak source material. I think Kai Ikada better start writing ecchi where it\'s not the size of the heart that matters, but what\'s on the ""top of the heart"".

In the first scene we meet one of our thighious ""mcs"" Fuyuki Minami rendered to tantalizing perfection behind a snowy Hokkaido back drop. The anime takes a moment to pan out to show the gorgeously animated scenery of the snow, further emphasising the frigid nature of the area. The first conversation between our mcs is more than anything natural, to a certain degree that is, no overly used tropes of ""bumping into each other we fall in love"" nonsense. You might\'ve notice that I\'m not giving as much love to our boy Shiki Tsubasa, well its simple, he don\'t deserve it. Ion know what I\'m supposed to say about him, he\'s there I guess, honestly that\'s the best review I can give him, at its core this anime is driven by thighs (the gals in the show), blood is just there for the ride, hell he\'s lucky I didn\'t self insert and replace him with something else already bcoz he\'s just that forgettable. Ayt that is a bit too hash, Shiki does what any typical mc in his position does, he simps... blushes when he has too, apologises way too loudly, and produces enough boners to built a bridge.On a more critical take, the romance is what you expect it to be, bubbly, wholesome with a tinge or more of degeneracy, the character dynamics needs to be studied, they got it right, there is an oddly satisfying fluidity to the characters, they feel like their own individual persons. We\'ve already met our resident yandere gyaru Fuyuki, next we get introduced to our \'mild not committed to the tsundere act\'Akino Sayuri, with her tired overly used architype of I hate the happy out going girl in class but oh wait she helped me so I don\'t hate her lets be friends yey. She\'s got great chemistry with our boy Shiki, although she totally gave him the cold shoulder when they first met. It goes without saying Akino possesses lascivious thighs much like Fuyuki, but with her character I feel like its a skit I\'ve seen before, maybe I\'ll get to like her as the series goes on but at the moment ummo stick with Fuyuki as my best gyaru. So its two gyals down and one to go, honestly I\'m kinda interested in seeing what the third one be like. One more thing I don\'t know if I\'m the only one that thought the booger scene in the first ep was disgusting, I mean who was that animated for? lets ignore our resident ""simp-son"" Shiki thinking that was kawaii for a second, I mean Jesus there is so many things they could\'ve done with that character at that particular time that would\'ve gotten me like ""oh thats cute"", but nah they just had to show Fuyuki with a fist full of boogers, ain\'t no way you convincing me thats kawaii, Japanese fetishes are getting out of hand.The production team did a decent job bringing this anime to life, there\'s always going to be nitpicks but at the end of the day they are exactly that, nitpicks. I think the anime looks great, the voice acting is alright, the music and sound do a great job of capturing the scene and mood perfectly. I could give an in-depth review of the nuances of what makes this anime a great watch but ain\'t nobody will enjoy a corporate like breakdown of a fictional character\'s thighs, so ya\'ll gonna have to settle for this, I know this might end up being cryptic for some of ya\'ll coz I be trolling too much, but hear me out I\'ll summarize.Should you watch this or not? to that I say if you ever paused an anime scene with thighs on the screen tf you waiting for join us, and if you here for a harem romcom then you won\'t go wrong with this one.Confession: Ayt ummo let the cat out of the bag, I been lying to ya\'ll and ummo come clean...Hokaidian and thighious are not real words.RECS:""Tedama Ni Toritai Kurokiya-San""""Dress Up Darling"" anime are something to behold.""Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi"" starts off with a phenomenal mood setting, the staging and overall vibe caught me off guard, the animatIon is pristine.

Join me, dear reader, as we delve into the initial impressions of this series:At the onset, I couldn't help but draw parallels to similar narratives like You Were Experienced, I Was Not: Our Dating Story. A chance encounter between a random, yet seemingly picturesque, anime girl and our protagonist sets the stage for potential romantic exploits. However, the journey thus far has unfolded at a languid pace, taking three episodes to introduce a new character—a potential love interest, perhaps?In terms of aesthetics, the artistry is adequate,...albeit unremarkable. The storyline, unfortunately, falls prey to a sense of despondency, lacking depth and substance. The characters, mere shells with no semblance of backstory, leave much to be desired, compelling me to idly await signs of growth and development.As with any narrative, there lies the hope that what initially appears bleak may yet blossom into something of substance. Reflecting on past experiences, where initial skepticism metamorphosed into genuine appreciation, I hold onto the prospect that Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi may follow suit.For those with an undying penchant for romantic endeavors and time to spare, I extend an invitation to embark upon this journey. However, for the discerning viewer seeking polished narratives, it may be prudent to await the completion of the series and peruse the reviews. As of yet, my recommendation remains hesitant, awaiting the emergence of its latent potential.UPDATE: Having traversed the entirety of this anime, my verdict remains unchanged. While it had its moments of brilliance, the characters remained underdeveloped, and the conclusion felt lacking in closure. Despite the fleeting joys it offered, the lack of depth left me yearning for more. 5 out of 10, a score that speaks to its potential yet unfulfilled. albeit unremarkable.

Only sore spot IS the MC being clumsy to the Max.', 'Dosanko Gal is a cozy anime, it\'s filled with feel good vibes, a few ecchi moments ( very soft ones ), a bunch of lovable characters, and everyone is being kind towards each other etc...I think it\'s worth your time if you are looking for a light hearted harem/romcom show.I\'ll describe the positives and negatives of this anime without spoiling anything.The positives :+ While the story isn\'t original at all, we can still praise it for the many wholesome moments it has, there\'s a big ""happy"" atmosphere in this anime it\'s enjoyable to watch good things happening to the characters, they...help each other to overcome the few issues they can face etc...+ The character designs are pretty good, and the other female main characters actually have better designs than the blonde gyaru, even her mom looks better/is more original+ Along with the chara designs, there are a few details here and there that enhance the visual aspects of this anime ( the colors are nice aswell ), and this whole Hokkaido setting is a good excuse to depict wintery scenes, which we don\'t see that often. However...The negatives :- Regarding the technical aspect of the animation, I don\'t think the show really shines in that regard. There are many occurences where the main characters are the only things moving in the whole picture/landscape ( even when there are other passerbies in the scene ) and I know it\'s probably because the anime didn\'t have a big budget, but I think it\'s frequent enough to write it as a con.- The male MC Tsubasa isn\'t the worst type of mc we can find in harems, but he does have a few traits of the loser/virgin archetype where he\'ll blush over nothing, overreact etc... It\'s a shame because on the other hand, this MC manages to have his moments in some episodes, he could have been a better character without those stereotypes.All in all, Dosanko Gal was a pleasant experience and I think it will please every harem/romcom enjoyer out there. While the story isn\'t original ( it\'s rarely the case in harems ), the cast of characters make up for it and you\'ll be eager to follow their adventures. The story made the right call by going for the cute/wholesome vibe, and there isn\'t any real cringe scenes. However, don\'t get your expectations too high because it does suffer from common problems found in those seasonal harem/romcoms such as poor animation at times ( despite having nice visuals and colors overall ) and the male MC could have been written better because he has too many clichés that are uninspired and make him less interesting. help each other to overcome the few issues they can face etc...+ The character designs are pretty good, and the other female main characters actually have better designs than the blonde gyaru, even her mom looks better/is more original+ Along with the chara designs, there are a few details here and there that enhance the visual aspects of this anime ( the colors are nice aswell ), and this whole Hokkaido setting is a good excuse to depict wintery scenes, which we don\'t see that often.

The main two girls really did carry this show (along with Fuyuki's mother gaw damn), they were always such fun in basically every scene and I really liked getting to learn more about them. However as is the usual issue with shows like this the main character really did hold back a lot of my enjoyment, I really don't understand why so...many anime are led by essentially a blank slate of a character who does the absolute bare minimum and almost doesn't even seem to think for themselves meanwhile they're surrounded by legitimately interesting characters who are well-written and fun. Like you've proven you can write good characters why isn't your protagonist one? Idk it really irks me because so much more could have happened throughout this but if you look back at it there was barely any development since the first episode we meet each character which is why I'm very glad the girls were as good as they were. There was really a lot of room for certain scenes to go certain ways or just for things to actually like happen but they never really did which did start annoying me a bit towards the end unfortunately. I did really like the art in this show though, it was all very pretty and colourful and I thought the designs of the main girls were really cool too I loved a lot of the outfits and whatnot.Overall this was a fun watch just don't go into it expecting a masterpiece, the girls really did carry but they remained fun to watch from start to finish and that's really all you need from this show so I'd recommend for an easy watch! many anime are led by essentially a blank slate of a character who does the absolute bare minimum and almost doesn't even seem to think for themselves meanwhile they're surrounded by legitimately interesting characters who are well-written and fun.

This goes on for a few episodes and you expect a decent anime where they fairly quickly will finally be together as a couple. However this is dashed by the introduction of Akino who pretty much falls for Shiki right away as well. But that is not even remotely the entire story as then Shiki's grandmother pokes her meddling...into Shiki's business and that followed by Natsukawa who also for some reason falls for Shiki instantly.This means you have 3 girls falling for Shiki right away and a grandmother who is unable to grasp what it's like to be young.

Not yet used to the frigid weather that Hokkaido commands in the middle of winter, he meets a random girl, Minami Fuyuki, at a bus stop.  It\'s there that they start up a conversation and before very long, we figure out that they are not only classmates, but live within close proximity to each other.  Tsubasa, who is clearly not used to Hokkaido\'s citizens, is clearly shocked by what he has learned from Minami, and before long, they...go on various adventures together.Tsubasa is pretty unremarkable in my mind, as he doesn\'t really offer much but his over-the-top reactions to just about anything related to Minami\'s bubbly attitude.  Although this technically isn\'t a harem anime, Tsubasa comes off as such, including his tendency to not be able to read the room very well.  It\'s not all the time, but it can get old when it happens as much as it does.  Minami\'s amazed by Tsubasa\'s lack of knowledge on just about anything.  If she\'s outgoing, than he\'s sheltered.  This works well because we get to experience the different settings with both of them, even if not all of them are winners.  At the same time, there was an episode, which was easily the strongest, where Minami breaks down, and it goes to show that even the most bubbly of characters show signs of being defeated, even when they seem unfazed by anything.Sayuri joins our cast a few episodes in, and is probably the best character in the series.  As a fellow introvert, I love that she doesn\'t shy away from her interests, even if they\'re not popular.  Yes, she\'s a gamer, and wishes to talk about it more with others.  She\'s young enough that there\'s room to grow outside her shell, and you can tell that she took some serious steps in doing as the series progresses.  Nothing quite as shocking as per experience on the bus pops up again, but there\'s no real steps backwards.  Rena is present for a few episodes at the end, but I didn\'t love how she was integrated into the plot.  She\'s the super popular and smart girl and there\'s not too much to it.  There could be - you can tell - but I feel like they didn\'t explore it enough.The biggest strength of this series comes off of the short segments that between Tsubasa and the three girls as they grow.  Even if Tsubasa doesn\'t really push the story along and contribute to them growing a whole lot, the others clearly get more confident while being around him.  And that\'s how you do your character development.  Again, Sayuri does this the best, and even if Minami is the obvious main attraction to this series, Sayuri should see more screen time.Some side characters push the plot along with differing results.  For example, Tsubasa\'s grandmother is in a few episodes, and her harsh attitude might have been a bit much for many.  However, what that resulted in was Tsubasa being out of the picture in certain moments, and you could tell that this really takes away from how Minami and Sayuri feel when he\'s not around.  This was an excellent way to portray it, even if it makes the grandmother more unlikable.  Takayumi, another classmates of Tsuabasa, also has some minor moments in a few episodes too.One of the series\' biggest weaknesses is its failure to really fit into the genre that it feels like it fits into.  For a romantic comedy, I don\'t really feel like it filled either of these genres very well.  There were signs of possible romance and the series wasn\'t all that funny for any amount of time.  While this in itself isn\'t too bad, this makes the series feel like it can get way too comfortable doing the usual ""I\'m on an adventure"" a little too often.  This, coupled with a relatively weak main character in Tsubasa, doesn\'t make a great match.  Additionally, I didn\'t love the ending.  This was probably one of a few shock-worthy moments that turned into nothing and a weird way to leave a series that may or may not continue.  (Story: 7/10, Characters: 6/10)Art: Animation gets a pretty comfortable pass, with the series not really requiring much in the way of pretty graphics due to the lack of big moments.  There were still a few, and they were done well.  The series kind of implies some serious fan service, but keeps them to a minimum, despite our main lady being a little more comfortable than she probably should be at times.  (7/10)Sound: No real complaints about the sounds of the series.  OP kind of brings the energy that Minami matches, with the ED not far behind.  Voice work was solid all around.  Matt Shipman\'s (Tsubasa) biggest strength is probably his goofy characters and he brings that on strong here.  Accents are generally hit or miss in VO work but the ones found here are decent enough.  I\'ll never get used to it because of consistency issues, but it was fine.  I\'m not sure where Mikaela Krantz (Minami) has been in the last few years of dubbing, but she was strong here, with a Canadian (or some people were pointing out, Minnesotan) accent that seemed strong.  I haven\'t heard her work since Wonder Egg Priority and this is obviously no where near that.  Brittany Lauda (Sayuri) and Jill Harris (Rena) round our strong main cast.  (8/10)Overall: Hokkaido Gals Are Super Adorable! does some things well, while others things certainly are found lacking.  With the flood of rom-com series these days, I always look for certain things that stick out to me, and there certainly are some to be found here.  But did it do enough to garner a wide audience viewership?  Maybe not, but it was still a fine watch.  This would certainly be a solid pick for anyone looking for school-aged characters in mostly non-school settings, going about their daily lives.

(7/10)', ""This series leaves alot to be desired narratively but is stylistically a refreshing treat to the eyes. It will absolutely need a second season to make the narrative better.While it's true that some of the romcom elements and tropes are a bit common, the setting of Hokkaido provides a certain level of uniqueness to them. It's also nice to see that despite the female MC being incredibly busty, we don't see an overuse of tropes playing onto this. Especially when it comes to bounce physics. It's a respectful (for an anime anyways) amount of chest related tropes.The greatest boon to this series is the incredibly...distinct eye stylization, especially with the girls eyes. The last time I saw eye shinies and blooms so incredibly different was Harukana Recieve, so if you've watched that and liked it for the eyes, watch this for the same.Other visual treats in this series includes the obvious nods to IRL Hokkaido and Kitami locations, and any natural scenes (snow, flowe gardens, etc) are done very well.The supporting cast of characters come off someone one dimensionally, but for a series where we're supposed to be focusing on the two MCs, that's to be expected.The biggest falling short point for this series is simply that it's only 12 episodes long. Far too little time to explore the narrative and it's supporting cast as it's unfolded to the viewer. As an unfortunate result as well the ending is somewhat unsatisfying. If you're a viewer who absolutely must have a satisfying ending, you may want to skip this anime until it gets another season. distinct eye stylization, especially with the girls eyes.

While the opening and ending may suggest it's just another typical harem series, it's a well-balanced blend of romance and slice-of-life elements. The characters genuinely feel like friends when they hang out, and the female lead isn't just a token for male fantasy fulfillment. Although it serves as a promotional project for Hokkaido, the storytelling effectively highlights the region's best features. Furthermore, the show doesn't shy away from portraying the challenges of living in such a cold area.

It takes place in Hokkaido and all the characters are gyaru. Does it really do anything new? No. If you’ve seen one of these, you’ve seen them all. That said, it is entertaining at times and 2/3 girls are really good.If it were 5 years ago before I watched every seasonal every season, I’d probably rate Dosanko Gal higher and would have liked it more. Having seen so many of these types of shows now and in such recent seasons, it’s...just hard to see how this separates itself from say, last season’s Kimizero. The MC steps off a bus and literally already has one of the hottest girls you can imagine come up to him and start simping. Within 3 episodes she’s in love and it’s just so convenient and perfect in the most boring way. Yea, the female lead is cute don’t get me wrong, but it’s hard to get emotionally invested in she and the MC’s inevitable relationship because of how contrived it feels.The other girls similarly fall in love with basically just by virtue of him existing. It’s a clear male wish fulfilment series and don’t get me wrong, I get the appeal of it. I love those myself, but I just felt this one was lacking the writing to make it engaging. 100kano and Megami terrace come to mind as examples of recent stories with harems that flesh out the characters and their motivations, and make the potential ships satisfying.Now, whether or not this show will be enjoyable will largely depend on how many recent seasonal romcoms you’ve seen, your tolerance for some usual romance cringe and also your feelings towards the girls. I think Sayuri and Fuyuki are really cute, but the third girl who was introduced at the end felt so undercooked. I’m sure she gets more fleshed out in the manga, but what we got here didn’t impress me much. As with most of these types of shows, the waifus are the best part and much more interesting than the MC. I was definitely more excited to get Sayuri and Fuyuki bonding moments than the MC and one of the girls. He just comes off as a cardboard cutout.The other big thing with this one is it’s one of the few series that takes place in Hokkaido and plays heavily into regional education and tourism promotion. Every episode feels like an ad for Hokkaido and I have no issue with that at all. Hokkaido is a beautiful place, second best in Japan after Kyūshu, and there’s not a lot of anime content with this setting. I enjoyed learning about Hokkaido food, traditions and regionalisms a lot. I actually think that was my favourite part of this anime along with Sayuri. So if you’re someone who’s into Japanese culture or just wants to learn about a new place, you can get some good info here.Overall Dosanko Gal is an ok anime. It’s not bad or horrible, I did enjoy watching it for the most part and I can understand why some people would hype and love it. It does have some cute girls and moments, but it just feels more of the same to me. Other than the Hokkaido setting, this could be 20 other anime. Yea, the all gyaru setting is nice, but I need a little more than that at this point. It was just too hard for me to take this show seriously at points.Dosanko Gal gets 6 out of 10. just hard to see how this separates itself from say, last season’s Kimizero. The MC steps off a bus and literally already has one of the hottest girls you can imagine come up to him and start simping. Within 3 episodes she’s in love and it’s just so convenient and perfect in the most boring way. Yea, the female lead is cute don’t get me wrong, but it’s hard to get emotionally invested in she and the MC’s inevitable relationship because of how contrived it feels.The other girls similarly fall in love with basically just by virtue of him existing. It’s a clear male wish fulfilment series and don’t get me wrong, I get the appeal of it. I love those myself, but I just felt this one was lacking the writing to make it engaging. 100kano and Megami terrace come to mind as examples of recent stories with harems that flesh out the characters and their motivations, and make the potential ships satisfying.Now, whether or not this show will be enjoyable will largely depend on how many recent seasonal romcoms you’ve seen, your tolerance for some usual romance cringe and also your feelings towards the girls. I think Sayuri and Fuyuki are really cute, but the third girl who was introduced at the end felt so undercooked. I’m sure she gets more fleshed out in the manga, but what we got here didn’t impress me much. As with most of these types of shows, the waifus are the best part and much more interesting than the MC. I was definitely more excited to get Sayuri and Fuyuki bonding moments than the MC and one of the girls. He just comes off as a cardboard cutout.The other big thing with this one is it’s one of the few series that takes place in Hokkaido and plays heavily into regional education and tourism promotion. Every episode feels like an ad for Hokkaido and I have no issue with that at all. Hokkaido is a beautiful place, second best in Japan after Kyūshu, and there’s not a lot of anime content with this setting. I enjoyed learning about Hokkaido food, traditions and regionalisms a lot. I actually think that was my favourite part of this anime along with Sayuri. So if you’re someone who’s into Japanese culture or just wants to learn about a new place, you can get some good info here.Overall Dosanko Gal is an ok anime. It’s not bad or horrible, I did enjoy watching it for the most part and I can understand why some people would hype and love it. It does have some cute girls and moments, but it just feels more of the same to me. Other than the Hokkaido setting, this could be 20 other anime. Yea, the all gyaru setting is nice, but I need a little more than that at this point. It was just too hard for me to take this show seriously at points.Dosanko Gal gets 6 out of 10.', '""Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi"" is a typical example of a generic romance anime. While it has some nice touches, like being set in Hokkaido, it sticks to a lot of clichés that make it a bit boring at times. The only real highlights are the three ""Gals"", who are great characters. On the other hand, the main character is just a typical rom-com cliché, blushing and flailing over the same things repeatedly.As someone who enjoys Slice of Life, I found myself pretty bored at various points. Towards the end of the season, things finally got interesting, and I felt like it was worth sticking...with it, but the ending was a letdown. In the end, even if you like romance, I wouldn\'t recommend it. with it, but the ending was a letdown. In the end, even if you like romance, I wouldn\'t recommend it.', ""A very average comedy about these 3 girls and 1 boy with the personality that we have seen thousands of times in other sometimes better shows and sometimes worst, there is nothing special here, the animation and the cold in Hokkaido of course its beautiful but overall these 3 Fuyuki, Sayuri and Natsukawa are just annoying af, and the boy who I don't remember the name it's just a boring protagonist made so virgens can relateThe first 6 episodes are better than the other half because in those 6 first episodes you are not yet tired of these bad written characters ok and that's not...a good thing, very bland anime 6/10. a good thing, very bland anime 6/10."", 'Collection of short episode-reviews with my immediate impressions[6] Effective ecchi comedy, i just wish they were a little older and that it could include more friendships w all genders for both of them.

It’s more likely than you’d think! Flashback, it’s 1904 and Hokkaido is the closest tangible land mass to repel a potential Russian attack due to foreign provocation. Fast forward 120 years and the same fear is spreading all throughout the region. Should Japan decide to occupy Sakhalin once again or there be another Russo-Japanese war, Hokkaido would be at the forefront. It’s no secret that Japan’s most northern island is rather sparsely populated by their standards and declining steadily due to their natural population cycle. In order to feed the potential war machine, the government must utilize what they...think “the kids” like, and therefore Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi was born.Anime is no stranger to tourism based on real locations in their shows. This was famously noted in multiple PA Works shows and in the hit military propaganda show, Girls und Panzer. Dosanko Gal is just the latest addition in a long line of location-based shows. When it comes to execution, this is nothing compared to say, Sakura Quest, in terms of attracting people to a geographical location. The stereotypical snow filled background is in the same vein as South Park stereotyping Colorado as a snowy location. However, due to the 2023 crisis-du-jour, Global Boiling, neither Hokkaido nor Colorado have been the snowscapes they once were. This is just the first chapter in unrealistic expectations and why Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi is a poor propaganda piece.In terms of characters, developing them, and overall realistic expectations, Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi once again falls short. By local country girl standards and idealization, it misses its mark. The gyaru fad seems to be gaining popularity again, due to Gen Z having a strong desire to emulate Y2K Millennial culture. While this may be something expected in a chic area in a first-tier urban area, it seems off in a more rural based setting. This also leads one to question the “draw” of such a character in this region. If the goal of the anime is to attract people to Hokkaido, wouldn’t it be more of a draw to feature a culture that is different from what is seen locally in the high cost of living cities? Is having TikTok dances and other city-slicker type cultural statements truly appropriate? I think not. For a government funded propaganda piece, this comes across as a failure of communication. Time and time again, it is proven that people move to less developed areas to escape the rat race, embrace wholesome values, or just to start their own cult. These are the topics that should have been brought up, not hyper-consumerism, TikTok, and mobile gambling games.Artistically speaking, Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi, is overall average to mediocre. There is nothing spectacular, nor is it offensive. This inoffensive artistic vision truly shows the government backing of this anime. Boring, expected, plain, and bureaucratic. All are adjectives that can describe Dosanko Gal. Likewise, voice acting and music are also typical of what you would expect. Nothing outstanding one way or another, but leaning more towards the mediocre side. If this was the anime industry’s quiet-quitting product, I would not be surprised.Overall, Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi is an anime plagued with mediocrity and mixed messages. On one hand it adds a much-needed spice of fanservice that has been sorely lacking in recent years due to the westernization of anime and their prudish values being enforced upon the artform. While on the other hand, it does not push any envelopes nor does it encourage any sort of deeper thought into the clear reason for the creation of the show. If this is truly a government propaganda piece, it does seem fitting considering how poorly it is executed. Much like the overall sluggish and hesitated response to world problems due to our ever-increasing connectivity and fear of economic issues among the proletariat class, Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi does fit in well with a unified world response. Does this show work on recruiting the remaining youth to the countryside? Absolutely not. Does this inspire anyone to move to Hokkaido to help create the northern bulwark? I doubt it. Is this as effective as modern day military recruiting? Absolutely. Dosanko Gal wa Namara Menkoi is just mediocre lip service, which truly makes it an appropriate show for 2024’s global situation.

Hokkaido Gals had a lot of potential, with a change of setting from where most of school anime are set in, which it ruined with its annoying MC and lack of plot.The story was a classic boy meets girl, that’s not bad in itself but it wasn’t done well. We never get an explanation as to why Shiki (the main character) moved from Tokyo to Hokkaido, and moving prefectures doesn’t sound like something you just do for no reason, right?Aside...from that, there literally no plot other than the characters going about their daily life, which can be enjoyable, SO many anime made it enjoyable with comedy or moe moments or literally anything else, and as far as I remember, there was not much of that in Hokkaido Gals, and the jokes never hit (were there even any jokes??)And the romance feels really forced, and makes no sense.As for the characters, the one character who’s in all of the frames, the main character Shiki, is insufferable. I’m okay with bland MCs, or MCs who lack social skills, I’ve watched a lot of slice of life like that. But usually, the MC has at least one special thing about him (Gojo from MDUD is good at sewing and has a backstory, hell even R-A-G’s MC had more character than Shiki and was more likeable). Shiki’s just there. No backstory, no goals, they try to sell us this image of him doing his best all the time or something but it never really hits, because there’s a pretty girl always by his side ever since he came to Hokkaido, and doing your best when a pretty girl’s cheering you on the whole time is pretty easy.Fuyuki, the main love interest and the first girl he met in Hokkaido, surprisingly isn’t just a pretty face, and probably the best character in this series. She has some character development too, but i felt like her breasts being half visible the whole time was really weird and ruined her character design.The rest of the characters don’t have much to speak of, but they have their own hobbies and interests and some character development, so they’re not as bad as Shiki, I guess as long as you can tolerate Shiki you’ll be fine.Hokkaido Gal’s art was very nice, the characters looked good, and the scenery too. But aside from that, it wasn’t very enjoyable. Like I mentioned earlier, there was barely any humor, and if there was I missed it because of how unfunny it was. There aren’t any moments that have you at the edge of your seat and everything’s predictable in a bad way.There’s just a lot of better ways to waste your time than this anime. from that, there literally no plot other than the characters going about their daily life, which can be enjoyable, SO many anime made it enjoyable with comedy or moe moments or literally anything else, and as far as I remember, there was not much of that in Hokkaido Gals, and the jokes never hit (were there even any jokes??)And the romance feels really forced, and makes no sense.As for the characters, the one character who’s in all of the frames, the main character Shiki, is insufferable.

What's worse is that the girl wants to follow MC everywhere, to be honest it's very annoying to see.Moreover, other Gal will join in the third episode.The MC himself, or the male character, is very unsightly, starting from the facial design and messy hair, Moreover, the reaction is quite annoying,...when something happens between MC and Gal, MC will definitely show a disgusting reaction.For the background, it is also in winter conditions, so every incident is definitely only related to winter, there is nothing else interesting, apart from what I've often seen in other anime about events in winter. when something happens between MC and Gal, MC will definitely show a disgusting reaction.For the background, it is also in winter conditions, so every incident is definitely only related to winter, there is nothing else interesting, apart from what I've often seen in other anime about events in winter.""]"

"Dragon Ball Z Movie 15: Fukkatsu no ""F""",https://myanimelist.net/anime/25389/Dragon_Ball_Z_Movie_15__Fukkatsu_no_F,"[""Dragon ball Z movie 15 Fukkatsu no F or Resurrection of Friezaseems to go canon with movie 14 Battle of Gods.Some time has passed since the events of The God of destruction Beerus alongside Whis were introduced as brand new characters from the previous movie that takes place after the Majin Buu Arc within the Dragon ball Z series, Along with the revamped Dragon ball Kai 2014 finishing off as well as an announcement of a new Series dawning upon us right after that,There have certainly been a lot of new content going on in and out of the franchise lately.Story/Plot - 5So I'll...do my best not to spoil anyone here at this point who have not seen this but as you can tell the title tells you most of the premise in a basic nutshell.Remnants of frieza's empire are monitoring earth for the dragon balls with some special assistance as they finally succeed in reviving frieza.Frieza fueling with even greater animosity for the saiyans than before decides to for the very first time in his life train himself to ascend into a more powerful state than ever before without even worrying about how far above others are in terms of power compare to his own so that he can exact his vengeance on Goku and others.From other previous dragon ball films It sounds like a familiar theme that has existed many times with that sort of premise don't you think?you would be right, A typical formula with a very familiar structure, but does it make the film entertaining and worth seeing? short answer yes.Now I can see why some Dragonball fans might not be as enthralled about frieza being the main villain of this movie and expected a different villain or possibly a new story/scenario at this point in time after Battle Of Gods is totally understandable.But to me if you look at it in this way, A revenge movie for frieza prior to him having a major impact in the series itself does make sense since he has ties to major characters within the story such as Vegeta, Beerus, Gohan, Goku, Piccolo and others along with major events that took place in the dragonball Z itself which after all, were some of the most well done moments in the show.Once again now, that previous threat from the series has returned in full circle which is cool in terms of the villain's reputation since frieza I feel is the best antagonist in the entire show hands down and one of the most iconic villains in the anime world in general.Love him or hate him you can't deny from the series how much of a crazy, menacing son of a gun he can be. Plus none of that ''This planet is going to explode in 5 minutes'' nonsense either in this.A couple of things that did bother me and questioned about were the training segments in the film on how the training segments was presented within the duration of time that the movie had and how frieza could even attain such power to be almost on par on goku's level of power prior to them facing each other from over the course of 10 years ago from now within this film and then within the space of 4 months frieza somehow surpasses some of the strongest characters including android 18, Cell, Majin Buu, Gohan etc, etc?? I'm sorry but to me that felt like pure BS.I must also point out that other characters were left out from the film which also did threw me off when watching.While watching how characters in the film are introduced into the story it sometimes did feel a little unnatural when its rushing through scenes into some brief interactions along with some reminders of the series while having this encompassing the film for the first third of it led this into being quite slow in place to start off just to get towards the big moments in the movie which a lot of people just mostly want to see.Maybe its because I'm watching the Japanese theatrical version of this since I did watched the movie premiere in theatres which makes me also interested as to how the extended version of this movie will flush out more stuff than this version.I do feel its structure with the characters though to be quite questionable and it might also hinder some viewers who do want a better understanding and possibly something of a better build up to its source material into this from the previous film. basically what I mean is how the film starts out and for the most part the story plays a lot of stuff more safer like the other films in this franchise but as a fan it didn't bother me that much.Art/Animation - 9.5There is no doubt for me as a fan, that this animation is some of the most impressive that I've seen out all of the dragon ball movies in general and no I'm not kidding. It steps up way more than even the likes of battle of gods in terms of art and animation as its shown at better angles with more of an enhanced flow in the action department which looks excellent from an animation standpoint. though I will admit the cgi is pretty noticeable and does seem a little stiff in this however this didn't detract from how excellent the animation looks. No doubt Best looking Dragonball film to date.Also Loved the action segments in this, They were awesome in this film!!Sound/Voice - 8The soundtracks are pretty good especially Freeza by Maximum The Hormone it really Kicks Ass!! No surprise if you've heard their other hardcore soundtracks from their albums or even in other animes such as Death Note which to me their theme of friezadoes fits frieza's demeanour In general for this movie.Momoiro Clover Z ending theme personally didn't suit this movie ending what so ever. If only they could just stick to sailor moon's music and stay far, far away from dragon ball related stuff.Apart from them, the music and the voice acting was really superb.The Dub performance is as perfect as it will be. My only nitpick with the dub if I'm being honest was mainly just Frieza mentioning in excitement of how he could reach a power level over 1.3 million which to me did not make a lot of sense But overall Its a fantastic dub as to be expected.Character - 6.5Now of course this movie doesn't just showcase Frieza's malicious and usual arrogance as the villain that he is at times but it also displays the progression of Goku and Vegeta actually training for the first time alongside one another which was quite a surprise to me and Its great since there rivalry is so damn popular.The characters in this have great interactions among the cast with great standout scenes with Bulma, Krillin, Master Roshi, Gohan and Piccolo being shown to what they are have been up to since the last movie and from that also includes newly added character Jaco from akira Toriyama's Manga Jaco The Galactic patrolman in the film never seen before in the show, Its Like a calm before the storm until frieza and his entire army appear to get ready for an all out war with the earth at stake, No surprise yet again.I kinda wish certain characters who were absent in this movie were in this just like battle of gods which had a full house cast of the characters from the show, To me they would of played a much more deserve role for this to give more creative routes and moments towards this movie.I would like to elaborate much more on the characters but again It will go into spoiler territory from here on in so again I'll allow you to find that out for yourself since it is that typical shonen formula of Good Vs Evil.A negative though that I must mention is the ending which felt quite brief in closing with the characters which could of been done better in my opinion especially on Vegeta's behalf.Enjoyment - 8It certainly was entertaining and for fans who enjoy the franchise in general no matter how long its been, In my opinion I certainly feel it was a fun movie and I will say its worth a watch to check out that Dbz nostalgia here and there.Its better also since the action scenes kicked a lot of ass with the Z-fighters. Also seeing the premiere of this made watching this even more memorable. Still I can't believe this franchise has been around for over 30 years now and honestly this made me remember some parts of the series again while watching this movie in a fond positive type of way, which is something quite special.Overall - 7I had my doubts about this movie beforehand and I knew I just wanted to see this for the fun of it and I'm so glad I did because it really was.I enjoyed it very much as a fan. of course your going to get some people bashing this movie from their own critical standpoint but I know all too well its like this on MAL with a lot of popular animes so its no surprise, so with all that being said my overall score for this movie is 7/10. do my best not to spoil anyone here at this point who have not seen this but as you can tell the title tells you most of the premise in a basic nutshell.Remnants of frieza's empire are monitoring earth for the dragon balls with some special assistance as they finally succeed in reviving frieza.Frieza fueling with even greater animosity for the saiyans than before decides to for the very first time in his life train himself to ascend into a more powerful state than ever before without even worrying about how far above others are in terms of power compare to his own so that he can exact his vengeance on Goku and others.From other previous dragon ball films It sounds like a familiar theme that has existed many times with that sort of premise don't you think?you would be right, A typical formula with a very familiar structure, but does it make the film entertaining and worth seeing? short answer yes.Now I can see why some Dragonball fans might not be as enthralled about frieza being the main villain of this movie and expected a different villain or possibly a new story/scenario at this point in time after Battle Of Gods is totally understandable.But to me if you look at it in this way, A revenge movie for frieza prior to him having a major impact in the series itself does make sense since he has ties to major characters within the story such as Vegeta, Beerus, Gohan, Goku, Piccolo and others along with major events that took place in the dragonball Z itself which after all, were some of the most well done moments in the show.Once again now, that previous threat from the series has returned in full circle which is cool in terms of the villain's reputation since frieza I feel is the best antagonist in the entire show hands down and one of the most iconic villains in the anime world in general.Love him or hate him you can't deny from the series how much of a crazy, menacing son of a gun he can be.

Still I can't believe this franchise has been around for over 30 years now and honestly this made me remember some parts of the series again while watching this movie in a fond positive type of way, which is something quite special.Overall - 7I had my doubts about this movie beforehand and I knew I just wanted to see this for the fun of it and I'm so glad I did because it really was.I enjoyed it very much as a fan. of course your going to get some people bashing this movie from their own critical standpoint but I know all too well its like this on MAL with a lot of popular animes so its no surprise, so with all that being said my overall score for this movie is 7/10."", 'Dragon Ball Z Movie 15: Fukkatsu no F Review (Dub BTW)Story (7/10) GoodThe story for Fukkastu No F is good not very good just got IT\'S DRAGONBALL PEOPLE one of the main reason majority of people watch Dragonball is not really for the story so when you hear what the plot is for Fukkatsu No F you shouldn\'t be surprised that it\'s straight forward. Frieza is revived by the Dragonballs, he invades earth they fight him simple. It is what it is and I think at best it\'s good I didn\'t have an issue with he because it\'s not what I watch Dragonball for it\'s...not bad so that\'s all that really matters to me if it was you would see something less then what this website considers a 7.Art and Animation (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.75/10) Good+The art I thought was very good it\'s Toei if Toei knows how to do anything it\'s right it\'s making something look good. This section is call ART so I wouldn\'t be talking about animation too much. But as far as CG is concerned it look OK, I noticed it from time to time like when Frieza\'s troops start to fly at the Z warriors or when Frieza at certain parts during the main fight and it didn\'t necessarily bother me, now could we have done without them? YES! But is it something to complain about? NO (At least not to me). To the unkeen eye in the Theater (which is where I watched it) I bet 50% of the people didn\'t even notice it, which is why I say it\'s nothing to complain about, it\'s here so deal with it, doesn\'t ruin my experience.Sound (9/10) GreatGranted I watched this in the Theater in English Dubbed so this counts for sound to me. Now all of the sound effects sound great, this is a category that\'s hard to mess up so a 9 sounds reasonable to me. The English voice actors were amazing at their lines they me it sound great. Especially Sean Schemmel which is always good but I when I certain a certain groan noise in pain for Goku in the scene when Frieza is stomping on Goku\'s wound when he was on the floor that solidified it for me that he\'s not only still good at doing Goku\'s voice but he\'s gotten even better. All the other voice actors are great also the voice they chose for Jako was pretty good also, it took sometime to get used to but once I did it fits him (I hope they don\'t change it).Character (8/10)More Specifically (8.50/10) Very Good+All my favorite DBZ characters are back (not in their prime sure.. Gohan) but back nonetheless! And seeing all of them is why I enjoy this anime and movie because everyone acted exactly how I remembered nothing has changed and that\'s perfect for me. Jako the new character introduced in the movie ""in my opinion"" stole the show he was outstandingly entertaining and unique. I\'ve read all the chapters of his manga a couple months back so I have knowledge of him going into this movie. So to see that his personality moved over to the big screen is great because I think he\'s a great addition to the group and I hope (we most likely will) we see more of him after the Fukkastu No F Arc in DBS.Enjoyment (9/10) GreatThe best thing as far as enjoyment to this movie in my opinion is the pacing. In comparison to Battle of Gods (which took just a little too long to get to the fight which is what majority of people watch Dragonnball Z for) Fukkatsu No F didn\'t jump straight into the fight but it kept it a length that didn\'t have me saying ""Ok I get it can we get to the fights now?"". Granted I enjoyed all of the dubbed Diolague in Dragon Ball. Filler or not filler, even in the anime, even in Battle of Gods I enjoyed it all because I love the characters of Dragonball so interaction between characters in Dragonball is enjoyment enough for me. And as if there\'s anything both Battle of Gods and Fukkastu no F did right is the comedy. Dragonball, Dragonball Z and even GT (to an extent) has always had entertaining comedy but these too movies I feel have one upped the stuff before it. It could be just me or it could be I haven\'t seen anything Dragonball is such a long time that I have forgotten how hilarious it can be (only thing that has kept DBZ comedy alive over the recent year is Team Four Star..). I personally feel it\'s at it\'s best when it comes to comedy in comparison to anything that this helped in enjoyment so much and always have for in anything Dragonball which is why even when a fight isn\'t being thrown I\'m entertained and Fukkastu No F did it\'s job the Theater was laughing so hard sometimes I couldn\'t hear the seconds of dialogue after the joke the released it is what it is..Overall (8/10) Very GoodMore Specifically (8.25/10) Very Good+This movie to me is very good. I met damn near all my expectations from an anime movie (and anime movies especially DBZ movies are very good at best now that\'s something I can say). The pacing, characters and dialogue alone makes it a 8 to me. I have no clue what people were excepting from this anime movie and a DBZ movie at the least, you can\'t say this movie is just like the other 13 gtfo (not counting Battle of Gods). not bad so that\'s all that really matters to me if it was you would see something less then what this website considers a 7.Art and Animation (7/10) GoodMore Specifically (7.75/10) Good+The art I thought was very good it\'s Toei if Toei knows how to do anything it\'s right it\'s making something look good.

Taking place after 2013’s _God and God_, this film has all of the action and mayhem that the franchise is known for. In a first for the series, the film has an underlying focus on Goku and Vegeta's character flaws rather than simply becoming stronger and beating the bad guy.Toriyama stated that the film would be “utterly hilarious” and he wasn’t lying. This is the most fun I’ve had watching something in the series for a very long time. Combined with an amazing fight that spans...over half the film and actual character development for Goku, this is the film everyone wanted the rather disappointing _God and God_ to be. Whereas that film spent most of its time with slice of life pieces and Vegeta trying to keep Beerus from getting angry only to have a ten minute fight between Goku and Beerus in the end, _Revival of ‘F’_ wastes no time getting to business. It must be noted though that this film borders on being a parody of itself due to the type of humor in it and a scene where Freeza himself is terrified instead of terrifying due to seeing Beerus a few feet away from him. It isn't bad, this film lacks the threatening tone or mood that the series had back when everyone was on Namek, and Freeza himself is more comical than threatening.While this film has everything a fan has wanted in a new film, there *are* a few drawbacks. In a number of scenes the animation is noticeably less than stellar instead of buttery smooth, and there are two or three CGI scenes that are cringe worthy due to their simplicity. The ending is also a bit abrupt with the epilogue being around only two minutes long. Most importantly, many fans' favorite characters such as Yamcha, Trunks, Goten, Chiaotzu, Mr. Satan and Majin Boo do not make any appearances. Artificial Human #18 has a few small lines in the beginning before focus shifts to Krillin, Master Roshi, Gohan, Piccolo, Tien Shinhan, Bulma, and Freeza.Despite its drawbacks this is the film that fans of the franchise want and will leave with their fists in the air while talking about their hero, Goku, and the amazing fight between the most evil villain of their childhood making a stupendous theatrical appearance with the latest standards in animation and a great soundtrack to boot as they watch a fierce battle just like in the old days. over half the film and actual character development for Goku, this is the film everyone wanted the rather disappointing _God and God_ to be.

However, a former of servant of Freeza brings him back to life with the Dragon Balls and he is back with a golden vengeance.This movie is pretty much fan service for those who loved the Freeza part of the series. How is Freeza back and better than ever? He claims he trained though you don\'t really see it. The movie moves at a pretty moderate pace but the final fight dragged a little longer than it should have as the original anime series...did with its fights. This movie makes use of its cast (Kuririn, Roshi, Tenshinhan, Piccolo and Gohan) but the way Gohan and Roshi are used is a little strange.The fighting in terms of defense is more fluid and a lot of kung fu-esque counter movements are used which i felt was new. The only way to further evolve DBZ\'s fighting is the panning and zooming and I think the movie excellently frames the action and keeps up with its pace.I am a bit mixed on the music. When Freeza is brought back, there is this heavy metal song which suits the character but the ending theme by Momoiro Clover Z to me just doesn\'t fit. Momoiro Clover Z for Sailor Moon Crystal is perfect but I just feel their music does not represent DBZ. To me, the change of DBZ\'s soundtrack is like Initial D without MOVE and the Eurobeat and Cowboy Bebop without the jazz.The current living and active voice cast reprise their roles. Nakao Ryuusei as Freeza still has the role excellently down even to his ho ho ho ho ho laugh. The movie also does an interesting play on Tanaka Mayumi playing Kuririn and Luffy in relation to his cell phone\'s ring tone. Other than that, don\'t watch this with either high or low expectations.

It is currently (August 4th - 12th) in limited release in the U.S and I HIGHLY recommend you see it in theaters while it\'s out if you\'re a fan of the series....I mean wow, the atmosphere in the theater was simply intoxicating. You\'re surrounded by long time fans of the show which is something that enhanced the experience for me all around. It...made the jokes funnier, and people\'s reactions to the ""holy shit!"" Moments just made them so much better. Funimation even made a Pre-Show for us to watch instead of trailers, which was funny and entertaining, only making me want to watch the movie even more. Now onto the movie. Ressurection of F is presented beautifully. The 90\'s style is still captured in the impeccable animation. Characters from Piccolo to Frieza himself look amazing. And the fight scenes are simply flawless. Movements are fluent and look great, and seeing our heroes use their unique abilities is eye candy. From the opening title sequence to the final fight between Goku and Frieza everything was handled perfectly. However the score took a back seat some of the time. The music that was put into the spotlight was awesome, but fights throughout the film were not enhanced by the soundtrack. The music was either absent or very muffled in contrast to the epic battles that took place. The story is pretty straight forward as well, which is a low point of the film because Battle of Gods had a better story, so here it seems like plot wise, Akira may have taken a small step back. The story is not anywhere close to ""average"" though...it\'s a solid ""good"" from me. Fans of the series will know what they\'re getting in terms of plot, it won\'t impress anyone, but it doesn\'t at all ditract from how good this film is either. It\'s an easy to follow story which brings back a fan favorite character that we all love, and delivers an epic final fight. Watching Goku and Vegeta\'s banter is always great, and character interaction is handled so well, partially because of how commited these voice actors are to their roles. There were hilarious moments as well as awesome fights with supporting characters like Tien and Krillin, which is great because we see them do much more here than we saw in Battle of Gods...However seeing Gohan not step up was disappointing. Akira did such a good job at telling a simple story with plenty of action, as well as adding some unexpected ""WTF"" moments that shocked myself and the audience...how can you not like that? Overall, while the story may not be as good as last time around, Resurrection F makes up for that in much better battles this time around. And though the story was not AS good, it was still very very solid storytelling and I can\'t flaw Akira for wanting to tell a straight forward story for the fans. I enjoyed the hell out of this movie and I can say the exact same thing for any fans of the show. Please do yourself a favor and see this thing in theaters. 9/10If you enjoyed my review give me a thumbs up! Thanks (: made the jokes funnier, and people\'s reactions to the ""holy shit!""

Thanks (:', 'Overview:We Dragonball fans often tend to be a very emotional bunch that give heated reviews. However, I\'m not here to say this movie SUCKED or this movie ROCKED! If you want my honest opinion...this movie was ok. It had some serious flaws, but it had some things it really did well. In the following paragraphs I will explain exactly what I mean.My thoughts on the United States Theater release:If you don\'t live in the US or simply don\'t care about this section, please skip ahead to the plot section.After months of waiting, DBZ movie 15: Resurrection ""F"" has FINALLY been released in US theaters. Of...course this means it is being released in a very limited number of theaters for 1 week only! This is despite the fact that this movie was the largest box office hit of 2015 thus far in Japan and the US actually has millions of non-anime fans in their 20s and 30s that still grew up with DBZ and might want to see this movie. Why the tiny theatrical release? Are US theaters all owned by people who hate DBZ and don\'t want this movie to make much money? Obviously that would a very, very silly conspiracy, but not QUITE as groundless and crazy as you might initially think. The 2nd largest movie theater chain in the United States is called AMC theaters, which is owned by Chinese billionaire Jianlin Wang. Mr. Wang is a very patriotic ex-Red Army veteran that is also a high ranking official of the Chinese Communist Party and happens to NOT like Japan very much. Japanese produced films like those released by Sony Pictures have seen their profits plunge in the US since 2012 when the Dalian He-Xing Corporation controlled by the Chinese government bought out AMC and several other US theaters to increase China\'s ""soft power"" overseas. Japanese financed films in the US are now shown on fewer screens and for shorter times, at least in part thanks to the efforts of the Chinese government. At this point I should be grateful that the CCP allowed this movie to be released in the US at all. Thank you Honorable Chairman Xi Jinping!Plot:Warning! This contains Spoilers!!!The plot is honestly the largest problem with this movie. You can tell that Toriyama himself wrote it because it contains the kind of plot holes and continuity errors that only the master of ""not giving a fuck about his own work"" is capable of. If this movie was written by someone who had never seen DBZ before and prepared by spending 5 hours reading wikipedia and fan wikia summaries it would have contained far fewer errors!Due to the high level of bullshit moments, I will give an overview of the plot and count the number ""Cinema Sins"" style with a number enclosed in parenthesis (1)The adventure begins with Freeza\'s henchmen going to Earth to gather the dragon balls. These henchmen were stated to have roughly equal power to the Ginyu force and like all of Freeza\'s henchmen did not have the ability to repress their power levels. However, unlike previous examples of abnormally strong power levels approaching the planet, none of the Z fighters noticed the presence of these minions and thus never tried to stop them (1).The henchmen wish for Freeza to come back to life, but the Dragon states that since he died when Buu destroyed the Earth, he now has new rules and can only bring back a body in the shape it was in at the time of death. Freeza got sliced and diced by Trunks and therefore his body could only be brought back in the tiny pieces that Trunks cut him into. The Earth\'s ""eternal"" dragon Shenlong has been killed twice before the time Buu destroyed Earth and there were no changes to his rules following the first 2 times Shenlong was restored (2).The minions simply take the small pieces of Freeza\'s corpse and place them in the healing tank, which perfectly restores Freeza\'s body. This is despite the fact that the healing tank used by Freeza\'s men in previous sagas could NOT restore the dead or heal such serious wounds as being in tiny pieces. That is precisely why Freeza\'s body had to be rebuilt as a cyborg following the explosion of Namek and his body was in MUCH better condition after Namek than after Trunks (3).Freeza died in his ""final form"" which is actually his original form and the other forms were created to preserve energy. Yet, when the healing machine pieces him back together while he is unconscious, he is somehow in his most repressed transformation (4).Freeza is informed that Goku has gotten much stronger and defeated Majin Buu, which shocks Freeza since we apparently now learn that Freeza\'s father once warned him of Majin Buu and Beerus the God of Destruction. Although I like that Toriyama has tried hard to retcon Beerus into the DBZ world, it makes ZERO sense for Freeza\'s father to have heard of Majin Buu! This is because at any time in Freeza\'s life when his father could have told him this information, Buu was sealed away and hadn\'t been seen by anyone for millions of years. There would be no reason to believe that Buu was still alive and even North Kai hadn\'t heard of Buu because it happened way before the lifetime of a low level Kai like him. The only characters with the knowledge of the entire history of the universe to know about Majin Buu were the Supreme Kai, other high level immortal Gods like Beerus, and the several million year old wizard Babidi. Apparently King Cold is a WAY better historian than any other mortal character and can predict that someone thought dead for millions of years is actually still somehow alive (5).Freeza announces that despite having a power level several thousand times lower than Majin Buu and well over 10,000 times lower than SSJ God Goku, that with six months of training he could fight on the same level as Goku. We learn that Freeza ""has never trained a minute is his life"" and that the only reason he isn\'t the strongest character in the Dragonball Universe is that he is the laziest character in the history of fiction. Freeza was certainly arrogant in DBZ, but he was also a highly ambitious tyrant that was totally bent on domination. Why would it make sense that he has never once worked out in his life and is even lazier than Oblomov (cookie if you got that last joke). This not only completely derails Freeza\'s character, but we never even get to see a second of apparently the greatest power boost training in Dragonball history! (6).We see the lovably flamboyant Whis training Goku and Vegeta and learn that both of them can now achieve a 2nd level of Super Saiyan God! Seriously?! Vegeta took forever to go SSJ 1 and never even came close to learning SSJ 3. How in the  fuck did Vegeta in a couple months attain SSJ God lvl 2?! Whis is obviously one HELL of a teacher. Maybe he is the one who secretly trained Freeza in order to provide a challenge for Goku!!! Nah, that would make too much logical sense. The real answer is that Toriyama doesn\'t give a fuck! (7).Freeza invades Earth and an epic battle begins between Freeza\'s soldiers and the Z fighters. This includes Master Roshi who beats the shit out of dozens of Freeza\'s soldiers...despite the fact that Raditz was below the average strength of a Freeza soldier and Raditz was 10 times stronger than Roshi in his prime (8).Krillen tells C-18 to protect their daughter while he fights against Freeza\'s men. Krillen doesn\'t want either of them to be in danger, despite the fact that C-18 is over 1000 times stronger than him and FAR less likely to die in battle. Why in fuck would C-18 allow her infinitely weaker spouse to go get himself killed?! She has never been shown to be a coward like Yamcha and we are led to believe that she truly does love Krillen and cares deeply about him. Why wouldn\'t she just knock Krillen out and go in his place?! Hooray for completely illogical character assassination! (9).Goku and Vegeta finally arrive to fight against Freeza and the action begins with the now blue haired Goku against Golden Freeza. Goku seems to gain the upper hand, but one of Freeza\'s minions with a tiny power level is able to severely injure Goku with a tiny laser because Goku\'s guard was down. This is despite the fact that Goku has been hit off-guard by dozens of FAR stronger attacks and it has been explained that Goku\'s tremendous Ki protects his body like a force field. The only exception was a non-canon filler episode where Krillen throws a rock at him for the sake of comic relief. (10).Vegeta takes over the fight and kicks Freeza\'s ass. Vegeta is arrogant and always looking for a challenge, so he will allow a fight to drag on if his opponent promises another transformation or hasn\'t reached their max power. However, Vegeta has always quickly finished his fights against weaker, unworthy opponents like Freeza in his current state. That is why it makes VERY little sense for Vegeta to give Freeza the time to repeat what he did on Namek and tried to do again against Trunks by blowing the planet and winning via default. Vegeta would have KNOWN that Freeza would try this because Freeza ALWAYS tries this strategy when he starts losing. However, Toriyama wanted to fuck over Vegeta and Freeza wins by blowing up the planet. Whis then pulls some deus ex machina bullshit and sends Goku back in time to just before the planet is destroyed so that Goku can kill Freeza. Why the hell do you hate Vegeta so much Toriyama?! If you didn\'t like him, you should have killed him off and not made him a main character! (11).Obviously I didn\'t catch all the countless mistakes, but these were just a few that particularly bothered me either because they derailed a beloved character or completely raped the continuity of the timeline.Art and Animation:The art and animation is actually pretty damn good. The use of CGI was slightly less annoying than in Battle of Gods, and the action was excellent. The well animated fights and big budget blockbuster feel made this movie enjoyable for DBZ fans despite the multitude of plot issues.Music:The music was honestly pretty good and I liked the inclusion of ""F"" by Maximum the Hormone. It was a nice touch!Overall:Is this movie the greatest thing Toriyama has ever produced? Obviously not. However, it was a well animated action fest with some enjoyable fights and a few funny moments. There have been WAY worse DBZ movies that we the fans have had to put up with over the years. If I wasn\'t a big fan of DBZ I think I would give this a 5 or arguably even a 4, but because I personally enjoyed it a lot, I feel that I have to give up a tad of analytical objectivity and give it a 6. Your mileage may vary. course this means it is being released in a very limited number of theaters for 1 week only! This is despite the fact that this movie was the largest box office hit of 2015 thus far in Japan and the US actually has millions of non-anime fans in their 20s and 30s that still grew up with DBZ and might want to see this movie. Why the tiny theatrical release? Are US theaters all owned by people who hate DBZ and don\'t want this movie to make much money? Obviously that would a very, very silly conspiracy, but not QUITE as groundless and crazy as you might initially think. The 2nd largest movie theater chain in the United States is called AMC theaters, which is owned by Chinese billionaire Jianlin Wang. Mr. Wang is a very patriotic ex-Red Army veteran that is also a high ranking official of the Chinese Communist Party and happens to NOT like Japan very much. Japanese produced films like those released by Sony Pictures have seen their profits plunge in the US since 2012 when the Dalian He-Xing Corporation controlled by the Chinese government bought out AMC and several other US theaters to increase China\'s ""soft power"" overseas. Japanese financed films in the US are now shown on fewer screens and for shorter times, at least in part thanks to the efforts of the Chinese government. At this point I should be grateful that the CCP allowed this movie to be released in the US at all. Thank you Honorable Chairman Xi Jinping!Plot:Warning! This contains Spoilers!!!The plot is honestly the largest problem with this movie. You can tell that Toriyama himself wrote it because it contains the kind of plot holes and continuity errors that only the master of ""not giving a fuck about his own work"" is capable of. If this movie was written by someone who had never seen DBZ before and prepared by spending 5 hours reading wikipedia and fan wikia summaries it would have contained far fewer errors!Due to the high level of bullshit moments, I will give an overview of the plot and count the number ""Cinema Sins"" style with a number enclosed in parenthesis (1)The adventure begins with Freeza\'s henchmen going to Earth to gather the dragon balls. These henchmen were stated to have roughly equal power to the Ginyu force and like all of Freeza\'s henchmen did not have the ability to repress their power levels. However, unlike previous examples of abnormally strong power levels approaching the planet, none of the Z fighters noticed the presence of these minions and thus never tried to stop them (1).The henchmen wish for Freeza to come back to life, but the Dragon states that since he died when Buu destroyed the Earth, he now has new rules and can only bring back a body in the shape it was in at the time of death. Freeza got sliced and diced by Trunks and therefore his body could only be brought back in the tiny pieces that Trunks cut him into. The Earth\'s ""eternal"" dragon Shenlong has been killed twice before the time Buu destroyed Earth and there were no changes to his rules following the first 2 times Shenlong was restored (2).The minions simply take the small pieces of Freeza\'s corpse and place them in the healing tank, which perfectly restores Freeza\'s body. This is despite the fact that the healing tank used by Freeza\'s men in previous sagas could NOT restore the dead or heal such serious wounds as being in tiny pieces. That is precisely why Freeza\'s body had to be rebuilt as a cyborg following the explosion of Namek and his body was in MUCH better condition after Namek than after Trunks (3).Freeza died in his ""final form"" which is actually his original form and the other forms were created to preserve energy. Yet, when the healing machine pieces him back together while he is unconscious, he is somehow in his most repressed transformation (4).Freeza is informed that Goku has gotten much stronger and defeated Majin Buu, which shocks Freeza since we apparently now learn that Freeza\'s father once warned him of Majin Buu and Beerus the God of Destruction. Although I like that Toriyama has tried hard to retcon Beerus into the DBZ world, it makes ZERO sense for Freeza\'s father to have heard of Majin Buu! This is because at any time in Freeza\'s life when his father could have told him this information, Buu was sealed away and hadn\'t been seen by anyone for millions of years. There would be no reason to believe that Buu was still alive and even North Kai hadn\'t heard of Buu because it happened way before the lifetime of a low level Kai like him. The only characters with the knowledge of the entire history of the universe to know about Majin Buu were the Supreme Kai, other high level immortal Gods like Beerus, and the several million year old wizard Babidi. Apparently King Cold is a WAY better historian than any other mortal character and can predict that someone thought dead for millions of years is actually still somehow alive (5).Freeza announces that despite having a power level several thousand times lower than Majin Buu and well over 10,000 times lower than SSJ God Goku, that with six months of training he could fight on the same level as Goku. We learn that Freeza ""has never trained a minute is his life"" and that the only reason he isn\'t the strongest character in the Dragonball Universe is that he is the laziest character in the history of fiction. Freeza was certainly arrogant in DBZ, but he was also a highly ambitious tyrant that was totally bent on domination. Why would it make sense that he has never once worked out in his life and is even lazier than Oblomov (cookie if you got that last joke). This not only completely derails Freeza\'s character, but we never even get to see a second of apparently the greatest power boost training in Dragonball history! (6).We see the lovably flamboyant Whis training Goku and Vegeta and learn that both of them can now achieve a 2nd level of Super Saiyan God! Seriously?! Vegeta took forever to go SSJ 1 and never even came close to learning SSJ 3. How in the  fuck did Vegeta in a couple months attain SSJ God lvl 2?! Whis is obviously one HELL of a teacher. Maybe he is the one who secretly trained Freeza in order to provide a challenge for Goku!!! Nah, that would make too much logical sense. The real answer is that Toriyama doesn\'t give a fuck! (7).Freeza invades Earth and an epic battle begins between Freeza\'s soldiers and the Z fighters. This includes Master Roshi who beats the shit out of dozens of Freeza\'s soldiers...despite the fact that Raditz was below the average strength of a Freeza soldier and Raditz was 10 times stronger than Roshi in his prime (8).Krillen tells C-18 to protect their daughter while he fights against Freeza\'s men. Krillen doesn\'t want either of them to be in danger, despite the fact that C-18 is over 1000 times stronger than him and FAR less likely to die in battle. Why in fuck would C-18 allow her infinitely weaker spouse to go get himself killed?! She has never been shown to be a coward like Yamcha and we are led to believe that she truly does love Krillen and cares deeply about him. Why wouldn\'t she just knock Krillen out and go in his place?! Hooray for completely illogical character assassination! (9).Goku and Vegeta finally arrive to fight against Freeza and the action begins with the now blue haired Goku against Golden Freeza. Goku seems to gain the upper hand, but one of Freeza\'s minions with a tiny power level is able to severely injure Goku with a tiny laser because Goku\'s guard was down. This is despite the fact that Goku has been hit off-guard by dozens of FAR stronger attacks and it has been explained that Goku\'s tremendous Ki protects his body like a force field. The only exception was a non-canon filler episode where Krillen throws a rock at him for the sake of comic relief. (10).Vegeta takes over the fight and kicks Freeza\'s ass. Vegeta is arrogant and always looking for a challenge, so he will allow a fight to drag on if his opponent promises another transformation or hasn\'t reached their max power. However, Vegeta has always quickly finished his fights against weaker, unworthy opponents like Freeza in his current state. That is why it makes VERY little sense for Vegeta to give Freeza the time to repeat what he did on Namek and tried to do again against Trunks by blowing the planet and winning via default. Vegeta would have KNOWN that Freeza would try this because Freeza ALWAYS tries this strategy when he starts losing. However, Toriyama wanted to fuck over Vegeta and Freeza wins by blowing up the planet. Whis then pulls some deus ex machina bullshit and sends Goku back in time to just before the planet is destroyed so that Goku can kill Freeza. Why the hell do you hate Vegeta so much Toriyama?! If you didn\'t like him, you should have killed him off and not made him a main character!

These are my thoughts direction after watching it for the first time...Overall, the movie was very exciting, anticipating and nostalgic. There are some great moments throughout the film that really make you feel re-connected with some of the greatest Dragon Ball characters ever. Although the production values have exceeded since the 90\'s, the enjoyment level of any Dragon Ball story has always been consistently high . The improved animation style goes hand-in-hand with the direction that Akira Toriyama is taking this new-age...saga, and I am enjoying every minute of it.Building on the last movie released ""Battle of Gods"", this new film expands the canon story arc to a whole new level. The time difference between the the two features has seen some exciting new progress for some characters. There is a new standard in power and strength as the threshold of potential is once again raised to new heights. I\'m hoping that some future episodes of Dragon Ball Super will elaborate on the details of some awesome new Saiyan transformations.Definitely recommend this movie to any and all fans of the Dragon Ball universe. Newbies should steer away as a lot of the already established plot points and character developments would go straight over your head.An amazing addition to one of the greatest stories ever told. saga, and I am enjoying every minute of it.Building on the last movie released ""Battle of Gods"", this new film expands the canon story arc to a whole new level.

That's one way to describe Dragon Ball Z: Fukkatsu no 'F'.Toriyama-sensei took us all by storm when the second most recent movie, 'Dragon Ball Z: Kami to Kami' or 'Battle of Gods' was released. It introduced us to a whole new perspective to the world of Dragon Ball Z, with the addition of a major antagonist, 'The God of Destruction' as he's known, Lord Beerus. Not to mention an all new transformation for our hero Goku known as the 'Super Saiyan God'. As lame as the name sounds, the appearance and the way it came to existence was somewhat similar too. But...the fact that it was an altogether different entity as it had transcended to the position of a deity made it somewhat believable and cool, and it was also helped by Beerus, a deity himself with interesting characteristics. But this is where it all fails for Fukkatsu no 'F', as there is no originality whatsoever and the main antagonist is Frieza. For god's sake, Frieza. Why did anyone think it'd be a good idea to bring back a popular villain, whose time has long gone from the series, give him an upgraded look and it'd be good to go?The resurrection of Frieza itself is a reason as to why the movie sucked, but it had a lot of other inconsistencies as well. First of all, there is no proper world building as the movie starts with a strange scene where little fairies are seen dancing and Frieza's mecha face is seen hanging inside that of a cocoon. The next thing we know is that Frieza's sub-ordinate, Sorbet is plotting to revive Frieza back using the Dragon Balls and is coming in search for it on Earth. He doesn't have to wait long as he just steals them from Pilaf and his gang who apparently have found all seven of the Dragon Balls. Strange enough because the last time I saw them they were at their wits' end rowing a broken boat not knowing where to go, so it makes no sense that they could find all the Dragon Balls scattered around the Earth in such a short period. It doesn't end there, after having all seven Dragon Balls the first thing you'd do is just wake the dragon up and ask for your wish, but no because at the very next moment Pilaf and his gang are visited by Sorbet who comes all the way from outer space to Earth in a moment. Pretty good timing, huh?Soon enough we have Frieza coming back to life and heading out to face the Z warriors in an instant with all of his army. The motive is lackluster, with Frieza learning how much Goku and others have become stronger, Frieza too heads out to train supposedly for the first time in his life. It all feels too old and bland to believe as the only reasoning given as to why Frieza could be a formidable opponent is that he could awaken his latent power by training. Now there is a hint for this in the previous movie when we see Beerus acting a little surprised when he comes to know of Frieza's defeat by a Saiyan, but it feels funny considering how powerless he's shown in the later arcs of Dragon Ball Z. And all of this works against it when Frieza comes back wanting a fight with the Z warriors. Going by the logic of Dragon Ball Z, it would only seem plausible for Gohan or even for Piccolo to defeat Frieza considering how stronger they have become. But nope, its shown as if Earth is once again facing a huge crisis and we even have Gohan saying that he doubts if he can even become a Super Saiyan, thus totally working against what Dragon Ball Z had established. Things take a turn for the worse when he's taking out in an instant by one hit from Frieza and is on the verge of death. (RIP Gohan, what have you done to his character, Toriyama-san!)The buildup is complete for a showdown between Goku and Vegeta who return after training with Whis back to Earth to face Frieza. In a nutshell, the ensuing battle is enjoyable for those who don't care for whats happening and just want to get their ticket's worth, but as for me its meaningless. There are two new transformations to be seen in the movie, with Goku and Vegeta each showing their new Super Saiyan God's Super Saiyan form. (The hair turns all blue basically) and an absurd power increase given to Frieza with his equally absurd Golden Frieza form. There also is no explanation or a buildup as to how Goku and Vegeta have achieved the new form, but I presume that would be later explained in the TV series, Super. (In which I have yet to reach that point on). But as for in the movie, its a negative. It all could've ended well at least with them letting Vegeta call it a day by taking his revenge on Frieza, but that too didn't happen and Goku once again hogged all the glory. In the end it all seemed like it was a test for Goku from Whis who turns back time to give him one more chance to end Frieza for good, which also made the very reason why Frieza was resurrected and his fight against Goku completely pointless.There are a lot of good movies in the Dragon Ball Z franchise but none of them till the thirteenth installment were canon. Fukkatsu no 'F' was definitely not one of those good movies and unfortunately it indeed is canon. Dragon Ball Z may have truly hit rock bottom with this one. the fact that it was an altogether different entity as it had transcended to the position of a deity made it somewhat believable and cool, and it was also helped by Beerus, a deity himself with interesting characteristics.

Fukkatsu no 'F' was definitely not one of those good movies and unfortunately it indeed is canon. Dragon Ball Z may have truly hit rock bottom with this one."", 'Are...are you serious? I have a hard time believing that THIS is the return of Dragonball Z\'s most notable villain and a good majority of the masses are happy with it. Maybe it\'s because I am long past the point of liking, much less caring about, the Dragonball universe, but I thought Battle of the Gods was pretty damn good, so that left the door open for me to warrant interest in Frieza\'s return movie. The lesson learned, as far as I know, is if you\'re going to make a movie where the genesis is a Japanese metal band doing a song about the character,...you can get away with making it stupid.STORY: Generally the story really never matters in these DBZ films, it\'s not like context of the plot ever has cohesion with the franchises\' overly bloated, ridiculous fight scenes after the initial Frieza story arc. So much like almost half of the 15 movies, shadowy bad guys want to use the Dragonballs for some nefarious purpose that never results in them wishing for immortality right off the bat. This group of numbskulls are remnants of Frieza\'s army. Sorbet, diminutive brownnoser who sounds like Warren Beatty to me. Tagoma, yet another 13th tall, skinny, bald guy, and maybe the others had names, but it seriously isn\'t important at all.So, with this being Frieza\'s great revenge, I was expecting a great sense of tension throughout the film once he\'s brought back. And since this is DBZ, we need a built-in excuse why Goku and Vegeta aren\'t there. Those two are off in Beerus\' world, training [WHAT A SHOCKER] with Whis. Fine, whatever, but the path of carnage I was anticipating was instead virtually absent. Earth\'s forces to stand against the former galactic overlord are Piccolo, a shriveled up Gohan (more on that later), Krillin, a character named Jaco, I assume he\'s from Cho, which I haven\'t seen, Bulma, for no discernable reason other than to make my ears bleed, and......Master Roshi...who hasn\'t done anything useful in Z up to this point. So this standoff is Frieza, allegedly blinded by revenge, coolly sitting off to the side watching the Z Fighter B Team play mop-up duty with generic henchmen. Why not turn it completely into Final Fight and have Krillin kick a garbage can to reveal a health replenishing hamburger?!This went on...forever. It\'s not engaging, not interesting, I DARE even call it pacing. The movie is filibustering itself and were it not for Beerus\'s existence, this would almost be a complete waste. Whereas Battle of the Gods carried a heavy sense of tension throughout the first act because of the unpredictable danger of the God of Destruction, Resurrection F returns to the repetitive, time padding, empty calories fights that made me sick of DBZ in the first place. This is anime malnutrition. SCORE: 3ART: The production values, animation, and CGI continue to be good to the series as the higher quality images makes the impact and pace of the battles the way they probably wanted them to look 20 years ago. It is very easy on the eyes, but I am not a fan of the new art, it looks very sterile, glossy, and lifeless. Much like how Bulma\'s character design somehow gets sexier as she ages, everything feels too neat and pristine, like it\'s afraid to get its nails dirty. And I have a hard time getting over that distracting shine on all the characters\' skin, they look like they were marinating in Armor All. When the action picks up, it is visually impressive, but a lot personality is lost in FashionBall Z here. SCORE: 6SOUND: The FUNimation VA group for the English dub reprise their roles, minus Tiffany Vollmer, as much to my chagrin, Monica Rial is now PermaBulma. Sean Schemmel sounds like the only one who still actually cares, as he\'s still decent as Goku. Chris Sabat seems to have given up and now just does alternating inflections of Roronoa Zoro for Piccolo and Vegeta. Chris Ayers still sounds like he\'s channeling Team Four Star Abridged Frieza, but I\'m used to it now. If there is one positive about new Dragonball is being done away with the irritating Bruce Faulconer soundtrack. It was cute for a while, but jeezuz, it got repetitive! SCORE: 7CHARACTERS: What can I say? It\'s the Z Fighters, they do pretty much the same schtick they\'ve been doing, just slightly subdued. I want Bulma assassinated. I was never a fan of hers and she\'s all over this movie shrieking like a harpy, so I can only assume this is a rib against me. An even bigger rib is how much Dragonball now seems to go out of its way to make Gohan, the only two dimensional personality, a gigantic dweeb post Mystic Super Saiyan. The biggest thing I like about him is that he DOESN\'T follow in his dad\'s footsteps, does right by his mother\'s wishes and finishes his schooling, and wants to be a decent father, something he never had. I learned a lot of people hate Gohan for that, then I realized just how out of touch I am. Being a good citizen is now frowned upon? This industry left me in the dust and isn\'t turning around. I\'m sure if I watched Cho, I might Jaco, he seems like a fun enough nonchalant being, which is a healthy break from the knuckleheads. Vegeta, another guy I was never a fan of ever, has become very likeable and funny. Other than that, the original villains don\'t add a damn thing to this. SCORE: 3IN CLOSING: To call this a disappointment is an understatement. This is Lord Slug level terrible and the two have a lot in common; wasted characters, nonsensical storytelling, continuity errors that make absolutely no sense upon hearing them, a useless middle portion of the movie, and an anticlimactic resolution that sums up everything I hate about the Dragonball universe!! The writers should\'ve been arrested for the ending to this movie, because they stole 88 minutes I could\'ve used for something productive instead of spending it on this failed attempt to rehash a part of my past. There are good things about it, ut as far as I\'m concerned, the bad dreadfully outweighs the good. Resurrection F? Yeah, ""F"" indeed on multiple levels. FINAL SCORE: 3 you can get away with making it stupid.STORY: Generally the story really never matters in these DBZ films, it\'s not like context of the plot ever has cohesion with the franchises\' overly bloated, ridiculous fight scenes after the initial Frieza story arc.

However, there was one character, a villain, that I never seemed to forget and I always regarded him to be my favorite, and that villain was Frieza. As time went on, people simply forgot about him because he wasn't the strongest threat any longer;  but what...made Frieza special to me was his overall connection with the Saiyans. No one terrorized and brought more misery to them than Frieza. He was the ultimate threat especially on a personal level. Dragonball Z: Resurrection F, brings the character back to life, and this was the one DBZ movie I just had to see. For the most part I wasn't disappointed.The story begins with Frieza being resurrected by his men with hopes that he would lead them once again. Frieza has something else on his mind and that's revenge against Goku for defeating him and Trunks for killing him. He learns that Goku has gotten much stronger, thus understands fighting him at the moment makes no sense. He then leaves to train on his own and come back stronger.I have to say that this movie kept me greatly entertained for many reasons. One element that stood out to me immediately was the character designs and animation. There's a fresh, clean like feel to the character designs with everything feeling updated. Characters like Roshi and even Gohan in his silly jumpsuit look strong and confident. Plus I liked the change in outfits for Bulma, and the small details added to Goku's uniform. It all feels up to date and right for this movie.The animation is by far a huge step up. The meshing of CG with 2D & 3D graphics was done a lot better this time than the last movie. Characters in the background had some nice life to them and nothing came off awkward.  The action was simply amazing as it focused on the characters martial arts backgrounds, this area could have been a whole helluva lot better had more characters taken part in the fighting, but I was still satisfied to see some really quick strikes, strong blows, and various kung-fu styles thrown in with the punches. Even if some one comes away hating this movie for other things; they will have to admit that for a DBZ movie the action is tight. The animation was done really well for the energy blasting spectacles.DBZ almost always rules with its ear blistering soundtracks. While this movie may not be on par with Cooler's Revenge or Broly: The Legendary Super Saiyan. It definitely gets the job done not only bringing life to the action but also to character interactions.One last thing that definitely brought a smile to me had to be the focus on Goku and Frieza's rivalry, along with the latter's overall hatred not only for Goku, but also his experience with the Super Saiyan itself. This is where the dialog comes off very strong, as Frieza is truly obsessed by this point, and it puts his blood feud with the Saiyans in perspective; I think this added to the drama a good deal, and the handling of drama is not something DBZ has always been strong on.I enjoyed this movie a whole lot but I did have to watch it twice because the first viewing left me very uneasy. It just so happened that Akira Toriyama decided to completely ignore previously established story elements that he himself put into play. There are continuity issues in this movie big enough to fit planets through and it's just a shame because the story could have been so much better had everything been told properly. These things also hurt previous character development and lessens them as characters. I mean who would think that Frieza was such a slacker that he never trained? It's hard to buy into that considering how seriously Frieza took himself. I also straight up didn't like the ending, because I'm long tired of Vegeta getting screwed over.Overall, this is definitely something fans should come into expecting it to be good. The updated animation, action scenes, and focus on the feud of classic characters makes this a DBZ movie that should be seen. I can imagine non DBZ fans getting something out of it as well.Highs: Action, animation, and characters done wellLows: Complete ignoring of previously established story elements hurts it made Frieza special to me was his overall connection with the Saiyans.

It sidetracks for the sake of rehashing old plotlines and throwing in even more lazy color-swapping power ups. Because who cares about continuity anymore? It’s about Frieza coming back to life and seeking revenge against Goku. That’s all there is to it, something he already did with his father in the past, as well as what his non-canon brother did in a movie. It’s not like I expect originality out of Dragonball; the damn thing is the monolith of the fighting shonen formulas and it has stuck to it for 30 years. What does annoy me a lot...though, is how Toriyama screwed up such a simple plot. I mean, this is HIS creation, and he knows how stuff work better than everybody else. And yet here we are with characters acting out of character, and the rules of how the Dragon Balls work changing out of nowhere.So ok, some bad guys make a wish to bring Frieza back to life. Why does he come back in pieces? Nobody else had that issue, even back when wishes had far more limitations. And why are all the good guys doing nothing despite sensing Frieza’s aura? I mean, seriously, at this point they can fly anywhere they like in a few seconds, and even a bottom rank fighter like Krilin is around Frieza’s power at this time. So why are they standing still for several minutes when they clearly sense someone summoning the dragon, bringing back a major villain, and then leaving in a spaceship? They were always flying to battle in previous arcs the moment they sensed something was off. They could have sent even a nobody like Yamcha to sneeze on the bad guys before they even made the wish, and the movie would be over in, like, ten minutes.Hell, they could have simply kept all the dragon balls in a secure place, so the bad guys wouldn’t even be able to make the wish in the first place. But no, they just let any random villain to gather them and wish for whatever the heck he wants. Something which is so easy to do these days. Back in the good arcs, it would require months to find them all. Nowadays even a comic relief villain like Pilaf can do that with no problem. Twice. Out of screen. And nobody gives a damn.Anyways, Frieza is back and he wants to kill Goku, just like every other bad guy wants in this show. But he also needs to get stronger in order to do that, since he became a small fry even back when Goku had yellow hair. Now that he got red hair, Frieza will need to get a new power up that can top even that. And he acquires said power up by… training for a few months. Yeah, that is all it took to get a million times more powerful; he was simply out of shape and needed to get into a fitness program. And he did it out of screen too, because who cares about training sessions anymore? We are all here to see dumb people punching each other.So, a few months later, Frieza attacks with a bunch of minions, and we get the typical part where all the non-Saiyans are trying to hold off the bad guys, because Goku is not around to do it himself. In earlier arcs he was too far away, or was still recovering from his injuries, so taking time to get to the battlefield was excused. But no such thing happens this time. He can teleport anywhere he wants in an instant, he is not injured, and has Kaio available to inform him about anything that is going on with telepathy. And yet no such thing happens for several hours. It’s as if everybody forgot how to use their powers all of a sudden.Anyways, the cannon fodder fights, and as always they are not trying to win, or even to weaken the enemy boss. They are just wasting time, until the only people who matter in this show after Namek arrive (which are Goku and Vegeta, duh). And holy crap, the power levels now make even less sense. Since when are we supposed to believe some of the minions are weak enough for even Muten Roshi to beat, while others are powerful enough to land punches on Picolo and Gohan. What the hell, if such powerful aliens exist, why was Frieza their leader? Or why did they bother to resurrect him, if they already had stronger successors to take over his position? What’s the point?After this completely meaningless battle scene, Goku and Vegeta finally arrive, because Bulma (of all people) bothered to inform them about Frieza. They are cocky enough to fight Frieza one on one, instead of ganging up on him and ending the battle right away. Or, I don’t know, letting Beerus who is even stronger than them to finish him off. Oh right, he is busy eating desserts, what a great character. What, you thought our noble heroes are here to save the Earth, protect their friends, or something trivial like that? Nope, they are here to have fun by punching stuff. And eat pudding.What follows is Frieza revealing his own personal lazy color-swapping power up, followed by Goku doing the same with yet another lazy color-swapping power up. Yellow is so last century, and red just got old last year, so let’s try blue this time. With a wonderful name to go along with it: Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan. No, this is not a typo. Then the final battle happens, where Frieza is completely owned despite his fitness program. Do you know how lame it feels to see all this build up amounting to nothing? And they didn’t even fight for a couple of hours like before, it only lasts a few minutes. And it all ends when one weak minions shoots Goku with a simple laser. What the hell is this crap, the guy could survive nuclear explosions before he even had yellow hair, and now that he has blue he gets heavily injured by a pistol? This is bullshit.But worry not, since now Vegeta can take on Frieza and prove what an amazing warrior he is by essentially finishing off his half dead opponent. And he fails even at that, losing his chance to take his revenge after all these years, because he was busy laughing at how strong he is, instead of killing Frieza. Frieza takes advantage of that by blowing up the Earth while everybody is busy doing nonsense. By the way, this is something he could have done all along without even having to land on the planet. But of course he didn’t, because if that happened the movie would have ended way too soon.Anyways, the Earth is destroyed for yet another time and it seems everybody died, but plot convenience says otherwise, since now there is time travel all of a sudden. Goku can go back in time and undo anything that wasn’t done properly, thus having an even easier way to fix any harm the villains caused. Forget the healing beans, the dragon bringing the dead back to life; he can simply load a previous saved file and try again. Hooray for tension!Thus Goku defeats Frieza before he blows up the Earth with his trademarked Kamehameha attack. Something he could have done all along but didn’t. By the way, why isn’t the solar system vaporized if Goku fires energy beams at this level? I mean, even in his initial form Frieza could blow up planets with a finger. How come Earth is not blown apart by Frieza, two God Saiyans, Beerus, and Whis, simply breathing on it? Whatever, power levels are bullshit.Thus ends this completely pointless movie, so we can rewatch it all over again ten times longer and with crappy animation, thanks to Dragon Ball Super. Milking for the win. And who knows, maybe Goku will get purple hair after this arc, and call himself Saiyan God Super God Saiyan Duper Kamehame Saiyan Lucifer Super. though, is how Toriyama screwed up such a simple plot.

He was humbled in battle of gods by beerus by seeing that there are many others out there who he cant beat however goku being goku and always striving towards new power getting god like power it again has gone to his head and again but now he learned of the consequences of his actions and resolved himself to not let it happen again.Enjoyment 8: This was a very enjoyable movie that had its comedic moments but was action packed from start to finish. I enjoyed every single minute of it, it had a lot of issues however looking past those this was really enjoyable for long time dragon ball z fans.Overall 8: This was a very good dragon ball z movie that had its issues however if the obvious inconsistencies and plot holes are ignored it was a really good action packed movie. action and then those in between who like both the slice of life stuff and action.Dragon ball z battle of gods from a story stand point was leaps and bounds better than revival of f however it lack action which revival delivers on to the fullest.Which is the better movie depends on whether you like dialogue and story more or seemingly mindless action.Story 7: The story for revival of f is simple,freeza is revived and wants revenge on those who led to his demise,goku and trunks.He goes to earth and a epic battle insures.That is all there is to this movie its simple and easy to predict.That is how dragon ball has always been and the reason why it is so popular because anyone of any age can easily understand the story.The story however had issues the thought of freeza even remotely been a threat to the z warriors at this point in time is ridiculous, the gap between freeza and buu is enormous and now that goku has god like power it is even more ludicrous that freeza could even be goku`s equal.The ending was also lack luster.Freeza was one of the most feared individual in the universe but in this movie he provided no real threat to the z warriors and as we all could expect didn't leave any real damage.This movie is indeed fan service for long time fans, to give us something to enjoy by bringing back arguable the most iconic dragon ball z villain and put him up against goku in an epic revenge rematch battle so in that perspective i guess the issues of the story can be looked past because the story was never meant to be the major aspect of this movie but it is the action instead.The fights didn't have much tension and seem like this was a training session for goku and vegeta and not a fight for their and the earths survival .Art 9: This movie is the best looking dragon ball z movie or any dragon ball z material to date, everything looked crisp and fluent.The action scenes were fantastic combined the good old fashion dragon ball z actions scenes with the blurred lines with the new animation cgi which weren't really an issue it didn't look bad.Sound 7: The sound in revival of f felt a little lack luster, there were only like 3 or 4 sounds in the entire film and there were scenes that i felt needed music however for what was played was good.Character 8: The characters were great a meld of the old dragon ball z cast with the new characters such as beerus,whis and jaco.The new characters made the movie more enjoyable with their interactions with each other beerus and whis still being beerus and whis with their interactions of food which are fun to watch.Jaco an instant hit character being a very interesting character to see being comedy relief and a very awesome character.In this movie goku actually got some character development,goku is that guy that always wants to fight and face new obstacles and he doesn't differentiate between good and evil meaning even if you are evil he would still give you a second chance to live so you can come back and fight him again because goku loves fighting but that kind of pure hearted desire for a new challenge is naive and often puts himself and those he loves in danger and the events in this movie led him to realize that and show him that he shouldn't let evil get a second chance and put others in danger.Goku believes too much in his own power and because of that tends to let his guard down because he sure in himself.Goku wasn't always like this i think its the super sayain power going to his head every since he became a super sayain and obtained that level of power with each gain in power he got more and more over confident case in point majin buu said he could defeat him as a super sayain 3 but didn't because he was so sure of himself and wanted the kids to do it.

If you spend time analyzing this movie you will scream to yourself WTF ?. Nothing makes sense in this movie and the plot is just a cheap attempt at capitalizing on a known villain. A new unexplained transformation used as a cash cow  to piece together a quick to grasp story.The visuals and sound are top notch, but the fights are lacking even for DBZ standards. The visuals actually take a slight hit due to the interjection of computer graphics at random parts of fights (Which noone ever likes).Chances are you will enjoy this movie...for what it is, but that's with your rose colored glasses. I can't get into the issues with the movie without spoiling it, just know very little is going to be cohesive and non of it will add any value to the universe. for what it is, but that's with your rose colored glasses.

Read only by your own risk.Dragon Ball blasted this year, with a new movie, a new anime series and officially declared May 9th as Goku Day. But we came to talk about the movie.I\'ll start by saying this: I liked the film... until the part where the beatings begun, there after the movie was falling to my taste so much that came to my mind the idea better get out of the theater.But before dwelling on this boredom that caused me the film, I will say what I liked:-Art: 8.The animation of Battle of the Gods was very...good, but still could not help feeling that there was ""something"" that did not fit the picture. Now in F, animators greatly improved animation, for example, in the last film was little hair thing organic Goku not sit here.-Story 5.Actually, seeing the synopsis briefly were giving, were some things that left a bad taste, but since seeing the film, I thought some of them were well excused and doesn\'t left you with the idea that Toriyama had forgotten his own canon. But beware, they maybe covered the issues that concerned me before seeing the film, but does not mean they have committed other horrors that I will explain later.Anyway, now it comes what I did not like.-Sound: 5.At first, the music. I don\'t mean that it is bad, it is non-existent! The music was not heard, and you had to distract a bit from the movie to see if you heard something. Throughout the film I heard only two songs, and one of those was the theme of the movie who kept shouting ""Frieza! Frieza!"" like twenty times in the chorus (which by the way is not nearly as good as Hero FLOW).-Character: 4.Another thing I did not like was the choice of the leading cast to fight Frieza. I understand that 18 has been stayed home to care for her daughter, I applaud that also the fact that Chaos and Yamcha to stay hidden out there to not be killed and a new meme of Dragon Ball.""Hey Yamcha, have you seen...?""[Insert here Yamcha Death Meme]""What?! But if we\'re not even fighting!""But what the hell, Toriyama?! What are Roshi and Ten Shin Han doing there?! Roshi stopped being support since the saga of Piccolo and Ten Shin Han two after, when Nappa used him as mop.The next downside is that this film use information that it\'s not on the series or films. At the start of the frame we see Jako the Galactic Patrolman.Now, I\'m sure everyone here knows that Jako is the protagonist of a proto pseudo-prequel manga Dragon Ball. The problem here is that many of those who watched Dragon Ball did not read that manga, so when Jako appeared and mentioned Bulma\'s sister ... not only the children said What? But also many of the adults who accompanied them.The problem with Jako is that it is just a meaningless pretext to warn the appearance of Frieza, when that same role it could have made any character that can detect the ki, because when Frieza went to Earth for the first time and Future Trunks kicked his ass, all the warriors could even feel it even when I was still far away. As someone said: ""The reference is only good if everyone understands"", and outside of Japan I think the vast majority did not understand the reference that Toriyama put.-Enjoyment: 4.But ... this is Dragon Ball, and as such you can not ask for a perfect and error-free argument. Dragon Ball needs only two things to be good: good comedy and good fights, and the film complies with that in the first half of the film, good comedy and the action sequence of the few Z warriors gathered against Frieza\'s eight thousand troops is great, but when Goku and Frieza show stellar transformations of the film, the thing starts to stink.I have no complaint about Golden Frieza, Toriyama knows explain it without sounding ridiculous. What was a complete stupidity was that of ...""I am a Saiyan God who became Super Saiyan""¡Tori! Really there was no need to create a transformation for the transformation of the last film, which incidentally the transformation is useless because Beerus defeated it in a matter of seconds.It would have been Goku this time could control the Divine Ki, as far as I was, in the last film he did not control and therefore Beerus managed to use him as mop, so Goku could demonstrate the power of this transformation he could not in the last film could have been a good reason. This new transformation seemed no more an excuse to sell more toys and DLCs in videogames. Tori, I never thought you\'d fall so low to the point doing pure nonsense with your franchise as Kuramada just to make easy money.After the bad shot of the Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan is passed, one would say ""well, at least now the fight will be good"". Nope. The fight is boring. In Dragon Ball Z and movies of this, we know that Goku (or whoever the protagonist) will win, but when it comes time, the enemy is infinitely more powerful than our hero and that\'s exciting to see when Goku can finally win. Here throughout the fight I kept saying ""No, Frieza will not defeat Goku"".The height of the ridiculous is the way that Frieza takes advantage in the fight against Goku ... making one of his minions to shoot him in the back with a laser gun! I need to say how ridiculous was that? If it had happened when Goku was in normal mode it would have been passable, but they shoot when in Full Power Mode, when that transformation has endured more powerful attacks coming from Frieza in Full Power Mode.In the last film we had people complaining about how ridiculous it was Vegeta singing in an attempt to calm Beerus, well, now where\'s those same people complaining that according to Toriyama, to beat Goku only takes a pistol and grab him neglected even though is at its most powerful transformation?And I don\'t want to continue with what follows: A Deus Ex Machina shoehorned only to rob Vegeta\'s glorious moment, that when he finally is going to fuck the motherfucker that made him miserable his childhood just after Vegeta has saved Goku. Tori seriously, do not do that, do not create a badass moment which justifies have held half an hour of crap, and then you wash your ass in the last three minutes with it (literally).-Overall: 4In short, what is my final verdict on the film? This: it is a typical movie Dragon Ball Z added nothing to the plot (which has been forged since the previous film) and it was only fan service for those who do not like the previous film under the guise of ""is a lot of comedy and nothing of Dragon Ball"". good, but still could not help feeling that there was ""something"" that did not fit the picture. Now in F, animators greatly improved animation, for example, in the last film was little hair thing organic Goku not sit here.-Story 5.Actually, seeing the synopsis briefly were giving, were some things that left a bad taste, but since seeing the film, I thought some of them were well excused and doesn\'t left you with the idea that Toriyama had forgotten his own canon. But beware, they maybe covered the issues that concerned me before seeing the film, but does not mean they have committed other horrors that I will explain later.Anyway, now it comes what I did not like.-Sound: 5.At first, the music. I don\'t mean that it is bad, it is non-existent! The music was not heard, and you had to distract a bit from the movie to see if you heard something. Throughout the film I heard only two songs, and one of those was the theme of the movie who kept shouting ""Frieza! Frieza!"" like twenty times in the chorus (which by the way is not nearly as good as Hero FLOW).-Character: 4.Another thing I did not like was the choice of the leading cast to fight Frieza. I understand that 18 has been stayed home to care for her daughter, I applaud that also the fact that Chaos and Yamcha to stay hidden out there to not be killed and a new meme of Dragon Ball.""Hey Yamcha, have you seen...?""[Insert here Yamcha Death Meme]""What?! But if we\'re not even fighting!""But what the hell, Toriyama?! What are Roshi and Ten Shin Han doing there?! Roshi stopped being support since the saga of Piccolo and Ten Shin Han two after, when Nappa used him as mop.The next downside is that this film use information that it\'s not on the series or films. At the start of the frame we see Jako the Galactic Patrolman.Now, I\'m sure everyone here knows that Jako is the protagonist of a proto pseudo-prequel manga Dragon Ball. The problem here is that many of those who watched Dragon Ball did not read that manga, so when Jako appeared and mentioned Bulma\'s sister ... not only the children said What?

At the same time, our main cast had some of their wardrobe revamped, and I thought this was a refreshing change.—There was a lot of action, which some people felt was lacking in Battle of the Gods. Though I personally liked the balance in its prequel, Fukkatsu no F definitely delivered the action that we all know and love DBZ for. Fights were well-choreographed and it was nice to see certain characters back in action.—Like its predecessor, DBZRF had the whole theater laughing. Though the movie had more action in general, it still kept a decent balance and had plenty of funny moments.—Though I enjoyed Battle of the Gods more and I will now proceed to bash this movie, it was comparatively amazing. DBZ isn\'t known for having great movies, or rather it\'s notorious for having terrible ones. But Fukkatsu no F is an exception that trumps what we\'ve seen in the past, and it was 100% worth the watch.Negatives:—The movie was a bit overhyped.Battle of the Gods was such an adventure to me that its high quality caught me completely off guard. Perhaps because I heard DBZRF was even better, I was disappointed when it finally came. I rewatched the former right before watching the latter, and Battle of the Gods just struck me as more effective comically, dramatically, and nostalgically than its sequel.—Goku has attitude problems for the sake of plot.I feel like Goku\'s personality was compromised and exaggerated. While he has always had the problem of being too trusting, and this has put him, his friends, and the planet in danger (as Whis summarized rather accurately); this stemmed more from his love of battle than from cockiness. Although he has developed some arrogance with the progression of the story (pronounced, for example, in the Buu saga), he has always swallowed his pride when he needed to. In Battle of the Gods, Beerus even acknowledged this when Goku accepted the power of those around him to achieve the SSJG form (his pride would have him avoid this ""cheap"" power up). That they make Goku seem like such an asshole, therefore, was a big negative for me.—Frieza is OP for the sake of plot.While Goku was mentally weakened for plot, Frieza was physically buffed to the point of absurdity. I can accept that Frieza could make a formidable foe when empowered with dragon balls, tech, etc, but for him to literally reach godlike power simply by training for a few months... it\'s insulting. Going into this movie, I assumed Frieza would get his power through a wish; as the movie progressed, I saw this wasn\'t the case. As Sorbet bragged about all the new technology Frieza\'s army had acquired, I assumed it would play a large role in his training; to my knowledge, it didn\'t. Literally until the credits began to roll, I thought Frieza would increase his power through some cheap trick. A deal with Beerus? Namek? ANYTHING? Nothing. Just a little willpower.—Frieza isn\'t OP enough.Even with his unbelievable power increase, Frieza never felt like a real threat to me. Watching Battle of the Gods, I never knew what would happen next. Even with the SSJG power, Goku couldn\'t match Beerus\'s power. However, Goku has little trouble dealing with the big bad guy this time around. In fact, (LARGE SPOILER ALERT) Sorbet is the one to stop him (really?). Meanwhile, Vegeta\'s chilling unscathed a few hundred feet away. Clearly Frieza doesn\'t pose much of a threat. JUST IN CASE, Beerus and Whis are there too. By the end of the movie, I was honestly still waiting for a bigger complication. The odds were just too stacked against him for me to feel like we were in any danger. Though I have yet to start DB Super, the whole movie felt to me like an introduction to the new series.—Jaco the Galactic FuckboyOkay, sorry. That was too harsh. But they blatantly advertise Akira Toriyama\'s ""Jaco the Galactic Patrolman"" with this hyperextended cameo. To be fair, they do a good job of it and Jaco serves as good comic relief. However, the little snot steals the spotlight and I felt a little betrayed. Coupled with the poor quality of DBS, this gives me the unshakeable feeling that the Dragon Ball franchise is selling out.Overall, it was a great movie despite its faults, but because of them I was a little underwhelmed. Still I give it a 9/10.Feedback is welcome, so tell me how to improve! ^_^ — The art was beautiful eye candy, and I loved seeing classic themes like the uniforms of Frieza\'s men remastered.

Still I give it a 9/10.Feedback is welcome, so tell me how to improve! ^_^', ""Allow me to preface that I am the biggest Dragon Ball fan out there. Since I first followed the series in 1999, Dragon Ball has inspired me in ways subtle and great, from fitness to creativity. Of all the anime series I have seen, none inspires me to be a better version of myself than Dragon Ball, as hyperbolic (lol) as that might sound. That being said, I am now going to argue why this film is one of the worst entries in the franchise, on the same level as the first half of GT and Bio-Broly. I do not enjoy trashing other people's works...or writing negative reviews, but I was uniquely disappointed by this film.From the start, the premise is already rote and uninteresting. I suppose on some level it is dramatically ironic to see a villain return from the dead as the heroes have so many times before, but we must keep in mind the timing of this film's release. Dragon Ball Super had not yet aired, and Battle of Gods left us with many fascinating plot threads to explore in the form of the twelve universes, the relationship of the Kaioshin to the Hakaishin, and the past history of the first Super Saiyan God. Instead we get this cynical, financially motivated exploiting of the franchise's most popular villain. Frieza's character arc, as well as his personal conflicts with Goku and Vegeta, were handled fantastically in the Namek saga, and many argue that was the series' finest story arc. We did not need to return to this well-worn ground. And to have the whole film focus on this fight, when we know Frieza will just fail again is really disappointing.The explanation for Frieza's newfound powers is offensively idiotic. Dragon Ball and DBZ had really solid power scaling and the various foes the Z-Fighters faced escalated in a plausible way. First Goku faces other martial artists, then an army, then lesser demons, then aliens, then cyborgs/androids, then an ancient genie, and now he finds himself sparring with gods. Retreading Frieza breaks the series' themes of constant self-betterment and and escalation. And to have Frieza gain godlike power over four months of training is ridiculous. Furthermore, Golden Frieza is a truly hideous and garish design - perhaps that was the point, but even still it reminds me of a basketball mascot. Go Lakers!I feel much the same about Super Saiyan Blue, which was a wise revision from the original name of Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan (SSGSS). Just LOL. But really the form is literally a recolor of the iconic golden-haired Super Saiyan form and nothing else. The fan designs for Super Saiyan 5 are far better than this, undeniably. It is cool to see Goku and Vegeta on the same level of power though. I also liked Goku and Vegeta's new costumes in this movie. Black Saiyan armor suits Vegeta well, and Goku's new gi reminds me of his gi from the end of Z, only orange.The fights were displeasing. I really wished they stuck with two-dimensional animation, the interplay of 3-D stuff with 2-D made the choreography a bit strange for sure. If you're not sure what I mean, compare the fights in this movie with the battles from the earlier DBZ films like Tree of Might or Dead Zone. This certainly does compare to the franchise's heights. There is no grace or technique to the battles, this is rock-em sock-em robots. I know this could have been done better.Also, there is a huge problem in the presence of Beerus and Whis. Regardless of your feelings on the two characters, their presence dramatically reduces the tension of this battle to the point of farce. Beerus and Whis are still leagues beyond Goku and Vegeta, and could one-shot Frieza if the whim occurred to them. Imagine if during the first Broly movie two all-powerful bystanders stood around and made jokes about ice cream while the Z-fighters were getting their asses kicked. How absurd.The ending is a pileup of puzzling decisions. Goku is pierced by a laser gun while he is in Super Saiyan Blue. Goku's destructive capability in this form is many times universal judging by his feats in the fight with Beerus, and we know that ki boosts durability as well as power. The idea that a seasoned fighter like Goku would let his guard down to this degree is almost character assassination. It is hard to imagine liking Goku as a character and also agreeing with this decision, because this makes him look like a true clown, rather than a martial artist. Vegeta is teased with the idea of personally executing the man who personally carried out the genocide of his people and enslaved him for 20 years, and of course he is denied this. Frieza somehow manages to destroy the planet while Vegeta has an energy blast readied at point-blank range, but this is undone with TIME TRAVEL of all things, courtesy of Whis, who is nothing more than a plot device. They go back in time so that Goku can swoop in and steal the kill from Vegeta. Obviously this is not dramatically satisfying at all - Frieza was not defeated by the strength and cunning of Goku and Vegeta, who both look like ridiculous fools in this movie. He was beaten by literal time travel hax. I apologize for summarizing, but putting these plot points in writing can perhaps help communicate my frustration.In summary, nothing in this film has any consequences and can be skipped. Of course, Frieza returns later on in Dragon Ball Super, and Super Saiyan Blue is used a lot in the future arcs, but this film is not necessary for the viewer to understand those particular points. This entire story is creatively bankrupt and is a blight on the Dragon Ball franchise. or writing negative reviews, but I was uniquely disappointed by this film.From the start, the premise is already rote and uninteresting.

The film does employ comedy and a sense of homeliness like the prequel, as it includes each of the characters we're all so familiar, all cozied up and assimilated into everyday life, right where we left them in Dragon Ball Z. Gohan has grown up and made himself comfortable as a family man and a geek. He's unsure if he can even still turn super...saiyan, as has been focusing on being a father and a husband. Master Roshi returns to the platform in his Dragon Ball skin, with skill and a functioning role beyond just being funny, though he is still hilarious. Do you think we can beat them? he asks. When no is the answer, he says, 'good, I just wanted ot be sure I wasn't being a chicken.' He even throws in a kamehame wave. Krillin becomes a cop, and it is funnier than anything, as it is perfect for him. With the Z fighters, he is bottom of the best. As a cop, he is a top dog.The film has a bit more plot than DRAGON BALL Z: BATTLE OF THE GODS, considering that film was just sort of there to set up a premiss for Dragon Ball Super and this sequel film. Frieza comes back, and he has been reconstructed. Brought back by the dragon balls, and put together again (he was cut into pieces by future Trunks in Dragon Ball Z) with a new machine constructed by the Frieza Force. He's cocky, upset that it took so long, and he had to sit and wait, tormented in Earth's hell. He wants to enact his revenge against Goku, but know that Goku has trained, and he must too train, for his first time even. He had never trained a day in his life, and was still so powerful... imagine what he could become and what would happen to his strength and ability if he were to actually work at it? He trains for a few months and jets himself to Earth, destroying a city as his 'hello.' Bulma calls for Goku and Vegeta to return to Earth after being informed by Jaco, a cute little space cop with a contagious voice. Goku and Vegeta have been training at Beerus' place and do not hear of the Frieza attack until Gohan, Piccalo, Krillin, having shaved his head... wonderful, really! hah, Jaco, Master Roshi, and Tien are deep in battle fighting members of the Frieza force. Once they do hear, Goku has the fighters power up, he locks on, and uses instant transmission, bringing Vegeta along with him.They fight, and overall, the fighting is great, and it is not sloppy and just 'fighting,' but they actually employ actual martial arts. They use wing chun, and block punches and kicks and blows. The only complain I have here is the obvious CGI. Maybe it was necessary. I don't know. I think though, it wsa quicker, and it was cheaper too, so that is why the CGI was put into place, but it looks bad, and it looks out of place and awkward.The end of the movie, Goku looks beat. He's turned super saiyan god, like in the first, and so too has Vegeta. The ending is a bit cheap. I don't want to say too much, though you'll probably see it from a m ile away, as did I , and everybody else, but it involve time travel, and everybody ends up A-OK. It is by no means a great movie, but fun and well made for any fan of Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, or maybe even Dragon Ball GT. saiyan, as has been focusing on being a father and a husband.

He's turned super saiyan god, like in the first, and so too has Vegeta. The ending is a bit cheap. I don't want to say too much, though you'll probably see it from a m ile away, as did I , and everybody else, but it involve time travel, and everybody ends up A-OK. It is by no means a great movie, but fun and well made for any fan of Dragon Ball, Dragon Ball Z, or maybe even Dragon Ball GT."", 'Oh boy, when I first saw the announcements on YouTube about this movie, I already had a bad feeling about it. Now look, its been a long time but I\'ve been a huge fan of the Dragonball franchise (and a Frieza fanboy) since I was young, which is why I was asking myself why would Toei make this movie to begin with if they were going to kill my favorite character of the franchise again?However months passed and the movie got released on cinema when I was temporarily living in Argentina back in 2015, so I decided to give it a chance just for the...sake of curiosity. Pretty much all my worries were confirmed to say the least. I could go into more detail but I will just mention here the parts that really irritated me:-During the fight against Frieza\'s army, Piccolo somehow struggles against a fodder footsoldier, and they have Gohan go Super Saiyan in order to beat him instead. Bullshit!-There is no tention in the entire fight considering that Frieza gets murked by base Goku and even more despite achieving the Golden Form.-Goku turns into Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan with blue hair, only to get one-shotted in the heart by a laser beam from Sorbet\'s ring, after beating Frieza. Bullshit and hilarious in a ""so bad its good"" way.-Frieza basically destroys Earth and kills everyone, except for the Z warriors which get teleported by Whis just in time. Then they decide to time-travel back in order for Goku to kill Frieza with a Kamehameha. Bullshit. This has to be the most underwhelming and insulting ending in the entire franchise which gets resolved in less than 2 minutes and it all ends with Goku laughing like an idiot like nothing ever happened.This movie was pointless, it added nothing to the story except for 2 new power-ups. Goku acts like a confident dumbass for the entirety of the movie despite the fact that he gets called out for it. A classic villain like Frieza gets treated like a joke and killed off again. Frieza eventually returns again in Super where he gets his time to shine mind you, but makes you wonder what was the point of doing this movie? If they wanted to make Frieza relevant, they could\'ve easily brought him back directly in Super and reveal him training with other villains in Hell, rather than having him sticked in a cocoon for cheap-comedy. Its quite dissapointing that many fans were so driven by the hype that they gave the film a higher score in many sites than it deserved.Any good stuff?Roshi fighting again onscreen (I can appreciate that)The Golden form, I suppose it was cool for a power-up although I still prefer the design that Cooler had in his final form.The scene were Krilin has ""We Are"" from One Piece as ringtone.Frieza one-shotting nerd Gohan in his base form (hilarious karma for that scene in the Fusion Reborn movie) sake of curiosity.

I\'ve read the manga, watched DB,DBZ,DBGT, movies, specials, etc. Dragon Ball has had a ton of impact on my life and sadly, if I had to describe DBZ Movie 15 in one word, I would use disappointment.My disappointment for the movie stems not from a case of overHYPE but rather from something much different. After all the anime and shounen I\'ve watched over the years, what makes Dragon Ball so special? It\'s certainly not the fight scenes...or the over the top transformations and power ups, that\'s for sure. It\'s the emotion. The feeling of desperation when the planet is going to blow in 5 minutes. The feeling of despair as Gohan watches Cell kill his friends and family. The feeling of hope as Goku descends to defeat the Saiyans. The feeling of weakness as Vegeta discovers how weak he truly is. These feelings are what makes Dragon Ball, and these feelings are what the new movie lacks.THE BAD:THE LACK OF EMOTIONNow let\'s see why the new movie is lacking in the emotion department directly. A new transformation is fine and all but it just kinda happened. Super Cyan was just there as a means to show that Goku/Vegeta had reached a new level of power. But did you feel the desperation that came from SSJ1. The loss that caused SSJ2? Even the sheer epicness of SSJ3? How about the need for SSJG in Battle of the Gods? Nope, Goku/Vegeta just casually transform into the strongest power up, no biggie.The need to defeat Frieza didn\'t even feel like it was there. As it is, the DB universe is filled with too many failsafes. Dragonballs overcoming death, and now, even time is a crutch when they screw up. This leads to the feeling that you don\'t actually NEED to defeat Frieza. Even with his power up, the fight seemed pretty anticlimatic, he didn\'t really have either of them on the ropes.""Power comes in response to a need not a desire, you have to create that need"" - GokuThe need for a new SSJ transformation was never really there. I guess it was sorta there for Frieza to become stronger but it was never really elaborated on.The lack of emotion in the new movie really got to me but I suppose I should talk about the other parts of the movie as well...UNNECESSARY FANSERVICEIt\'s cool and all that they brought back some Z fighters and even had a cameo with Jaco the Galactic Patrolman but I felt like it was a little unnecessary. This kinda plays in with the emotion thing. The fact that the only reason they are there is for the sake of fan service, bothers me. As stated by Frieza, Gohan alone could easily take out all of the Frieza forces alone. So why doesn\'t he? Fanservice.PLOT INCONSISTENCIESWhy is Master Roshi able to fight on par against opponents that Gohan/Piccolo are fighting? Why is a railgun able to almost kill a Super Cyan God, a being that could go toe to toe with a being that could destroy planets with a yawn? Why does Frieza stop trying to blow up the Earth when Goku approaches him with a Kamehameha? These are the questions. Yeah, I know that DBZ has a ton of plot holes but come on, these are really stretching it. Are railguns the new Kryptonite?THE GOOD:Well the art style is pretty polished and the sound reminds of the good ol nostalgic dragonball days. I thought the idea was great with Frieza, the original universe conquerer coming back for vengeance was great. After that, I\'m running out of good things to say about the movie.THE RESTDragon Ball has never been a super serious anime, but at the very least, it was serious when it needed to be. Now, it feels like the whole thing has become a complete joke.I have a feeling that people only liked the new DBZ Movie for the sake of it being a new DBZ Movie. As in, imagine if the movie wasn\'t DBZ, would you still like it? Do you like it because it\'s good or just because you\'re Dragonball starved and want new content/want to feel nostalgic?

I\'m supposed to be out there, watching something... anything else, but this! It would... if just once in a while, to watch some actually good, well-made anime, and write actually positive review about it! And what do I do instead?! Listen to some doucheback-fan of mine, who once asked me to watch, and review this piece of trash - obviously even my fans hate me! - and offer thy my sweet, delicate ass, to the herds of butthurt fanboys, who will undoubtedly tear me right open for stuffing, for ever...even laying my finger on their precious franchise! But, since I seem to live and breath from pain, I may as well go all out with it!The ""Asspull of Epic Proportions"" staring this time with Frieza, as a Golden Showertoy, and Carrot cake as a Blue God of Merchandicing, featuring all of those, that used to to jack-shit before, staring behind the curtains and serving ice cream to that purple Cat-thing, from the previous movie. Frieza wants to play, and Carrot\'s ready and loaded for use - three hours tops, watch for over-heating! Once again it\'s just ""so cool"" to see these stupid idiots risking their life and limb for a conflict, that could\'ve easily just been wished away, and since Veggie-ape is still so popular with the fans, he\'s somehow allowed to also have this ridicculous blue hair dye... which is exactly the same plotpoint that happened to him twise before, since Toriyama can\'t keep this guy freaking dead! Once again, stupidity takes place, and look at that... everyone\'s dead! But donät worry, kiddies! Deux Ex Machina happens, and all is well again. Tune in next time, when fans of the show tell Toriyama, how they want their favourite apes be turned into Super Saiyan Super Dragon Titan Super God Super Saiyan XVII, Trunks finds out he\'s really a she, and how Piccolo and Gohan finally have a baby together!There, I did it! Can I now have my flask back, please?!My thoughtprosses, while watching this movie, was pretty much summed up as such; ""Oh, those guys, that should\'ve been dead since the first arc of DBZ are still here - cool... meatsheald! It\'s not like they\'re here for any other reason, than just some cheap fan-service, and some extra minutes! And looky that! The only reasonable, honorable, and downright respectable example for a hero - goes by name Gohan - that this franchise has to offer, is now not only smaller in size, but also with a character, and purpose! Sucks to be upworthy model citizen, husband and father, right - Lord knows, the world hates those! And who\'s our villain, then? That albino, psychotic manchild/transexual albino lizard, whos been dead once, brought back as a sexmachine, killed like a runaway-joke, and now resurrected - as a title says! - a golden... powertool? What a ripoff! And what does he want this time? A revenge, from the Jaws 3 - sure... shocker. And oh how nice - the purple cat-thing, and his flamboyant chambermaid are here too... to eat ice cream, and clean the mess up, after our heroes have - yet again - failed and killed us all, or worse! Truly, these two are perfect for the cause, so that rest of our useless crew, can just sit back, an tremble and lament upon their utter uselesness, like a heroes they undoubtedly are - better stay dead, if you\'re just gonna get in a way, dumbasses! And oh, what did I know - the world exploded... again! We\'re all dead... again! Well, that\'s not so bad - Boo did it already, and Cell truly tried, so... no biggy! Let\'s just turn back in time, and fuck around some more with our useless villain, and our clearly homocidal sosiopaths/psychotic idiots... no sorry, heroes, to give our fans some more pics to wank on us!""If you can\'t tell by that alone, I was in pain.As always - as expected, from this franchise - there\'s no plot, no expansion of the characters but quite the opposite, no subtlety, paperthin-as-always story with no urgency, or interesting ideas - rock \'em sock \'em- robots, flying through the air while flailing at eachoter, and trashtalking stupid pointless shit, to give the movie some more extra minutes... truly fascinating! - shallow premise with no stakes or consequenses, via everlasting deux ex machinas, and overall pointlesness all over the place, that it\'s almost hard to believe, that this is actually a movie, and not some 15-minutes- long special!Seriously... I can\'t believe that I\'m saying this, but while I suffered my way through DBZ... Freiza was my hero! He killed the saiyans, he killed Vegeta, and he killed the spare - so to say - of the cast, that in time, turned out to be just ultimately and completely useless, in this super saiyan-wankfest, thus giving Krillin the heroic death he deserved, and Vegeta the ending, he at least deserved! He was a hero, and a liberator! And what\'d they do to him?! Made him this money-milking hooker/dumbass villain, from every american horror-movie ever made, that gets killed every single title he\'s in, but just keeps coming back for more, for sequels - next time, I bet he\'s gonna get a free sundae, too! And just to keep his rotting carcass fresh, we give him a new paintjob, every time when Toriyama needs some more weed-money... which\'s about every three-four movies, for now on, I presume!Well, shit... welcome to the pokemon-ship, you guys - this ship ain\'t gonna see some land, nor fresh new skanks in a long time, so better make away now with what you can! Re-using villains, and plotpoints like this, may indeed work for the franchise, that doesn\'t even want to try, and for the fans, who\'lll loyally take everything it has to offer, with no thought, nor meaning, but it sure as Hell, does not work, for me!This movie, is a unneeded sequal to an already unneeded movie, based on yet again nothing but fanfiction, and fan-service - without boobs, of course, because... adults hate those! - living and surviving on a life-support, called nostalgia, thus only excisting to squeese out every little bit out of that sweet, juicy carcass of a big, fat monster, that\'s this franchises fanbase, to make their wettest fantasies, and most loosest of dollars, to get some wings, following that same shallow, meaningless and utterly ridiculous ""power porn""-theme, that plagued the last movie... only in this version, played only for shits and giggles, like a joke this movie as a whole, really and truly is. The last two character in a whole franchise, that ever mattered, and will ever matter worth a shit, are now both closest to be called gods, for the sake of tomfoolery - how much more privileged these saiyans really need to get?! - and those who aren\'t - those poor, unlucky bastards with lives, families, and totally wrong, unprivileged plot-genes - are either jokes, or less than that... which I can\'t seem to find proper words to describe them to! This ""porn"", is like a kind of hentai, that\'s all filtered, and blackboxed all over the place to the point of turmoil, with endless loopanimation and halfassed voices, that it\'s no longer proper to call it even a porn anymore! There\'s only so much wanking, that you can do, to the same kind of porn, before it starts to both feel, and taste like a sour shit, and surely, this franchise, has a long time ago hit it\'s lowest low, still not knowing, when to end. It has absolutely nothing more, or anything else to offer, yet it just keeps coming back for more... like a horny teenage boy, who just can\'t take ""no"" for a answer.Someone needs to take their hands out of their pants, and stop giving Toriyama all this money, to make these movies, so he can\'t waste any more ink, and trees, to make paper for this shit! Not watching this movie - if you\'re not already been subdued to it\'s toxic influence - is the same as saving dozen panda cubs, from starvation, and every time, you wank away any more money out of your pants, for this franchise... the panda cub will die!Story: 1Art: 4Sound: 3Characters: 2Enjoyment: 1Overall: 1 even laying my finger on their precious franchise!

No joke I actually had to pause the movie a couple of times due to utter frustration and or disappointment.The animation in this movie is painfully average, seeming more like a direct to television movie rather than a theatrical release film. Also it has way too much CGI where it is...distracting. They couldn't even animate Goku and Frieza fighting half the time. distracting.

A few months of training is all it took for Freeza to be nearly at the level of a god of destruction, give me a break. If you took the old power levels and tried to get Freeza from 1 million to whatever Majin Buu was, that alone would take years. It disrespects the journey Goku and Vegeta had to take to get to this level.This of course continues in Dragon Ball Super. The Saiyan's go from not being able to become Super Saiyan to on par with...Goku in 3 days. Disgusting. Goku in 3 days. Disgusting."", 'A review in ten notes:1) This is forty-five minutes too long.2) Fittingly, this is also a nearly beat-by-beat remake of the fifty-minute Return of Cooler movie from the early 90s, just padded to hell with scenes of, fanservice I guess? I\'m not sure who was served by this.3) Well, besides Master Roshi actually contributing to a fight for the first time in any of these movies, or in all of DBZ for that matter. Really sucks that I hate a movie so much where the minor characters technically get to contribute a lot.4) Actually yeah, the whole ""give everyone a moment to shine even if...they are irrelevant to the plot"" thing is even more egregious here than in Battle of Gods, because there are actual stakes, technically, and it just goes on forever because we have to get four minutes of Tenshinhan punching some mooks I guess.5) Where\'s Yamcha????6) One of my favorite parts of Fusion Reborn was this scene about halfway through where all the dead people are coming back to life, and that includes Frieza, who is rampaging around in a city somewhere until Gohan shows up. As soon as he recognizes him, Frieza flips out, and then gets one-shotted in a display of just how far the series had come since the early days of big buff gay space alien man. This movie would have been quite a lot better if they weren\'t taking Frieza seriously at all, and THEN he suddenly overwhelms them all because he got gold-plated armor or whatever. But that would take actual writers.7) Speaking of that, what the hell was Gohan doing in this, again? Isn\'t he supposed to be like ""Mystic Gohan"" or whatever now where he\'s permanently in his strongest form, which is WAY stronger than any non-Goku characters. However, here, they\'ve completely forgotten it and he\'s basically a human on the sidelines. I\'m not one to complain about continuity in something as silly as a Dragon Ball movie, but they\'ve basically written off the best character in the franchise and relegated him to a needless extra like all the other sidelines guys.8) How does a ninety minute movie feel like it\'s three hours long? How did they manage this?9) You do NOT get a pass on using CGI models in your fight scenes because you didn\'t have the budget to animate properly in 2D. Dragon Ball is one of the most popular multimedia franchises in the world. I\'m not buying what you\'re selling here.10) Lastly, the OP and ED are pretty bad.

However, here, they\'ve completely forgotten it and he\'s basically a human on the sidelines. I\'m not one to complain about continuity in something as silly as a Dragon Ball movie, but they\'ve basically written off the best character in the franchise and relegated him to a needless extra like all the other sidelines guys.8) How does a ninety minute movie feel like it\'s three hours long? How did they manage this?9) You do NOT get a pass on using CGI models in your fight scenes because you didn\'t have the budget to animate properly in 2D. Dragon Ball is one of the most popular multimedia franchises in the world. I\'m not buying what you\'re selling here.10) Lastly, the OP and ED are pretty bad. That\'s all.', 'Revival of F or Fukkatsu no F or Ressurection F or whatever you want to call it, is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.Revival of F is about Frieza coming back to life for the billions of time.That is the premise, Frieza returning... With a power up. That\'s all.This alone raises a bunch of red flags. Battle of Gods, as awful as it was, set up a new Universe with countless possibilities for new encounter. Instead we get a movie just about fighting a resurrected bad guy that even someone like Goten himself could beat easily.But it\'s ok because Frieza gains a...power up that makes him stronger than Goku in his strongest form.But we are getting ahead of ourselves. Let\'s step back a few steps.Frieza is one of the characters that has been brought back the most often. Even after this movie premiered, Frieza is keep coming back. He is no longer a threat and Toei just can\'t stop milking him.I have seen countless people defending this because the other times were ""not canon"", despite people forgetting Mecha Frieza was in the actual manga.But how is it this time that Frieza is back? Back then it was because of the gates to hell opening, ghost warriors, surviving the destruction of a planet and so on.This time Frieza was brought back with the Dragon Balls by some new officer in Frieza\'s army who\'s name is not worth remembering. The reason they brought Frieza back was because they needed his leadership, which translates to power in this case.So they use the Pilaf Gang somehow knowing they know about the Dragon Balls and wasting the other wishes of Shenron bringing back Frieza in pieces.There have been arguments about why Frieza was brought back as chunks instead as a whole or ash, as well as why he was being brought back at all despite the time restriction of how much time had to pass to grant a wish like that.But Dragon Ball\'s revival policy regardless of Dende\'s buff makes no sense. Also Shenron didn\'t really seem to want to bring Frieza back and scammed the underlings if anything.The real reason they did bring Frieza back like that is to lure him away from earth so that he doesn\'t get one shotted by Piccolo.The problem is that despite all characters being fast enough to arrive where Frieza was resurrected and noticed Shenron was summoned, nobody bothered to go and finish the job.In other words: Gohan, Piccolo, Krillin etc. were dumb for the sake of the plot.There is no way in hell these people forgot how dangerous it is to have someone like Frieza alive, even if they are vastly stronger at this point.Frieza got put together with new technology in the Frieza army. The interesting thing is that Frieza reverts back to his 1st form for some reason and has his armor back... After hearing Boo was defeated by Goku, Frieza decided to train claiming he had never trained once in his life.This is where shit goes out the window. Frieza has apparently no training experience, we don\'t see what he does, but someone manages to get strong enough to fight the likes of Goku. In 4 month to be exact.There are so many problems with this:1. Frieza will surpass many vastly stronger characters at this point. We are talking Piccolo, Cell, Dabura, Gotenks, Ultimate Gohan. Those are exponentially stronger than Frieza Saga characters. To just surpass them with off screen training is beyond retarded.2. If all Frieza had to do is train to get this strong, then the entire point of destroying planet Vegeta and the fear of the Super Saiyan has been meaningless. If Frieza just trained 4 month after losing to Goku, he would have one shotted Future Trunks with a yawn. This devalues all of the Frieza Saga and the Super Saiyan transformation.Meanwhile we get a glimpse of Goku and Vegeta training under Whis. One of the worst things RoF does is turning Goku\'s strength into a weakness devaluating his training under Mr. Popo which didn\'t just consist Ki sensing. Goku can sense movements and while in a calm state he can dodge attacks without thinking (kinda like what UI tries to do).We will get to this later as well as one of the worst plot devices which gets hinted at.Frieza appears with his entire army on earth. This is the next problem of this movie, the supporting cast is completely worthless. Frieza is purposely just watching his fodder soldiers getting slaughtered. Many people think this is great, but honestly it\'s just pointless filler to pad out the runtime. None of the things need to exist. Piccolo can just release a destruction wave and kill everybody in and instant.After the soldiers are defeated, a guy confirmed to be Dodoria Level enters the battle and beats the crap out of Piccolo. That was one of the dumbest scenes considering Piccolo is fused with Kami and doesn\'t have any weighted clothing. Struggling with someone at Dodoria Level.It gets worse when Gohan appeared and HAD TO USE SUPER SAIYAN to beat the Dodoria Wannabe. A complete embarrassment.Once that is done, they just summon Goku (and Vegeta) by powering up. Then they ended up being cheerleaders for Goku and Vegeta again.After Frieza transforms into his first form, we get a bit of a fight until the next terrible thing happens. Goku doesn\'t go Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, Super Saiyan 3 or Super Saiyan God, but to his new most powerful form: SUPER SAIYAN GOD SUPER SAIYAN.One of the dumbest names for a transformation ever.Basically we are just getting Goku vs Frieza from the Namek arc again, only that they are colored differently. These are some of the laziest power ups of all time. Just pallet swaps.Frieza refers to himself as GOLDEN FRIEZA, I kid you not. This just feels like the Frieza Saga rehashed in a fanfiction. Frieza even has the same weakness he had in his 100% form which is the reason he fails to beat Goku despite being stronger.Goku trained under 3 Gods and now with Whis who is the master of Bills, yet, he almost loses to Frieza who trained off screen for 4 month. Pathetic.Goku, who hated Frieza and threatened him to never appear before his eyes in the Frieza Saga, decides to let Frieza live and suggest him to train so they can fight again. It renders pointless everything Goku went through in the Frieza Saga and devalues Frieza as a threat.Frieza in this movie isn\'t a threat. Yes, he is stronger than our heroes, but there is no tension because:- we know Goku will train Oob at the end of Z so the entire confrontation is meaningless- Bills and Whis, who we know are stronger, are on earth and can always interrupt the fight- Vegeta is watching from the sidelines. If Frieza were really that dangerous, they can always fuse.This is why the next dumb scene is entirely pointless: Goku getting one shotted by that Frieza Officer who is probably not even stronger than Ginyu. Goku from Z would have never been one shotted by a nobody like that, even if he were in base form. Unlike in Super, in the the movie this scene is countless times worse, because the beam comes from the front meaning it was in Goku\'s eye sight and he should be able to dodge or tank with by increasing his ki. He was in Super Saiyan Blue so how did he get one shotted by a freaking laser?It only existed for letting Vegeta show us that he can use this new, totally original, Super Saiyan form (DONOTSTEAL) against Frieza. I remember fans being amazed by this including Vegeta fans.To me this is just a pathetic scene that existed to humiliate Vegeta if anything. Vegeta was at full strength beating up a weakened Frieza and still loses. You see, Frieza blows up the planet killing Vegeta while he apparently has survived.I am not a Vegeta fan, but even I feel cheated considering Toriyama wanted to give Vegeta fans something to look forward to.But it\'s ok, Whis used his time reversal power to allow Goku to finish off Frieza after being fully healed. This one was one of the worst ways to end a story arc and devalued Frieza\'s existence even more. It felt more like he was just comic releave. He became countless times stronger but felt less threatening than Pilaf.Modern Dragon Ball turned Frieza into Team Rocket. He appears, loses and appears later again. He poses no threat.Music was forgetable. Frieza got a shitty theme song by one of my favorite bands which just shoults FRIEZA, FRIEZA, FRIEZA which cringed the hell out of me. Such a disappointment coming from the guys who made that amazing opening song for Death Note.Any other soundtrack was just forgetable. Don\'t remember a single one.Art was fine during the Frieza vs Goku fight before the original transfomations #DoNotSteal. When the transfomation battle started the fight made no sense in how the planet isn\'t getting wrecked by these overpowered beings fighting (considering Frieza has no selfrestriction its even more questionalbe). Also the CGI really takes out of the movie. Thank God it was temporary.But the shitty story and inconsistencies... not to mention the plot devices would ruin the art even if it looked like Dragon Ball Super Broly.This is why Revival of F sucks. Do NOT watch this garbage movie. power up that makes him stronger than Goku in his strongest form.But we are getting ahead of ourselves.

Do NOT watch this garbage movie.', ""I think Toei or Toriyama have an obsession with Frieza just like with Broly. The dude can't stay death for a single arc.Even if he isn't the centre of the story, his cells are still involved. He is in almost every flashback or with anyone involved. It just doesn't stop. And every time he returns he is the butt of all jokes, even if he gets an illogical power boost like in this movie by training for 6 month off screen and surpass even the latest recolor power up by our Toriyama-Sensei :DFrieza poses no threat. Whis and Beavus are there eating desert while Frieza...shits his pants seeing them. Like in the previous movie Billus is treated like a gary stu and turns everyone into his bitch. Honestly, I feel if instead of a movie we got a slice of life series, Frieza's power up would be more tolerable. But this movie tries to be serious and ruins Frieza in the process. Not that he needed any more humiliation. Trunks, GT, Fusion Reborn etc already did a fantastic job in making Frieza look like a jobber. And Dragon Ball Super would turn Frieza into full Team Rocket.Toriyama-Sensei was inspired by a Music which the people keep yell Frieza. Said music appears in the theatres and its making me honestly laugh. I like a good comedy but I don't feel that was the intended reaction by the directors.How about the fights? So the jobber teams exchange some blows. Piccolo struggles with some orc dude. Is he perfect Cell Level? I doubt. The movie nerved Gohan and Piccolo making them look weaker than they were on Namek. Gohan apparently can't even use his full power and gets humiliated like usual since the Buu Saga.Goku and Frieza would finally enter the fight. For some reason Goku and Vegeta care more about taking turns than just finishing off Frieza who like every DBZ villain would blow up the planet if cornered. Thank god he won't do that...Goku and Frieza would change colors looking like designs I am certain I saw on Deviantart at some point.Then Goku gets almost killed by some gunlaser making him look like a weakling. Isn't he in some kind of God Form? How did that happen when back then he could tank shit like that and not even flinch?Talk about inconsistency.So Vegeta enters the ring and gets killed by Frieza because Frieza did the unthinkable and blew up the planet. :/Thank god we have the Dragon Balls to fix that, but since nobody wanted to animate Porunga for this movie, Whis turns into a plot device who can just rewind time so Frieza can be stopped.I think I spoiled the movie, but seriously I didn't. You can see the ending miles ahead. Vegeta being a jobber and getting humiliated even by a worn down Frieza is Toriyama's specialty. He hates Vegeta and I don't know if I love him for that.Music was meh. I liked the jokes with Jaco. Tien used the Tri Beam so he gets points for trying. The CGI was a turn off, but the colors were pretty. I like pretty colors :]Sadly I can't give this movie a good score. Every character in this movie was a disappointment. The premise is something we have seen billions of times. And it kinda negates the things that happened on Namek. If only Frieza trained before coming to earth... maybe even Super Saiyan Blue Trunks wouldn't be able to stop him.Why didn't Frieza train anyways in the first place? Being scared of Super Saiyans... that fear was unjustified.Also the entire exploration of all the universes was halted wasting the things established from Battle of Gods for a filler movie.And there were no cute waifus. If you can't give me a good story, good fights or ruin previous arcs... the least you can do add someone as hot as Kefla to keep my attention and excitement. If a Love Live movie were called a Dragon Ball Z movie, at least that would get at least a 5. shits his pants seeing them.

For any DBZ fan this should hit right in the childhood as one of the first villains we ever knew has come back from the dead. The set up is this, Frieza has a couple thousand goons left years after his demise, and they finally set out to use the Dragonballs to bring him back to life, luckily for them Pilaf and crew already had 6 of the 7 found by the time they arrive. If you are wondering why the Z fighters didn\'t take...notice, it was mostly due to only 2 of Frieza\'s goons coming to Earth instead of the entire army. With their very impressive technology Frieza is back from the dead and decides before he gets his revenge with Goku that he will have to train first. Roughly 6 months go by and Frieza is ready to fight and brings the whole ""Frieza Force"" along for the ride. Of course Goku and Vegeta are both away training with Whis while Beerus is still taking his very long nap(s). As one would expect the fight begins without them and to me it appeared to be a means to allow characters like Tien, Krillin, and Piccolo a little time on the screen before Goku and Frieza take up the rest. To be frank that\'s about all there is for story, it\'s pretty light on this one but on the plus side it is far less silly than Battle of Gods was. (Depending on your taste that may or may not be a good thing.) Thing is there is still humor to be found but this concept is a bit easier to accept than BoG was.If you were looking for character development you may want to look elsewhere, aside from a couple lines pointing out Goku\'s and Vegeta\'s flaws our characters largely don\'t change. Despite Frieza\'s new form he is really just the same as you remember him from the end of his fight with Goku. If you were like me I had a soft spot for Gohan when I was growing up and to see him become the most powerful fighter at the end of the Cell Saga, by the Buu Saga his character was probably the 3rd most powerful amongst the heroes. If you are wonderings where I am going with this I wanted to say I still think that Gohan may have been the most powerful fighter on Earth despite his lack of any training while Goku and Vegeta were away.  It\'s hard to say exactly since the power levels of these characters has gotten so disproportionate as time has gone along. In the end I hope Gohan gets back into fighting in DBS, would make things more interesting assuming that DBS goes into unknown territory.Now for the ""transformations,"" largely they are cosmetic and serve only to tell us that certain characters are more powerful than others. Also when Frieza invades Earth the Z fighters didn\'t even bother we just got a couple lines explaining that Frieza is more powerful than before and there it is. His final form is something akin to when Goku went Super Saiyan for the first time but if you are expecting some new attack or anything like that you will be disappointed. Also the form of Super Saiyan God that we saw in Battle of Gods may have been an incomplete form so we do see a slight variation but as I said it\'s merely cosmetic. This is where the padding in DBZ comes in. While we make fun of the fact that it took characters forever to change into a new form there was some gravitas to that. Because now the transformations happen so quick you feel underwhelmed by the experience unlike when we first saw Frieza take a new form or when Goku went Super Saiyan.Kind of in line with what I was just saying because of the lack of time we don\'t feel that our heroes are in any kind of danger. A good example is how frequently Bulma goaded Frieza and yet he did nothing. I think in DBZ chances are Bulma would be dead, even with the 5 episodes of filler. Perhaps it was that I couldn\'t imagine Frieza magically getting so strong that he would be more powerful than Majin Buu. In any case there are just one too many deus ex moments that undercut any possible danger we may feel for the characters.The fights were well done as one would expect for anything Dragonball related, however...there was an increased use of 3D animation which for the most part did not blend well with the traditional animation. There are a few cases where you couldn\'t tell the difference, but the filmmakers made a point to make it obvious to us when they were using it. I hope for future features or Dragonball Super that they either stop trying with the 3D or develop and blend the technology for better use.I may sound fairly critical of this movie but it\'s way easier to point out faults initially than the pluses. Look at the score(s) that I gave this movie, I do feel this is a step up from Battle of Gods and this definitely had my attention more there was a point where I could tell I was truly drawn in versus being aware that I was watching a movie. If you are a fan of the series or just want a trip down nostalgia lane this a good way to spend your time for an evening. notice, it was mostly due to only 2 of Frieza\'s goons coming to Earth instead of the entire army.

This whole ""God"" thing is indeed interesting....12 universes, each with its own God of Destruction....Goku\'s new form and Vegeta\'s pursuit to overpower Goku... this things made me feel like a kid again.With sadness I have to admit that this movie like its prequel released in 2013 and currently being aired TV series are total bullshit.SSJG (SSJ GAY) - created by combining soul energy of 5 pure-hearted saiyans -     C\'mon!!    Maybe some of future next forms will be achived by fu....g a unicorn.Z warriors having toruble...fighting with bunch of weaklings - The power level is completely messed up.Finally! Frieza new form is totally overpowered! I\'m waiting for Krillin,Yamcha,Tien or Master Roshi to train 4 monts and become God-like powerfullFighting scenes are far from perfect. They\'re too short and filled with unnecessary dialogues.The only thing that cannot complain about is the art and sound which were very good.If you\'re a huge Dragon Ball fan then I\'m almost certain that you\'ll be dissapointed after watching this, but if you don\'t care about the details you may like it.Sorry for the grammar.

But this whole movie is just the definition of empty.Frieza is enlivened. Training for a short period of time and just reaching the level of (Namek Arc to God of Destruction Arc) in a short period of time? It runs down my spine almost freezing when I think of it. DB...has always had bad power scaling and this is one of the prime examples.But what else happens in the film, except that Frieza goes on a rampage and the Namek Arc repeats itself? The answer is - nothing.Visually the film was attractive and I had absolutely no problems watching it. It\'s a typical Brain-OFF title, you can enjoy it despite everything.

While I found this to be an enjoyable film it did have a few glaring issues.So basically what gives this movie some merit is the visuals and the quality of the English voice work. The animation is awesome with great use of color and CGI and it was aesthetically appealing as far as animation goes....It was also fluent and smooth. The english dub was surprisingly good but I have yet to hear the Japanese voice acting though. Um the story well.... It\'s good I guess. It covers Frieza getting ressurected after getting killed by Trunks and now he\'s been ressurected by his minions and he wants to exact his revenge on Goku. The problem with the story is that I felt they had opportunities to expand but it didn\'t. Then they had this weird plot twist that was absolutely ruined do the standard Dbz bullshit. The characters are the same thing, some had no development and were new, some had development from previous installments in the franchise but had no expansion.  Even with these issues I still enjoyed this film but there was one more big issue that really bogged this movie down, for example this new ""Super Saiyan God"" mode..........why? This was pretty unnecessary in my opinion same with Frieza\'s golden form. It just comes across as pointless fan service.At the end of the day what is there left to say? It may sound like I hated this movie but far from it. It\'s an enjoyable film but has some weak points. It\'s still DBZ, still well choreographed fight scenes above average humor, and this in particular has really good animation and at. So if you like DBZ or are just looking for a movie to watch when your bored, go for it the visuals alone make it worth watching. It was also fluent and smooth.

I ain\'t gonna think less of you if you choose to leave.""This sums up my reaction as an audience after watching this movie.As a serial DBZ fan since childhood(note the word serial), I have thought of Frieza as the most fearsome villain of all the DBZ Universe, that is, untill I saw Cell Saga. Even though Frieza is a bit over rated in DBZ series(apart from the fact that he has a brother named Cooler, for God\'s sake), he is one of the most formidable characters in DBZ Universe( I\'m leaving Super...Buu behind, since I still have to catch up on that part later). Also, in DBZ Battle of Gods , when mentioned about his defeat by the hands of Goku by his angel Whis, even Lord Beerus acknowledges about him and his defeat. Such may be the power of ""Lord Frieza."" These expectations are not even a bit fulfilled after watching this movie.For starters, this movie shows his revival after his death by the hands of Future Trunks(Mecha Frieza, baby). He is revived by the only one reason of his declining reign, by the new commander of his battalion Sorbet and his second in-command, Tagoma. After revival, he trains for three months and, apparently, gains a new form, self proclaimed by him as ""Golden Frieza"".This comes as no surprise, as everybody knows about Frieza\'s might. But this is a tad bit too much of a might to show off, even for him. And by he way, how does he match the power of Super Saiyan God, after training for only three months? There must be a logic behind this.Also, he is shown a bit too cocky for his power, unbeknownst of the Super Saiyan God transformation achieved by Goku and Vegeta.To be honest, this movie could have only been made for nostalgia. Even if Frieza leaves the DBZ Universe, the vice-versa may not be possible, from the likes of this movie. Also, while mentioning about Gohan, he is shown utterly powerless here, compared to the bravery he showed while fighting the second form of Frieza in Namek. He easily gets injured by Frieza in his primary form,even though he is powered up to Super Saiyan 2(effect of Frieza\'s training, perhaps).The fight scenes look like they have been replaced from a video game sequence. Goku and Frieza looks like caricatures while fighting. Apart from that, Super Saiyan God is worth a watch.Nevertheless, Frieza is a character to lookout for, even if he is not revived for a third time. Also, there is a mention of Goku and Vegeta\'s vulnerabilities by Whis himself, while he trains with them. This information may prove useful for those who are going to watch Dragon Ball Super, after this movie, which are related closely. Sound tracks are great, especially the theme of Frieza is spine chilling and it really suits him.Hence, I can say that, I was partly satisfied with the movie, and for the fact that even Frieza acknowledged the results of a good training, which is shown in his new golden form. I hope that this movie may prove to be meaningful in the upcoming episodes of Dragon Ball Super, and Frieza is given a worthy role in it.

I realize the show has flaws and is only so loved because of the nostalgia boner it'll give to people and the fact that it's the first anime people have watched, it still holds a place in my heart. Anyways, rant over. Here are my thoughts on the movie.The story isn't the worst thing to come out of Toriyama but it still feels like something off of fanfiction.net. Frieza becoming stronger than Goku's new form in like 6 months (I think the whole reason...they made this movie was to start up a new line of Goku figures but now he has blue hair so epic), Piccolo being on equal ground with someone who shouldn't that much stronger than Captain Ginyu at max. Muten Roshi being on par with Frieza Soldiers even though it should be next to impossible for him to get all that much stronger even if he did train his ass off in the past little while due to his age. It was such a mess.The characters are your quintessential Dragon Ball cast (Goku, Vegeta, Piccolo, ect.) mixed in with some new characters and overall it isn't too bad in this department, no complaints here, really.The animation was fairly polished here, I'd daresay it's the best looking film to date... if the cringeworthy CGI wasn't there. The CGI was barely there but good lord was it bad. The original series didn't have the msot consistent animation but at the same time it didn't have a $5,000,000 budget per episode.The soundtrack was pretty generic there was nothing special about it so I have no real need to go in-depth here.Overall you can just skip this one. they made this movie was to start up a new line of Goku figures but now he has blue hair so epic), Piccolo being on equal ground with someone who shouldn't that much stronger than Captain Ginyu at max.

Animation and soundtrack are fantastic, and the voice actors gave it their all, which are definitely the great aspects of the movie. Story isn't very complex, however, it is Dragon Ball Super, people watch for the action. Regardless, story could have been so much more. However, the movie overall had few memorable moments, and just could have been so much more. The dynamic between Goku and Vegeta is really great, and Frieza himself is definitely no pushover. However, this movie is really only for the people who REALLY like Dragon Ball. "", ""Resurrection “F” is about what I was expecting from a Dragon Ball movie, and that isn’t very much. In fact, I was kind of surprised at how well a few things were done. The one thing I LOVED about this movie is that it let other, lesser known characters have an active combat role, hugely progressive in the world of Dragon Ball. Even Master Roshi got to throw down for a little while and to me that was the highlight of the movie.Almost every other complaint I had with the core Dragon Ball Z universe persists here, including a simply awful power scaling structure,...but this is a movie for the fans so this may be a good thing for those who enjoyed the original series, I'm not sure. The animation is done really well and most of the original English dub voice acting cast returns to do a great job. but this is a movie for the fans so this may be a good thing for those who enjoyed the original series, I'm not sure.

The only thing interesting about the plot is an old adversary coming back and new forms for Goku, Vegeta and Frieza. Even though the plot in DB and DBZ wasn't really deep or complex, in RoF it's even more simplified and linear: bad guy comes, Z fighters hold off the little bad guys, Goku and Vegeta take on the big baddy.Art: 10/10. The fights are well-choreographed and the art/animation is well done.Sound: 8/10.

I was expecting something similar (meaning something hardly good), but I have to say I've been even more disappointed.The major problem for me is that Toriyama and his team went further in the contradiction with the original Dragon Ball universe and lore. I won't spoil uselessly, but some characters like Gohan or Frieza, in this movie, are completely irrelevant/illegitimate in terms of everything. In fact they took the DBZ universe and adapted it to whatever they wanted, whether or not it was logical considering the original series.Moreover, (spoiller alert), we have...here another transformation, the SSJG Blue: that makes two new transformations in just 2 movies (is this really necessary?), and it makes one transformation appearing without any explanation.

Nothing really impressive compared to some other major anime movies, but just fair enough to be acceptable.Unfortunately that's not enough to make a good DBZ movie, especially when it lacks the catchy and salacious humour of the firt chapters, and the epicness/violence of the fights from the Frieza/Cell/Buu arcs. here another transformation, the SSJG Blue: that makes two new transformations in just 2 movies (is this really necessary?), and it makes one transformation appearing without any explanation.

It\'s not a transformation per say, it\'s his base form with his potential unlocked you don\'t lose your base form\'s power somehow! Even from the Cell saga to the Buu saga he didn\'t lose much (let\'s say 1/6 of his power) in 7 years why would he lose 3/4 of his power in the same timeframe (from the end of the Buu saga to Fukkatsu) it doesn\'t add up. The scriptwriter even admitted that the staff messed up when the promotional videos from BOG featured SSJ Gohan instead of Ultimate Gohan and even criticized GT\'s staff for doing the same mistake...and they do the same here? Come on.4) ""Trunks and Goten are not here because it\'s too dangerous""...No just no...They can sense Frieza\'s power and the fact is THEY\'RE THE STRONGEST (BECAUSE OF GOTENKS) SINCE BUU WAS SLEEPING AND GOHAN DOESN\'T HAVE HIS ULTIMATE FORM ANYMORE FOR WHATEVER REASON!!!5) Piccolo losing against a weak member of Frieza\'s army...No just no...6) Gohan beating the guy who beat Piccolo...NO!!! JUST NO!!! In fourteen years Piccolo is always weaker than SSJ1 Gohan somehow?!? Hell no! We\'re not in GT!!!7) Goku underestimating his opponent at this stage...No just no...It\'s just ridiculous.8) The Frieza cocoon thing in hell...No just no...I think it\'s contradicting Piccolo\'s line about hell in the actual manga anyway.9) ""Freezer\'s training 4 months !""...No just no...It has to be way longer and why would he make a return when he knows he doesn\'t control his form well enough? Doesn\'t make any sense.10) ""Frieza never trained! Because he\'s so smart and powerful without training!""...No just no! He knows that Goku became stronger when he came on earth with his father Cold but the movie is implying that Frieza knew that and did not train and lost against Trunks. It\'s clearly contradicting the fact that he\'s smart and it just doesn\'t make much sense. In my opinion the canonical and original manga version of Frieza was not that powerful and was meant to be stronger as mecha Frieza (through training or science) in order to come on earth and beat Goku...but Goku was simply just too strong for him to catch up because saiyajins make quick progress. That\'s always how I understood it. Even from a scenaritic point of view knowing that Frieza was afraid of the Super Saiyajin but was able to overcome Vegeto\'s level if he did trained during four months only doesn\'t add up and make him look like a stupid lazy bum. Also...Cell has Freezer\'s DNA, he\'s more intelligent and he\'s naturally stronger than Frieza without training...So why wouldn\'t he know about his limits just like Frieza did ?

Whereas Battle of Gods treaded similar ground to Yo! Son Goku and Friends Return!, with a nice balance of slice of life and fighting, this movie is all about the fights, which isn't really a bad thing!

The world progresses logically, we get to see Goku and Vegeta pushing themselves to the next level of strength, Frieza feels consistent and love-to-hate as ever. Once again the Super Era seems to have a healthy level of self awareness, recognizing Goku and Vegeta's flaws directly in the text, rather than between the lines, Beerus and Whis also feel right at home among the core cast, I really like them!It's not all sunshine and rainbows, the production side can still be a little rough. The effects animation was definitely better this time around, and generally the fights and characters were smooth and on model, but the use of CG, especially in the crowd scenes remained an eyesore. This is a marginal improvement over BoG, but not quite where a film in a series this big should be. The music was a bit all over the place in this one, some of it I really liked (specifically Frieza's surprise death metal theme!) but some cues felt a bit out of place. Finally, and most glaringly, there is a form in this movie that was not built up to properly, this is probably my biggest issue with the plot of the film. Still, this stuff isn't enough to kill it for me, and it shouldn't be enough to kill it for you.

Once again the Super Era seems to have a healthy level of self awareness, recognizing Goku and Vegeta's flaws directly in the text, rather than between the lines, Beerus and Whis also feel right at home among the core cast, I really like them!It's not all sunshine and rainbows, the production side can still be a little rough. The effects animation was definitely better this time around, and generally the fights and characters were smooth and on model, but the use of CG, especially in the crowd scenes remained an eyesore. This is a marginal improvement over BoG, but not quite where a film in a series this big should be. The music was a bit all over the place in this one, some of it I really liked (specifically Frieza's surprise death metal theme!) but some cues felt a bit out of place. Finally, and most glaringly, there is a form in this movie that was not built up to properly, this is probably my biggest issue with the plot of the film. Still, this stuff isn't enough to kill it for me, and it shouldn't be enough to kill it for you. I'm excited to keep moving forward into the Super era of Dragon Ball!"", 'Okay, so pinanood ko ng buo yung Tagalog dubbed ng Resurrection F. I know, it\'s been released for like; 2 or 3 years now pero ngayon ko lang napanood yung fight scenes na tagalized. Dati kase pag labanan na, biglang magshi-shift yung audio from Tagalog into English. Ngayon, tagalized na ang full movie. MABUHAY ANG MGA PIRATA!! So yun, maraming beses ko nang napanood/nabasa ang kwentong ito. English, Japanese kahit Latino pa par napanood ko na. At ang performance sa bawat languages ay exhilarating. Though ito ang worst canon part ng story ng buong Dragon Ball Franchise, you can still enjoy it for nostalgia. Dati...kase nae-enjoy ko lang yung movie dahil sa it\'s Dragon Ball. And that\'s it. So Yun, napanood ko yung Tagalog dubbed. Boss Jefferson Utanes as Goku at ang iba pang magaling na cast. No offense sa batang 90s pero hindi naman talaga Z ang napanood kong Dragon Ball eh. Pero yung Kai. Ang tanging part lang ng Z na napanood ko in Tagalog ay ang Cell Games Saga, kalahati ng Babidi Saga hanggang End of Z. So, yeah. Iba yung nostalgia na meron ako kesa sa most of the Dragon Ball Community (yes we have a community), kase ang pinanood ko noon ay Kai. Na-exposed ako sa Kai mga grade 3 ako. Yung naramdaman kong ""sensation"" (korni ng expression, sorry) nung pinanood ko yung movie ng full Tagalog dubbed ay hindi nostalgia, para bang reunion sa isang kaibigan mula sa pagkabata na matagal kong hinanap pero di ko na muling nakita. Sa ibang dub kase; di naman kase ako sa dub na yon lumaki kaya walang gantong revelation. Wala lang. Ang saya lang. It\'s weird. Siguro ganto yung naramdaman nung fans ng F4 nang i-remake ang Meteor Garden. Ang naramdaman ng isang die hard fan community ng muling mag-perform ang isang banda o idol group na ilang taon nang disbanded. It\'s just SO GOOD. It\'s weird na na-realize ko lang nung panoorin ko ang dub pero, tulad ng Sailor Moon sa mga babaeng Otaku; Dragon Ball is not just an anime from my childhood. It\'s kinda like an old friend. kase nae-enjoy ko lang yung movie dahil sa it\'s Dragon Ball. And that\'s it. So Yun, napanood ko yung Tagalog dubbed.

In all my years of watching Dragon Ball Z back when I was 9 years old, I would never think that anything as HORRIBLE as this pile of shit people call a movie would exist, yet here we are.Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection F is nothing more than another godawful lazy attempt to reel in fans that will literally eat anything DBZ related up, whether it\'s a new form or a villain with the most shit writing ever.The whole premise of the plot is really whatever, like sure you can pass that considering how many plotholes this movie has...but what really annoys me is how in the end, they just say ""fuck it, let\'s just do a rewind and then let Goku get the final kill because after all he\'s the main character LMFAO"" type beat. The part where they give the other side characters a moment to shine was nice, but then they get washed within less than 5 minutes.Quite honestly, watching Suicide Squad feels MILES better than whatever the fuck this type bullshit this is because it\'s something I can point and laugh at for being quite bad, but Resurrection F is just boring type of bad. Literally how did they make a good film with Battle of Gods then drop this abomination afterwards????? It literally makes 0 fucking sense how they could do that.Aside from the negatives this heap of bullshit has, there are some ok aspects of it such as the music and art, but even then, only good art and sound direction can carry a movie so much. At the end of the day, I get that DBZ in general is not supposed to have that good of a story, but at least they could\'ve tried to make it somewhat entertaining rather than stitching together 10 second poorly animated CGI fight gifs together and call it animation. Overall, save your time, go watch something else, because the DBS recap version of this specific movie is EVEN WORSE than the movie itself. but what really annoys me is how in the end, they just say ""fuck it, let\'s just do a rewind and then let Goku get the final kill because after all he\'s the main character LMFAO"" type beat.

Hayate no Gotoku! Can't Take My Eyes Off You,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14653/Hayate_no_Gotoku_Cant_Take_My_Eyes_Off_You,"['You know what I want for Christmas this year? A butler. A personal butler to serve me and obey my every single command however, whenever, and whatever I want. Well, that\'s the feeling I got initially before I began watching the series. I was a fan of the original Hayate the Combat Butler franchise. Kenjiro Kata\'s writing and his works aren\'t the best in terms of story telling but can be a fun watch especially when you\'re having a bad day. Then, the  news came when Kenjiro Hata decided to write a separate series of the original Hayate. Now, here we are...Hayate no Gotoku!...Can\'t Take My Eyes Off You (also known as Hayate the Combat Butler! Can\'t Take My Eyes Off You) is a separate series of the Hayate franchaise that stands independently written by the author of the manga, Kenjiro Kata himself. Now, this can be both a good or bad thing. Likely, if you\'re a manga reader, then you\'ll be very familiar with his works. However, if you\'re more into the animation product, then brace yourselves. This might be something you might want to keep your eyes on for mixed reasons.The series retains its lighthearted tone of a comedy. Nagi and Hayate stars together as the main protagonists along side their friends. Yup, the gang is back together for some maid and butler fun. The series starts quite slow and Nagi is lazy as ever. She\'s always been lazy anyways but still retains that fondness for video games and doing whatever she wants. Damn, talk about being a lazy spoiled brat. In fact, a new semester is about to begin and she\'s still laying down on her sofa. Things does somewhat pick up its pace though as her knight in shining armor (Hayate) comes to her recuse like anyways.The initial episodes of this series seems to be independent despite the title of the series. It\'s sort of misleading as “first night, second night, third night” as one might expect some sort of chronically linear story. However, most of the first half doesn\'t seem to connect much. Furthermore, it introduces a new character who comes under the claim to be Nagi\'s little sister. It\'s hard to take her seriously with her personality. In fact, it\'s hard to take this series seriously at all with the themes, cliches, and gags. Although it does brings back some nostologia from the original series, it\'s starting to lose its touch especially for die hard fans from season 1. It doesn\'t help by the fact that there are even a few minor fillers in between. As painfully it may seem, it\'s there.However, there is some good news. A certain strawberry colored hair council president makes her return in this series along side some other promising characters including one with an idol status and those dreamlike song entrances to boot. Other characters makes their appearances as well but all seems to be in the background. Even Maria from the original series seems to have a lesser role. I scratch my head several times whenever I think of this as a thought pops into my head: There\'s a butler with a star role, what about the maid?The artwork from this series is a joke. No, it\'s not even a parody because it\'s portrayed as a joke, in the wrong way.“Can\'t take my eyes off of you?” I can barely look at some of the characters\' design from this series. Hayate looks like a bishounen more than he should be. Hell, he\'s like a trap now. The rest of the characters\' designs aren\'t too different either. They all have identical heads with different colored hair attached to their bodies. In other words, it doesn\'t work out right. Most of the background colors are also quite generic and weak. A bit of an improvement to the artwork would have been much better to be honest.Luckily, the soundtrack of the series works well from my perspective. Although nothing special, ""CAN\'T TAKE MY EYES OFF YOU"" by eyelis actually fits and presents some of that Hayate-like feeling of pleasant nostologia. The OST of the series so is just average but the insert songs from a certain idol shake things up. The ED song,""Koi no Wana by Haruka Yamazaki, performed from that same girl is presented quite well in the form of metamorphic art and style. Not too shabby.Ultimately, watching Hayate no Gotoku! Can\'t Take My Eyes Off You is like trying out for a sports team at a new school. You think everything might go your way but it might turn out otherwise. Whether the result pleases you will be different for everyone. Some of you might not take your eyes off of the series while others hit that drop button without a moment of hesitation. I\'m sort of in the middle. At times, I snooze and lose the thought of enjoying the series. At other times, I get a pleasant feeling of watching it through. But overall, the decision is up to you to decide if you will enjoy this new and latest installation of the Hayate franchise. I mean, it-it\'s not like I want you to watch this series or anything!

I mean, it-it\'s not like I want you to watch this series or anything!', 'The Hayate series has been going now for a relatively long time, the manga started running back in 2004, and had already added two anime series` to its name (one of which was 52 episodes long), but since 2009 we’ve had nothing really new from the Hayate franchise, except a pretty sub par movie in which nothing happened but whatever. The point is that it had been a while since anything substantially new came out, that was until we heard about this new series, cant keep my eyes off you, which was going to be entirely original, some of us got our hopes up, others...stayed cautiously optimistic but in the end all of us where to be disappointed by this cynical cash grab.And that’s exactly what this series was, a rushed, poorly thought out attempt to keep the Hayate series alive and in peoples memory until the next real season comes out, which, COMPLETELY BY COINCIDENCE, was announced just after this series was finished, yeah nothing fishy there, uh hum, nice try.So Hayate No gotoku Cant keep my eyes open continues the story of Hayate an extremely unlucky teenager who through a series of unlikely events ended up working as a butler to a rich spoilt tsundere girl named Nagi to pay of the massive dept his rotten parents saddled him with. The series essentially follows his misadventures as he tries to avoid death or getting into more debt on a daily bias. This season however deals more with Nagi`s past and when a mysterious girl shows up claiming to be Nagi`s sister, looking for something called the Black Camellia then the gang must journey to Las Vegas to uncover the truth.I really don’t like writing one sided reviews but honestly I cant think of anything really good to say about this series at all, the only interesting bits in the whole show where stuff they took straight from the manga (such as the diner scene), and as this is supposed to be an entirely original series I cant count that, everything that is original is awful, as are its interpretation of the characters and its design of them, but more on that later, for now lets talk about the major mistakes in this series.The first huge mistake was actually in even making this series, you see “Cant keep my eyes anywhere near you” is set some time in future of the last season, and is even ahead of the manga, yeah no problems there. You see season 2 ended just before going into what many people including myself believed to be the pinnacle of awesomeness that the manga ever reached, the Athena arc, but they decided to save that for the real third season and instead they gave us this half baked plot about a watch, and some crazy sailor moon villain who wants it and a whole bunch of other boring crap that no-one cares about.The result is a hackney, Frankenstein like monster of a story that’s trying to do a whole bunch of things but isn’t doing any of them right, its trying to be a comedy but its not funny, its trying to be serious, but its ridiculously over the top (and not in a good way), its trying to be a love story, but with flat characters and no resolution, its trying to be father-daughter story, but they don’t flesh it out enough and waste too much time on pointless stuff.So in the end by trying to juggle too many things at once, combined with a rushed script they ended up dropping them all, and the result is something messier than a lit paper bag on a door step...which is ironic because both things are full of sh##Then there’s the new character, Nagi`s supposed sister, this character was pretty forgettable, another loli tsundre, geeze there must be more of these than there are actual animes. But in all seriousness this was a pretty bad character, most of the time she is just annoying, with the attempts to make her cute and moe so obvious and cheap that I want to punch the screen every-time see appears. There where some attempts to give her a character of her own but for me she never broke free from being a character who has been created simply for this series alone, and then strictly never mentioned again.The other characters where pretty awful too, Maria was static and boring (and stupid, yes I said stupid, because there’s a scene where she’s standing on one of those air vent things on the floor that blows your skirt up Marilyn Monroe style, and it happens to her three times in succession and she gets angry, but she never once thinks to take three steps to her left and walk off it... you dumb bimbo!) Nagi was bland, disinterested and slow to pick up on incredibly obvious things and so was everyone else, we’ll get to Hayate in a minute but all the side characters felt like puppets with their strings cut.After that is the art, and if you wanted proof that this series was a rushed mess, then all you have to do it look at it, I mean wow, there were actually some scenes that were comically bad, some characters actually looked like their faces and been created by a blacksmith... who was blind.I mean Manglobe aren’t exactly top of the line animators but ive never seen anyone turn out a disaster like this in years, geeze!If you’ve seen this series then I think your familiar with the infamous terrible reveal shot of a certain character, yeah you know what im talking about, its actually so bad its funny, seriously go watch it, its in episode 3, just watch from around 3 minutes in you’ll know it when you see it, trust me...Lastly we have the main character, why am I doing him last? Well because hes probably the least important thing in the whole show, he doesn’t do anything! No im not kidding he does nothing in the entire show, he`s always there don t get me wrong, but he’s usually just standing in the background, smiling awkwardly. He`s like everything else in this series, horribly forgettable, we learn nothing new about him or his character, he doesn’t grow, regress or change at all, now I know this is essentially a comedy and so character arcs are not as important as in other types of stories, but you still need some level of character or it’ll become a series of “things that happen” rather that a story.He might as well be part of the scenery for the majority of the show, he mostly just nods and says “yes m`lady” or “eehhh!” you could remove him from the show and just put in Parker from Thunderbirds and it wouldn’t have made a lick of difference.Its painfully obvious that this entire series is filler and so they couldn’t do anything drastic with the characters or the story as this series is meant to be seen and then forgotten.The Hayate franchise has always worked on a basic formula of a zany sort of Gintama like comedy, and a basic harlem series with a clueless main character. And while the franchise had its problems, it still produced some funny and memorable moments despite the constraints of the genre, however none of those moments exist here, this series feel like a cheap imitation of a Hayate series with a hackney story attached that would make even a college student throw up in disgust.It adds nothing to the franchise and is completely forgettable, well except for that reveal shot (whoah that was hilariously bad), and is clearly just a very long trailer for the real third season. The whole thing just feels like it was rushed out to tide people over until then and really should have just been shortened to an 3 episode OVA and released as a special edition with the next volume of the manga.Its really quite sad to see how badly this series messed up because it really feels that with just a good bit more work and time spent on it then this could have been a good series in its own way, but as it is im afraid it really is a stinker.show less stayed cautiously optimistic but in the end all of us where to be disappointed by this cynical cash grab.And that’s exactly what this series was, a rushed, poorly thought out attempt to keep the Hayate series alive and in peoples memory until the next real season comes out, which, COMPLETELY BY COINCIDENCE, was announced just after this series was finished, yeah nothing fishy there, uh hum, nice try.So Hayate No gotoku Cant keep my eyes open continues the story of Hayate an extremely unlucky teenager who through a series of unlikely events ended up working as a butler to a rich spoilt tsundere girl named Nagi to pay of the massive dept his rotten parents saddled him with.

He`s like everything else in this series, horribly forgettable, we learn nothing new about him or his character, he doesn’t grow, regress or change at all, now I know this is essentially a comedy and so character arcs are not as important as in other types of stories, but you still need some level of character or it’ll become a series of “things that happen” rather that a story.He might as well be part of the scenery for the majority of the show, he mostly just nods and says “yes m`lady” or “eehhh!” you could remove him from the show and just put in Parker from Thunderbirds and it wouldn’t have made a lick of difference.Its painfully obvious that this entire series is filler and so they couldn’t do anything drastic with the characters or the story as this series is meant to be seen and then forgotten.The Hayate franchise has always worked on a basic formula of a zany sort of Gintama like comedy, and a basic harlem series with a clueless main character. And while the franchise had its problems, it still produced some funny and memorable moments despite the constraints of the genre, however none of those moments exist here, this series feel like a cheap imitation of a Hayate series with a hackney story attached that would make even a college student throw up in disgust.It adds nothing to the franchise and is completely forgettable, well except for that reveal shot (whoah that was hilariously bad), and is clearly just a very long trailer for the real third season. The whole thing just feels like it was rushed out to tide people over until then and really should have just been shortened to an 3 episode OVA and released as a special edition with the next volume of the manga.Its really quite sad to see how badly this series messed up because it really feels that with just a good bit more work and time spent on it then this could have been a good series in its own way, but as it is im afraid it really is a stinker.show less', 'Hayate no Gotoku has always and probably will always be one of my favorite animes and mangas; Finally the third season has been released and I still love it! This anime is not for everyone because it lacks much direction and rather has many slice of life aspects surrounded by comedy and somewhat of an underlying plot. Similar to Detective Conan in that matter-many episodes go by in an individual type of way while the big picture with the characters moves along slowly. In Detective Conan its Conan\'s trails on the whereabouts of the Underground Organization while in Hayate no Gotoku its the developing harem...surrounded by the clueless Hayate-this is indeed the ultimate comedy!If you like comedy, if you watch other anime, especially if you enjoy slice of life, if you enjoy romance, if you want to laugh this was the anime for me and hopefully for you too! So go back to Hayate no Gotoku and watch it from the beginning. Now starts the review on Season 3.The first season was by SynergySP. The second season was by J.C. Staff. Now this season is by Manglobe. Some of us feel very scared when as we wait for the next season that will either make it or break it. Luckily so far the different studios have not failed us and after watching the 3rd episode I\'m glad that Manglobe has managed to keep up the good work!Story: (9)Hayate never had much of a plot, but the underlying advancements are the story to me and right in the 3rd episode we already get some advancements with Hayate and Hinagiku a definite plus for me. It seems they are moving the story on nicely. Actually it is said that the original author Kenjiro Hata wrote some of the story based on some ideas that never made it to the manga.Art: (7)I don\'t know but the art seems to have been getting weirder every season. The characters look a little freaky in this one with some attempted 3-D perspectives on the faces (none of which seem to be working for me). This isn\'t too important, expressions are portrayed just as well as ever.Sound: (8)The opening and endings are good. They didn\'t leave a super impression on me but then again none of them really have (in the hayate no gotoku series).

I always enjoy Hayate no Gotoku and hope things stay that way.Overall: (9)Hey this anime is comedy and lacks many things. I give it a 10 but it can\'t be considered a ""masterpiece"" I guess.

The story became more of RANDOM SH*T  Art became slightly worse sound well became a little better character from one point better from other worser but mainly Hayate(only character not Anime) changed to the better . I don't enjoy watching this rubbish but i will for i don't wan't to read manga.  I guess it was disappointing to me that season 2 ended with so much mystery's well atleast...i don't see any pedophile romance with nagi and hayate. Yet still Hayate became more of Supporting role . Maybe this because of my age or maybe I'm right but this anime became more childish with stupid jokes etc. Like I said i wan't story development not random comdey with slice of life THERE ARE TONS OF ANIMES LIKE THATCheers i don't see any pedophile romance with nagi and hayate.

This disappointment may have led to some fans having a bias against this season. However, even though this season wasn't nearly as good as the other seasons, it's also not as bad as some people may say.The series starts off with a bunch of fillers, which the series really could have done without. The comedy in these episodes are very forced and although some of the jokes are funny, most of them fall flat on their face...which makes these episodes weak in general and very forgettable. However as the series goes on the story starts to pick up and everything gets better from there. The story itself is pretty good because it contains numerous twists in it (predictable or not) and it also unveils a lot of things that happened in the past which made the plot very interesting and entertaining. The series also benefited from the story because it gave the viewer something to look forward to every week, and although this story was decent the series does lack the charm that the previous seasons delivered.The art in this series is just bad. The poor artwork is most noticed with the character designs, where the character's faces and heads looked out of proportion. Also the colours they chose aren't the best either. Usually artwork isn't something I pay attention to but for this series, the art was so bad that it had a negative impact on the series.The sound on the other hand is pretty decent. The opening really fit the more serious series this time around and it actually sounds pretty good. The ending sounds alright too and both were pretty catchy. Through-out the series there were also number of insert songs which are also pretty nice.The characters are always a strong point for Hayate no Gotoku, even for this not so strong season. The characters are still great (even the new ones), each of them stand out individually because of their unique personality. However, this time around, the series really focuses (as in only focuses) on Nagi and Hayate and all the other characters this time around play a very small role, so some of the viewers may be disappointed that they won't get to see their favourite character have much of a role. Overall the characters manage to retain their greatness from previous seasons.Hayate no Gotoku: Can't Take My Eyes Off You could have been done much better as the comedy just wasn't there and the art was just plain horrible.

Can\'t Take My Eyes Off You ReviewPresentation:Yet another studio is producing the newest season of Hayate no Gotoku! The amount of detail of the background is amazing. Like the buildings actually look like that in person. It does lack extras on the sad note. The Strip is a crowded place. I have no idea why it was so deserted on this anime. Laziness perhaps? I still dislike the character design. Something about the hair strand in the middle of their faces bugs me. It is probably because it steals attention from the character\'s faces. The main theme songs sounded nice. You can...feel the effort put in them because it is disappointingly the best part of this series.Characters:The new characters were uninteresting except for Tsugumi. Tsugumi x Nagi is a nice Manzai. Old returning characters aren\'t fully utilized. The best part of Hayate no Gotoku is their diverse characters and yet they limit their screen times. Some of them even acts out of their characters like Sakuya calling Isumi, ""Isumi-san"" on the last episode. When the hell they became such strangers? I do like how they changes clothes every now and then. The worst criminals in the world have an Engrish accent. Seriously, how hard is it to find a English speaking seiyuu with native accent? I would do it for free FFS. (Just provide me a flight and hotel to Japan!)Story:I see no purpose on having Las Vegas as the main setting. To be honest, it could have taken place back in Japan and I wouldn\'t see any difference. Just have the casino win as a lotto win. Where the hell were the omakes? It stopped half way the series and never came back. I wanna know what happens next to Urashima Taro, damn it! The story is too plot driven. I enjoyed the slapstick version of Hayate no Gotoku! with minimal and random plot better. They are overextending their genre and should just go back on the basics. This kind of twisty story would be better fit on a movie. The comedy scenes are forcefully wedged inside the plot heavy storyline. I don\'t know if I should either take this series seriously or not. One the early stages of the story, some scenes were hilarious like the restaurant scene on episode 5. You see, next producer of Hayate no Gotoku!\'s name here, just stick to comedy! And fuck storyline. Finally, the ending was satisfying. She finally confessed and Manglobe is playing safe with his response. Doesn\'t really set on ""what\'s next on the series"" but at least they didn\'t fucked up the ending.Verdict: 6.4/10 (Slightly Above Average)+ Great theme songs.+ Detailed background.- Not as funny as S2.- Bad character usage.Raccoon Dog out of 10. feel the effort put in them because it is disappointingly the best part of this series.Characters:The new characters were uninteresting except for Tsugumi.

However, once you start to watch this season of Hayate no Gotoku, then you really will enjoy it after all. The story line is completely different from the rest of the series. You could say it's a off-topic storyline to give the anime a new kick to it. In the end of this anime, it really is quite touching to see what happens. Majority of people think that anime's like this are boring because of it's parody, but really, watch till the end...and you will change your mind. The funny thing about the art concept is, that.... It's really different despite the fact that the author took control of this season. What I mean by funny is that, by the end of this anime, the art is EXACTLY the same as the first two season, and I started to laugh about this. Character development is quite different from what I expected, there are new characters in this season, and the way these characters act are completely different from the series. All the people in the old 2 series that were almost on EVERY episode, here well, they barely show up other than Maria, Nagi, and Ayasaki. Overall for this anime to me personally, I would give it a 10, and I recommend this season for all viewers to watch, and truly understand Romance anime's. (P.S. I am curious but... I wonder what Maria's last name, unless this is her last name.)[Supoirā, ishiki no minaoshi, oyobi kankoku ga fukuma rete imasu]Anata wa subete shitte iru yō ni, hayatenogotoku no shirīzu wa kanari nagakute, hijō ni randamudeatta \u200b\u200b.

Many people say they dislike it because it doesn\'t have to comedy of the first 2 seasons, but this NEW SERIES*, i put emphasis on that, was never meant to be as hilarious as the first 2 seasons.  I find the plot of ""season 3"" very interesting and if you were to give it an evaluation while disregarding the change in genre from the the first 2 seasons to this, then I think you would agree that it is a good show. ', 'Hayate no Gotoku is one of my most favorite anime/manga. In fact ive been following it for 4 years since the first season was released. So far it is the most disappointing season of the series. Why did i say so?Firstly the story. The story is well built it contains what Hayate no Gotoku needs and likes. But its is so twisted. There are some parts in which is included in the manga. But they slightly changed it buy adding Tsugumi in it. And it did not really follow the plot of the story in the manga. It is not necessary. But i really expect...that the S3 would get the series back on track. But disappointment surprised me..Art. S1 has a great art. S2 has a medium quality of art. But the hell with S3. The art sucks!! Its like they are degrading their art every season. If luckily if get a S4 and still degrade the art I would stop watching this series.Sound. It has great OP and ED. Voice actors are great.Character.The most loved part of this season. without the original characters participating on this show. It would be pathetic.Enjoyment. I did enjoy in some episodes but it was very few...Overall. The series would be just in fair. So far anyone can read it. No blood and Gore or anything. Certainly some fans of Hayate no Gotoku are very disappointed. Well anyways lets get over it and hope for a better season (If they are stil going to make one..)Other comments:If they would just animated the part in the Manga. Especially The End of The Worlds Arc. I want to see A-tan get animated.../(T_T)\\ that the S3 would get the series back on track. But disappointment surprised me..Art. S1 has a great art.

The specific sense of humor and the use of art to exaggerate the characters dumbfounded expressions always made me laugh back when I watch the first two seasons. However, after the long gap  'I can't take my eyes off you' was a disappointment.The story line is completely independent of the manga, and covers the story behind Nagi's father and mother. In all honesty I thought that the actual plot of the show was not half bad, I might even admit good, but there was a bigger...issue. The plot didn't appear until about the 7th episode.Now, in Hayate no Gotoku terms plot wouldn't really be important, but I found the episodes in the first half of the series to be somewhat lacking. There was a few good scenes, but in all honesty I felt bored at sometimes. Seeing as I would claim myself as a fan of the series I found that to be slightly awkward. The jokes were there, but I suppose they weren't as appealing to me at all.A new anime specific character Tsugumi Ruri, claiming to be Nagi's sister, is added to the show. Tsugumi is clearly up to no good upon her entrance to the show in episode one, but at the same time is obviously to nice to do any harm. She is an airhead and her voice is somewhat whiny, and is picked on for the entirety of the show.Thankfully, in the second half my faith was returned. The plot helped increase my enthusiasm to continue watching and I slowly enjoyed the comedy that was placed in there.  The entire cast eventually makes their way over to Las Vegas to obtain an object called the Kurotsubaki that her deceased father left behind. Needless to say it is cursed with horrible luck, but allows the wielder to experience great luck at times. For some reason Tsugumi wants Nagi to reclaim this pocket watch, and the mystery behind Nagi's father, the Kurotsubaki, and Tsugumi's motives is revealed.In all honesty I wouldn't say this is the best Hayate no Gotoku has to offer, but if you want to learn the history behind Nagi's parents this will explain it. The Hina fans will probably last until episode three at least, and I don't think I need to say that the majority of the season is almost all Nagi centered. I don't think I would recommend this season to anyone who is on the fence, but I am sure that any fan would probably still enjoy this season. issue.

Whether it\'s a video game, anime or manga, I\'ll only rate it after I\'ve played, watched, or read the entire thing! Even though I might initially think, \'Whoa, talk about a total letdown!\' ""I can\'t believe it says so much about this series in just a simple dialogue. If any of you have read the manga, and especially if you watched the previous Hayate no gotoku...season 1 and 2 (HnG), it is more than probable that you\'ll be thoroughly disappointed with this series (Can\'t take my eyes off you!).What this series does is like adding barbeque meat and sauce to strawberry sundae. Use the good ingredients in the absolutely wrong places. That\'s a recipe for disaster.Hayate no gotoku used to be quirkly, parodical spoof of spoofs with a midly serious storyline emerging and disappearing. But the new series totally forgot its essence and started taking itself too seriously from the get go. The art, the music, the plot, the characters everything became annoyingly serious and seriously annoying. I am not saying that there are no jokes, which there are plenty. But that weird, quirky plotline where you never know what might happen next and everything may just be grand parody is gone. Just look at the first episode of this series and the original one, and you will know.----------The story obviously cannot be same with the original series so it has been changed, drastically, with equally drastic consequences. Before you even know what happened in the past you take a time leap into the present. It\'s like showing you the last episode of code geass R2 and expecting you to weep. Seriously?!The plotline is poorly executed with neither, the present nor the past getting enough of its share in a paltry 12 episodes. The laughs and gags are fewer than before, the characters cannot be developed, because they already have in the past (original series). The side characters are even thrown about haphazardly. It is poorly thought, stupidly executed series with no basis whatsoever except, maybe, spoiling the manga plotline a bit.The art has been botched up in totally wrong direction. Can you expect to laugh at a seriously drawn and more realistic character? The background got a CG makeover, the characters all started looking serious, and even the tiger looks more real!!The soundtracks are good. They are so good and serious that the series starts looking like a serious drama. Again, they are great to listen to but not suited to great comedy.The only things i liked in this series are Hinagiku and Nagi\'s father. And so many clocks.And I have still watched it. And held my head in frustration.----------Bottomline. If you are a fan of the fun in the original manga/series, better avoid this.For hardcore fans and sarcastic comrades, oh you will love this! maybe. season 1 and 2 (HnG), it is more than probable that you\'ll be thoroughly disappointed with this series (Can\'t take my eyes off you!).What this series does is like adding barbeque meat and sauce to strawberry sundae. Use the good ingredients in the absolutely wrong places. That\'s a recipe for disaster.Hayate no gotoku used to be quirkly, parodical spoof of spoofs with a midly serious storyline emerging and disappearing. But the new series totally forgot its essence and started taking itself too seriously from the get go. The art, the music, the plot, the characters everything became annoyingly serious and seriously annoying. I am not saying that there are no jokes, which there are plenty.

Himouto! Umaru-chanS,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31234/Himouto_Umaru-chanS,"[""I actually enjoyed this a lot more than the main series.Really short bite sized eps that I chained half of em in one sitting.Nothing much to it in terms of story, just a good laugh. Hard to rate the story when there is none, and that is just fine.Art could be improved but then again it's just a blu ray extraSounds actually is pretty good in fact i think one of its strong pointsCharacters are okay each fulfils their purposeIt certainly is entertaining so imo it scores big on enjoymentWould totally rate this higher if the art was somewhat improved and slightly longer "", 'Story: 9Art: 9Sound: 10Character: 4Enjoyment: 8Overall: 8No review for this? Going to review this now.Never seen Himouto! Umaru-chan first? Then this will be weird. Himouto! Umaru-chanS is a series of shorts that manages to tell a pretty good story in the amount of time, sure it\'s kind of rushed but it is a two minute short after all. Anyway, in these amount of ""shorts"" every girl in Umaru-chan! has a chibi sprite as Ebina, Umaru, Kirie and Sylphinford venture off into a different universe learning different tasks as random stuff happens, like a zombie invasion. Sure it\'s random but it\'s well paced unlike other shorts...I\'ve seen, it doesn\'t drag on and on about the same thing, it doesn\'t feel like it\'s going on forever. The story, art and voice cast are all amazing like the series it is from and it doesn\'t feel like a different thing from Himouto! Umaru-chan!Now that the good things are out of the way, let\'s talk about the girls. Ebina, Umaru, Kirie and Sylphinford don\'t honestly feel like they were from Umaru-chan. Besides Kirie, Umaru doesn\'t really balance well with the other characters, she doesn\'t feel like a best friend or a rival to both Sylphinford and Ebina, honestly, a show just about Kirie and Umaru wouldn\'t be bad, but when its a show about all the girls, it just seems that the other two are out of place and shouldn\'t really be there. Also they feel even more dull here then in the series, which you should kind of already expect but they just feel a little more boring then normal, which a shame.If you\'re bored one day, watch all of these shorts where we see the characters be themselves without Taihei in the way? Watch these shorts, you will be in love with them! I\'ve seen, it doesn\'t drag on and on about the same thing, it doesn\'t feel like it\'s going on forever.
