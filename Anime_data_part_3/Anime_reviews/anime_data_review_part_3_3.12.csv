Tennis no Oujisama: Pair Prince,https://myanimelist.net/anime/10862/Tennis_no_Oujisama__Pair_Prince,"[""I noticed in these that disappointed me was when everyone talked their mouths didn't move sort of like when one was talking to themselves except in these episodes their mouths didn't move even when talking to each other.It reminded me of a comic strip except that it was able to be heard and read, threw me off a bit since it was far from the original anime, the stories were not bad.These were a few short stories about students from other school, some of our regulars showed up every now and then. They were still interesting short stories. They showed a different side to quite...a few characters.This is still not a  continuation of the original after finals nor is it a have to watch before Prince of Tennis II.  But it didn't suck either once you get past the mouths not moving and just pay attention to the story... a few characters.This is still not a  continuation of the original after finals nor is it a have to watch before Prince of Tennis II.

Tenkuu Senki Shurato,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2113/Tenkuu_Senki_Shurato,"['An anime i watched recently from around the time i started to watch anime, and some things were predictable, other things were`nt, the story i liked very much , so as some of the charachter developments, music i had no complaints about +) Only the thing is that the main person, Shurato is a bit too sensitive  and does reckless things what put me off a bit, and the too emotional scene`s on and off that destracted me, But i plenty enjoyed the show ', 'It is pretty much saint seiya but worse in almost every way.The cast of voice actors are quite good and the opening theme is actually very catchy but there is too many similarities to saint seiya in plot.The colors are quite dull and the lip syncing is not very good.The pacing is also not very consistent and almost felt like a ""monster of the week"" anime.Despite being a relatively long anime it also felt as though much of it was rushed.Like saint seiya it is based on mythology but in this case hindu/buddhism and personally I did not find it as interesting because...of it, for example i don\'t think the vajra the main character uses is a cool weapon. It is also partially because my lack of knowledge of the mythology. of it, for example i don\'t think the vajra the main character uses is a cool weapon. It is also partially because my lack of knowledge of the mythology.', 'just finished the entire series and figured id give a review since this anime is not really talked about by english speakersthe voice acting and music/soundtrack is very good I found the music very catchy and fitting. Shurato is what id say is what Saint seiya would be if it was an isekai with hindu myths.Shurato  is very similar to Saint seiya and has been compared to it, it was clearly influenced by it as this came just around the same time as Saint Seiya\'s hype, Saint seiya inspired a trend of what id call ""magical boys in armor"" it was shortly lived though...as Shurato and ronin warriors are really the only other anime like this.  It has the theme of myths, gods, magical armors and traitors much like Saint seiya does, Despite this though it still had enough differences in the story and characters for it not be like you are watching the same show.the animation was good for the first 23 episodes by 1989 standards, but starting in episode 24 the animation had a huge drop in quality sometimes the characters look straight up badly drawn in these episodes and certain details are left uncolored but thankfully it gets much better again by episode 35. the character designs are pretty good with cool looking armors.the title character Shurato, is alot like the standard shounen protagonist he\'s hot headed and somewhat childish and dumb but he has a good heart and proves to be a good warrior, at times I found Shurato\'s ignorance and impulsiveness abit annoying but, otherwise I think Shurato is good for the type of character he\'s supposed to be  and he does go through some development the shurato in episode 1 compared to the last episode feels pretty different. the hachibushu are generally pretty good characters I got nothing bad to say about them the flamboyant Reiga stands out as a pretty likeable character, Hyuga and Ryoma are great as well . Gai is the one I found most interesting he is remembered to be a very kind gentle person that would not even hurt a fly, so its a huge shock to shurato that he has became cruel and filled with evil on tenkukai  especially since he is also part of the hachibushu and should be on the same side, the series often focuses on Shurato and Gai\'s friendship and the mystery to why yasha-oh got reincarnated into being an evil warrior it all gets revealed and resolved in the bittersweet ending of their conflict.  Overall id suggest this anime to saint seiya fans due to the similarities but also to anyone that likes old school shounen anime and anime that focuses on myths.   I found it pretty enjoyable to watch it was not too long or too short the pace felt just right.  I rate this 9/10 despite it maybe not being entirely perfect it got a high ranking due to the fact that I never felt bored watching it, the characters and story are memorable and I don\'t have many complaints about it overall. as Shurato and ronin warriors are really the only other anime like this.

Suisei no Gargantia Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19211/Suisei_no_Gargantia_Specials,"[""I was a bit hesitant at first to actually watch the Suisei no Gargantia specials due to the mediocrity of the series reflected by the 13 episode season. While Gargantia wasn't necessarily bad, the pacing, overall story, and character development are easily depicted as lacking, considering the potential this series innately had. These two specials essentially give background stories behind the story of Gargantia; they fulfill background information in two separate manners. Rather than lumping these two episodes together and calling them 'specials', they should have been split into their own separate OVAs.The first special covers Ridget, the new overseer and daughter of the...previous fleet commander and gives background information about her life and stress of fulfilling the role of acting fleet commander. The episode isn't heavy on drama, major themes, or any character development necessarily. It's more of some extra screen time dedicated to fleshing out Ridget's character a little more. It was a fair watch, but doesn't quite add much to the series.The second episode of the special is dedicated to showing how Kugel arose to the figure of a God and how the cult of his religious followers came to be. Although the episode is a dark one, I thought this particular episode was the best that Suisei no Gargantia had to offer as an animated series. There are strong themes apparent that showcase the many flaws in human nature. Human beings are greedy, manipulative, cunning, power-hungry, and selfish; Kugel's character development reflects these traits well. This episode reflects that well. It also showcases major fallacies depicted by the facade of Gods and religion. For being a special, this episode added a lot of quality material to the series. It feels as if it should have been a part of the actual season airing. It's a shame that it wasn't.Overall both specials combined were a decent watch. From my perspective the second special was far better than the first and actually felt like a necessity to understanding more about the story of the series. previous fleet commander and gives background information about her life and stress of fulfilling the role of acting fleet commander.

Personally I enjoyed it - despite its predictability, it was a beautiful and charming story that everyone should give a chance.On the Blu-rays comes not only improvements to the animation and art, but two unaired OVA\'s. Those hoping for a continuation of events after Gargantia may be disappointed - both episodes take place in the middle or before the events of the series, respectively. These episodes will not mean much to people who haven\'t already finished Gargantia, so I cannot recommend that you watch these before finishing the series.The first OVA...(ep 14)  is about Ridget\'s past.While Ridget does take on an important role later on in Gargantia, we know little of her background besides what is only told to us. This OVA does a good job of filling in some of those blanks, when investigating an abandoned ship colony she realizes she knew some of the people who used to inhabit it. We then spend a good half of the episode in a flashback about Ridget\'s past and one of her former friends.It\'s a little heartbreaking, but also touching. And while I wish for more Ledo and Amy bonding, we do get enough of it that I am satisfied until the second OVA appears next month (according to what I\'ve been told).I would give episode 14 an 8/10.The second OVA (ep 15) fills us in on how Kugel - and his Yunboro, Striker - became the leader of the pirate-turned-cult fleet that Ledo and Pinion encounter near the end of the first season.The story focuses around the relationship between Linaria, a girl who is visually and behaviorally similar to Amy, and the troubled heir to her late father\'s fleet, and Kugel, who conveniently appears on earth to save her from certain death from her half-sisters who are chasing and attempting to kill  and take the fleet from her.Linaria prays to the ""God of the Sky"" in her moment of need to save her, and Kugel unwittingly protects her as the enemy ships fire on Striker. He uses ""minimal force"" to suppress their attack, and ends up destroying all the ships. Miraculously all the sailors survive, now with a new-found fear of Linaria\'s supposed ability to summon gods from the sky.This series of events cements Linaria as the leader of the fleet, with Kugel at her side. Her eldest half-sister, Oceanid, however, is skeptical of the deification of Kugel and Striker, and makes an attempt to have him killed. However, it backfires, and it elevates the situation even further.During this entire time, Linaria is visibly sick, and it is obvious here that we see how Kugel ended up dying later on, as he contracts her illness. More series of unfortunate events has the situation spiral out of control.Linaria has a great impact on Kugel with her heartfelt words of gratitude, but Kugel takes them in the wrong way, and starts to embrace his cult-like reign over the fleet in the vein of the Alliance laws. When Kugel inevitably dies, Striker takes the opportunity to continue leading the fleet in the fashion that the Alliance would have.While this episode can be touching at times, everything felt forced because of pacing issues, and I didn\'t feel as strong of a connection between Kugel and Linaria as I believe there was meant to be. Perhaps if there was more than a single episode of development for this story it would have had more impact. It\'s unfortunate that there was some missed potential here. Thankfully, this is not the end for Gargantia, as if it were it would have ended on a somewhat mediocre note.I give episode 15 a 6/10.Still, I would recommend this duo of OVA\'s to fans of Gargantia. Ridget gets some much needed love in her short and sweet OVA, and Kugel\'s story, while flawed, does add more flavor and emotion to his story, and the fate of his fleet.

Personally, I really liked it, but it wasn't as good toward the end as it was at the beginning. I thought they could have done with a few more episodes, since it was the pacing that killed the end for most people. And now that we have 2 more episodes- both depicting backstories of characters who do kind of need development, so how are they?Ep 14: I thought this was a pretty okay episode, but kind of forgettable. It showed the backstory of Rigit, the captain of Gargantia. It was a bit sad but far...from tearjerking, and it didn't really do much to flesh out her character. But it had a few funny moments and of course we get to see more of that gorgeous animation that I think everyone can agree is always a positive part of this anime. 7/10Ep 15: I really liked this one. It gave more backstory to the main antagonists and you see how he goes from a pretty good guy to the dickbag you see in the main series. And there is quite a bit of darkness and emotion in this one. I'd give it a 9/10 from tearjerking, and it didn't really do much to flesh out her character.

I'd give it a 9/10"", 'This isn’t as much of a review as a PSA. These two episodes were made pretty much to fill up the content of the BDs to a neat 5-episodes-per-volume figure. The first one was released on BD Vol.1, the second on BD Vol. 3. As such, referring to them as “episodes 14 & 15” is both wrong and misleading, they aren’t meant to be a follow-up to the main story, rather, the first one is Episode 4.5 and the second one is Episode 13.5.Episode 4.5 suffers the most if seen at a wrong time, because its story, both chronologically and narrative-wise, takes place between Episodes...4 and 5, with characters acting according to the story progress up until that point, which creates a jarring discrepancy if watched after the later episodes of the main plotline. The first half of the episode is dedicated to worldbuilding, which again, is pretty pointless after the main story is over. The second half provides some extra backstory for the character of Ridget, who also got her character arc resolved well before the finale of the series, in Episode 8. Overall, even if watched in the right order, this episode is just an inoffensive filler, providing nothing but an opportunity to see the cast do more stuff, 6/10.Episode 13.5 is an immediate follow-up to the final episode of the series (narrative-wise, chronologically it’s a prequel) and is much more relevant to the plot progression. It provides some background on the cultist fleet, which is necessary for connecting the finale of the main series with the follow-up OVAs. It also explains the origin of the second flying squirrel that first appeared in Episode 12 and followed the protagonist ever since. The episode’s storyline of Kugel and Linaria compares and contrasts with the storyline of Ledo and Amy, so it isn’t a filler by any means, but it feels a bit rushed to really work well, 5/10. 4 and 5, with characters acting according to the story progress up until that point, which creates a jarring discrepancy if watched after the later episodes of the main plotline.

All of the good points go to 14, but unfortunately 15 is... also there.For those who like the LedoxAmy plot in the main series, probably the best parts of episode 14 are them spending time together. They\'re rather adorable. Ledo actually comforts Amy at one point and it says a lot about how he\'s grown as a character since he arrived on Earth. (-cough- a lot more than he did in the actual show...-cough-)That being said, the episode does kind of attack your disbelief when something happens to a new character and they just... walk away mostly fine. The rest of the ""character development"" in the show is kind of stupid, like much of the series.Episode 15 is about Kugel\'s time on Earth before Ledo ""finds"" him again. It\'s emotionless and silly and seems to exist because someone was bored and had no idea what else to write for episode 15. I guess it gives a character we never really meet some screentime? And it gives some more ships for Kugel stans?So if you want, I would suggest watching episode 14 for the cute, and skipping 15. But I also wouldn\'t recommend watching the series anyway. Just watch ""Macross Frontier"" or ""Promare"" if you want drama and mechas and good music. -cough-)That being said, the episode does kind of attack your disbelief when something happens to a new character and they just... walk away mostly fine.

The first episode is set somewhere in the parent show’s middle-to end bit (since Chamber is still alive, but Ridget is already the commander. Also, Ledo is still struggling with the language a bit). It follows the cast encountering and exploring an abandoned fleet, supposedly riddled with ghosts. Spoiler alert: no ghosts were to found, except for the ghosts of past.The episode is alright, and it was nice to see some depth to Ridget’s character. However, I...felt like the story was incomplete, and I was left wishing for more. What happened to the characters from Ridget’s past? Where did they go, and why did they have to abandon the ship in the first place? I feel like there was enough material here for a short movie even, so simply cramming the content into a single episode felt a bit rushed.TL:DR. (it wasn’t even that long, sheez.) A nice little episode for the fans of the show. Nothing new, and you won’t miss anything even if you skip this, but if you grave for more Gargantia and have time to kill by all means, give it a watch. 6/10.The second episode centres around Kugel, the Galactic Alliance colonel the main show portrays as the antagonist, and his companion Pilot Guidance System, Striker. The episode follows their landing on Earth, their encounter with a pirate fleet and Kugel’s rise to power as the fleet’s commanded and as an emissary of god. The story is interesting, and it brings depth to Kugel’s character, something I felt was missing from the original show.Like the first special episode, this one too felt a bit rushed. A lot of material was covered, but since the entire episode had this backstorey-feel to it, this didn’t really matter, and was pretty much expected. Some things were left annoyingly open, like for example the pirate fleet; why had he pirate girl’s father left power to the youngest daughter? Why did the others have such animosity towards her? Was it just rivalry between siblings, or something more? A short explanation would have been nice. Or maybe I just missed it? :PTL:DR. A good addition to the main series, finally shedding desired light on the main antagonist’s motivations.

Tabisuru Nuigurumi: Traveling Daru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15077/Tabisuru_Nuigurumi__Traveling_Daru,"[""A beautiful, calming short that is well worth watching!Story - 7It's obviously not got a filled out story, only being 10 minutes long, but that was enough time too draw you into what story there was. The pace was quick but not rushed and that was enabled by the soundtrack which sped it along in the initial stages. My attention didn't waver once because immediately I was interested in the journeys of a tiny, little stuffed toy (presumably made by the young girl) and where it was going. There is no dialogue (apart from 2 sentences at the end in English) but this in...no way hinders the story, it makes your senses become more acutely aware of the sounds going on in the background and various images in each scene. There was also a lot of symbolism used in the centre and in the backgrounds, for example. the butterfly spreading it's wings after being trapt in the coccoon, it foretold of the final journey to be had by the stuffed toy. The ending was a mixture of both happy and sad, it was the ending you would expect and also not in some ways I think. The last scene after the credits really brought a smile to my face.Art - 9It had the most spectacular sky scenes, I almost gasped during one of the scenes. The character designs are relatively simple and the main girl looks very ordinary. Careful precision has been made with many of the scenes, such as the reflection in the window as the girl touches the glass, the wind through the scarecrows hair and waterdroplets on the ground. I think it's the precision that adds a new dimension to the TN:TD.Sound - 9It starts with a fast-paced 50's style trumpet tune that allows the story to move through time very quickly. It then slows to a peaceful guitar and piano song, the standstill of time when both the stuffed toy and the girl are in deep contemplation and a sense of loneliness comes through the music. Then the music stops for the sound of the waterdroplet, it is after this that piano music emerges which then changes to violins/cellos that make you feel uplifted and hopeful. The music is extremely effective, it substitutes the lack of dialogue perfectly. You could shut your eyes and almost follow the story from the music alone.Character - 6Not much to say on character as it is so short and there is no dialogue till right at the end. We come to understand that the stuffed toy has never stopped wanting to reach the girl throughout the story. The girl is shown in the beginning to be devastated to loose her toy and then as the story moves on and she grows up we come to understand that she has become a fashion designer. She seems to be finding inspiration difficult and she is frustrated, you see that she also still thinks about the stuffed toy she lost many years before. At the end you see that she has never forgotten about this stuffed toy even though her life has moved on such a long way.Enjoyment - 9Really surprised by how much I have enjoyed this short, I came out feeling good and optimistic. It really reinforces the value of determination. I was happy at the end but also managed to feel really sad in the middle and the end as well, for something with little time to make me feel, lonely, sad and happy must be good.Overall - 8Definitely worth the little time it takes, it took me by surprise and maybe it will you too. It may seem like a childish tale of a stuffed toy that walks and journeys but actually I felt it could be shown to all ages. Everything about this short wasn't lacklustre or lazy, it was done precision and careful planning, there were tiny details and clever symbolism that scattered the backgrounds and made it eye catching and interesting. no way hinders the story, it makes your senses become more acutely aware of the sounds going on in the background and various images in each scene.

At the end you see that she has never forgotten about this stuffed toy even though her life has moved on such a long way.Enjoyment - 9Really surprised by how much I have enjoyed this short, I came out feeling good and optimistic. It really reinforces the value of determination. I was happy at the end but also managed to feel really sad in the middle and the end as well, for something with little time to make me feel, lonely, sad and happy must be good.Overall - 8Definitely worth the little time it takes, it took me by surprise and maybe it will you too. It may seem like a childish tale of a stuffed toy that walks and journeys but actually I felt it could be shown to all ages. Everything about this short wasn't lacklustre or lazy, it was done precision and careful planning, there were tiny details and clever symbolism that scattered the backgrounds and made it eye catching and interesting."", ""(SPOILERS)Key things to note before even watching:It's a short ( xx mins. < 30 mins.)It lacks dialogue (mostly...)Story: 9/10--Despite the short having less than 5 sentences, the story is told through the journey of a little handmade toy that was left behind by his owner in a rush to board her plane with the parents. Daru, the toy, ventures to return to his beloved owner and along the way he travels to many countries, searching for her by asking various other objects and animals. He even manages to make a small companion friend, a caterpillar, whom he protects from the elements when he finds that...it turns into a cocoon.Art: 7/10--It's not amazing, but it is charming and very cute. In some scenes there was a lot of thought and details put into certain objects. Sometimes the art/animation is absolutely outstanding; one such case is when they showcase the night sky with the clouds (Around the 2 min. mark). Since Daru is traveling around the world, it is easy to note where he's has gone to by paying attention to the background.Sound: 9/10--Charming. It's very simple and relaxing and in my opinion, the music suits the mood of the scene wonderfully. From the excitement to the hopeless moments, the music is a perfect match without being too overpowering for the scene, but neither lacking in emotion either.Character: 10/10--There are really only two characters to focus on, and though while neither really talk much, there is a lot of heart they both have. The owner and Daru both display loyalty and love for one another in their remembrance of each other and determination (In Daru's case) to reunite.Enjoyment: 10/10--While others have expressed lack of interest or enjoyment from this short, perhaps because it IS short and they think it lacks a story, I find this little anime to be quite charming and thoroughly heartwarming. It most definitely reminds me of pixar's shorts--little to no dialogue, but a story behind the actions of the characters and emotion that can be felt. I suppose it takes a certain kind of person to find this enjoyable. It's quite quaint, but it is very cute. If you're anything like me, if you can relate to and understand the message without it being thrown in your face, you'll like this. I quite like this little anime a lot. I love the simplicity of it, as well as the ending. It's nothing powerful and amazing but it's simply the same as enjoying a beautiful day. It's not so much what you did with your time, but just enjoying it for being what it is. Though it looks quite childish, I do believe that a mature audience can take pleasure from this sort of piece.Overall: 9/10--It's simply very cute and charming. It tells a great story given the time frame. The music is wonderful. The art is simple sometimes and amazing other times. The characters truly show heart for one another. I thoroughly enjoyed this, and because it's so short, it's worth sparing 10 minutes and enjoying it for what it is. it turns into a cocoon.Art: 7/10--It's not amazing, but it is charming and very cute.

And it wraps up the series wonderfully. Every episode feels important to the story and character development, unlike the previous season. We continue this season with more episodic buddy cop action, but the subplots all drive toward a singular purpose.The last episode is a little bit of a let down, but if you count the second to last as the last we get perfect resolutions to the important plot points with no useless information attached. We get some kind of resolution to the Miyuki/Ken OTP drama, and a solid crime solved.

I really loved the series, however, it seems they mutilated a couple of two nice characters. One of them was ""reassignated"" to another department, the other was literally vanished, like he never existed.The characters\' complex emotions and struggles left a lot to be desired, the animation was downgraded, all the season seemed like a filler on its own.

I watched the first and second seasons generally close together yet when it came to the third season it didnt feel as as good as it was in the others and i felt like this one was the same jokes over and over.The story itself is great and I loved every part of the police force and...seeing Natsumi and Miyuki working together to get peace on the streets. I loved how these two had a wonderful chemistry that kept on going throughout the seasons and drawing them together over and over. I wished i could see more of these two in action again and again and do wish there could be another season!However there was also things that I disliked...firstly Yoriko's voice is way too whiney and annoying and it made me cringe everytime this woman had a scene or even spoke. And Secondly...Nakajima. Nakajima is a complete looser, coward and downright pushover that it started to get annoying the more times he shown up with his 'love' for Miyuki. I wished so badly that he would leave and Miyuki would realise what a looser this guy was as it made me feel like Miyuki could do better. I know others liked the love that these two had however to me it was downright annoying and unbearable!The art style wasnt anything that 'stood out' and to me this was pretty plain in comparison to other anime however the way the comedy was made me still enjoy this anime to its fullest and you can still have a good time.The characters to me in this was a bit of a good and bad thing. First you have Miyuki and Natsumi that grow together and become somewhat an unbreakable team. However there isnt as much development with these two MCs as its generally the same thing over and over again. Aoi was a character I enjoyed as they protayed his character rather well and I actually liked how they did his design. Yoriko was just a whiney character that I honestly started to give up on and wanted out the show since the end of season 1, she was useless and just a cringe to my ears. Same for Nakajima, this guy was just a pathetic looser that just was there for a 'love' interest for Miyuki however he was such a baby I wished he left and a new better stronger love interest came along. (Or even love between the two MCs!). There was also two characters, the highschooler that turned into police officer however she was transferred and i had hoped she stayed and had more development, and you also had Natsumi's love which seemed to have disappeared somepoint with noone else to take the spot again. The characters dont really change that much and you always see the same ones popping up throughout the series. Which sometimes was annoying having to watch a whole episode to do with 'Strikeman',  'Moped Mama' or 'Nakajima's Pathetic Love' again. The characters could have been better done with newer ones coming into the season and a mix up of the old cast.I'd definitely recommend this anime to people that love Police anime and in general Comedy while working on a job. However I would keep in mind that not much of the characters change and a lot of the same scenes will play out throughout. I was glad I watched this series from start to finish and wish there was more. (tho i still wish Nakajima would leave and Yoriko's voice get better) :P(P.S.

This particular subplot being the major thing that kept the series going also means the series is pretty much over (not to mention that I'm writing this a decade and a half after this last season aired!).Another disappointing part is how Noriko and Aoi are permanently relegated to being comic relief and joke characters incompetent at their job, despite a couple of episodes trying to convince you otherwise, only to backtrack about it in the final episode which is very much unfit to even deserve to be a season-closing episode, it really should have been a special or an OVA instead.(end of spoilers)Essentially, besides action, there's less of everything and less substance, in order to make it as friendly to watch by a new audience as possible, parting with a big side of the soul of the series in the process. It's more focused on solving cases on an episodic basis than to further the relationships between characters. There still are cute moments, but I found myself cringing more than usual when faced with so many rocks left unturned.In conclusion, I would say that it's probably completely fine to watch this season as your first Taiho Shichauzo experience as a gateway to then discover how good and soulful the previous seasons were.However if you've been watching or marathoning the series from the very beginning, this last season will very likely leave a quite sour taste in your mouth considering the amount of amputations it went through. I wouldn't say that it ruins the series, but if you ever were planning to watch it, I think I'd advice not to watch anything past season 2. Or if you're hell-bent to watch season 3 after season 2, you probably should wait for the series to be no longer fresh in your mind so that the contrast with the last season doesn't hit you too hard and doesn't tank your enjoyment of it too much. for the entire duration of the season, as in, none of the characters go through any change from the start to the finish.Most of the support cast which was introduced as early as season 1 was heavily cut down, cutting down by the same token their driving force in character development for the main cast and close support cast, as it used to be heavily reliant on them.(spoilers incoming)What is more of a shame is how they were cast aside.Saori Saga (the highschooler looking up to Natsumi and Miyuki in S1, then joining the Bokuto precinct with everyone in S2) gets transferred elsewhere between S2 and S3 without much of an explanation, only to briefly come back for the token cliché filler beach episode.Sena and Daimaru (Ken's parents) only briefly show up as a plot device to solve the case in the penultimate episode, with no thought spared for them otherwise, despite being the main driving force in the evolution of the relationship between Miyuki and Ken in previous seasons (same goes for Honda the former WRC mechanic from season 2 and his young daughter Megumi, they completely disappeared).Shoji Tokairin from the mountain rescue police who becomes Natsumi's boyfriend in S2 completely vanished as if he never existed in the first place, Natsumi seemingly retroactively going back to her earlier less mature self from before meeting him and resuming her antics with the Chief and embracing her life being single.Inspector Kinoshita, who helped Natsumi grow as a policewoman along the previous seasons no longer seems to exist.Also the main Miyuki+Ken subplot that played a big part previously is barely touched upon as there's little to no further romantic checkpoints happening between them, the two barely interact for the duration of the season only for the subplot to be suddenly and anticlimactically concluded by the end of the penultimate episode.

So if you enjoyed the First and Second season I personally would recommend you to skip it because in my case this season (Full Throttle) does left a sour taste in my mouth and kinda tainted my overall enjoyment of the Taiho Shichau Zo series; if you are a casual enjoyer just want something to fill you mind, ""Full Throttle"" is not unwatchable per se but can be boring sometime so certainly there are more better shows that will worth your time out there.Firstly talking about how...actually is ""Full Throttle"", that it contains about 20 of 24 episodes (episode numbers for Taiho Shichau Zo on MAL is kind of a mess) of filler stories, some of them are good but none of them made much of a dent to the series, and if you have watched the 1999 5 episodes Taiho Shichau Zo Special you know what I mean, this is basically a 20 episodes of that,  they are just meh like chewing a piece of gum that has already been chewed out of flavor. The only pro on top of my mind is the animation quality, the technologies for animation definitely improved in 2007 than 1994 with the help of computer animation the action scenes are smoother and more lively than before.The elephant in the room for me is most key side/background characters from the previous seasons are missing, and instead of making some excuses such as \'they have moved away\' or \'they are busy\' the ""Full Throttle"" decided not to mention them and any past events they have involved in at all, it almost feels like ""Full Throttle"" trying to pretend they have never existed. Which made it even worse are in some occasions where the mentions of those characters/events are almost unavoidable due to the curtail parts they have played for the protagonist\'s character development, the ""Full Throttle"" bypasses them with out of place obscure dialogs or forcefully pretend those events never happened... It is so intentional which drives me mad... ironically some of the \'ignored\' characters does showed up... in the very last few episodes... like at least be more consistent since they were erased for the whole season!! Changing the pasts and erasing the characters breaks the canon which is my biggest criticism towards the ""Full Throttle"".All on screen characters which including the protagonists has their personality slightly altered in ""Full Throttle"", which resulted in Over all the flat/one dimension characters and less dynamic relationships. As for protagonists the major traits are still there but different which feels like freshly built character with the old characters frame, especially for me just off the First and Second Season the strong disconnection of personality and characters are really obvious. Besides, all the support characters become more one dimension and fallen to stupid and useless teammate type of role and less interesting and more annoying. Small segment, the animation art style in ""Full Throttle"" that mentioned previously may also contributed to the personality change a little, cause the new animation used made male characters actually looked and vibe-ed differently from previous season. Further more, the characters perorated in ""Full Throttle"" are more \'serious\' and \'formal\' (less playful and less grounded), the amount of \'formal\' administrative big talks use in this season alone are longer than the previous 80-ish episodes combined. Could be just bad writing but either way the personalities are non canon and flat, and relation dynamic is pretty much not exist, which made the only 2 non-filler stories feels short.Upon writing this I realized the non canon factors, which triggered me the most, are probably just because of bad writing, but also there are few interesting filler episodes...

Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8934/Star_Driver__Kagayaki_no_Takuto,"['Adaptations are becoming a bit of a thorny issue in anime these days, which is a bit odd considering how many are produced every year. The constant conversion of stories from other media is a pretty lucrative business as there\'s already an established market for the end product and its merchandise, regardless of how good the show actually is. Like anything in life though, there\'s a price to pay, and there are increasing concerns about the impact adaptations are having on original works. The resulting negative effect on script and screen writers is beginning to be felt throughout the industry as studios everywhere are finding...that their creative teams are slowly becoming unable to develop original concepts into viable storylines. The reason for this is purely because in comparative terms, it takes more effort, imagination and skill to make something original than it does to rework something that already exists, and if one doesn\'t regularly exercise their ""mental muscles"" in a substantial manner, then their creativity will begin to stagnate.And that\'s the reason why we get anime like Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance).The series begins with Agemaki Wako and Shindo Sugata as the pair take a moonlit stroll along a beach on the fictional Southern Cross Island. Along the way Wako detects the scent of of someone she doesn\'t know, and following the trail, she and Sugata find a young man who has been washed ashore. He is Tsunashi Takuto, and his arrival on the island will awaken his destiny.Well, that all sounds pretty heroic, but that\'s about as far as it goes. Star Driver may initially seem like an interesting proposition, but many of the plot themes are never fully realised, which only exacerbates the fact that there is simply too much going on in the storyline. The series makes some rather nice subtextual introductions at certain points, but no matter how important these may be to plot or character development, they\'re never fully utilised and thus become the equivalent of the human appendix (i.e. totally useless).The storyline progression is handled in the standard ""fight of the week"" manner that is so prevalent in shounen anime and manga, but alongside that Enokido Yoji (series composition and script writer), and director Igarashi Takuya (Soul Eater, Ashita no Nadja, Doremi), have seen fit to add a number of themes that only serve to confuse the audience. In addition to this there are a number of questions that remain unanswered come the end of the series, which may hint at an attempt to have the viewer infer the relevant information rather than outright carelessness.That doesn\'t mean the storyline is bad though. While there may be a degree of confusion, Star Driver does offer up some interesting ideas that could have taken the show in a new direction.Visually the series is a bit of an odd blend as while the concept is predominantly shounen, several of the male characters have a decidedly bishounen look to them. Star Driver seems to play on this by naming Takuto\'s alter ego the Galactic Pretty Boy, but it\'s difficult to tell if this is an attempt to parody the character style. That said, there\'s a mundanity to the overall design that no amount of beautification can remove, partly because everyone is supposed to look good, but mainly because there seems to be a limited range of expressions.While there are a few scenes that depict specific feelings rather well, the majority of the time the characters display very little emotion, and many of the more expressive moments can seem forced or contrived. In addition to this, the complicated and overly sexualised costumes of Glittering Star, the weird posturing, the rather odd mahou shoujo style transformation sequence when Takuto summons Tauburn, and even the design of Tauburn itself, all promote the idea that Star Driver is a parody anime, and this conflicts with the serious tone of the show.Speaking of Tauburn ...The conceptualisation of the cybodies is interesting in that it highlights a degree of innovation and originality, which is odd when one considers the slightly banal approach to character design. There\'s a novelty to the mechas that\'s nice to see, especially Tauburn\'s rather obvious court dandy/musketeer influenced look, so the obvious question is why the same innovative approach wasn\'t taken with the characters themselves. The backgrounds also suffer from a similar mundanity, which is a little disconcerting given the nicely surreal overtones of Zero Time.As for the animation, the character movements are pretty standard, but the action sequences are often fluid and well choreographed. Unfortunately this is overshadowed by the the fact that specific scenes have simply been re-used to the point where viewers may find themselves skipping particular moments, and while this tends to be a fairly common practice in ""fight of the week"" shows, it still smacks of laziness.Which neatly leads me on to the audio side of the series.Star Driver initially seems to be well served in the acting department thanks to the experience of Miyano Mamoru (Takuto), Hayami Saori (Wako), Fukuyama Jun (Sugata), and the rest of the cast, so it\'s a bit strange that many of the roles seem shallow and forced. Part of the reason for this is the lack of facial response on the characters themselves as this gives the impression that the seiyuu are trying too hard, but the script is also to blame as much of the dialogue seems to have been written just to fill in the gaps. All of this makes the voice acting a much more difficult proposition as the seiyuu are often forced to compensate for poor writing.On the other hand the effects are well timed and very clear, and one of the nice things about this show is how it doesn\'t use music, as background tracks are often reserved for occasions of emotive importance or action sequences. There are also two opening and ending themes for the series, and while they tend to have a slightly upbeat feel to them, they seem to work well with Star Driver\'s major theme.Possibly the biggest issue though, is the lack of substantial development on the part of the characters, which could have been somewhat offset had they been clearly defined from the start. Unfortunately this is not the case, and while viewers are given the facade of progression through interactions, conversations, and even action sequences, in reality there is only one thing learned throughout the whole show, and this only occurs in the final episode. In addition to this there are few explanations forthcoming about why the members of Glittering Star are so determined to use the cybodies, and the only thing that seems to tie their actions into the story is something called The Departure (which is another thing that isn\'t properly explained).But that\'s not the worst part.In a nutshell, the characters are dumb, and leading the idiocy is Takuto. The very first episode has him entering the enemy base, but for some reason he ""forgets"" that he\'s been to the heart of Glittering Star\'s operation, and so the secret society is left to continue their work relatively unimpeded. This is possibly the biggest hole in the plot as at that point Takuto is aware of the enemy, knows where they and who their target is, and could very easily expedite a much simpler and shorter resolution. Because of this the so-called past traumas, the posturing, the banality of the high school setting, pretty much everything used to define the characters in some manner, all become slightly ridiculous.So, where does that leave us? Well, on the surface this seems like a pretty solid proposition, especially with Enokido Yoji (who wrote the screenplay for Diebuster), taking part on the production side, and there are some enjoyable moments that occur throughout the series. Star Driver is nothing if not an interesting idea that tries to approach certain concepts from a different angle, and the little touches of innovation here and there add a pleasing quirkiness to proceedings.Sadly, it\'s not enough as the series retains a ridiculous quality that isn\'t helped by a decidedly sub-par script, seemingly emotionless characters, and the lack of any substantial explanations. Star Driver tries to do too much with too little, and the apparent attempts at parodying certain themes only adds to the confusion and makes the plot more convoluted and overly complicated.This may not be an adaptation of any sort, but that doesn\'t mean that it\'s automatically good, regardless of who worked on it. There are some positives within the series, but ultimately this is nothing more than mediocrity at its finest.The fault lies solely with Bones, who in the last two years have produced one original anime franchise (Tokyo Magnitude 8.0). Everything else has been an extension of an existing title, or an adaptation from another medium. Unfortunately they\'re just one studio out of many that continue to try and cash in on the popularity of something else, with no regard for the effect this has on the viewer or the industry itself. After all, it\'s easier to blame things like fansubs for falling sales rather than admit that what you\'ve produced is nothing more than average. that their creative teams are slowly becoming unable to develop original concepts into viable storylines. The reason for this is purely because in comparative terms, it takes more effort, imagination and skill to make something original than it does to rework something that already exists, and if one doesn\'t regularly exercise their ""mental muscles"" in a substantial manner, then their creativity will begin to stagnate.And that\'s the reason why we get anime like Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance).The series begins with Agemaki Wako and Shindo Sugata as the pair take a moonlit stroll along a beach on the fictional Southern Cross Island. Along the way Wako detects the scent of of someone she doesn\'t know, and following the trail, she and Sugata find a young man who has been washed ashore. He is Tsunashi Takuto, and his arrival on the island will awaken his destiny.Well, that all sounds pretty heroic, but that\'s about as far as it goes. Star Driver may initially seem like an interesting proposition, but many of the plot themes are never fully realised, which only exacerbates the fact that there is simply too much going on in the storyline. The series makes some rather nice subtextual introductions at certain points, but no matter how important these may be to plot or character development, they\'re never fully utilised and thus become the equivalent of the human appendix (i.e. totally useless).The storyline progression is handled in the standard ""fight of the week"" manner that is so prevalent in shounen anime and manga, but alongside that Enokido Yoji (series composition and script writer), and director Igarashi Takuya (Soul Eater, Ashita no Nadja, Doremi), have seen fit to add a number of themes that only serve to confuse the audience. In addition to this there are a number of questions that remain unanswered come the end of the series, which may hint at an attempt to have the viewer infer the relevant information rather than outright carelessness.That doesn\'t mean the storyline is bad though. While there may be a degree of confusion, Star Driver does offer up some interesting ideas that could have taken the show in a new direction.Visually the series is a bit of an odd blend as while the concept is predominantly shounen, several of the male characters have a decidedly bishounen look to them. Star Driver seems to play on this by naming Takuto\'s alter ego the Galactic Pretty Boy, but it\'s difficult to tell if this is an attempt to parody the character style. That said, there\'s a mundanity to the overall design that no amount of beautification can remove, partly because everyone is supposed to look good, but mainly because there seems to be a limited range of expressions.While there are a few scenes that depict specific feelings rather well, the majority of the time the characters display very little emotion, and many of the more expressive moments can seem forced or contrived. In addition to this, the complicated and overly sexualised costumes of Glittering Star, the weird posturing, the rather odd mahou shoujo style transformation sequence when Takuto summons Tauburn, and even the design of Tauburn itself, all promote the idea that Star Driver is a parody anime, and this conflicts with the serious tone of the show.Speaking of Tauburn ...The conceptualisation of the cybodies is interesting in that it highlights a degree of innovation and originality, which is odd when one considers the slightly banal approach to character design. There\'s a novelty to the mechas that\'s nice to see, especially Tauburn\'s rather obvious court dandy/musketeer influenced look, so the obvious question is why the same innovative approach wasn\'t taken with the characters themselves. The backgrounds also suffer from a similar mundanity, which is a little disconcerting given the nicely surreal overtones of Zero Time.As for the animation, the character movements are pretty standard, but the action sequences are often fluid and well choreographed.

Some people were initially on board because it looked like a throw-back to old school mecha. Some watched it because it looked like a full on parody of 90\'s anime with the ridiculous nature of the show combined with the over-the-top style. And even more watched it because it was penned by the same guy who did the composition for Revolutionary Girl Utena, Yoji Enokido. Yet when the credits rolled at the end of episode 25, it was obvious to me and to anyone who stuck with the show that Star Driver...was its own beast so to speak. It incorporated elements of the things I mentioned above yet it never really followed through with any one idea. Surely a mish-mash of these ideas would create schizophrenic anime which tries to do everything and succeeds at nothing, correct? Any other circumstance, I\'d tell all of you yes, because there\'s absolutely no way an anime like that could ever be good. Yet against all odds, I found myself enjoying Star Driver more and more as the weeks went along until I reached the startling conclusion that hey, Star Driver was good! Not just good but pretty damn awesome and compelling! I wrapped my brain around why I was enjoying it so much, when virtually every aspect of the show was working against it. I mean what kind of anime has the audacity to take itself seriously when the main character\'s title is ""Galactic Pretty Boy""? The answer is: Star Driver, an anime that somehow manages to pull it all off, and pulls it off with a healthy dosage of fabulousity.SD\'s story isn\'t really something out of the ordinary. A secret organization made up of high schoolers are bent on taking over the world with giant robots that are sealed in a pocket of space/time while some random Mary Sue shows up to thwart them with his own ridiculous giant robot while sporting an equally ridiculous costume and Mahou Shoujo-esque transformation scene. While this is the basic premise of SD (and pretty much every episode), many people will think it gets repetitive pretty soon (and believe me, it does). So why would anyone like it? Well my answer is derived solely from one aspect of the show and that\'s primarily the subtlety of the execution. The subtle way exposition is fed to the audience, the subtle way characters are presented and written, it makes for a really compelling style. Its one of aspects that made Utena as good and popular as it was. Now I know BONES\' anime have a notorious reputation of not holding the audience\'s hand at all when it comes to story-telling and much of it becomes read in-between the lines or not addressed at all. Star Driver also does this, but only to a degree. It\'s not so vague that it becomes frustrating but its mysterious enough to compel the audience to continue watching. It gives the audience a chance to think about the plot and characters by themselves and tactfully delivers the answers later at an appropriate time. This is a grand form of storytelling not because the story itself is good but mainly because of the way its presented. Unfortunately while the storytelling borders on masterful, there are some really annoying pacing problems with the whole package. Case in point, most people will drop this in the first 5 or so episodes. I wouldn\'t blame them because the show has very weak start, where characters are very slowly introduced and the show pretty much relies on the mecha fights to carry it for 20 minutes. Didn\'t help that the fights were usually only 1-2 minutes long. It slowly builds itself up and it really gets better after episode 7 but I can\'t really look favorably at the beginning since it could have played up the shows strength which is characterization instead of lolhijinks and boring-as-hell mecha fights. The show also drags towards the end which is honestly baffling to me since there was plenty of material they could have used to make things interesting. Yup, around the end it sort of reverts back to the formula used at the beginning, but thankfully gets its shit together and ends on a strong note.Now like I said earlier, SD\'s characters are its strongest point. Even when nothing but high school antics are happening on the screen, there is a sense that everything that happens has some meaning behind it. So when characters often start talking about inane or seemingly pointless topics, it can turn out to be euphemism or a metaphor that has relevance to the plot. Now I don\'t mean all the antics and comedy have some ulterior theme to them, sometimes there really are comedy scenes to make the audience laugh but more often then not, you\'ll be thinking about some lines of dialogue long after they\'ve been said. This brings me to another element that SD does really well and that\'s character interactions. Instead of long flashbacks about something or other, character\'s personalities are revealed through the way they act around each other, especially when the tone becomes serious. And these are probably the best parts of the show, Sugata\'s conflict with Takuto, Mizuno general interactions with her sister, Kanoko\'s demeanor and attitude towards the Glittering Crux and Wako\'s internal struggle between Takuto and Sugata are all great. Even more impressive is the fact that SD goes out of it\'s way to characterize minor characters as well as major characters. You can probably argue that Takuto himself is the Mary Sue and isn\'t characterized worth shit but at the same time you could probably write papers on how his real personality is implied in juxtaposition of the Mary Sue front he shows to all the characters and even the audience. Hell you could even write an essay on how his first phase ability makes him the main character of the show with his catch-phrase ""Dazzling the stage"" as proof of how meta things can appear.  It doesn\'t go as far as Utena does but it certainly isn\'t a slouch slouch in that regard.As per all BONES anime, the art and animation is done very well. There are loads of awesome sakuga cuts for all the animation fans out there. Generally the fights can be very repetitive with Takuto winning all the time but the animation can make them very exciting sometimes. It doesn\'t happen too often since I can count the number of times where everything aligns on one hand but when the art, animation, plot and music are all synched in excellence, it becomes very awesome.  But be warned, this isn\'t really an anime where the mecha fights are the most important part of the show, most of the backlash towards the beginning happened because the mecha bits were actually the worst parts. Mostly because the fights are nothing more than a tool for characterization in the end and you\'re enjoyment of it will revolve around how much you care for the character that fights Takuto. I won\'t say the mecha aspect is downright terrible, but I honestly think they could have better implemented the Cybody fights to coincide more with the plot than the characters. Some of the best episodes in the show don\'t even have any fights in them. The sound on the other hand is really good and is strong throughout the show. SD has some of the best insert songs I\'ve heard in quite a while (like Monochrome) and uses them very efficiently. The other tracks manage to keep up with the vocal ones as well, so its not like the rest of the OST is bleh in comparison. The voice work is also typically good, the best performances come from Jun Fukuyama as Sugata, Ayano Niina as Kanako and Akira Ishida as Head. Can\'t say I\'m not sick of Mamoru Miyano after watching a lot of animu but he pulls off Takuto\'s happy-go-lucky attitude well enough and still manages to convey his more serious moments with the appropriate tension.Star Driver really turned out to be that one show you liked but couldn\'t really point out why. Kudos to all those people who stuck with it through thick and thin, god knows it tried our patience many times. But for all its apparent shortcomings like derp pacing, flaky mecha moments and wasted potential, it still manged to be one hell of an anime, and a great ride. I\'ll definitely miss the Saturdays where I stayed up all night into the wee hours of Sunday morning discussing the newest episode and whatnot. If you haven\'t watched it, I recommend really pushing through those first couple episodes because they\'re not the best this anime has to offer. Star Driver offers a really unique experience that I haven\'t seen in much-if any anime, so I strongly recommend it.oh and(ﾉゝ∀･)~キラ☆ KIRABOSHI!because it had to be done. was its own beast so to speak.

For me, that's what Star Driver is. It's one of those stories that's just... different. Maybe there are animes that could be similar, but this one just stands out.If you think about it, the story is simple. The Galactic Pretty Boy has to defeat the Glittering Crux Brigade, in order to... well, we're looking for 'save the world', I guess? Other than the names, it sounds pretty generic, but I gave it a perfect 10. Not because of some sort of game-breaking plot device...that ultimately makes the plot 10 times cooler, but it's simply how they pull it off. Even if some parts are cliche, it's still pretty original.Now, art. I just have to say, Tauburn is the pimping-est looking mecha in the history of ever. All the mechas (or Cybodys) have very vivid and special qualities, making them different to each other. All with very good color schemes, and unique designs. The characters are pretty well done. Sort of like Code Geass, where they go for the tall skinny characters. But unlike Code Geass, characters are younger, and for me, are a bit more proportioned. I give it a 10.Voice acting, opening theme song, ending theme song, background music, sound effects... Oh, and a special song that plays whenever they fight.... It suits the anime perfectly. There's really not much to say here. No complaints whatsoever. 10.Well, since I don't want to name names and spoil anything, I shall just refer to them by the color of their hair. Red is the lively and upbeat type of person. Believes in good, yadda yadda, all that jazz. Common in a main character, so no complaints there. Yellow is the normal-ish clueless one, and Blue is the quiet and mysterious ones. Alright, the mains are a bit generic, but as I said earlier, it's how they pull them off. The supporting cast are a colorful (Both hair-color-wise and personality-wise) set really able to help tell the story of Star Driver. Plus, the development with all of them, God, it's just freaking good... (Yes, I can be creepy)Overall, I really like the anime. I enjoy every episode, and I think a lot more people should watch it. There are currently nine episodes right now, and each one is good. It's an unusual mecha anime, of which the likes I haven't seen in awhile, and of which I hope to see more of soon.Have fun. that ultimately makes the plot 10 times cooler, but it's simply how they pull it off.

I saw this anime in the January 2011 copy of the Japanese Newtype, and thought it seemed interesting enough so I decided to watch it. I liked how the characters looked, and it seemed vaguely interesting, but my high hopes were soon shot down.  I don\'t know if I am missing the pure genius of this anime, or if I just see past all the jiggling boobs and girls who want to tap everything, and see the series for the pile of nonsense it is....SPOILERS, KINDA SORTA, DOWN THERE VVVV.The series had a good start, but after seeing a scene where maids randomly had cat ears and 4 foot bunny ears on, I grew worried of the fate of this series in my eyes. Yada yada, school stuff, yada yada. ""DON\'T GO TO THE OLD GOLD MINE KIDS"" -cut scene to gold mine with girl in her discount sexy time outfit- . Why they decided to buy out a circus and Mardi Gras surplus store, and make the girls dress like they are at a S&M club is beyond me. I just can\'t really take characters seriously if they are looking like a jester reject while wearing a cheesy gold mask with a beak. Just the whole lair in the gold mine thing just baffles me, everything about it. It just seems so stupid to me. Every time they\'d have one of their evil group meetings, I\'d be forced to wait through 4 minutes of all the girls re-crossing their legs 40 times, and shots of their legs and garters. God forbid we see their faces. There also sometimes would be random cheering or booing from what I will assume are 100 fat old hairy men lurking in the shadows, since They never really show any of the other members.In the first 2 episodes, they decided to reuse several scenes like 5 times, and made jokes about 4 times of how wacko, oh i mean Wako is always hungry. There is also really awkward staring scenes between our hero GALACTIC PRETTY BOY and Wako, and throughout the next 4 episodes they try to show that the two are crushing on each other (uh, hello, you already made that clear in the first episode). I thought the mecha stuff was pretty cool, but in the course of 2 episodes having the same type of fights, and the same ending was kind of over kill I think. I\'M GOING TO WIN, GRRRRR. -gets destroyed after a few seconds- OH NOO, -stumbles out- FIRST THINGS FIRST, WE ARE TAKING YOUR LITTLE BADGE THING, GET OUT OF HERE AND GO WORK OUT IN YOUR DARK ROOM, YOU AREN\'T IN OUR CLUB ANYMORE. Also, what was the point of kidnapping Wako in the first place, if she magically appears in her little bubble thing whenever a fight is going to occur while she is doing random things. Let\'s just pray that she isn\'t taking a dump one day, and she is force bubbled into a fight scene. At only 4 episodes in, they don\'t really explain what all this maiden and mecha stuff is very much. Why do these things even exist? How do only certain people have the power to control them, and why do they have to use those ugly masks?Oh, and apparently every time someone is about to fight, the random fish girl in the cage has to start singing. After 3 or 4 times of this, I had enough. I have no idea who this fish girl is, or why she is in a cage or anything. All she does is just play with a chain, and tell really boring stories to some guy that uses way too much hair gel and just rolls around on some couch.Me being a girl, and not a lesbian, the naked scenes, boob jiggling, random make out scenes, and panty shots didn\'t really win me over. Apparently to be in the villain club and a girl, you need to show everyone you are horny, and either make out with people, try to rape them, or be about to kiss them. Apparently the thing to do is to kiss through glass. A moment that made me ""wut"" was when the stacked green hair girl starts regaling the class (while the teacher is talking) about how she is married to some 65 year old and how she gets ""lonely"" at night. Who does this. No on in real life for sure. She also decides to get a hair cut (it doesn\'t look different) in the middle of the classroom during lunch time.Why she lives on a cruise boat and has a alligator in some dirty pool, I have no idea. LOL DON\'T WORRY GUIS HE IS A FRIENDLY ALLIGATOR!Overall, this series had the basis for something really cool, but IN MY OPINION fan service and just trying too hard made this series pretty sucky. I really liked the opening though, so props for that. Too bad I don\'t like the series. It was pretty bland, and could be a lot more interesting. It was also really confusing at times, and I felt as if parts were cut out or that there was a really sudden scene change. The characters had personality, but some of them showed none or only stood out because of there hair color. Maybe this series gets better in the later episodes, but I think I\'ll pass on this series. SPOILERS, KINDA SORTA, DOWN THERE VVVV.The series had a good start, but after seeing a scene where maids randomly had cat ears and 4 foot bunny ears on, I grew worried of the fate of this series in my eyes. Yada yada, school stuff, yada yada. ""DON\'T GO TO THE OLD GOLD MINE KIDS"" -cut scene to gold mine with girl in her discount sexy time outfit- . Why they decided to buy out a circus and Mardi Gras surplus store, and make the girls dress like they are at a S&M club is beyond me. I just can\'t really take characters seriously if they are looking like a jester reject while wearing a cheesy gold mask with a beak. Just the whole lair in the gold mine thing just baffles me, everything about it. It just seems so stupid to me. Every time they\'d have one of their evil group meetings, I\'d be forced to wait through 4 minutes of all the girls re-crossing their legs 40 times, and shots of their legs and garters. God forbid we see their faces. There also sometimes would be random cheering or booing from what I will assume are 100 fat old hairy men lurking in the shadows, since They never really show any of the other members.In the first 2 episodes, they decided to reuse several scenes like 5 times, and made jokes about 4 times of how wacko, oh i mean Wako is always hungry.

Also, I felt the need to write this based on finding the previous review pretty inarticulate, and slightly off-base, however, people are entitled to their own opinions.Story:Yes, the previous review was somewhat right, in that there is a lot thrown at you, but it really isn\'t that hard to keep up with. Also, it\'s to be expected that the first episode gives the audience a lot in order to pull in a big audience. It also makes me a lot more intrigued than turned off. It is a little over...the top, calling the main character\'s newfound power ""Galactic Pretty Boy,"" but it was enjoyable, nonetheless, and honestly, there\'s worse out there.Art:Art is great, and so is the action. They insert a mecha fight scene into the 30 min segment that they are given, and it comes in a little randomly, there are many questions that pop up for the audience, but it was done very well.Sound:I loved it. The background music was better than a lot of series I\'ve watched. Opening and closing scenes were nice (and the animation to accompany them was great.)Character:This is a little shaky because there was so much introduced in one episode that it makes the characters seem very underdeveloped and random. However, keeping in mind that this is the first episode, and I am very curious as to how it all pans out. I like the characters so far at least.Overall:REMEMBER - THIS IS A REVIEW BASED ON THE FIRST EPISODE ONLY.Anyways, I would definitely give this series a try. The opening song with the animation really sparked my curiosity because it revealed a little more about what is to come.

But you loved every minute of it and couldn't stop watching!Well, Star Driver reminds me of those shows.  Each episode contains the same confrontations, the same transformation sequences, the same fight sequences and same slap-stick comedy between the main trio.  But there's just something about the show that just hooks me to it.  Maybe it's the fact that it moves...beyond shows like Sailor Moon and delivers a decent plot, crisp art, great soundtrack, and extremely likable characters (with pretty costumes to boot!)Takuto, the show's hero, ends up half drowned on a remote island.  There, he meets Wako, a happy-go-lucky shrine maiden and Sugata, the cool quiet guy.  He ends up going to their school which turns out to be a lair for these giant mecha robots called 'cybodies'.  Turns out most of the school can pilot these things and what do you know, Takuto can pilot one too.  Complete with his own transformation sequence (because guys need them too!), he turns into Ginga Bishounen (Galactic Pretty Boy) to protect Wako from the 'bad' cybodies.Like I said, story from episode to episode is pretty much the same thing, only with different characters.  But the little side stories and funny moments they add really boosts the enjoyment factor (like Wako's BL fantasies). The beginning episodes give you little snippets and hints for the main plot, then it really starts delving into it starting in episode 20.Art is superb, it's been the only show where I've actually noticed characters eye movements and blinking.  They definitely did a great job with the details and didn't cheap out with the panels. Even the repeated transformation sequences are quite tolerable with the great graphics ;)  Might I add I love their costume designs too!The cast is amazing too, Fukuyama Jun (ie. Lelouch, Grell) plays Sugata,  Miyano Mamoru (ie. Light, Zero) plays Takuto. OP/ENDINGS are catchy and I do like the random songs the characters sing from time to time.The characters have taken on almost stereotypical standard character types from anime.  Takuto is the bright, optimistic guy, Sugata is the cool, level headed pretty boy.  Wako is your damsel in distress but still very likable.  While not entirely original, it's been tried and true.  The antagonists are well introduced, each with their background story and specific quirks, they actually don't really feel like bad guys.  It's really easy to get attached to the characters.To be honest, my enjoyment rating is higher than all the other ratings (I gave it a 9), which doesn't really add up.  But I have to say that I am really addicted to this anime at the moment.  I definitely recommend for others to try, maybe more so for the girls since I feel there's some male fanservice going on in here (if the transformation sequence is any indication) =P  All in all, a fun enjoyable watch! beyond shows like Sailor Moon and delivers a decent plot, crisp art, great soundtrack, and extremely likable characters (with pretty costumes to boot!)Takuto, the show's hero, ends up half drowned on a remote island.

Galactic Pretty Boy! Tauburn!!!"" Such a stupid and embarrassing line that I would never repeat in public in a million years, but there\'s something about this series that\'s just so captivating and moving.\'STAR DRIVER: Kagayaki no Takuto (Takuto of the Radiance)\' is like a homage to various \'70s mecha anime. Everything about this series screams of classic Japanese mecha, superhero, and tokusatsu, while many modern elements, for better or worse, are also incorporated. The surprise is: Everything clicks.The story of \'STAR DRIVER\' is summarized by caged girl in the beginning and later in the school play: ""Planet of Fish"". The...evil organization ""Kiraboshi"" aims to reach the stars by breaking all 4 seals of Zero Time and activate cybodies in real life. Kiraboshi\'s leader is akin to Sam in the ""Planet of Fish"" story. On the other hand, Takuto tries to destroy all cybodies so that Mako, the Southern Seal, can leave the island. He represents Mark from the school play. Episodes take the monster-of-the-week format à la \'70s mecha.The characters are the archetype heroes and villains from classic mecha. Our protagonist Takuto is like one of those classic superhero who\'s good at everything, likes to help everyone, and has such a strong sense of justice that he\'s almost naive. Yes, super robots were never meant to be piloted by weak indecisive morons, they were supposed to be piloted by superheroes that kids admire. The hero proactively engaging into the battle to make the world a better place, is a nice change from most recent mecha series. On the other hand, the antagonists are all in an apparently evil organization shrouded by mystery. This character setup is proven to work over and over in iconic classic mecha series.Scene recycling is prevalent like the retro shows, with cybercasket scene looking like classic mecha sortie, Tauburn appearance scenes recycled with CG-assisted backgrounds, hero \'Sailor Moon\' transformation into uniform. The enemy mecha even explode with delay, \'Kamen Rider\' style, having the protagonist\'s mecha looking all cool in the foreground after pulling off some awesome move.Almost every single mecha moves are borrowed from famous \'70s anime. Yes, the pilots even scream out the signature move names! These are just few that I noticed (and still remember):* Tauburn: ""Tau Galaxy Beam"" - Mazinger Z ""Breast Fire""* Tauburn: ""Tau Missile"" - Getter1 ""Shining Spark""* Tauburn: ""Galactic Cross Cut"" - Daltanious ""Flame Sword Cross Cut"", Voltes V ""V Letter Cut""?* Tauburn: ""Pile"" Attacks - Nu-Gundam ""Fin Funnel"" Attacks* Tauburn: ""Pile Crusher"" - Getter2 ""Drill Punch""* Tetrioht: Bike attack - Combattler V ""Gran Dasher""?* Qophlite: Flight mode - Transformers?The retro influence can even be found in music for this show. Did the insert songs leading up to, and during battles remind anyone else of \'Mothra\'? The two main insert songs were absolutely brilliant. Catchy and well edited, more importantly, godly audio mixing that matched perfectly with every single episode\'s battle initiation.""STAR DRIVER"" must seem like an outdated \'70s knockoff by now, but there are also many modern elements mixed in.Story-wise, the pacing is excellent. It was so captivating that I didn\'t mind the excessive corniness, and just wanted to know what will happen next. It seems like battle in alternate space is a fad this season, with \'Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica\' and \'Yumekui Merry\' following the same format. Our heroes are taken to ""Zero Time"" by Kiraboshi in nearly every episode, where they fight like crazy for the fate of the Earth, unbeknownst to rest of the world. The show ends with a generic modern epic final battle where the protagonist transcends an (supposedly) insurmountable power in the universe. We\'ve seen it in other mecha series like \'Gurren Lagann\', \'Asura Cryin\', \'Heroic Age\' etc. Unlike those mecha series with fail endings, \'STAR DRIVER\' never got too serious, and maintained the so-bad-it\'s-actually-good atmosphere throughout by almost making fun of itself by rolling out one retro cliché after another, thus the corny ending actually worked.The show also had healthy amounts of harem and ecchi. It\'s true every girl in the show were head-over-heels for Takuto or Sugata. However, both of those two main characters knew exactly who they liked, and also didn\'t have to act like a thickheaded retards most of the time, and just brushed off girls they\'re not interested in. Additionally, those guys are supposedly extremely good looking, and have decent personality or mystique, so it wasn\'t too far-fetched that they were the most popular guys on the island (yes, living in an island give girls limited choice too). The ecchi was present in Kiraboshi female costumes and cybercasket scenes, but the girls didn\'t trip randomly for panchira and the camera wasn\'t constantly shooting up to their panties. Although these elements exist as little bonuses, they were never detrimental to the show.The modern artwork is magnificent. Mecha, character, and costume designs were very unique, and the battle scenes were very exciting with fluid action. The visuals were so nice that the horrible CG-assisted recycled scenes seemed to be deliberately done for \'70s influence, so-bad-it\'s-actually good. While the scenery in Zero Time was always amazing, the ordinary world was a bit too bland.The voice acting is wonderful, especially for that of Takuto, Kanako, and Keito. All of were perfect fit for respective characters, and very emotional tones in key scenes. BGM were decent, some of them quite memorable. The OP by Aqua Timez was perfect for the theme, and addictive like most of their tie-ups.\'STAR DRIVER\' was a highly nostalgic mecha series for me, which successfully blended the tried-and-true retro qualities with cliché modern elements to create something completely different. Admittedly, there is the gayness of Galactic Pretty Boy and Kiraboshi members, the abundant corniness, and certain plot holes (like why don\'t they just shoot Takuto in real life?) that the viewer must overcome, but I believe series like this is what anime is all about.

An organization on the island, Glittering Crux wants to unlock the power of the cybodies (the mechs) and use them for....Something.  The cybodies can only be used in zero time, some alternate dimension, and Crux wants to break the powers of the 4 maidens on the island to be able to use cybodies in real space.  This all sounds well in good, its just the execution of the whole concept is pretty subpar...for an anime being released in 2010.-> Note: the reason for the low story marks is because the charecters dick around in school or the island and it is no were near as funny or fulfilling as other mecha anime, namely any Gundam show, or its much closer cousin full metal panic.  If you have not seen full mental panic and are reading this, go see it.  Its infinitely better than Star Driver.Art: The visuals are fantastic.  The cybodies are colorful and seem as powerful as they are made to seem within zero space.Sound: The sound is good, but what really stands out is the music.  Particularly the music when members of crux being to enter there cybodies.  Also in the earlier episodes the fish girl songs combined with the regular music score create a 5th element type sythisius of sound and music that is simply perfect.Characters: the characters are well portrayed, but they are fairly bland when all is said and done.  There is not that much development side from the initial portrayal.Enjoyment: despite its serious drawbacks with the plot for a modern mecha anime, star driver is a fun, flashy show that should keep you entertained for 20 mintues. for an anime being released in 2010.-> Note: the reason for the low story marks is because the charecters dick around in school or the island and it is no were near as funny or fulfilling as other mecha anime, namely any Gundam show, or its much closer cousin full metal panic.

The formula that I am talking about (monster of the week) is common in kids shows. Yes, kids shows! You know those shows that you loved when you were 10 but you 'grew out of?' Well, I WOULD describe this show as sort of a teenagers version of a 'Monster of the week', except this show probably takes on the themes of at least 2 other shows through the time that I was watching it. For a 26...episode anime, this is simply too much to do in a 25 minute show in my opinion, especially since a third of the episode is taken up by a fight scene (every episode, hence Monster of the week).Another issue with this show is the characters. I could find ONE character that I liked. The rest of the characters could all just disappear and I honestly would not give a shit. I'll try to describe the characters despite this. We have the three main characters - Takuto, well I could not find anything special about his character but apparently he can summon a robot under certain conditions and uses dual swords. Then we have Sugata and Wako, who are trapped on the island that this anime is set in for various reasons. Sugata and Wako are also engaged(not really important to the main story). I don't feel like describing the rest of the characters because1. Too many characters. Way too many.2. The characters are all forgettable, partly because of 1. Except for Mizuno. Maybe it's because I actually sympathized with here and she didn't suck as much as the other characters did, including Takuto and co.Animation in this show was bright, colourful, fluid, all that jazz. However I do have an issue with the character designs. The characters all look like stick figures. It doesn't help this show's case that the main character looks more like a pussy than the smallest guy in my school. Also, I think they colour coded the character hair so that we could actually identify the characters from each other because they were so uninteresting otherwise.Music/sound in the show was nothing to complain about really. The only problem with this section is that it is never explained why the girl in the cage is singing the song before the main characters jump to that other dimension (Zero Time). To me this seems like the show is giving the song meaning for no reason at all.I don't know what else to say about this show. The concept of it sounded pretty cool at before I began to watch it but the series ended up being really boring because of a bunch of themes scattered all over the place and really uninteresting characters. I don't think I even got the character names right because of how uninteresting they are. Most of the characters contribute almost nothing to the story and are just there to fill time while the  main villain just goes about his business. I don't think I will ever finish watching this show because I highly doubt the ending will save it for me. I don't really have an issue with 'monster of the week shows', but the parts between the fighting were really boring and pointless. I think I would have just preferred an endless series of fights.To summarize, I would not recommend this show unless you really enjoy huge fighting mecha anime. You won't be thrilled at the characters/story so it would be best to just tolerate them while waiting for the inevitable clash between two huge robots. Otherwise, there are plenty of shows with cool characters that you can relate to and don't make watching a freaking show seem so much like a chore.I hope this review is helpful.This is my first review so feel free to message me and give me advice on how I can improve my future reviews. episode anime, this is simply too much to do in a 25 minute show in my opinion, especially since a third of the episode is taken up by a fight scene (every episode, hence Monster of the week).Another issue with this show is the characters. I could find ONE character that I liked. The rest of the characters could all just disappear and I honestly would not give a shit. I'll try to describe the characters despite this. We have the three main characters - Takuto, well I could not find anything special about his character but apparently he can summon a robot under certain conditions and uses dual swords. Then we have Sugata and Wako, who are trapped on the island that this anime is set in for various reasons. Sugata and Wako are also engaged(not really important to the main story). I don't feel like describing the rest of the characters because1. Too many characters. Way too many.2. The characters are all forgettable, partly because of 1. Except for Mizuno. Maybe it's because I actually sympathized with here and she didn't suck as much as the other characters did, including Takuto and co.Animation in this show was bright, colourful, fluid, all that jazz. However I do have an issue with the character designs. The characters all look like stick figures. It doesn't help this show's case that the main character looks more like a pussy than the smallest guy in my school. Also, I think they colour coded the character hair so that we could actually identify the characters from each other because they were so uninteresting otherwise.Music/sound in the show was nothing to complain about really. The only problem with this section is that it is never explained why the girl in the cage is singing the song before the main characters jump to that other dimension (Zero Time). To me this seems like the show is giving the song meaning for no reason at all.I don't know what else to say about this show. The concept of it sounded pretty cool at before I began to watch it but the series ended up being really boring because of a bunch of themes scattered all over the place and really uninteresting characters. I don't think I even got the character names right because of how uninteresting they are. Most of the characters contribute almost nothing to the story and are just there to fill time while the  main villain just goes about his business. I don't think I will ever finish watching this show because I highly doubt the ending will save it for me. I don't really have an issue with 'monster of the week shows', but the parts between the fighting were really boring and pointless. I think I would have just preferred an endless series of fights.To summarize, I would not recommend this show unless you really enjoy huge fighting mecha anime. You won't be thrilled at the characters/story so it would be best to just tolerate them while waiting for the inevitable clash between two huge robots. Otherwise, there are plenty of shows with cool characters that you can relate to and don't make watching a freaking show seem so much like a chore.I hope this review is helpful.This is my first review so feel free to message me and give me advice on how I can improve my future reviews."", '(This review will only help people how are planing or have watch this anime, and is just to help them understand the format/style of this anime series.)Okay first things first for those who have not watch this anime yet this is not your typical mecha anime series, and if you think that this may look similar to gundam and other heavy mecha anime your are wrong. I my self is victim to this why become Star Driver yes has mechs, has sexy babes but that\'s where everything ends. Its not bad its just the flow of the story and character interaction has not been very...""Interactive"". Yes I have watch 6 episode of the series and will watch it to the end because it will be unfair to judge it this early.Good Point1. Story good enough its not your typical new guy in school meets people then meets friends fight bad guys save girl then that\'s it. So far The main character has to fight against his entire school (I mean it every one in his school) to protect the girl. Yes its not very original but come on the entire school population is against him and wants to kick is ass.Bad Points1. Bad flow yes its to early but in 6 episodes and still the same thing. Fight other students in mask (some are hot female students by the way ^_~) and every time he defeats one they just go by there way no revenge or friendship growth with the main character nor do they interact with the main character.This series reminds me so much of magical girls like sailor moon etc. but for the male version. Its not bad but the lack of flow early in the story is about to poor. I know its still the build up stage but six episode just fighting like magical girls with mech\'s is pathetic - yet original + so being balance is your chose when you watch this.Just finished it so kept my promise...Last thing is you watch it your self and judge it. So that\'s that hope that this helps you guys. ""Interactive"". Yes I have watch 6 episode of the series and will watch it to the end because it will be unfair to judge it this early.Good Point1.

Star Driver appeared to be trying to mix around the classic archetypes of super robot anime, slice-of-life high school comedy and the over-the-top elements of Code Geass. If the series ran for the most part as a comedy like Gurren Lagann where it didn't take itself seriously, then I would have found myself liking this series quite well. Instead the series tries to take itself seriously yet with the many eccentric traits of the characters, it comes across as rather awkward and hard...to take seriously just like Code Geass and is bogged down by quite a good number of issues in its plotting. Many episodes tend to run in a similar setup:1. Takuto is enjoying himself with Wako and Sugata.2. Random member of Glittering Crux in the student body meets with him or tries causing mischief.3. Member decides to challenge Takuto to Cybody battle.4. Takuto overcomes foe.5. Repeat for much of the show's run.This was quite a repetitious setup for each episode and made things appear to be mostly episodic for the show. In addition, the show doesn't really bother going into great detail into its major elements such as what led to each of the students in Glittering Crux to join the group, how Cybodies came to be, how humanity came to discover them and why the Glittering Crux did not dispose of Takuto away from Cybody battles if they desired world domination so badly. The ending also came across as rather weak with a shallow baddie unveiling himself, elements of deus ex machina and failing to provide a proper resolution to the love triangle that later develops with Takuto, Wako and Sugata.There are some elements to the plotting of Star Driver that did work well for me and kept me from dumping it much earlier on. The series does do well at fleshing out and developing the bond between Wako, Takuto and Sugata showing that the three come to greatly care for one another, even as they are aware of the complicated situation they have to overcome with the Glittering Crux and their love triangle. Marino's character arc even lays out some heart-wrenching and deep-seated issues with her that are not as apparent with her on the surface.On the visual end, Star Driver does have clean artwork delivering a decent amount of detail on mecha, character and scenery designs; as well as having its moments of fluid animation during fights between Cybodies. There are some noticeable occasions where the visual quality can drop quite a bit, particularly in some scenes during the middle and last episodes.If you could put up with and enjoy the bizarre and over-the-top developments of Code Geass, then you might be able to enjoy Star Driver more than I did. Otherwise, be prepared for a mostly mediocre romp that tries to blend together the elements I mentioned above yet comes across as hard to care for because it doesn't cover its major elements and is hard to take seriously when it tries to be so. to take seriously just like Code Geass and is bogged down by quite a good number of issues in its plotting.

Let\'s start with the school uniform especially the tie, it looks like an inverted penis, for the girls the tie looks like an inverted penis with balls in the sides of thier collars, 2nd the Glittering Crux Brigade\'s attire, nearly all of the girls dresses in an S & M outfit while the guys dress in a heavy metal band. Also the Cybodies look like a poster symbol for Anorexia, which somehow how makes me think that the artist of this anime seems to be promoting it.

Sadly, it went down to a ""which boy will Wako choose?"" and ""Takuto beats down the Kiraboshi"" without very much development.Art:I don´t have much to complain here. It was a bit too colorful in my opinion, but especially in the fighing scenes, you could see were all the graphic-work went.Sound:The soundtrack was maybe one of the most outstanding features of the anime; the tracks themselves felt good,...and the insert songs were a great addition.Characters:Here it stars going downhill.Most characters hardly change from your first impression. From my point of view, exept the love-triangle centering Wako, there is almost no character development at all.

Takuto saves the day.That´s basicly what every episode was about.With the sole exeption of Head, most of the Kiraboshi-members somehow didn´t take their goal serious, beeing all nice to Takuto or even becoming his friends outside of the fights.

Obviously, the answer to this question will differ from person to person since not everyone has the same taste. That being said, Star Driver is easily one of the most enjoyable shows I\'ve watched in recent years. It\'s just fun and so very very FABULOUS. This show really reminded me what it\'s like to truly enjoy a series despite its faults and plot holes. During every fight I was rooting for Takuto and often I was on the edge of my chair in excitement. Everything from the over-the-top battles and transformation sequences to the very likable and interesting characters made...this show a pleasure to behold.I\'d like to just leave it at that and hope that my genuine enthusiasm for the show will rub off on you, but obviously to give a fair analysis and better understanding of what you\'re getting into I\'m going to break it down traditionally by story, art, sound, character, and my enjoyment.Story: The general plot can be oversimplified down to there\'s people who have giant trans-dimensional robots who want to fight Takuto\'s robot so they do and get royally owned. This in its own right (coupled with the fantastic soundtrack) can be enjoyable on its own. However, the story goes much further in many unexpected ways as we learn more and more about this bizarre ""Glittering Crux Brigade"" and what they\'re trying to accomplish. The general tone of the story is quite varied in how it will switch from comedy, to mech battles, to romance, and suddenly to drama and back again.Something that\'s very important to note about Star Driver\'s story is that it requires a good amount of suspension of disbelief. If you\'ve watched anime long enough perhaps you\'ve cultivated this skill. Otherwise, you might be turned off by the sheer absurdity of it. It\'s not the series\' strong point, but if you can revel in its absurdity, overlook the plot holes, and embrace the ridiculous outfits: you\'ll find a good story with excellent pacing that is neither too slow or fast. (7/10)Art: The art of Star Driver is beautiful, unique, and often fluid. This is what first grabbed my attention when I looked into this series. When they\'re not in ""Zero Time"" the background art of this island looks like paradise and is very pleasing to the eye. When they jump into ""Zero Time"" and start the mech battles, everything gets dialed up to 11. The Mechs look absolutely fantastic while also being hand-drawn. The scenery in ""Zero Time"" is space-themed and is so beautiful that it\'s hard not for it to take your breath away. Check out a battle on youtube if you\'re not convinced.The character animation is done by Bones and as a fan of their previous works like Darker Than Black I was very pleased with the results. Putting a number rating on something so inherently subjective is rather pointless, but I thoroughly enjoyed the art and animation and thus I feel that it deserves special recognition. (9/10)Sound: YOU ARE MY ONLY SHOOTING STAAAAAR!~I feel that the soundtrack is easily the highlight of this show. I loved both OPs and both EDs and thought that every piece of the OST was used appropriately to enhance the intended mood. Each of the Four Maidens has her own theme that is played at the start of each battle and I thought that they were all catchy and a pleasure to hear. The songs ""Cross Over"" and ""Shining Star"" by 9nine were especially catchy and used as ED 1 and OP 2 respectively. It\'s a soundtrack that you will notice, but at the same time it doesn\'t detract from the scene it\'s supporting.With regards to sound effects and voice acting, both are superb. The sound effects during the battles are cool and fit nicely, and the voice actors all fit their roles spot-on. Miyano Mamoru did an especially good job as Takuto with his hilarious engrish and epic battle cries.Overall, the fact that I still listen to parts of the OST daily is a strong sign to me that this show has an outstanding sound. (10/10)Character: The general impression I had of the cast was that they were all unique and likable with very few exceptions. Furthermore, all of the cast feels very real and human. Takuto\'s inspiring and bright personality is well contrasted with Sugata\'s more stoic yet kind demeanor. What was especially impressive is the attention the show gives to properly fleshing-out minor characters. I\'ve always been impressed with shows that can manage a large cast of characters well, and Star Driver is certainly one of them.I can\'t be too analytical of the characters without spoiling plot developments, but what I will say is that each character\'s personality is unique and their interactions are interesting to observe. (9/10)Enjoyment: My personal opinion is that the most important part of any show is how much I enjoyed it. Honestly, Star Driver is one of those shows that you just really enjoy without knowing particularly why. Maybe it was how awesome Takuto was as he skillfully defeated his foes? Maybe it was his ridiculous transformation sequence and catch phrases? Maybe it was the Glittering Crux Brigade and how fabulous they were? Or maybe it was all of it?As I\'ve said before, I enjoyed the hell out of this show. It evoked excitement, put a smile on my face, and made me eager to watch more.

', 'Star Driver is a confusing story of a bunch of kids trying to take over the world. Well, in essence. This show literally can take anything and throw it at you. Sometimes this works, and sometimes… well it doesn’t. The less critical you are of every little detail the more and more enjoyable it can be.The story takes place on a small island with a big secret. There exist giant robots that are sealed away by the maidens of the island. The Glittering Crux desires to release these upon the world. As the seals are broken they come closer and closer to being released into...the real world. However, it is up to the Takuto to dazzle the stage and prevent them from breaking free from the dimension they inhabit! Again and again he fights them off like a true hero! While this is all fine and good and he is quite dazzling… the combat becomes quite repetitive. Sure each Cybody, robot, is unique and has its own gimmick but the fights all feel the same. There is no feeling of urgency as you see Takuto kick ass without any scratches every time. Thankfully if you brave it out the final battles are more unique, interesting, and well, closer to the quality of something that those people can say is “BONES quality action.” That said if I had to grade solely on the episodic action segment it would be pretty bad. However, the stuff taking place outside of Zero Time, the dimension cybodies are sealed in, is a lot more enjoyable.The characters in Star Driver cover every archetype out there. We have the rich ojou who lives on a huge boat and has two servants one of the few I have ever liked, the studious serious mysterious class representative, and a free spirited girl who believes in magic. As a matter of fact, the female lead is one of the least interesting and unique one that comes to mind. She is, however, the maiden which Takuto and Sugata fight to protect. Takuto is very admirable, kind, and the way he enters the battle saying ""Dazzling the stage, galactic pretty boy"" pretty much sums up how he does everything. Sugata is very serious and always looking out for Wako. He is also very quiet and doesn\'t like to be upfront about what he does.  Each and every one of the characters have something about them that will leave an impression on you at one point. If there is one thing Star Driver does right, it is weaving in episodes for each character. Unfortunately I will not elaborate on the characters more because the bulk of what is interesting about the show is finding out who they are.Yes, through the first chunk of episodes they introduce all the characters of the story. Depending on if you like said character the episode can be a hit or miss. The ‘good guys’ consisting of the mains interact through these supporting roles in order to show us each side of the story. By each side I imply that these others are always somehow involved with the cybodies on the island. They don’t go to great lengths to hide their identities, at least to the viewers. The Glittering Crux only wear masks, and when you’re the only person with that hair color AND that seiyuu it is sort of hard to not make the connection.The romance in this ends up sucking for something original and not ongoing. There is not much progress in this although Wako spends all of her time uselessly fawning over our male leads. There are a few good moments but in sort, do not hope for much here.One of the interesting things is the parallelism they make between the story of the characters and the that of which is told behind the scenes by Sakana of ""Sam the Squid Piercer."" It tries to put an artistic or descriptive background on what I was watching and was just one of the many little things that I found interesting. Another little repetitive quirk: The animation scene is the same every time zero time is activated and people board their cybody. The sequence takes a good minute at least, and the same (awesome imo) insert is played for it, switching once half way through.There is one thing that can\'t really be described - Star Driver somehow gets you pumped up. The battles aren\'t stunning, the story takes a while to kick in, but there is just something that makes you want to say \'this is pretty awesome!\' every time you click the play button. So as a disclaimer; If you don\'t get pumped up at all in the first episode it definitely won\'t happen at all. If you lose this after episode one feeling by sticking it out a bit longer till episode 6 or 9 for two good arcs. From there it only gets better. the real world. However, it is up to the Takuto to dazzle the stage and prevent them from breaking free from the dimension they inhabit! Again and again he fights them off like a true hero! While this is all fine and good and he is quite dazzling… the combat becomes quite repetitive. Sure each Cybody, robot, is unique and has its own gimmick but the fights all feel the same. There is no feeling of urgency as you see Takuto kick ass without any scratches every time. Thankfully if you brave it out the final battles are more unique, interesting, and well, closer to the quality of something that those people can say is “BONES quality action.” That said if I had to grade solely on the episodic action segment it would be pretty bad. However, the stuff taking place outside of Zero Time, the dimension cybodies are sealed in, is a lot more enjoyable.The characters in Star Driver cover every archetype out there. We have the rich ojou who lives on a huge boat and has two servants one of the few I have ever liked, the studious serious mysterious class representative, and a free spirited girl who believes in magic. As a matter of fact, the female lead is one of the least interesting and unique one that comes to mind. She is, however, the maiden which Takuto and Sugata fight to protect. Takuto is very admirable, kind, and the way he enters the battle saying ""Dazzling the stage, galactic pretty boy"" pretty much sums up how he does everything. Sugata is very serious and always looking out for Wako. He is also very quiet and doesn\'t like to be upfront about what he does.

From there it only gets better.', 'In a boring world, there are youngsters who seek thrills while having their spirit be their guide. And what could be better than swimming to an Island infested with a evil organization destined to destroy the world, in order to find the fabulous school-life while being a ""GINGA BISHOUNEN""? Welcome to the world of Star Driver: Takuto of Radiance, a glorious anime filled with thrills and school drama. But let\'s not forget the giant robots that fight for their goals, which will prevail, Good or Evil? Ladies and Gentlemen, let\'s not waste more time and jump right in!I will put my review into these categories;...Overview, Story, Characters, Sound and Animation, and my overall enjoyment which serves as a conclusion!The overview:The Story takes place on a Island somewhere in Japan, location unknown, where we follow in the footsteps of our prettyboy and real main character Tsunashi Takuto, in his search for his father and nothing more than the thrill of being young and adventours. What seemed to be a regular Island contains a dark past, where an organization known as The Glittering Crux has evil plans to break an ancient seal, in order to bring the sealed Mechs called Cybodies into the realm of living. The seal is contained within four maidens of the Island chosen by bloodline in order to defend the seal and prevent it from breaking.While the Glittering Crux is successful in breaking the first maidens seal, the others are well protected by our Hero, the one and only; Tsunashi Takuto and his newfound secret Cybody which he inherited; The Legendary Cybody, TAUBURN. Tsunashi is no one else than a ""Ginga Bishounen"", A Legendary Hero and savior. From this point we follow him through his school-life with his friends Wako, which is a maiden, and Sugata, where Takuto-kun from time to time, has to save Wako from her seal being broken by the evil organization in epic battles for survival.The Story:What\'s particularly interesting in this anime is the story, as it is really paper thin, but brings in alot of enjoyment and some big twists here and there to keep you seated and longing to watch more. The story is told in a beautiful way where we follow Takuto through his everyday life after coming to the Island where he meets different people and does a lot of things a normal, yet popular guy would do, like joining the drama club, yes popular kids in Japan do these things. But the story really takes on its climax where near the end of each episode, Takuto will have to fight different members of the Glittering Crux in order to defend the maids\' seals, using different techniques and different abilities in order to prevail. The Story is quite linear and brings an interesting aspect of both school-life and what it would mean to be a Legendary Hero, ""Ginga Bishounen""(Galactic Pretty boy). As mentioned before it is paper thin, as the real plot and real reason behind why Crux does what it does, will not be revealed until the end of the series. As the fights are astonishing, they are the only way to keep the plot developing further, where as the school-life is  just kind of a filler for the relationship building between our three main characters. Which is sad, i wished that the significance of what happened at school would be well, more significant. But the Enjoyment is there, and the reason I keep coming back is because it manages to pull out the kind of two lives that Takuto live, the way the story goes from School to Mech epicness keeps you sitting in your seat wanting more for each episode. And this is the reason why the story is so great, it captivates you by being nearly invisible, the story is basically the life of a teenager gone Super Hero, and it fits this anime to the stone. 7/10Characters:The Characters on the other hand are not really that much developed. And are pretty much just regular teenagers, but with the exception of cool looking hairstyles. All of them have a back-story and a past which at some point get revealed and works as a reminder of why they are, who they are right now. But as the most fascinating thing in this story is how the characters interact with each other, which is basically 1/3 of what the anime is about. Not much of character development going on except for Takuto, which has to grow when he finds out that there are a lot more pressure and responsibility on his shoulders than he initially had thought. As far as the interaction between each character goes, each character has his/her own way of doing things and this kind of becomes a testament for how they are as people. Also on a side note many of the Glittering Crux members also have a past which you get to see, because there are a lot more to them than just evil villains, they have their own reasons for doing their deeds. The Characters have some love relations going on between them which also forces out some of the truth they are trying to conceal and not show to others, this brings in more aspects to what\'s fascinating about the animes characters. 8/10Sound and Animation:I am a man who is really concerned with the animation and soundtrack of an anime as it may make or break and anime for me. And let me tell you this straight out, bleh.... this anime hits STRAIGHT A\'S IN BOTH CATEGORIES. Almost had you there! But dear reader, this anime excels in this category straight out. The wonderfully detailed characters and the use of bright colors, everything is just perfect, the way the robots/mechs fits the characters and how they also made them resemble their users is astonishing. The fights are amazing, the shading and the weaponry are also pretty darn cool. So animation is top notch, and the soundtrack really tingled my senses in a good way. The music fit the animation like no other, like the song ""Monochrome"" which is used right before the summoning of the mechs gives you straight out Goosebumps. The song when Takuto destroys and enemy mech, it gives you the sensation of being there and that you actually won something. The OST is filled with many songs like these and are exactly fit for the situations they are used in, and the beutiful orchestrated music is straight out godly! 10/10Overall:This Anime is not something you watch for the plot, so if you are looking for something really plot heavy and something that goes deeper than meets the eye, this is not exactly the anime to serve those needs. But this an anime you sit to on a Saturday just for satisfaction, it has cool characters and huge mech fights, what more could we need? What\'s interesting is that even if the plot is short to nonexistent it is still pleasant to watch the interactions between characters and how at night Takuto gets to fight big as mechs with his ultra overpowered legendary one. So the strong sides is the way story gets told, from a slice of life point and from the action superhero point. Unfortunately this seems to be good blend actually, it fits each other to some extent that it\'s actually becoming entertaining. And this show is all about flashy colors, big mechs and overall enjoyment with the removing of the heavy and deep plot. So overall, a great soundtrack, a story and animation which fits the genre, amazing fights and a really entertaining day- school life sets this anime at a strong  8/10 for pure enjoyment.Hope you guys enjoyed this review, if you did please give at thumbs up, and enjoy your day!

They wander, get lost, make mistakes, try to find meaning in life, and try to do the right thing. Some of them fall in love, and others yearn to. There’s a pitiable few who get trapped there, and never learn to grow up. That’s Star Driver. There’s also a story, of course, and it does some cool things sometimes, but it’s not what’s ultimately important: the feelings, the friendships, and the adventures.If you just let go and let Star Driver carry you, it’s an incredible ride. Its biggest strengths are that it looks fabulous...and has a strong, weird vibe. Its biggest weaknesses are its plot and repetitiveness.Highly recommended.Kiraboshi! and has a strong, weird vibe.

Okay, Star Driver....*sigh* First, let me start by saying that I, while enjoying it immensely, have really been slacking on my anime viewing as of the past few years. Star Driver is one of 2 anime I\'ve finished since Kill la Kill ended back in early 2014, and one of only about 10 anime that I\'ve finished in like 6 years.  This, most likely, severely impacted my enjoyment of this series...and man, did I enjoy this one!Story:This is, without a doubt the weakest aspect of this series.  Is it terrible? No. Is...it unique? Definitely not. Is it even engrossing in any way? Eh...sometimes...maybe...ish.  The main plot of the series centers around Tsunashi Takuto, a 15-year-old boy who washes up on an island one night and is discovered by fellow teenager Agemaki Wako and her childhood friend/somewhat-fiance Shindo Sugata.  We soon learn that Takuto is actually the legendary ""Ginga Bishounen"" (literally ""Galactic Pretty-Boy""~) who is capable of summoning a giant mech suit (referred to as a Cybody in the series) named Tauburn. We follow Takuto, Wako and Sugata as they try and prevent ""Clichéd Evil Organization #1,987,208"" (actually called ""Kiraboshi: Order of the Cross/Glittering Crux Brigade"") from using other Cybodies and the powers of islands\' four Shirine Maidens for their own dark purposes. Most episodes follow a somewhat ""monster of the week"" formula which can get dull after a while.  And, of course, there is typical high-school life and the required love triangle of the three mains to deal with when we\'re taking a break from the real plot.  The story is nothing groundbreaking, can sometimes be seen as less than coherent and most of the time is just a convoluted mess. It\'s still entertaining in it\'s own right and I didn\'t find it painful to sit through.Art:For the most part, the art-style of this anime isn\'t really anything to write home about. However, when it truly needs to shine, it does so with fantastic results! The animation of each and every ""Zero-Time"" mech battle is simply gorgeous, with the sheer epicness leaving me in a state of ""@)___(@"" 90% of the time. There is a lot of repeated animation but I was never bored watching them play out over and over again. It was just that fun to watch. Shame that most of the fight scenes were under 3 minutes in length; this is one of the areas where the series really shines. On the other hand, the character designs are a strange combination of both flashy and bland.  It\'s the weirdest thing: sometimes they\'re distinctive and interesting (such is the case with characters like Takuto, his seductive...and married...classmate, Mrs. Kanako Watanabe and a few others) and sometimes they leave something to be desired (Wako, Sugata and about 80% of the supporting cast).Sound:This is easily my absolute favorite aspect of this series. I. Love. This. Soundtrack.  It\'s gorgeous, full of epic orchestral pieces and  beautiful character tracks (courtesy of the Shrine Maidens).  In fact, the Northern Shrine Maiden provides me with one of my favorite anime tracks of all-time, ""Monochrome"" (the T.V. version, in particular).  This series does not shirk in the music department. When I can actually remember the tune of the opening and ending themes, I am instantly impressed. And as for the voices, Star Driver is crammed full of familiar talent that is known to deliver. Fukuyama Jun(Lelouch) = Sugata, Miyano Mamoru(Rintarou/Light) = Takuto, Hayami Saori (""Tsuruko""/Ikaros) = Wako.  Other famous seiyuu include Tomatsu Haruka (""Anaru""), Yukana (C.C./everything), Ishida Akira (Gaara/everything else) among many others.Characters:Here\'s where we get shaky again. While the characters are all well-established and easily distinguishable from one another there is little to no development, especially concerning our three main protagonists.  They are essentially the same from start to finish.Takuto is the perpetually happy lead with the gravity defying hair.  He attracts pretty much every female he makes eye-contact with, is pretty much good at anything and everything and is just a super nice guy. You\'ve seen this character 3,000 times and you\'re gonna see it 3,000 more times. The kid\'s just...perfect. He will figure a way out of any situation, no matter how a**-pull-ish the solution seems. He doesn\'t have any further potential to reach as a character because by the start of the series he\'s already reached it. I don\'t hate him as a main character, but compelling? Nah...Sugata is another one you\'ve seen time and time again. The beautiful, dark-haired, quiet type. He sometimes seems to have a chip on his shoulder, but is generally friendly. I wouldn\'t classify him as ""the stoic"" but he isn\'t far from it. He comes complete with angst, family issues, secrets, dark prophecies and other miscellaneous baggage. Somehow, with all this going on, he\'s even less interesting than Takuto.  Oh, and he\'s also a harem-magnet, of course.And Wako...oh, Wako. She\'s pretty cute...she...um...eats a lot...she\'s...nice...and she\'s.....well....yeah. That\'s pretty much it. She is the least realized character in this series and that\'s saying something. Her relevance to the plot revolves around her being one of the only 2 known Shrine Maidens at the start of the series (not a spoiler, I promise) and being the main focus of the underlying rivalry between, otherwise best friends, Takuto and Sugata.  She\'s the female lead, but it really just feels like she\'s there without needing to be. She does stuff, especially near the end, but it feels like ""too little, too late"" by that point. She\'s a decently attractive, bland girl with an undeserved male-following and little else to offer. One good thing is that, while she does occasionally fill this role, she isn\'t always playing the part of ""damsel in distress"".As for the supporting cast... I like them! I like them all a lot! There is a large cast of supporting characters and all of them are a blast to follow. This, along with the musical score and Cybody battles are the primary reason I stuck with this series til the end and plan to watch the movie. From the above mentioned Mrs. Kanako Watanabe to the teen-bishounen loving school nurse to the only girl who can out-positive Takuto (Yo Mizuno) to the creepy anarchistic maybe-lesbians Kei and Ko, I got a ton of laughs from these characters. And they, along with the host of other interesting supporting characters, pretty much provide the best drama for the series. If an episode is uncharacteristically deep and intriguing, it\'s probably starring one of these guys or gals.Enjoyment:I must admit, even with all of its aforementioned flaws, I am very glad I chose to watch this anime. It was essentially just on a whim that I picked the series but I had a blast!  It was just that fun to watch. Stupid fun, but fun nonetheless.  Like I said before, this is only the second anime I\'ve seen to completion in over a year and I desperately missed the medium; since this series is basically and amalgamation of the most stereotypical anime-y things imaginable, my judgement could have been clouded by a sense of nostalgia and fondness!Overall:Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto will most likely not be the best anime you have ever seen or ever will see.  It\'s got a fairly weak story carried on the backs of a fairly standard main trio. However, there are a ton of great side characters to keep you distracted from how confused the main plot has you. The animation at times is just breathtaking (especially during those ""Zero-Time"" battles). And the soundtrack is both beautiful and epic. If you\'re looking for a deep story that will leave you pondering the meaning of existence, you ain\'t gettin\' it here. If you\'re looking to come home from work or school and kick back with a plethora of funny bishounen and bishoujo, get drowned in enough fanservice to make both sexes happy and occasionally have your mind blown by what you\'re seeing and hearing, then check out this series. You could do much worse. it unique? Definitely not. Is it even engrossing in any way? Eh...sometimes...maybe...ish.

He attracts pretty much every female he makes eye-contact with, is pretty much good at anything and everything and is just a super nice guy. You\'ve seen this character 3,000 times and you\'re gonna see it 3,000 more times. The kid\'s just...perfect. He will figure a way out of any situation, no matter how a**-pull-ish the solution seems. He doesn\'t have any further potential to reach as a character because by the start of the series he\'s already reached it. I don\'t hate him as a main character, but compelling? Nah...Sugata is another one you\'ve seen time and time again. The beautiful, dark-haired, quiet type. He sometimes seems to have a chip on his shoulder, but is generally friendly. I wouldn\'t classify him as ""the stoic"" but he isn\'t far from it. He comes complete with angst, family issues, secrets, dark prophecies and other miscellaneous baggage. Somehow, with all this going on, he\'s even less interesting than Takuto.  Oh, and he\'s also a harem-magnet, of course.And Wako...oh, Wako. She\'s pretty cute...she...um...eats a lot...she\'s...nice...and she\'s.....well....yeah. That\'s pretty much it. She is the least realized character in this series and that\'s saying something. Her relevance to the plot revolves around her being one of the only 2 known Shrine Maidens at the start of the series (not a spoiler, I promise) and being the main focus of the underlying rivalry between, otherwise best friends, Takuto and Sugata.  She\'s the female lead, but it really just feels like she\'s there without needing to be. She does stuff, especially near the end, but it feels like ""too little, too late"" by that point. She\'s a decently attractive, bland girl with an undeserved male-following and little else to offer. One good thing is that, while she does occasionally fill this role, she isn\'t always playing the part of ""damsel in distress"".As for the supporting cast... I like them! I like them all a lot! There is a large cast of supporting characters and all of them are a blast to follow. This, along with the musical score and Cybody battles are the primary reason I stuck with this series til the end and plan to watch the movie. From the above mentioned Mrs. Kanako Watanabe to the teen-bishounen loving school nurse to the only girl who can out-positive Takuto (Yo Mizuno) to the creepy anarchistic maybe-lesbians Kei and Ko, I got a ton of laughs from these characters. And they, along with the host of other interesting supporting characters, pretty much provide the best drama for the series. If an episode is uncharacteristically deep and intriguing, it\'s probably starring one of these guys or gals.Enjoyment:I must admit, even with all of its aforementioned flaws, I am very glad I chose to watch this anime. It was essentially just on a whim that I picked the series but I had a blast!  It was just that fun to watch. Stupid fun, but fun nonetheless.  Like I said before, this is only the second anime I\'ve seen to completion in over a year and I desperately missed the medium; since this series is basically and amalgamation of the most stereotypical anime-y things imaginable, my judgement could have been clouded by a sense of nostalgia and fondness!Overall:Star Driver: Kagayaki no Takuto will most likely not be the best anime you have ever seen or ever will see.  It\'s got a fairly weak story carried on the backs of a fairly standard main trio. However, there are a ton of great side characters to keep you distracted from how confused the main plot has you. The animation at times is just breathtaking (especially during those ""Zero-Time"" battles). And the soundtrack is both beautiful and epic. If you\'re looking for a deep story that will leave you pondering the meaning of existence, you ain\'t gettin\' it here. If you\'re looking to come home from work or school and kick back with a plethora of funny bishounen and bishoujo, get drowned in enough fanservice to make both sexes happy and occasionally have your mind blown by what you\'re seeing and hearing, then check out this series. You could do much worse.', 'Well how should I begin this…It’s kind of hard to write a review for this anime and to that I’ve never done it before. You can’t put one animation into simple words everyone understands without spoiling anything but at the same time rate what’s actually happened in the series.This time to put it frankly, my expectations were too high. I always loved Utena and I always will, this\'ll never change. I already knew that Star Driver would probably not be able to play in the same league as Utena, because there are just 25 Episodes and Utena still sparkles with 52 + 1 OVA....Maybe Star Driver would have gotten there somehow but as it is now it feels kind of loose and unfinished. Now for the reason why I think so, I beg your pardon, but this will take a while. ^^’’Introduction:In the first Episode some girl named Wako, a Miko and a guy named Sugata were introduced, both seem to share a connection, he wanted to do something to protect her, something that would seemingly cost his very own life. Wako on the other hand did not even want to think about that fact, she begged him not to.It really felt like there was something bigger behind this, not just a bond they were sharing, something in Sugata must have trigger that feeling to do the ultimate sacrifice.Then someone gets washed ashore, an unconscious boy, red hair, red shirt, white trousers. Wako who seemingly is a lovely and caring person rushes to the boy, because she sensed something near them. Quickly applied first aid saves the boy from death and we get introduced to Takuto the  next day in the Animation.Sugata, Wako and Takuto quickly become friends, and most of the time in the animation you’ll here why. “Because he can put a smile to everyone’s face”.An organization named Kiraboshi is introduced as well or as the subs call them, “glittering crux”, seemingly evil, dark clothing, masks. An organization where no one knows who the other person is, they even have a special greeting, which is still nice and cool after I watched the 25 Episodes. Anyway, they explain that they are here because they want to bring there Cybodies to the outer World.Cybodies are machines or rather mind and motion controlled metallic Golems, each of them has a different ability. Other than in Gundam a Cybody is directly linked with the human mind and soul, if the Cybody gets hit, driver inside will be hurt as well. Glittering crux wants to use those giant metallic things to change the world and/ or be the strongest military might. But there’s a catch, they are only able to ride one within something called “Zero Time”.The Mikos/Maidens of this island (the only one who’s known from the start is Wako) keep this “Zero Time” intact, so that no Cybody is able to enter the outside world. So Kiraboshi has to destroy every Maidens Seal to set their war machines free.That’s a nice reason, everythings good, we learn that Wako and Sugata are engaged, we have some evil plot mostly about changing/ revolutionizing the world or destroying it, but sadly this is where things start to fall apart.Major problems:Takuto, the hero of the series and Sugata seem to be the only interesting guys on the whole island, so everyone female (even the members of Kiraboshi,) is interested in either Sugata OR Takuto. There are lots of episodes where interesting character development is abandoned in favor of mindless swooning. But that is not the main problem.Evil guys are not evil or rather never were from the start, some interesting parts and story strings are quickly tossed aside with some halfhearted explanations through either Takuto or the guy called “Head”.The head/captain of the theatrical club is the only really mysterious person including the pet ""vice"" Fukuboncho from the start, but after Episode 23, after she said something that really stirred something in me, she is never seen again, as are many other good characters.Takuto on the other hand, who’s always in the spotlight, has to fight one or sometimes more members of the evil Crux organization. I will not say why, or explain everything because this is basically a spoiler which will turn out to be the main reason for the story to progress, if you can even call it a story.So the red haired boy, who only got here to this Island to “search for his father and to live out his youth” ends up in fighting with his own cybody, which he inherited from his grandfather, to protect the Mikos/Maidens of this Island. And every Member of the Crux seems to fall prey to his “Tauburn” with simply ONE Attack.Even though the boy stated his grandfather did not teach him anything about Tauburn, he is able to come up with every attack the robot can do in an instant. If he’s in a pinch, fear not after 3 or 4 Episodes it is rather clear how this Animation will progress.Those “fights” are not really impressive or surprising, no matter how strong the opposing Cybody seems, Takuto has, in the end, by no means any problem in defeating the thread before him with one single attack.This is the basic flaw this animation has, and it sadly will drain your patience and your liking to Takuto very quickly (except you are into that stuff ofcourse).Throughout the series are many things which you will never recieve a proper answer to and it is much like the storywriter is saying “Well it’s like that, live with it” to everyone who has actually watched it.The Ending of Star Driver “Kagayake no Takuto” will leave you at awe, not because it is intensely good or bad, but because it feels like you just started it. There was not much progress throughout the series and you could explain everything in Star Driver with just 3 to 4 sentences.Soundtrack and voice acting:The voice acting was great, as always, the watcher is immediately able to feel something from the characters, they are funny when they have to be, sad, angry or secretive. They did a really good job, the best they could to put more feeling into everyone. Sometimes it’s a bit over dramatized but that’s okay, it’s an animation, better that, than nothing. It was great to hear and see the emotions from the characters from the beginning to the end and the charactersongs really warmed my heart.The Soundtrack itself was good, really good, there are a few songs, especially the songs of the maidens which will never be erased from my MP3 player. Sadly those where only distributed through the Blu-Ray limited Edition in Japan. Monochrome alone was so beautiful, soothing and powerful at the same time that I want to see the first ten episodes just because of that one character (Sakana-sama) and her specific song. If you have the chance to buy it, do so, you will probably never regret it.Animation:The Animation of StarDriver was rather well made, it was nothing epic, some poses and expressions appeared to be a bit clumsy, but that’s okay, Anime would not be such fun if it was perfect. Everything looked like it should, there were no harsh differences like in some other animations (Angel Beats for example). Sometimes the Cybodies would get another dark inked shadowing or rather gloss effect, and sometimes not, which is sad, because it looked really nice in the last episode. The clothing of every character was nice, the movements were not overdone, and the movement sequences were okay as well.The “fights” seemed to be flashy and well done at first but the animation lost a bit of its charm because of the story progression and pattern. No matter how good a Crux Cybody including how threatening all attacks looked Takuto would ultimately turn it into a scrapheap with one measly hit, nothing more would it take to make it explode like all others before.Overall I’d state the following, if you are too bored by my writing or do not have anough time to read through it.It’s not that Star driver doesn’t try to be good, it’s fun to watch, but overall it fails to deliver a plot that will keep you going and it even fails to satisfy the viewer in the end. If you expect nothing more than a fun animation, without deep conspiracies or really good and believable villains or reasons to fight, than this is your animation. Likeable, heart-warming characters and a really good OST with some very memorable tracks make it worth watching, but they will not make a few basic mistakes, like major plot holes or the lack of excitement in battle disappear in thin air. It\'s a fun to watch animation but still nothing you want to keep for years to come.To put it bluntly, if they want to explain everything, there will definitely be a season 2 or a movie which ties in. If not this will be my final review for the series.Thank you for reading. Maybe Star Driver would have gotten there somehow but as it is now it feels kind of loose and unfinished.

If not this will be my final review for the series.Thank you for reading.', ""(This is a spoiler-free review adapted for this site)[Synopsis]: After swimming from the mainland, Takuto Tsunashi (Miyano, Mamoru) washes ashore on the Southern Cross Isle. After being revived and cared for by Wako Agemaki (Hayami, Saori) and Sugata Shindou (Fukuyama, Jun) Takuto decides to enroll at the local high school where he meets other students but all the while a mysterious organization has set its plans into motion on the island. The Glittering Crux Brigade, utilizing robot-like technology called ‘Cybodies’ which can only be piloted in a dimension called Zero Time, attempt to break the seals of the island’s designated maidens in order to loose...their technology on the rest of the world. As a Galactic Pretty Boy, it is up to Takuto and his own cybody Tauburn to thwart them and their leader ‘Head’ (Ishida, Akira).[Characters]:There actually isn’t too much to say about the shows protagonist, Takuto Tsunashi. He’s not quite carefree but does exhibit a cheerful demeanor, especially around his friends and becomes serious enough when he needs to be. His cheeriness aside, Takuto doesn’t really have much to his name and without the aid of the famously eccentric Miyano Mamoru – would be a highly forgettable character as he lacks complexity even at a basic level. His desires are straightforward and he does not act proactively within the show so its hard to see if there is anything less than obvious going on beneath the surface with him. It is hard to characterize or describe Takuto outside of his enthusiasm which presents a problem for the show which he must act as the main character in.Wako, the island’s southern maiden, is the one who finds Takuto unconscious on the beachhead and resuscitates him. She is engaged to Sugata however as the show quickly reveals – this arrangement holds about as much gravity to it as if they were distant neighbors. The reason this is bothersome is because Wako promptly finds herself in a love triangle between Takuto and Sugata as she is attracted to both of them – so why her marriage arrangement even exists in the first place is a bit of a conundrum. Wako herself is fairly simplistic like Takuto in that the only things of note within the show are her love interests and her identity as a maiden for this makes her a target of the Glittering Crux Brigade.Of the three main characters, Sugata is the most calm and emotionally reserved. Despite being engaged to Wako he doesn't seem to mind her and Takuto hitting it off or even going on dates however he does appear to care deeply for Wako and subsequently Takuto who he befriends quickly after his arrival. While he is protective of Wako he is unable to do much when Takuto battles with the Glittering Crux Brigade in Zero Time which forces him into a position of inaction – Not the most exciting character trait.Lastly, because the Glittering Crux Brigade and the school which Takuto attends have so many different members and students respectively, a great deal of the cast is given plenty of screen time. While they do not necessarily make up for the rather plain main cast of characters, they are greatly varied and provide a good measure of entertainment as they interact with each other and the protagonists – they display good individuality and at times can be the most interesting thing in the episode.[Art/Animation]:The art and animation is quite good with consistent detail throughout the 25 episodes. While there are no notable drops in quality, the approach to animation sometimes changed depending on the scene. Action scenes featuring the cybodies would sometimes take on a harsher level of shading and the frame rate might lower a by a few however the technique worked well for the action sequences and was even reminiscent of Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann at times.Takuto’s design is quite vibrant, primarily when he is in his transformed / piloting state of the ‘Galactic Pretty Boy. The Glittering Crux Brigade sport crude and revealing outfits which, while matching well with each other, do not really have anything tying them theme-wise to the show or setting itself.[Story]:The story has a good deal going on inside of it but not everything is immediately relevant to the primary plot – which is fine. Some of the more interesting character interactions and exchanges happen independently of the Glittering Crux Brigade’s episodic attempts to break the maiden’s seals and fulfill their goal.The show starts in a “fight an episode” style formula however stays true to that form with only small variations for what I would consider far too long a time. With near comedic timing, the main cast will be enjoying themselves, the Crux Brigade will interrupt by initiating Zero Time by way of their Cybodies, Takuto and Tauburn defend Wako and defeat the enemy at hand, the day resumes. While there are other subplots and characters at play in the show alongside this conflict, the monotony of the presentation is quite memorable. Which brings me to my next point:The characters in this show, for lack of a better phrase, are unrealistically stupid. Firstly, the members of the Glittering Crux Brigade, while expressing disdain for Takuto each time they are defeated and scheming on the sidelines all the while, never feel like they are truly trying to accomplish their objective. They wish for nothing more than to best Tauburn in Zero Time and break Wako’s maiden seal however their diversity of strategy is severely lacking among other things. The true problem with this is that the show gives specific insight into how dumb the characters are being. If they fail to defeat Takuto, why not send in multiple cybody pilots at once to defeat him you ask? Perhaps it because they can’t due to the rules of Zero Time… however this is not the case – they are perfectly capable of fighting in pairs as well as trios and so whatever reason that exists as to why they cannot all team up on him at once is completely lost to me. Furthermore, while one cybody will differ from the next in design and sometimes weapons, the strategies the drivers employ are almost always ‘attack head on and brute force a victory’. The fights themselves are quite nice and well choreographed but upon realizing what the Brigade should be capable of on paper, their actions are extremely underwhelming.To capstone this last point concerning the unintelligent behavior of the characters – Takuto himself is quite frustrating in this regard. Despite the fact that he knows the Brigade is after Wako, he never takes steps to further protect her other then when he fights on her behalf in Zero Time. He is entirely aware of the danger to her on the island however at no point in the entire series does he do any more than wait for the next day to arrive before he is again launched into Zero Time to fight. He knows where the enemy’s headquarters is after episode one but fails to take advantage of this information in any way. It is this stagnation of action that further cripples him as a character for me.Lastly, the show at times boasts what I would describe as ‘false depth. Over the course of the first few episodes we are told a story by the Northern maiden and later in the show are presented with a stage production of a related story. These scenes by themselves are actually quite good and are of my more favorite moments of the show however it is in their near-allegorical nature that they become problematic. The stories these scenes detail are at times quite referential to the plot of the show itself however these parallels don’t always make direct sense and sometimes could refer to multiple things within the plot. It is this lack of a decisive or clear feeling that cheapens what could have been very interesting story telling.[Music]:The music was what I thought was one of the more positive points of the show. Each maiden is attributed one song and these songs often play in correspondence with their character arcs. These songs usually show up come Zero Time and because there is a decent variety of them on top of the orchestral score – I think they keep what could be very monotonous and repetitive transformation sequences quite fresh and fun.The score outside of these maiden songs is not as impressive to me as a listener however the orchestral themes go quite well with the mecha action of the show and lends itself well to the dramatic points of the show as well.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:The show is fun however has actively negative elements that impair it’s presentation overall. There are a great number of things, like Takuto’s outlandish title of Galactic Pretty Boy and the Glittering Crux Brigade’s outfit designs that might suggest the show is attempting to parody something however I saw no conclusive evidence on this note and therein I felt the crudeness of these things worked against what I would have thought was supposed to be a serious show outside of the school happenings and romantic exchanges.Rating: 5I gave the show a 5 because it failed in many aspects to become memorable to me. The primary cast lacked characterization and the side characters, while interesting, were put to such frustrating use within the plot of the show that they themselves became disappointing as well. The show doesn't quite answer all of the questions I wish it did and this is fine in some regards however there are few a spoiler-related questions that could have been given room for explanation that would have markedly improved the show’s plot. You will likely reach the end of the show and have a decent number of your questions answered however probably not the ones that you will have wanted to be explored.[Recommendations]:I would recommend Star Driver to people who enjoy the more hand-to-hand style of combat mecha as well as those who enjoy the episodic fight presentation as the major bulk of the show is spent in this way. The show doesn't sport much in the way of comedy but viewers who enjoy large casts of characters, each with their own thoughts and motivations, will be entertained by Star Driver however may be disappointed by the way in which the show utilizes these otherwise interesting characters. their technology on the rest of the world.

He is entirely aware of the danger to her on the island however at no point in the entire series does he do any more than wait for the next day to arrive before he is again launched into Zero Time to fight. He knows where the enemy’s headquarters is after episode one but fails to take advantage of this information in any way. It is this stagnation of action that further cripples him as a character for me.Lastly, the show at times boasts what I would describe as ‘false depth. Over the course of the first few episodes we are told a story by the Northern maiden and later in the show are presented with a stage production of a related story. These scenes by themselves are actually quite good and are of my more favorite moments of the show however it is in their near-allegorical nature that they become problematic. The stories these scenes detail are at times quite referential to the plot of the show itself however these parallels don’t always make direct sense and sometimes could refer to multiple things within the plot. It is this lack of a decisive or clear feeling that cheapens what could have been very interesting story telling.[Music]:The music was what I thought was one of the more positive points of the show. Each maiden is attributed one song and these songs often play in correspondence with their character arcs. These songs usually show up come Zero Time and because there is a decent variety of them on top of the orchestral score – I think they keep what could be very monotonous and repetitive transformation sequences quite fresh and fun.The score outside of these maiden songs is not as impressive to me as a listener however the orchestral themes go quite well with the mecha action of the show and lends itself well to the dramatic points of the show as well.[Final Thoughts and Rating]:The show is fun however has actively negative elements that impair it’s presentation overall. There are a great number of things, like Takuto’s outlandish title of Galactic Pretty Boy and the Glittering Crux Brigade’s outfit designs that might suggest the show is attempting to parody something however I saw no conclusive evidence on this note and therein I felt the crudeness of these things worked against what I would have thought was supposed to be a serious show outside of the school happenings and romantic exchanges.Rating: 5I gave the show a 5 because it failed in many aspects to become memorable to me. The primary cast lacked characterization and the side characters, while interesting, were put to such frustrating use within the plot of the show that they themselves became disappointing as well. The show doesn't quite answer all of the questions I wish it did and this is fine in some regards however there are few a spoiler-related questions that could have been given room for explanation that would have markedly improved the show’s plot. You will likely reach the end of the show and have a decent number of your questions answered however probably not the ones that you will have wanted to be explored.[Recommendations]:I would recommend Star Driver to people who enjoy the more hand-to-hand style of combat mecha as well as those who enjoy the episodic fight presentation as the major bulk of the show is spent in this way. The show doesn't sport much in the way of comedy but viewers who enjoy large casts of characters, each with their own thoughts and motivations, will be entertained by Star Driver however may be disappointed by the way in which the show utilizes these otherwise interesting characters."", 'Star Driver is... an interesting experience. It\'s a formulaic ""villain of the week"" mech show, but also a very ambitious and unique one. Though it definitely had a set pattern to it, it tried to go somewhere different within that pattern. I went into the show expecting to be indifferent towards it, but that\'s not the effect I got. Star Driver is at the very least worth a glance; here\'s why.Story - 7/10The story is pretty good. It\'s ambitious and certainly quirky. It starts off strong and gets weak nearer to the end, but the ending makes up for it. Admittedly, Star Driver\'s story has...definite flaws. In many instances, the viewer is left to figure things out on their own. We\'re never really told why many of the events in the show are happening, or even why they matter. As I said, it follows a ""villain of the week"" format; each week, the protagonist fights a new enemy and beats them (with a few episodes not fitting this pattern). The show is reminiscent of Revolutionary Girl Utena in this aspect. Many of the episodes have their own side plot, usually relating to the enemy for that week. We get a lot of info we don\'t need, but not a lot that we do. Even in the end there are a resounding number of questions left unanswered. If bones wanted to, they could probably make a season two. They don\'t need to, as the ending is a very good example of an ending that makes up for the flaws in a series.Art - 10/10The characters are drawn in a very fluid (if not anorexic) manner. The show\'s animation never looks bad. What stands out are the mech fights. The battles are GORGEOUS. No two ways about it. Part of me thinks that Star Driver was just made so that bones could show off their skill in the field of animation. If that\'s the case, well played. All the fights are a definite treat to watch. The mech designs are reminiscent of Mamoru Nagano\'s work (Five Star Stories, Heavy Metal L Gaim) and they ARE out there.Sound - 7/10The soundtrack is pretty nice and fits the general mood of the show. The insert songs playing during the battles is a very nice touch. The openings and endings are fine. Nothing too noteworthy, though check out the insert song ""Monochrome"". It\'s fantastic.Character - 7/10While Star Driver has issues with its story, character development is handled rather nicely in this show. If anything, it focuses so much on character development that it neglects the story. We know why each of the characters are motivated, from protagonist to antagonist. Though at first it leaves us in suspense, we gradually learn about each of the important characters, maybe more than we needed to. Still, there\'s a bit left out, likely for suspense. THAT BEING SAID; the cousins arc is one of the most pointless things ever. Why? This arc has characters that were literally brought in, given no backstory, and filled up space. This is the best example of bad character development in this show.Enjoyment - 9/10GINGA! BISHOUNEN! Star Driver is indeed a fun watch; it\'s humorous, intense, and witty. The fights are great and the jokes are pretty funny. For all its flaws I was anxious each week for what the next episode would have. Personally, I love Star Driver for what it is. Is it a masterpiece? No, but it\'s certainly a fun shonen series.Overall - 8/10Averaging all previous factors, the score is a decent 8, mostly due to enjoyment. It\'s hardly the best show in recent years (that would be Madoka Magica), but it\'s definitely an enjoyable one. Even with all it\'s problems I\'d still recommend it as an enjoyable shonen mech series. Light to decent 8. definite flaws. In many instances, the viewer is left to figure things out on their own.

Boy was I wrong. Star Driver had extremely well done art, music, and plot to go with the mecha action. It went above and beyond my expectations and is now one of my favourite anime of all time. Most of the characters were a bit bland, but a few of them were quite intriguing, and the character designs were fairly nice. Definitely something for shonen lovers to see, but also a great series for a casual viewer to watch. "", ""Star Driver is a very cool anime. I found it really enjoying. If you want fan service, I think this got lots.At first, I was like 'another mecha' but no, it isn't just mecha. It is a mecha full of actions, comedies and dramas. This anime has one of the best combo. It didn't fail to amuse me.The art is very interesting. I found it much excellent by checking all of the robots/cybodies. The actions thrilled me much. It also makes me wanna punch my laptop sometimes.So if I were you, I'll watch this with a large bucket of popcorn and sit like a boss. "", ""There was just something about this anime, I don't know what it was, which just kept drawing me in. I would have moments where I was hesitant to continue watching episodes, maybe looking at all the episodes I still have yet to watch and thinking about how they were going to fill them all, but, when I finally did decide to continue, there was just something that hooked me and made me fall in love with this anime all over again.This anime reminds me of Gundam Seed, except with less action and more character development. This anime has a pretty big cast of characters and...while some didn't get the exploration I think they deserved (come on! George and Tetsuya are the hottest guys in the anime and they're barely in it! I feel ripped off! I need my eye candy! D:), this show just seems to have a way of making you fall in love with characters you never thought you would fall in love with and, in the end, I think that's something about the show that is simply amazing, it makes you love its characters so much.A lot of people felt that the lore was really esoteric, but I followed it all pretty easily and it's certainly not any more out there than a lot of other animes I've watched. When it's at its worst, this anime is a simple, plain Mecha anime with a mystic twist, not bad, just a little plain, but, when it decides to get its act together, oh, can it ever be good! There are twists which I was amazed at and moments that tugged at my heartstrings. Mizuno, who I really didn't like at first as she seemed annoying and childish, has such an amazing arc that had me amazed when the big twist finally came and, in the end like every other character, I came to love her so much! This anime definitely gets better as it goes, building off of what the earlier episodes work hard to set down and make the audience comfortable with, until it becomes great. This is also an anime that, even though it's protagonist is male, is arguably a female-driven anime with the majority of characters being female and having the most time dedicated to them and their character developments. Overall, it's definitely not an anime for everyone and I think it may be better for some people to watch the movie instead as it works to streamline the story, but, overall, I definitely don't regret watching this anime. It's not good enough for me to consider watching it again, but it's definitely one I'm glad to have watched and to have in my completed collection.Still, the extra content in the movie is so amazing, especially if you've watched the whole anime. If anything, those few extra minutes gives this anime a huge boost.This is an anime that I find very hard to grade, there are things I adored, but also things that hold me back so, overall, I have to give it 7.5 cybodies out of 10, maybe a bare 8 with the extra movie content attached one.And the adventures of life continue on.... :) while some didn't get the exploration I think they deserved (come on!

What Star Driver lacks in story and characters, it makes up for in music and enjoyment.Story (7/10):The story revolves around your stereotypical shonen character Takuto and his relationship with the surrounding characters, mainly Sugata and Wako.  Star Driver follows the main shonen theme of ""I will protect you"" and the story does a good job sticking to this theme.  Thrown in there are the other classic themes of love, troubled childhoods, and save the world, to name a few.  These other...themes are not fully exploited, probably due to the fact that there\'s so many and not enough episodes, but I think if this became a 50 episode anime, they\'d be able to exploit these themes in the way that they wanted to.Art (8/10):The art is controversial.  It follows the same lines of Lelouch of the Rebellion and CLAMP to some extent, with the bodies all being vertically stretched and big eyes, but somehow this manages to fit the anime.  If you can get over that, the rest of the animation is pretty good, my only complaint is the amount of reused clips, sure it saves on budget, but it should have done what other transforming animes do, like Sailor Moon, Pretear, etc by showing you the full transformation a couple of times, then just do a fast forward.  We don\'t need to see Tauburn stepping through Zero time every episode, it has no significance to the anime, and actually, you never really find out why that mecha does that and not the others but you can put clues together.Sound (9/10):Ok, the first OP was horrible, I could never sit through it, but the second OP was much better and fit the shonen type anime a lot better.  I never watched the ED so I can\'t critique those.  The reason why I rated the sound so high is due to the Maidens\' songs, sure, the first time you hear some of them (West Maiden\'s Innocent Blue) it might be a little high pitched, but it grows on you, just like all of them.  The best has to be Northern Maiden\'s Monochrome, I highly recommend that to be added to anyone\'s playlist.Character (7/10):The characters in Star Driver are very cliche, with Takuto representing your ""I can find happiness anywhere"" (I hate to say this, but another Naruto), Sugata representing your darker character with a lot of unwanted responsibility (almost like Sasuke, but definitely not as moody), and Wako representing your stereotypical shojo character, with multiple love interests and a hungry stomach.  These are the main characters, but you can definitely draw connections from the characters in this anime, to others (Mrs. Watanabe= Rangikou from Bleach for example).  So, the characters don\'t really stick out, and as you can see, I can\'t even remember their full names.  There really is no character development so to speak of, the only one being Mizuno and she\'s not even around for the full series.  Everyone else stays in their stereotyped roles and never budge from them, no resolutions are made.Enjoyment (9/10):I had been trying to find a good anime for a while and Star Driver didn\'t fail me.  I was skeptical at first due to the character designs and other recommendations, but the first episode got me hooked.  You just have to laugh at everything, I mean, having your superhero type being called ""Galactic Pretty Boy""?  You know that\'s thrown in there just to make fun of bishies, and they do play around with that, especially with all the silly, stereotypical poses.  Warning, this anime\'s main focus is not on the fight scenes, so don\'t expect much from them because they\'ll always be a let down (except for the last episode, that wasn\'t that bad).  I guess the thing to keep in mind are all the quirks throughout the anime, some of them are pretty good and I know you\'ll enjoy it as much as I did.Overall (8/10):I just averaged all my other scores and came out with an 8, but I think I would give this anime a 9.  It really wasn\'t bad if you\'re not expecting a deep story, but something light and funny.  The animation was consistent and actually pretty good, if you can get over the stretched style (which is good for making fun of bishie characters).

Overall, just sit back and relax and enjoy the comedy.', ""Sometimes, you get a work that “doesn't know what it wants to be” – shows with a confused tone and jumbled presentation that tried to reach for too many different elements and couldn't grasp them all.  Star Driver is different.  In a weird way, it's a show that knows exactly what it wants to be... but somehow manages to be ignorant of what it is, leading to it rather shamefully squandering loads of potential.So what did Star Driver want to be?  It wanted to be a teen drama/romance mecha fighting show with a 'surprising' emotional heart to it – a spectacle of...action and young love with a zest for life.  The problem is that most of these core elements are... kind of poorly handled.Let's talk about the action.  This is Star Driver's biggest, and probably most insulting problem.  The animation for the action scenes (and the show in general) is gorgeous.  It's bright, it's colorful, it's fast, it's flowing... every moment is easy to 'read' and carries a lot of meaning and impact when it wants to.  The issue is that the fight choreography is terrible.  Most of the mecha battles in the show have very few twists and turns, not a lot of action from either side, and are actually terribly short when you cut out all the long (if pretty) repeated or nearly repeated intro and outro animations.  In fact, I'd say that for the first two thirds of the show, the average mecha battle has maybe thirty seconds of actual robots fighting.  This would be bad on its own, but it's especially grating when the show spends several times as much time on the setup and wind down as it does on the actual meat of the action scenes.  Repeated animation (especially when there is some variation) isn't bad on its own, but when it outweighs by far anything you do with said animation, you've got problems.  I'd contrast this with a show like Kill la Kill, which clearly didn't have enough money to have constant, detailed, good-looking animation like Star Driver, but more than made up for it with excellent choreography and a good sense of what makes a fight scene engaging.Because it isn't (just) how cool the fighters look.  Star Driver has that down, but it fails on other elements.  For instance, there needs to be an ebb and flow of combat.  The best fight scenes, whether they're quick or long, do their best to have each side gain and lose the upper hand multiple times, or at least for good reasons why the tides turn.  You want to see the heroes on the ropes and rally, and to believe in the threat of the villain you also want to see them rally and counter what the hero does now and then.  In Star Driver, most fights start with the villian showing off, and then Takuto turns it around and wins in one hit before you can really appreciate the recovery, and there's never, at least until the final episodes that get this a little better, a fight where the villain can present a continuing threat and the hero's victory doesn't feel trivial or automatic.Further, good fight scenes establish investment in what the fight is about.  You can have two characters beating each other up, but viewers won't be invested unless they understand why these characters are beating each other up.  Star Driver, for all that it actually gives a lot of focus to its villain of the week (too much, if you ask me) fails to establish the stakes that are why Takuto fights against the Kiraboshi Order of the Cross.  OK, they were trying to... um... hurt a girl?  Nullifying Wako's seal would seem to be something that would sting, and it's a pretty jerk thing to do, but beyond that?  What they'd actually like to do with the cybodies once they're unleashed?  It's marvelously unclear; we know that they would have power sufficient to be players on a global stage, but we don't know why they want that power as a group or what they intend to do with it.  And, in fact, individual members of the Kiraboshi Order of Silly Costumes seem to have different opinions: One wants to make money,  another wants outsiders off her darn island, another seems to want some kind of justice... they have too many individual goals to really mesh as a group.  This means, as a weird conspiracy, they're too unfocused for us to really feel threatened by them: they could use those cybodies to burn nations and rule the world with an iron fist or they could use them to make shoes for orphans; the show doesn't really care.  They're kind of jerks to Wako, and while that may be all the motivation Takuto needs, it's not all the motivation we need to be with him when he's putting his life on the line for it.From all of this, we get the main weakness of the show: it spends way too much time and effort in singular areas, and fails to support them properly.The cast is another example of this.  The main characters are, oddly enough, some of the least interesting characters in the show.  Takuto, Sugata, and Wako are (in that order) Bland, Blander, and Blandest.  I can kind of forgive Takuto for this – being the male lead is never easy, and at least he has something of a personality but Sugata and Wako have the defining features of slightly broody cardboard and damp cardboard.  The best thing I can really say about them is that the show does at least seem to know that they're deprived of characterization, and doesn't try to insultingly tell us facts that aren't shown.  They have nothing, but that could and would be worse than nothing, and at least they're consistent in how blandly vaguely nice or so they are.The weird thing is that the side characters are actually rounded and developed.  Minor villains that are relevant for one or two episodes over the entire course of the show have hopes, dreams, and backstories that give them more personality and deeper characters than our leads pretend to have, while more significant side characters like Mizuno or Kate can do even more, and their struggles have the capacity to carry entire arcs that our leads couldn't support.And as with the raw beauty of the animation, you might ask yourself: “Isn't that a good thing?”.  But the problem is that it comes at the expense of things that are more important.  The show, as a whole, could have been stronger if we spent less time with all the nobodies and also-rans in the Kiraboshi Order of Unclear Goals, and more time establishing our main characters as people, or building up some relevance to the battle over the cybodies.  Maybe a couple of the villains could get full supporting character development, but only ones that could actually tie in, rather than distracting from what's actually important here.I say this especially because, once the show actually gets around to giving answers and doing things that aren't just developing Kiraboshi Order of Angst mooks or giving us the 90% same fight every episode... it actually has good answers and good elements.  The final arc's involvement with Sugata is a great turn of events, but it's squandered because he says probably half a dozen words after the turn.  The villain's master plan is great, and in a better work with a better explored villain it could have been something amazing... but we only learn about it in the literally final episode, mere minutes before he's defeated for good.  Other arcs, involving the Shrine Maidens and even the heroes would have had more of an impact if the show as a whole had been paced better, introducing topics, letting them sit with us, and developing them over the passage of time so they have some natural growth, rather than just throwing them at us and resolving them about as suddenly.  The entire structure of Star Driver is like drive-by storytelling: Plots, and not ones that benefit from the element of surprise, appear out of nowhere, hit you, and then disappear as suddenly.  On the whole, the last act of the show is, again, a bit better about this than the show as a whole, but by the time you get there the damage has already been done.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 4 (the pacing is wrong and it doesn't know what to focus on)Art: 7 (It's very pretty, but poorly used)Sound: 8 (This is strong; the Voice Acting is spot on and Monochrome is a beautiful song)Character: 5 (There are good characters, but they're the wrong characters)Enjoyment: 5TOTAL: 5.8 (6)Verdict: Some shows are vastly more than the sum of their parts, using elegant structures and moments of brilliance to spin straw into gold and make something amazing or impressive out of bits and pieces that wouldn't be that good on their own.  Star Driver is the opposite: it takes a bunch of good pieces and proves, that with bad pieces placed in exactly the wrong places, all those good elements can fail to add up to anything worthwhile.  It's not the worst show I've seen, not by a long shot.  It isn't even particularly bad.  But all the same, it's enough of a waste that I really couldn't and wouldn't recommend it. action and young love with a zest for life.  The problem is that most of these core elements are... kind of poorly handled.Let's talk about the action.  This is Star Driver's biggest, and probably most insulting problem.  The animation for the action scenes (and the show in general) is gorgeous.  It's bright, it's colorful, it's fast, it's flowing... every moment is easy to 'read' and carries a lot of meaning and impact when it wants to.  The issue is that the fight choreography is terrible.  Most of the mecha battles in the show have very few twists and turns, not a lot of action from either side, and are actually terribly short when you cut out all the long (if pretty) repeated or nearly repeated intro and outro animations.  In fact, I'd say that for the first two thirds of the show, the average mecha battle has maybe thirty seconds of actual robots fighting.  This would be bad on its own, but it's especially grating when the show spends several times as much time on the setup and wind down as it does on the actual meat of the action scenes.  Repeated animation (especially when there is some variation) isn't bad on its own, but when it outweighs by far anything you do with said animation, you've got problems.  I'd contrast this with a show like Kill la Kill, which clearly didn't have enough money to have constant, detailed, good-looking animation like Star Driver, but more than made up for it with excellent choreography and a good sense of what makes a fight scene engaging.Because it isn't (just) how cool the fighters look.  Star Driver has that down, but it fails on other elements.  For instance, there needs to be an ebb and flow of combat.  The best fight scenes, whether they're quick or long, do their best to have each side gain and lose the upper hand multiple times, or at least for good reasons why the tides turn.  You want to see the heroes on the ropes and rally, and to believe in the threat of the villain you also want to see them rally and counter what the hero does now and then.  In Star Driver, most fights start with the villian showing off, and then Takuto turns it around and wins in one hit before you can really appreciate the recovery, and there's never, at least until the final episodes that get this a little better, a fight where the villain can present a continuing threat and the hero's victory doesn't feel trivial or automatic.Further, good fight scenes establish investment in what the fight is about.  You can have two characters beating each other up, but viewers won't be invested unless they understand why these characters are beating each other up.  Star Driver, for all that it actually gives a lot of focus to its villain of the week (too much, if you ask me) fails to establish the stakes that are why Takuto fights against the Kiraboshi Order of the Cross.  OK, they were trying to... um... hurt a girl?  Nullifying Wako's seal would seem to be something that would sting, and it's a pretty jerk thing to do, but beyond that?  What they'd actually like to do with the cybodies once they're unleashed?  It's marvelously unclear; we know that they would have power sufficient to be players on a global stage, but we don't know why they want that power as a group or what they intend to do with it.  And, in fact, individual members of the Kiraboshi Order of Silly Costumes seem to have different opinions: One wants to make money,  another wants outsiders off her darn island, another seems to want some kind of justice... they have too many individual goals to really mesh as a group.  This means, as a weird conspiracy, they're too unfocused for us to really feel threatened by them: they could use those cybodies to burn nations and rule the world with an iron fist or they could use them to make shoes for orphans; the show doesn't really care.  They're kind of jerks to Wako, and while that may be all the motivation Takuto needs, it's not all the motivation we need to be with him when he's putting his life on the line for it.From all of this, we get the main weakness of the show: it spends way too much time and effort in singular areas, and fails to support them properly.The cast is another example of this.  The main characters are, oddly enough, some of the least interesting characters in the show.  Takuto, Sugata, and Wako are (in that order) Bland, Blander, and Blandest.  I can kind of forgive Takuto for this – being the male lead is never easy, and at least he has something of a personality but Sugata and Wako have the defining features of slightly broody cardboard and damp cardboard.  The best thing I can really say about them is that the show does at least seem to know that they're deprived of characterization, and doesn't try to insultingly tell us facts that aren't shown.  They have nothing, but that could and would be worse than nothing, and at least they're consistent in how blandly vaguely nice or so they are.The weird thing is that the side characters are actually rounded and developed.  Minor villains that are relevant for one or two episodes over the entire course of the show have hopes, dreams, and backstories that give them more personality and deeper characters than our leads pretend to have, while more significant side characters like Mizuno or Kate can do even more, and their struggles have the capacity to carry entire arcs that our leads couldn't support.And as with the raw beauty of the animation, you might ask yourself: “Isn't that a good thing?”.  But the problem is that it comes at the expense of things that are more important.  The show, as a whole, could have been stronger if we spent less time with all the nobodies and also-rans in the Kiraboshi Order of Unclear Goals, and more time establishing our main characters as people, or building up some relevance to the battle over the cybodies.  Maybe a couple of the villains could get full supporting character development, but only ones that could actually tie in, rather than distracting from what's actually important here.I say this especially because, once the show actually gets around to giving answers and doing things that aren't just developing Kiraboshi Order of Angst mooks or giving us the 90% same fight every episode... it actually has good answers and good elements.  The final arc's involvement with Sugata is a great turn of events, but it's squandered because he says probably half a dozen words after the turn.  The villain's master plan is great, and in a better work with a better explored villain it could have been something amazing... but we only learn about it in the literally final episode, mere minutes before he's defeated for good.  Other arcs, involving the Shrine Maidens and even the heroes would have had more of an impact if the show as a whole had been paced better, introducing topics, letting them sit with us, and developing them over the passage of time so they have some natural growth, rather than just throwing them at us and resolving them about as suddenly.  The entire structure of Star Driver is like drive-by storytelling: Plots, and not ones that benefit from the element of surprise, appear out of nowhere, hit you, and then disappear as suddenly.  On the whole, the last act of the show is, again, a bit better about this than the show as a whole, but by the time you get there the damage has already been done.SCORE BREAKDOWNStory: 4 (the pacing is wrong and it doesn't know what to focus on)Art: 7 (It's very pretty, but poorly used)Sound: 8 (This is strong; the Voice Acting is spot on and Monochrome is a beautiful song)Character: 5 (There are good characters, but they're the wrong characters)Enjoyment: 5TOTAL: 5.8 (6)Verdict: Some shows are vastly more than the sum of their parts, using elegant structures and moments of brilliance to spin straw into gold and make something amazing or impressive out of bits and pieces that wouldn't be that good on their own.  Star Driver is the opposite: it takes a bunch of good pieces and proves, that with bad pieces placed in exactly the wrong places, all those good elements can fail to add up to anything worthwhile.

Now that I've completed it, I can officially say... what the hell? =(Where this anime loses points for me is all through the STORY... and that's pretty important.A lot of the episodes were spent doing nothing, when there was a lot to be done and a lot of unknowns to explore. I appreciated the karaoke with Keito (best scene EVER!) and the overall comedy, but I think that the writers could have tried a little harder instead of leaving a million loose ends. Don't get me wrong,...I enjoyed the quirks they explored with each of the students, but felt that things could have moved a bit faster.The ending was unsatisfying to me, personally, because I like to settle everything. Is it because there might be a second season? I'm not so sure about that, I think it's just because they simply shrugged off the details while they wrapped it up.The drawing is adorable, especially Takuto and vice president, and I rather enjoyed the sparkly sparkle of each apprivoise and battle. I enjoyed listening to the beautiful voices of Miyano Mamoru and Jun Fukuyama.Also, I can't believe the limited # of moves Takuto learned... still galactic cross slash, even in the last ep? -_- There's just so much potential that they didn't even touch, about Takuto and his dad, about Sugata and Wako and Takuto, about each of the characters... Why, why, why did it end like this?!Kiraboshi.

And Star Driver is just that.It\'s funny, now that I think back. The element that kinda made me continue watching this anime was because of the Galactic Pretty Boy transformation. Takuto is just so swag, it takes a real man to...shake that pretty ass like how he did! XDOk, veering off topic. Anyway, similar to any of BONES\' original series, the story flies off automatically. Translation: it just means that the main character ALREADY knows what he\'s doing and everyone knows what their doing. Typical shounen animes would start off with a clueless boy who stumbled upon something magical..then POOF!!! ""THY POWER LIES WITHIN THEE AND THY IS THE CHOSEN ONE FOR..."" ...ya-daa ya-daa. But this series just slams the main plot concept in your face! First episode was like a ""Huh? What?"" because there\'s the protagonist whom everyone addresses as The Galactic Pretty Boy, characters who are high schoolers working underground as masked freaks and, if you\'re the type who is so familiar with the mecha designs from Gundam stories, lemme tell ya, Star Driver\'s mechas...have high heels.This series depends on its first episode. The first episode is the one that either breaks or makes this anime. I\'ve seen alot of critiques going, ""ARE YOU KIDDING ME? WHAT A TACKY NAME TO CALL SOMEONE GALACTIC PRETTY BOY"", and boy, it gets worst. And the story? Ambiguous starting, yes indeed. But further into the episodes when it goes into repeat mode (every episode, school-time -> zero time -> battle time -> new bad guy comes out!!! -> saves the day (or the girl) -> returns back to time -> all smiles), you\'ll get used to what powers that are adapting to and how they operate.Now this repeat mode, it\'s kinda frustrating sometimes. There are times when the protagonist does a brand new power to a battle that was difficult to win, and i\'m here like ""urmm, excuse me, when did you learn that power? and why didnt you just use that for your other previous battles? it would have been SOO much easier!""But things take a great turn of events once the second season kicks in, and the real plot gets serious and surprising.That\'s when this series gets the attraction and praises of many, because this is the essence of the anime that viewers are waiting to see. I\'d rather not peer into spoilers here, but it\'s a worthwhile ride and this show really fits the quote ""Expect The Unexpected"". The ending is just spectacular as well! :DThough if you\'re the type who needs to know in how the characters know about the history of their mechas or how the \'evil\' organisation was created or how the characters know of their powers or how the characters even get their powers to ensure that you feel complete satisfaction for the story, then my take is..don\'t watch this.This anime will end with that note. I\'m the type who willingly accepts that this ending is a result from this cut-off plot that BONES is delivering.For the art, it\'s simply amazing! This show practically uses every single colour available in the world! It\'s seriously full of rainbows! Character designs are wonderful, and vaguely describes what kind of character they are which is good because not everyone is what they seem. There\'s a good variation to the characters, and all of them are just beautiful.The music in the background fits very well with whatever happening on the scene, and I must say that the maidens\' songs are definitely something that many will look forward to. The music has that tension vibe that brings chills to your spine and it has that space-galactic-star-trek feel to it too.Overall, this show was, well in the words of the ginga bishounen, very fabulous. It\'s original indeed, with the unique hand motions, gestures and names. It certainly stands out among the rest as something outstanding. And after watching the entire series, you\'d come to realise that the repeat mode episodes, unlike some animes, dwells greatly on character development and not just on the power-ups. The characters interact splendidly and the story never fails to give insights on everyone to ensure that the viewers are given their own judgement to determine if the characters are bad or good.So if decimal points exist, I\'d give it a 9.5 out of 10.Fav male character: Tsunashi TakutoFav female character: Mizuno Yo shake that pretty ass like how he did!

Takuto, the fearless red leader fights the evil circus show called the Glittering Crux to stop them from taking over the world and ruining the Island Maidens lives. Using his super overpowered, unbeatable mecha (and support from his theater club friends) he fights a different reject Crux member every week; defeating them in glorious bishounen fashion. Despite its obvious story flaws I found comfort in the ""monster of the week"" approach that...the series took. It reminded me of a super steroid filled version of power rangers.Story 8As I\'ve stated the story is slightly repetitive and the first time I watched the series I found the it hard to follow. It leaves many unanswered questions until the very end. However the answers to these questions are somewhat surprising and create good character development. I\'m not a huge fan of the ending to this anime, because it seems to reach a resolution so fast and because it is pretty predictable. I did enjoy much of the show\'s humor when it was there and the show\'s serious side was never too melodramatic.  There are a few anime cliches and some yaoi fanservice, which is kind of a turn off, but for the most part the plot flows fairly well and creates an interesting story.Art 9I really liked the art in this series. Everything from character design to backgrounds was amazing. The action sequences were also very well done and flowed smoothly. Emotions and body language are also portrayed well. I especially liked the use of color and tone to set the mood for a scene.Sound 9Openings and Endings for Star Driver are great. Gravity 0 by Aqua Timez is a great song and it went great with the animation. There are also 4 in-show songs sung by the Maidens. These are normally sung preceding an epic mecha fight and serve to set the mood. I really enjoyed all four Maiden songs and thought they were a great addition to the anime. The voice acting is also very well done though there are some pretty ridiculous sounding voices, particularly in the Glittering Crux.Characters 9The characters of Star Driver aren\'t particularly unique. There\'s the main character that all the girls love. He\'s outgoing and you can\'t help but like him. Then there\'s the female lead who\'s super happy and beloved by all. The villains start out as typical bad guys, out to rule with world using their giant robots. However, the anime does a wonderful job of fleshing out many of the villains by showing their everyday lives and motivations. My favorite character by far is Shindo Sugata. He\'s the main character\'s friend and a super badass... watch the anime and you\'ll agree with me, he\'s a beast.Enjoyment 10Star Driver is show that sucks you in.

On the island of Southern Cross there is a mysterious masked organization known as Glittering Crux. Their mission is to discover the island\'s four seal maidens and shatter their seals. Each time they do so, they gain more power over the mysterious stone figures that lay in the mine that they use for their headquarters. With each seal that is broken the more power these “Cybodies” have, until the final seal is broken, and they will be...able to be unleashed upon the world.Unfortunately for Glittering Crux, the island has a newcomer, teenage boy Takuto Tsunashi. Takuto posses a Cybody of his own, the Tauburn. Each time Glittering Crux tries to unleash one of its Cybodies, which become usable in the mysterious dimension known as Zero-Time, Takuto is able transform into the ""Galactic Pretty Boy"" and wield the Tauburn, being perhaps the world\'s only way to stop Glittering Crux from accomplishing their plans. At the same time Takuto must maneuver a love triangle involving his friend Sugata Shindou and his fiance, Wako Agemaki, who is one of the island\'s maidens.Star Driver is a fairly interesting take at first on the mecha genre. It is written by Yoko Enokido, the same person who wrote the show Revolutionary Girl Utena. That show\'s influence on the style of this show is quite apparent. The show is neither your traditional super robot show nor the gritty real robot type of show that Gundam has made popular. Rather it is something completely different. Similar to a show like Code Geass, high school drama is a big part of the show; in fact to a level where you sometimes think the mecha battles are complete after thoughts. The mecha themselves are quite pretty (arguably the highlight of the show) and the storyline is structured that Takuto is only able to fight one Cybody at once, and it is quite complicated for them to be repaired, What this means is that we typically have a new mecha battle practically every episode. Both the design and the animation are fabulous, and the music just adds to it. If I was viewing this show purely on its visuals and styles, it would get a very high mark.When your main character proclaims himself a ""Galactic Pretty Boy"" you learn that you can\'t take things too seriously, and that\'s really the way to approach this show. It is a fun viewing, but usually not very thought provoking. Several aspects of the plot are quite laughable, most notably that nearly every single member of Takuto\'s school is a member of Glittering Crux but they often don\'t realize each other are members when it should be quite obvious. Other rather foolish aspects of the storyline include the perverted school nurse and one of Takuto\'s classmates being married to a wealthy senior citizen who lives thousands of miles away and doesn\'t speak the same language as her. The love triangle between Takuto, Sugata and Wako is also quite a focus although we do eventually add to it other dynamics from several angles to liven things up.Where the show falters is that it becomes very formulaic at times. You generally know exactly how each episode is going to go; namely 12-15 minutes of character development, often focusing on a supporting character, a singing sequence (much like Utena) as Zero-Time appears and Takuto gets in the Tauburn (along with his pretty boy costume) and Takuto quickly defeating his opponent. Rince and repeat. The best episodes are those that completely eschew this formula. The show also has an overabundance of characters. Most notably, a pair of characters are introduced approximately 2/3 into the show, get a lot of focus, and end up being completely useless to the overall storyline. Trimming them as well as several others would have helped, especially as the show rushes its way through its conclusion.If you can get over those faults though, there is a lot to like about this show and it provides a high level of entertainment and enjoyment. able to be unleashed upon the world.Unfortunately for Glittering Crux, the island has a newcomer, teenage boy Takuto Tsunashi.

This can be infuriating to some but I found it nice to be given the space to think about things and try to figure them out for myself. Honestly, I found it a beautiful work of anime bullshit.The only drawback is that it was...decidedly male-gaze driven in unnecessary ways. Female characters are lustful but very few male characters have that as a focusing trait, and in women even sexual harassment is not treated as a problematic behavior but... it's anime. Some of this is to be expected, unfortunately. I did not find this to be a deal-breaker. decidedly male-gaze driven in unnecessary ways.

You\'ve been warned. Disappointing. That\'s one word to describe this anime. It\'s so sad. This show had so much potential and squandered it all! I even gave it an 8 out of 10 at one point. If you combined Gurren Lagann with Revolutionary Girl Utena, you\'d get Star Driver. In this show, characters pilot these mechs called, ""Cybodies."" They can only activate their Cybodies in ""Zero Time."" Which is an area that takes place in a different dimension, at least that\'s what I think it is. The show never really...explains what Zero Time is exactly. Our main character, Takuto Tsunashi, has his own personal Cybody and a secret identity. ""The Galactic Pretty Boy, Tauburn."" Trust me that\'s not a spoiler. He fights against the Glittering Crux,  a secret organization that might also be a cult who considers Tauburn to be a threat to their seemingly evil plans.There\'s a little bit more to the story, but I don\'t need to explain everything. I just want to talk about my problems with this show because it\'s such a let down. How about I talk about the more positive aspects of this show that made me love it in the first place.Pros:• Neat character designs that caught my eye the second I saw them.• Awesome choreographed fights.• Top-notch mecha designs.• Amazing sound design.• Superb voice acting.• The Flamboyancy of Tauburn and the other Cybody pilots.It had nearly everything I wanted out of a mecha anime! I love Tauburn\'s  transformation sequence and how he shakes his hips to get his costume on. It\'s such a fun and unique way to transform and it\'s beautifully animated. I highly, highly recommend the first episode. The show even has cute girls that most definitely appeal to my taste. (Appearance wise.) It has the whole Sha-Bang! This show is like if Gurren Lagann took ballet lessons. I never thought I would say that sentence in my entire life. It\'s not as manly or hot-blooded, it\'s more graceful. I believe in the second ED, Tauburn was using his mech to ice skate in Zero Time, dual wielding star swords while cutting missiles in half. It\'s brief, but stunning to look at.Con:• THE WRITING!Now my biggest issue with Star Driver is it\'s lack of direction. This show\'s lack of direction was just gnawing in the back of my head. I saw this very early on. The first half of this show is just a formulaic ""What mecha are we fighting this week, duuuude!"" kind of show. Meanwhile, the show tries to flesh out more of it\'s supporting cast members by giving them little mini arcs. This was fine for a little while. The second half is when things get rocky. I thought this show was written by Shou Aikawa. It turned out that I was wrong, as usual, and it was written by Youji Enokido. I ended up mixing the the two up because their writing styles are so similar. Both try to introduce too many ideas in such a short amount of time. Their ideas aren\'t bad per se, they just don\'t explain them well. The show isn\'t clear on what it\'s trying to do or say. And the ending wasn\'t very good either. I won\'t say what happened, but the ending has no real closure, it just ends. If only the show had good writers. A 6 out of 10 isn\'t a bad score, but for this show it\'s very upsetting.

The first few episodes of Star Driver are charming, though episodic, and are reminiscent of something like Revolutionary Girl Utena, where there’s a mysterious group of students that secretly battle each other after hours.• In the case of Star Driver, it’s more of the case of when time is halted, they pilot mecha in a way that looks arcane and archaic, like the guymelefs in Escaflowne), which I thought was fascinating. Inwardly, I...was thinking, “They could do so much with this premise and the character selection,” but does anyone expect Studio Bones to deliver… probably not.• I kept praying that this series would be the ONE fucking exception, and that it wouldn’t fall through like a pen on wet paper, but it did! The plot leads somewhere that seems like it was written in five minutes. Like they had spent all thought on how they wanted things to LOOK rather than having a cohesive plot.• A character gets put on a boat and sent away with little to no explanation (probably because they could not even begin to afford Haruka Tomatsu; she’s known for voicing Asuna in Sword Art Online and many other pretty girl characters), and the romances grow convoluted and confusing and you’re left to wonder whether being way too fucking obtuse or it’s just poor writing. Knowing Bones, just poor writing.• The music, character designs, and animation were definitely there, but a direction was not. The series makes itself seem FAR more contentious than it actually is. The ending had a lame reveal and an anti-climatic fight that tries to elevate its depth by taking the final battle TO SPACE.• Many thought that this series was a comedy or a parody, since there were over-the-top operatic presentations in the plot, such a the protagonist being referred to as the Ginga Bishounen a.k.a. Galactic Pretty Boy, and the student council members dressing in dominatrix attire. But, the show takes itself far too seriously for any of that; in fact it’s hard to place a particular tone on this series.• Overall, it could have been handled much better. The visual direction, as I said earlier is very pretty. Takuya Igurashi, the director of Soul Eater and Ouran High School Host Club, did it.

It’s a failed auteur piece and I rate it a 5/10.', ""Star Driver is a show that is more entertaining than it has any right to be. In 2010, scriptwriter Yoji Enokido embarked on a new journey in familiar territory. In Star Driver, the influences of shows that Enokido previously worked on, such as Ouran Highschool Host Club, Revolutionary Girl Utena, Sailor Moon, and even Evangelion, are are bright as day. The final product is a show that crosses existing boundaries in strange ways, the end result being something between a mecha anime for girls and a magical girl anime for boys.As expected of Enokido, the story of Star Driver is one that can be appreciated...on multiple levels. At its most basic level, Star Driver is about a teenage boy, Takuto Tsunashi, with an infectiously positive personality who ventures to an island off the coast of Japan in order to find his father. On this island, Takuto, who reveals himself to be “the Galactic Pretty Boy,” finds himself caught in a series of mecha (or Cybody, as they're known as in the show) battles that take place in an alternate dimension, known as Zero Time, against other teenagers, who make up a group known as the Glittering Crux, with the purpose being to protect, or destroy, the Cybodies of the island’s shrine maidens, which upon their destruction would allow Cybodies to be used in the real world. The series tends to follow an episodic “villain of the day” format. Some viewers may dislike the episodic nature of the series, but it's this structure that allows us to know the cast much better, and the moments that break the formula become all the more impactful for it. Although the Glittering Crux are our antagonists, they aren't evil, just high school students struggling with growing up in their own ways. On top of that, the focus of Star Driver isn't the Cybody battles, which are as beautiful as they are brief, just like how Utena wasn’t about sword fighting duels, it's the high school students that pilot them and the inherent struggles of youth, with close attention paid to the phenomena of love. Like in Utena, everyday life segments that make up Star Driver vary in tone; some are as flamboyant and satisfyingly-ridiculous as those you would see in Ouran, while others take a dramatic turn. Ingrained in the story is the conflict of being born and raised on a small, isolated island; in such a setting. Character struggle to determine whether they have a duty to follow tradition or are free to follow their aspirations. On another, deeper, level, the story is about the experience of trios. Many characters of the cast make up their own respective trios of friends, and one of the most subtle but engaging aspects of Star Driver is observing how these trios differ. The dynamics and personalities in these groups cause them to experience different struggles, and seeing how they overcome the conflicts that arise as a result of their relationships is one of the most engaging parts of the series. The characters of Star Driver tend to be fairly well-written, although some are expanded upon more than others. The show has a very large cast, so some members of the ensemble are more-or-less deemed insignificant compared to their peers. Star Driver isn’t perfect. At times, the story and lore can be confusing, there is a fair amount of terminology, although it isn’t overwhelming by any means, and some things you may think are important the plot or lore of the series are ignored. The ensemble cast may have been too large. But at the end of the day, Star Driver’s story is still comprehensible and the flaws don’t detract significantly from the experience.The designs are great throughout the series. The designs of the characters are as vibrant as their personalities. The characters of Star Driver are birthed from a diverse color palette, and it’s interesting how the colors swap to fit the setting, such as the bright colors during school-life scenes or the darker purples during Glittering Crux scenes. The costumes of the Glittering Crux in particular are pretty cool. When it comes to mecha anime, however, the designs of the mecha are vital. In this regard, Star Driver is quite unique. Some viewers may be put off by the slender frame of most of the Cybodies, which differ heavily from those found in Gundam. However, I found the designs very refreshing and visually-appealing. That’s not to say there are some weird costumes and Cybodies, but they’re easy to overlook given how strong the other designs are, and if anything, they not-as-good ones will make you laugh (like the torso-sections of the costumes of a certain duo that appear in the later half of the series).Star Driver is produced by Bones, so it's not a surprise that the animation is well above what you would expect from most anime. The animation is generally very good. Lines are clean and movement is fluid. Cybody fights in particular are beautifully animated, even if they are short. Because of the show’s episodic nature, animation does get reused. Typically, before a Cybody fight begins, the viewer will see about 50 seconds of the same footage in which the “villain of the day” enters their Cybody and Zero Time opens. During part of this sequence is some noticeable CG, but it isn’t there for very long and the anime is generally pretty free from the intrusion of noticeable computer-generated animation outside of some effects to make Zero Time more unearthly. Also, even though this sequence is formulaic, it is nonetheless exciting, as the different pilots will change the sequence slightly, and throughout the series these sequences are accompanied by great music with vocals. The animation for some of Takuto’s attacks also gets reused, as well as the sequence in which Tauburn, the name of Takuto’s Cybody, enters Zero Time, as well as that in which he transforms into the Galactic Pretty Boy, although they are animated so beautifully I can’t fault them for getting their mileage out of these sequences. I never got tired of them, but their status as recycled is noticeable to any observer.Sound is a category in which Star Driver excels, whether you are speaking about the voice acting or music. Miyano Mamoru does a fantastic job as Takuto, but it doesn't stop there. The most important members of the cast are also voiced by talented individuals. The soundtrack for the series is also great. Each of the 4 maidens has their own song which they sing throughout the series. The songs do a good job of hyping up the viewer for the battle that immediately follows. The non-vocal background in the series is also quite good. Not every song is memorable, but they never detract from the experience and convey the tone and atmosphere of the scenes they accompany very well; they blend in very well. Star Driver also has fantastic opening and ending sequences. The songs chosen do a good job of enhancing the animated scenes they accompany, particularly the openings which are fantastic. The great opening sequences really embody the energetic and youthful nature of Star Driver.In short, Star Driver is entertaining and engaging because of how these different components come together. It isn't a perfect show, and some may be turned off entirely from decisions like the episodic formula, reused animation, or Enokido’s writing style, but for others, Star Driver will be a show that will resonate with their souls just as strong as masterpieces like the Tatami Galaxy because the elements may combine in a way that turns out to be exactly what the viewer wants from an anime, as it did for myself. on multiple levels.

That’s not to say there are some weird costumes and Cybodies, but they’re easy to overlook given how strong the other designs are, and if anything, they not-as-good ones will make you laugh (like the torso-sections of the costumes of a certain duo that appear in the later half of the series).Star Driver is produced by Bones, so it's not a surprise that the animation is well above what you would expect from most anime. The animation is generally very good. Lines are clean and movement is fluid. Cybody fights in particular are beautifully animated, even if they are short. Because of the show’s episodic nature, animation does get reused. Typically, before a Cybody fight begins, the viewer will see about 50 seconds of the same footage in which the “villain of the day” enters their Cybody and Zero Time opens. During part of this sequence is some noticeable CG, but it isn’t there for very long and the anime is generally pretty free from the intrusion of noticeable computer-generated animation outside of some effects to make Zero Time more unearthly. Also, even though this sequence is formulaic, it is nonetheless exciting, as the different pilots will change the sequence slightly, and throughout the series these sequences are accompanied by great music with vocals. The animation for some of Takuto’s attacks also gets reused, as well as the sequence in which Tauburn, the name of Takuto’s Cybody, enters Zero Time, as well as that in which he transforms into the Galactic Pretty Boy, although they are animated so beautifully I can’t fault them for getting their mileage out of these sequences. I never got tired of them, but their status as recycled is noticeable to any observer.Sound is a category in which Star Driver excels, whether you are speaking about the voice acting or music. Miyano Mamoru does a fantastic job as Takuto, but it doesn't stop there. The most important members of the cast are also voiced by talented individuals. The soundtrack for the series is also great. Each of the 4 maidens has their own song which they sing throughout the series. The songs do a good job of hyping up the viewer for the battle that immediately follows. The non-vocal background in the series is also quite good. Not every song is memorable, but they never detract from the experience and convey the tone and atmosphere of the scenes they accompany very well; they blend in very well. Star Driver also has fantastic opening and ending sequences. The songs chosen do a good job of enhancing the animated scenes they accompany, particularly the openings which are fantastic. The great opening sequences really embody the energetic and youthful nature of Star Driver.In short, Star Driver is entertaining and engaging because of how these different components come together. It isn't a perfect show, and some may be turned off entirely from decisions like the episodic formula, reused animation, or Enokido’s writing style, but for others, Star Driver will be a show that will resonate with their souls just as strong as masterpieces like the Tatami Galaxy because the elements may combine in a way that turns out to be exactly what the viewer wants from an anime, as it did for myself."", 'The anime (Art and Character Design) is cute, Pacing is horrible, soundtrack is repetitive, battles are short and repetitive, characters are not well fleshed out and lack true depth, the world isn\'t fully thought out etcThis anime has a lot of issues, and whilst I would consider it a ""Bad"" anime it wasn\'t enough to simply just drop the anime.As I write this review, I am on Episode 7 and not much has happened in terms of character development, of both the Mains (I\'ll canonically refer to them as the trio) and the villains.Whilst the anime is doing well in terms of the animation and...the Art, I\'d recommend people skip this show if they are bored. the Art, I\'d recommend people skip this show if they are bored.', 'The anime is 10 years old and not top of the charts, but decided to write a review anyways, because it is a bit contradicting -  in that the story is absolutely awful, but there are some elements in it that are quite beautiful. Not going to criticize the story since it seems to have been done to death but will list some things about this show I liked:Nice element 1, the relationship between Wako, Takuto and Sugata. Time and time again in love triangles, the female lead goes with either one or the other; in harems, hostility is the usual theme between male...characters since they are inevitably romantic rivals. But in this series Wako managed to maintain the love for both male protagonists until the end. The dynamics between Takuto and Sugata is also interesting. They share the same love for Wako, but their common objective of protecting her prevails and bond them together, which results in some nice bromance. Basically any time the 3 spend time together, I find it a pleasure to watch.Nice element 2, not quite sure about the word, but perhaps cinematography? For example how the music and the scenes are mixed. The ED in the first half by 9nine has a nice tune, but the short scenes during the ED where the 3 share funny moments are done nicely that fits both the anime theme as well as the music. Wako\'s song ""Komorebi no Contact"" performed under Sugata\'s house on his birthday is very refreshing: The song itself is rather simple, but coupled with the scenes, it shines. The way Head plays with his candy balls, his painting on Sora standing on the beach, these little things add atmosphere to the show. (It\'s just too bad the plot never went anywhere...)Nice element 3, the stories within the story. The tale ""Squid Piercer"" told by the North maiden, and the play during the school festival by the drama club is awesome. Yep the main story is an incoherent mess, yet the mini-stories make up for it somewhat.Nice element 4, while the development of side characters are mostly incomplete, I think some of them have great potential. Like say the North maiden. She\'s imprisoned, but amazingly, she has that ""I don\'t fear my captor and I just don\'t care"" air about her and tells her story passionately, gradually it becomes confusing whether it\'s Head that imprisoned her physically, or that she captured Head with her story instead.Perhaps the best way to watch this one is to use ""turn off logic but pay attention to the little things"" mode, which I think works. characters since they are inevitably romantic rivals.

Remember Kids Next Door? This is that but with 100% more leather. Their roster is filled out with all the usual archetypal thirsttraps - the 15-year-old (married) milf and loli senpai, both of whom fall for the main character (tell me you didn\'t see that one coming), serious megane girl hopelessly in love with the...main characters\' (male) side-piece, horny school nurse (ah yes, feeling up your patients, who are also kids, is totally good practice, and she is also totally head over heels for the MC, hehe, par for the course at this point) and, rounding things off, the power-hungry mystery main 40-something boss who masquerades as a teenager, because drama and also ends up being the main character\'s long lost daddy in the end (this shitshow somehow managing to channel the most harebrained and cliched plot twist of the last century, somehow). What\'s their motivation? What\'s their stake in this shitshow? I could not tell you, because I was never told. All it comes down to is that they wanna take over the world with Cybodies, the mechas of this show, and to do that they need to break the seals of four maidens. Oh, they also do this corny ass gesture where they make a horizontal v-sign in front of their right eye and yell ""Kiraboshi!"" (glittering star). Basically, this is a plot that feels right at home in one of those retro h-anime with demons and/or alien girls or something. Also, the megane girl ends up being a double agent or something, but I lost all motivation to pay attention at that point. That\'s something for all your ""twist"" lovers in the audience, I guess.The main characters aren\'t any better either. The protagonist is a one-note chosen one, predictably, and I can\'t think of anything notable to mention about either of his two main companions other than them being sentient mcguffins, who just end up being dragged around with the so-called plot. I think a couple of other mcguffins are introduced in the second half of the story, but they\'re just more of the same.The mecha fights are so monotonous episode after episode. Go into ""Zero Time"" (a pocket dimension or alternate reality plane where time stops for everyone except the relevant, and I use that term loosely, characters), trade a few blows and then blast em away with a finishing move. Like seriously, I came across this anime by sheer chance and the mecha designs looked interesting enough to make me want to give this a shot.

The Fable,https://myanimelist.net/anime/55911/The_Fable,"['NOTE: This review is purely for the first 3 eps of The Fable anime. I have not read the manga or watched the live action adaptation, so I won\'t be referencing those in this.The Fable is an interesting anime. Here\'s the premise: Satou Akira, our main protagonist, is known as the infamous genius ""Fable"". A lot of things are easy for him, but being a normal member of society isn\'t. He has been given a special mission: not to kill anyone for a long period of time. Believe it or not, this may be the toughest mission he has yet to take on.The Fable reminds...me of a more serious version of Way of the Househusband. The MC is a badass Yakuza member, who is often oblivious to his own surroundings, and has to work with others in order not to blow his cover. Just like Househusband, Fable has very good comedy imo. It\'s one thing to write good comedy on paper, but delivery is just as, if not, more important imo. Saying a dumb joke with a deadpan voice might illicit a completely different reaction than if u were to say it with a cheery voice.Characters: I enjoy the cast of The Fable a lot. Akira is a very enjoyable main character, he has that ""dead inside"" vibe which I tend to like with these types of shows. He\'s clearly tired of life, constantly making jokes about how others will outlive him and such, so he\'s trying to find different things to look forward to, even if it\'s the stupidest shit (like a certain third rate comedian that he loves). Youko Satou is also enjoyable to watch. She is disguising as Fable\'s sister and her lines are funny too, the main thing she is looking forward to is ""a good man"".Score: 9/10Sound: The sound in this show is very good. From the SFX to the voice acting, they have nailed this aspect down to the tee. The fights feel real and have stakes, you can feel every hit and punch. As I mentioned, the voice acting is also top tier. The cast of VA\'s is stacked, seeing as there are big names such as Miyuki Sawashiro, Akio Ootsuka, and Kana Hanazawa. Additionally, the chemistry between Miyuki Sawashiro (Youko) and Kazuyuki Okitsu (Akira) is very natural and smooth. Their character interactions are dynamic, quirky, and overall engaging.Score: 10/10Animation: I saw a lot of people complaining about this, saying that ""Tezuka production ruined another great manga... blah blah blah"". Look, I don\'t think the animation is S tier, but it\'s certainly not bad. In fact, it\'s pretty good. Even though this is the weakest part of the show, the fights still look fluid and are well composed and choreographed. The character art could be a little better, but even so, I ain\'t complaining.Score: 7/10OP and ED: I love the op, ALI once again delivered. Visuals aren\'t anything out of this world, as it mainly consists of still shots of the various characters, but the song is an absolute vibe, so for that reason alone I enjoy the opening theme a lot.The ending however leaves a lot to be desired. Not only is the song really bad (it\'s shitty autotune rap) but the visuals don\'t stand out as they just roll credits and have slideshow visuals. You can definitely skip the ED and u won\'t be missing out on anything.Opening Score: 9/10Ending Score 3/10Combined Score: 6/10Overall, I believe that The Fable is a very enjoyable show that anyone can enjoy.

But then it got me thinking about the nature of adaptations and the difference between western and Japanese approaches to adaptations of previously existing works. I’ve expressed my frustration about the predominant use of manga adaptations over original works that have taken over the medium before, but my frustrations have only grown in the handling of the adaptations. Japan...(from what I’ve gathered) seems to hold the idea that adaptations should be a one-to-one exact replica of the original and fans get angry when this rule is not followed. However, I believe that adaptations should not strive to be a one-to-one match with the source material.Manga and anime are two very distinct genres and should be treated as such. The first and very prevalent example of this is pacing. I recently started watching Fate/stay night (2006) and it was incredibly difficult to get into because it was obvious that the first two episodes could have been easily condensed into one. I was just waiting for the story to start as I watched scenes that could have easily been cut without changing anything. Keeping all of the same character intros, all the same world building and character building; with slight tweaks to events (that don’t matter at all for the Ordinary World) and tighter writing, you could have easily cut that down to 20 minutes and it would have been so much more engaging. And that is just minor adjustments. You can do that at a large scale in the story as well. What people fail to realize is, although giving plot and characters time to grow is important, which is what manga excels at, a tighter script will ultimately help investment in those characters. If someone has a huge character moment but then it takes 6 episodes for their character to have another character moment, then by that time, I have already lost investment in that character. With manga, you don’t have to worry about this. Each chapter is created as its own thing so they can be dedicated to certain characters or story beats. With a cinematic medium however, where lines between chapters are blurred, all aspects of the story have to be moving at the same pace.To give an example to what I mean, I believe Horimiya (2021) is the greatest manga adaptation when it comes to pacing. Although I’m glad it did happen, I really don’t believe Horimiya Piece was necessary at all. This is coming from someone who loves the manga to death and enjoys every chapter. I am so glad they decided to tell the whole story in one season, because with that time limit in mind, they could narrow the story down and cause a greater emotional impact. By picking and choosing which chapters were important: what they could cut and what needed to stay, they controlled the pacing. And it’s not like they only chose chapters that had emotional moments. There was plenty of filler in the show, but that filler was also especially chosen. By opting to choose filler chapters, they gave the characters time to breathe, and for us to both enjoy their shenanigans and let us see the fruits of their efforts. What’s the point of Miyamura growing closer with people if we don’t get to see their dynamics? It helps with pacing, with the themes of high school and with the overall emotion that is set later. By seeing their friendships, when Miyamura reflects on his life, we have seen first hand that he is in a better place and we get that emotional resonance.Now Horimiya’s chapters are more episodic than most but you can take that principle and use it on more long narrative shows. By choosing which scenes are important, which can be condensed, which can be rearranged to match with other scenes and what can be dropped entirely, you create a more balanced, well paced, tighter and overall a lot more engaging story. You don’t need to match the manga one-to-one. You can add scenes, you can combine scenes, you can take out scenes entirely to make it more cinematic, and enhance the anime experience. That is what anime can offer that manga cannot. Manga can be planned out, but it is written chapter by chapter. Anime can be written with the whole picture in mind, and the whole story laid out for them. I don’t mind rewrites as long as they serve to enhance the story. The whole last episode of Horimiya, with the “what would life be like if that one coincidence didn’t happen”, was an anime original. And it was one of the best scenes in the show.I’m not asking to ‘How to Train Your Dragon’ it and change the story entirely, I’m just saying that you can change the story to better fit the medium. A good example of this is fight scenes. You can’t show action that well in manga so when you have a medium that can, use it. Let me see better choreography instead of the still frames in manga. You can do that. That’s why I’m loving Wind Breaker (which is coming out by the time of writing this review). Because the fight scenes are shown to us. That was one of my biggest issues with Demon Slayer; we just didn’t get to see the fights all that much. What we saw were still frames of peoples faces and them explaining the fights instead of just showing us. I don’t need characters to tell me the enemy is too fast when you can just animate that and show me. I understand it’s necessary in manga, but you don’t need that shit in the adaptation. If you’re just going to tell not show, then why make it into an anime at all?That is a good question: why are anime adaptations made at all? Pretending that it’s not because anime is run by talentless hacks who don’t have the balls to fund an original story, anime is the stories of manga with voice acting, movement, color and music. With these additions however, and the severe lack of proper funding, a lot of the detail that made manga so captivating is lost. I understand why people say the manga for One-Punch Man or Death Note was better. Because when you read the manga you see how much effort was put into every panel. The details of the drawings are incredible and by reading it, you have time to appreciate it, instead of with anime where those shots are gone in a flash. There are pros and cons to each medium. So a good adaptation will have a reason to be adapted. A reason where adding movement and music and voice acting will outweigh the loss of detail and make up for the difference in pacing. The adaptation has to add to the source material.Two great examples of this is Love is War and Food Wars. Starting with Love is War, not including the dramatic music and superb voice acting, the amount of original visual gags that they added enhances the comedy so much that it improves the jokes of the manga. Like the cowboy standoff in the 20 questions game. The reason for making it into an anime was because by making it a more visual experience, you can add to the jokes. It’s not watered down, it’s enhanced. With Food Wars, I will admit, I have not read the manga. But I cannot imagine it working in any other way than cinematically. Food Wars works because it embraces how batshit insane it is. The operatic music, the over the top voice acting, the visual flares all create an experience so surreal that I cannot imagine just reading it. It would not have the same impact. To add to that, the presentation of food is very important to its taste. So to try to show off these insane meals without color just doesn’t work. Food Wars needed to be an anime because, although it might miss some detail on the food, the need to enhance the dramatic presentation is so much more important to the story and the aesthetic.Not all manga needs an anime adaptation. Going back to Fable (yeah this is still a Fable review) the anime is just a watered down version of the manga. Sure the voice acting is good, but the details of the faces and the environment that made the manga feel so grounded is lost in the anime. And the voice acting just doesn’t make up for it. The music is forgettable, the fight scenes don’t play a huge role in the story and they weren’t even animated that well (due to budgeting). The addition of color doesn’t add much because it’s not important and there are animation errors. The movement is stilted and the lines of the face are so obviously drawn that we lose the realism of human interaction. There was no reason at all to make this adaptation. You have to look at the merits of the source material and decide what can be improved by adapting it. The merit of The Fable magna is how grounded it is. The characters are drawn realistically instead of stylistically. Nothing is fantastical and it is drawn and written in such a way to make you think this could happen in the real world (to an extent, it is pretty goofy at times). So if you were to adapt it, how would you do it? Well, I would drop some plot lines, choose to focus on certain characters, tweak the story and make a Live-Action movie. With a movie the themes and narrative have to be extremely focused. You lose the realism in the anime, but it would be enhanced through Live-Action. I don’t think it’s necessary, but that’s the only way an adaptation of Fable could work. What we got, and I see now that is what many manga fans have been getting, is a watered down version of the source material. I understand now what those people mean when they say ‘you should just read the manga.’ All because of the philosophy that adaptations should be one-to-one copies.Though those people who say that shit could stop being petty assholes about it.

You get to see Lucius explore and get inspiration from these modern-day inventions to bring to his fellow Romans. It\'s beautiful.There are no...""hateable"" characters here. There was no actual ""villain"" in this series. If anything, Lucius\' enemy was ""art block."" So don\'t expect some action scenes here.

But some scenes are mixed with a bit of CGI. The background characters would move so fluidly while the characters in the foreground would move with certain frames per second. You can tell easily which one is CGI and which is not. I am not really against the use of CGI in anime. It\'s just that it\'s very obvious to not point out. But that did not hinder me from enjoying the show.Towards the end of every episode, we get to hang out with the author of Thermae Romae, Mari Yamazaki.

The 2D art style is decent, but the 3D one, is just ugly and poorly made. At least this isn\'t a fighting show, so it doesnt matter that much.-> It have a constant orange/coffee like colored filter, maybe to fit the Ancient Roman Thermas theme, but sometimes it just feels weird, almost feeling like everything is dirty, but maybe this is just a personal pick of mine.-> The character have some weird design choices, their face expressions are just too small and subtle, almost being non existent, if not for the constant change in voice tone to enhance them, they could have done something more expressive.At the end, it\'s a good, interesting and relatively funny show, a much needed change in the usual Isekai Formula we are all fed up, especially considering this is coming from from a Netflix. story, what inspired the author.The only criticism i have towards this show are the following:-> The mix between 2D and 3D art style, that as always, it\'s just ugly.

He has huge art block and has problems with making something that other Romans would appreciate, after he visits the Japanese bathhouse he has a lot of ideas to improve his project.I think it could be good anime, but after a few episodes, it’s just boring. The concept for every episode is almost the same. The main character, Lucius Modestus can’t find an idea for a new bathhouse, he’s getting to Japan through water, finds something interesting and...new, gets back to Rome, and do it in his project. And it’s just it, in all episodes which I watched. Maybe in another episode, something more is happening, but after 5 episodes I had enough.From the cultural side, it’s kinda nice. You can learn something about Japanese and Roman bathhouses and culture. I didn’t know before a lot of things that were shown in anime, but the construction of the episode is just too much for me.Anyway, Lucius is a kinda good character. You can see his motivation and goal in all this stuff, he understands what he needs to do and why what is uncommon in anime made by Netflix. His background is just the usual, dead father, dead grandfather, but it’s not about revenge. He just wants to be approved by Roman society and do bathhouses in which everyone can relax and regenerate to work for Rome even harder than before.I also really appreciate that Lucius and Japanese people can’t communicate. It’s common to have a situation like “I’m Roman and can speak Japanese”, but here is nothing like it, he doesn’t understand them, they don’t understand him and that’s beautiful.But here is my biggest problem, the main part of the episode ends and you wanna see the ending, but there’s no traditional ending. There is 2-3 min of the author’s story about how she discovered things that Lucius find out in that episode. I think it’s nice to do something like it, but maybe as another episode for people, that’s more interested in this.That’s why I think this anime is 5/10.

To top it all off, the author of the series included clips from her adventures in discovering bathhouses in Japan, which is just so fun to watch as well!My only issue is the animation continuity, or lack thereof. While the majority of the animation is great, some parts of the animation is 3D animated. 3D animation in anime...can be awesome (look at Beastars for example), but here it looks like it was just a way to cut cost and time.

For context, I am a Classics and Japanese double major at university.  I've been studying Latin for years, I am half-Japanese, and I love onsen.Story 7Thermae were public baths in Rome, and were popular places to relax, get clean, and talk to others.  Lucius Modestus, the main character, is an architect and thermae designer.  In each episode, he faces a variety...of challenges: demanding clients, impossible requests, or rude visitors.  He finds the solution to each of these problems in a surprising place: by accident (usually by falling or slipping) he can sink to the bottom of a bath in ancient Rome and emerge in a modern-day Japanese onsen.  He is mistaken for a foreigner, and is helped out by the Japanese people around him.  He is shocked by the technology and customs that he finds in onsen, and when he returns to Rome, he incorporates these things into the baths he designs, which become huge hits with the Roman people.  Every episode after episode 1 follows this plot line, so after a while, you know where each story is headed, but it is still a funny and novel story.Of course, as a Classics major, I was laser-focused looking for historical accuracy (ignoring, for a minute, that the main gag of the show is time travel), and there are actually some great historical aspects in this show.  The show takes place during the reign of Emperor Hadrian, and works to keep itself within that timeline.  They show Trajan's Column, and mention that Vesuvius erupted around 50 years ago.  There were some great details in the scenery of the first episode, where there was graffiti on the walls, and the boys were wearing bulla.Art 6There isn't too much to be said about the art.  It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great.Sound 7I watched the show in Japanese audio with English subtitles.  When Lucius is in Japan and tries to speak to the Japanese people, he speaks in Latin.  I would have loved to have listened to the Latin closely and judged its accuracy, but unfortunately it sounded like gibberish.  Kenjiro Tsuda is a phenomenal voice actor, he's one of my favorites, but his pronunciation of Latin was almost impossible to understand.  When I could make out the words though, it sounded like the grammar and vocabulary were accurate.Character 7There aren't many recurring characters besides Lucius, who is a humorous character.  His passion for baths, and his grudging appreciation of the Japanese are funny and interesting.Enjoyment 8, Overall 7At the end of the day, this show is a comedy, and actually teaches you more about Japanese baths than Roman ones.  Lucius time-travelling to Japan and copying the Japanese baths and bathing practices in Rome is the main gag of the show.  No doubt the author, when learning about the public baths of Rome, which were large, technologically advanced, popular places for socializing, saw similarities in the bathing culture of Japan.  I remember that I had a similar reaction when I was in elementary school: I read about thermae in a picture book, and it reminded me of onsen.  Obviously the appropriation of Japanese baths for Roman ones is a joke, but the show is sincere in its appreciation of baths.  There is a short educational segment at the end of each episode, in which the mangaka, Mari Yamazaki, tours around Japan to highlight aspects of Japanese onsen.

I watched it with my partner and we enjoyed it enough to finish it, at least.In this series our main character is a bathhouse architect named Lucius Modestus. Every episode, he finds himself stuck on a certain aspect of his work, like writer’s block but for architects. Without fail, he manages to fall into a bath, moat, pond or similar and gets transported to a bath in Japan. Upon his arrival he does some exploration and examines everything that is foreign to him. With this fresh inspiration...he returns home and manages to overcome his architect’s block, resulting in a job well done. The episodes make bathing seem so relaxing that I wish we had bathhouses like those in my country as well, but alas.There’s nothing wrong with this premise. In fact, the crossover between Rome and Japan is quite novel. However, the bathhouse-of-the-week format quickly becomes repetitive. Not only that, Lucius is not at all a likeable character. He is so driven by his work and loyalty to Rome and the emperor that it causes issues in his marriage. The first episode is also meaningless and almost turned us off the series completely.The artwork and animation is barely passable. I think I’m just not a fan of the style chosen here. The soundtrack and sound effects did their job. And as much as I like Tsuda Kenjirou’s voice, he is much more fitting for badass roles such as Tatsu in Way of the Househusband.In the end, the series was entertaining mostly because it has an interesting premise.

The first episode is also meaningless and almost turned us off the series completely.The artwork and animation is barely passable. I think I’m just not a fan of the style chosen here. The soundtrack and sound effects did their job. And as much as I like Tsuda Kenjirou’s voice, he is much more fitting for badass roles such as Tatsu in Way of the Househusband.In the end, the series was entertaining mostly because it has an interesting premise. But together with the live action sections at the end, Thermae Romae Novae felt more like a tourist advertisement promoting Japanese bathing culture than a full-fledged anime series.', 'Thermae Romae Novae (2022)Honestly a good show with some fantastic live actions footage with the author and various spas across Japan and the inspiration of the show.Firstly the ending segments with the live actions tours are absolutely fascinating and really made for some knowledge of where I need to go when I am in Japan.The show itself is pretty fun, you skip the process of building that happens and essentially it is episodes of a problem, foreign solutions and then the results and reception. Artistically speaking it is pretty good and nice to watch. It never needed to be crazy detailed so this...is fine. The sound is average, nothing special but does it need to be? Characters outside of the main guy and his friend and the emperor, perhaps who cares? Finally, the show itself is good, it never was going to be amazing, but it is good for what it does.7/10. is fine. The sound is average, nothing special but does it need to be?

Finally, the show itself is good, it never was going to be amazing, but it is good for what it does.7/10.', 'Netflix does it again: another terrible show. And as true Netflix style, this show is animated quite horrendously, to say the least. That, however, is one of the many host of flaws that this show has.Sure, the CGI that\'s ubiquitous, the lack of fluid movement, scenes of walking or monologuing dragging just a bit too long is bad, but how about adding a 3-5 minute live action sequence about baths in Japan? I don\'t really care about how the author of the manga is the host, or how ""informative"" it is. It\'s just lazy, and of course, more importantly, makes it so that the show...does not need to animate that much more. Hey, better package this live-action sequence as a unique ""feature,"" rather than cutting corners.Okay sure, the animation and live action sequences are bad, but that\'s not all. The general episodic format of Lucius going into a different Japanese bath and experience its culture is also terrible, too. First of all, you\'re stuck in the perspective of Rome for half the show, and the Rome portion of the show is extremely lackluster. There are absolutely no characters that matter other than Lucius himself. Sure, he technically has a couple of friends that are recurring side characters, but they just are husks of a real character that just make small talk with Lucius, but really, anyone would have been fine, as long as Lucius gets some conversation in.In fact, this show could have been good if the show actually cared about Lucius building baths. The format is that Lucius isekais to Japan and implements the bath culture into his own baths in Rome. However, none of the build or design process is actually shown, and you\'re just shown the of course, successful finished product. It would have been nice for the show to have Lucius struggle to get ideas approved, or trying to replicate the bath culture from Japan. But nope, you kind of just see his finished product. Other than that, the time the show is in Rome is pure boring exposition that sets up how Lucius needs to yet again, implement a new feature in a bath, serving not much purpose.Ok, the time in Japan is probably the best part of the show, but it\'s still not that good. I definitely like the culture shock, and it depicts someone of Lucius\'s time period well, thinking that the Japanese people are slaves. However, it\'s still not very funny. Is it relaxing? Um, not really? you\'re kind of just seeing Lucius react to how different baths work. It kind of gets really old real quick, not that it was particularly good to begin with.So yep, should have guessed that Netflix would butcher another show. does not need to animate that much more.

It’s all quite random but you can get a rather interesting look at the personalities of each character without breaking the plot of the show.

It’s just enough to show this wasn’t done with the rest of it. The opening seems to be a bit confusing if you didn't finish the TV show. There is...a part that will give you a small clue as to what happened at the end that could end up spoiling the show.The music is one of the best parts because it has the really nice feel just like the TV show.

Yes! Precure 5 GoGo!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3692/Yes_Precure_5_GoGo,"[""While the original Yes Precure 5 had some very good points to it, it's undeniable that there were some consistent flaws in the series that bogged down its enjoyment. While GoGo is far from flawless, it definitely succeeds in being a very solid sequel that helps to pick up where the original Yes 5 had fallen.The plot doesn't stray too far from the typical thing that you'd expect from a Precure season - an evil organization is seeking out items that, if in their hands, could destroy the world. The five girls, who had given up their powers at the end of the first Yes...5, are resurrected as Precure when a guardian named Flora calls for their help. The plot proceeds pretty typically, though it does have some strong points to it. For one thing, there's a sideplot that revolves around one of the characters' past and inner conflict with the evil organization that flows very well. The plot also ties up many important things that are brought up. In general, the plot of GoGo can shine when it truly wants to. There are some aspects in it that could be better fleshed out, and there's also the fact that the plot takes a while to properly progress. There's also the fact that later on in the show, GoGo ends up completely dropping and forgetting about two of its villains and never gives us a resolution in terms of their whereabouts. Regardless, the story of GoGo manages to be one that keeps itself steady throughout most of the run.However, most people don't watch Precure for the plot, but for its endearing characters. GoGo has the advantage of having viewers that already know and are attached to the main cast, so it's not hard to become reattached to them in the sequel. Seeing as there are five (later six) girls on the team, the show makes it a point to give everyone equal screentime. Although our leader is quite obvious, the spotlight doesn't hesitate to shine on the other girls when need be. GoGo also makes it a point to focus a bit more on the girls' goals and the struggles they face when attempting to achieve them. One of our main characters has an implied learning disability, yet seeks to be a teacher, and shows some very real struggle and inner conflict in trying to attain her dream. While most of the development took place in season one, GoGo still gives us room to give everyone a bit more depth to their character when it comes to things like their goals and dreams.Anyone who watched the first season would know that there was quite a lot of, to be blunt, cilche and cheesy romance, namely between Nozomi and Coco. If you weren't a big fan of this, then you'll be very pleased to know that GoGo features little to none of the dramatic, shoujo-y romance subplots that Yes5 had. This season has a bigger focus on both our main female cast and our two new main characters, Kurumi and Syrup, and cuts out the unnecessary and kind of embarassing romance the first season had. Speaking of Kurumi and Syrup, the development for these two characters is also a big plus in GoGo. Syrup in particular undergoes a lot of inner and outer conflict and develops into a very solid ally of the Precure. While Kurumi's development doesn't reach near those levels, her relationship with the girls throughout the show  helps her become a more fully-fleshed out character.GoGo also improves with its villains in a way that would help shape Precure villains in the future. Pretty much every season pre-GoGo would follow a route of having one villain attack the girls for a few weeks, get killed off, and replaced. The reason this wouldn't work well is because it wouldn't give the viewer time to get to know the villain or their past and motivations. GoGo, while it still does do some quick villain killing, keeps its villains alive much longer than usual and also lets one become redeemed. This lets you become much more invested in what they're doing, rather than wondering when they're going to be replaced.The art for GoGo has a much sharper and cleaner look to it, and it's definitely worth nothing that there's been an animation upgrade. Regardless of that, the season is still riddled with many instances of off-model scenes from Toei, which is to be expected in any long-running Toei show. When it tries, however, the animation can end up being extremely fluid resulting in very well-animated fights. The transformations also received an upgrade, which finally involved dynamic movements whilst transforming.The soundtrack is not much different at all from the original Yes5, and still consists of composter Naoki Sato. There are many familiar tracks included in GoGo that you may notice when watching the show. Sato's music is very well-done and helps to exemplify both the slice of life and the dramatic moments of the show. His music generally compliments the show in a very positive way.GoGo, in many ways, ranks above Yes5 when it comes to enjoyment. GoGo manages to have quite a few memorable episodes and the more consistent villains helps add on to this as well. Again, being familiar with a majority of the cast also helps to raise the enoyment of the series, giving it an advantage in that sense. It definitely does a great job at keeping the viewers entertained, and when it really tries, ends up doing an excellent job at just that.While GoGo is far from a perfect sequel or season in general, it's able to have a solid enough cast and story to be one that is worth watching for anyone that got enjoyment out of the original Yes5. It's improvements in romance, villains, and even animation help bring it up a few notches over the original season as well. If you were a bit disappointed in how the original handled these things, then I'd recommend that you give GoGo a gogo and see how it fares up to the original. While it's a generally forgotten season, it's one that fans of Yes5 should definitely pick up. 5, are resurrected as Precure when a guardian named Flora calls for their help.

While it's a generally forgotten season, it's one that fans of Yes5 should definitely pick up."", ""I've discussed a lot of PreCure works before. And why not? The franchise has over a dozen series, a bunch of films, games and it's definitely one of Toei's big, profitable franchises. However, there was an early entry into the franchise that nearly killed the whole thing. That was the follow up to Yes PreCure 5. Yes PreCure 5 GoGo performed so badly in terms of ratings, that the next instalment had to be a rousing success or it was going to be the end of the franchise. And it's the reason no PreCure has had a direct sequel since. So, what was so bad...about this series? Let's have a look.Story:Our heroines are continuing their normal lives and pursuing their goals when a strange delivery boy appears with a letter for them. The letter requests their presence at a place called the Cure Rose Garden. Unfortunately for them, a group called Eternal is also interested in getting into the Cure Rose Garden and they'll do anything to get the Rose Pact away from the PreCure.The biggest problem with the narrative is just how much time is spent on transformation sequences. Especially towards the end when we have their transformation sequence, Milky Rose's transformation and exceptionally long special attacks when Coco or Nuts grants them power. It kind of reminds me of summoning Knights of the Round in FF VII, it's cool the first time you see it but since it never gets abridged you start getting up to get yourself a sandwich or read a chapter of your book after starting it. Except that these sequences combine to be at least twice as long as that summon.There are also issues that come from this being a sequel. To name an obvious example, Bunbee returns. Which is fine in and of itself, he wasn't explicitly shown to be destroyed. What doesn't make sense is that he gets a huge power boost for no apparent reason that makes him a threat again. I guess he did some off screen training with King Kai. The attempt at throwing in romantic tension between Coco and Nozomi is still awkward, uncomfortable and creepy. Since the dude is both her teacher and a different species.The story does have its positives. Syrup's story arc is pretty good. The series also has its share of fun moments that are worthy of a PreCure series.Characters:This is actually one of the big reasons I think this series flopped. The characters in Yes PreCure 5 are not strong enough to carry two series. They were trite archetypes in the first series. In the sequel, they're very much the same. The first series at least tried to add some degree of depth by giving them episodes where they have to question who they really want to be. The series pretty much does nothing new with them as characters. Except for Milk who gains her own transformation and abilities as Milky Rose. Even then, the core of her character is the same. She's extremely loyal to Coco & Nuts and she has a friendly rivalry going on with Nozomi.The antagonists are fine. They're pretty much an organisation that collects rare goods without regard to the people who produce them. They could rebrand themselves as archaeologists and their collection room as a museum if they wanted less flak over it.Art:This series has the weakest monster designs I've seen in the franchise. There are a lot of monsters that are just a random object with the hoshina orb somewhere on it. Which really is a lot different from taking something ordinary and warping it into a monstrous form. It's just so lazy. Same with the overly long transformation/ big attack sequences. It gets exceptionally bad when we sit through the transformations and then we get both the rainbow rose explosion and the milky rose metal blizzard. Because all of those together are about five minutes. Which is about a quarter of the episode when you factor out the theme tunes.Sound:The actresses continue to be strong in their roles. Surprisingly so given how bland the characters are. Paku Romi makes an excellent addition to the cast. It's also nice to hear Koyasu Takehito even as a short-lived villain. The series has decent music, but does the same thing as the first Precure 5 series where they replace their ending theme tune with one that's very much a slightly modified version of Splash Star's Ganbalance de dance. I know Splash Star is superior in every way, but taking its music isn't going to give you its power.Ho-yay:There's a little, mostly involving Karen and Komachi or Coco & Nuts. There's also a bit with Karen & Kurumi. Not as much as any other PreCure series I've reviewed. Even the first Yes PreCure 5 had more.Areas of Improvement:Develop your characters. These characters weren't strong enough to carry 49 episodes and have a good series out of it. Adding 48 more with the same lack of development just makes it more noticeable.Seriously, stop pushing the idea of romance between an adult squirrel and human girl. It's creepy.Shorten your big attack/ transformation sequences. Seeing them a few times in their entirety is enough. They can be tighter and more condensed after.Final Thoughts:So, why did this series fail? Honestly, I think it has to do with the non-compelling, creepy romance elements in combination with these characters not having the strength to carry two series. There's just not enough personality there. That being said, this series really isn't any worse than the first Yes PreCure 5. It's largely bland with some stand out negative and positive aspects. So, I'm giving it a 5/10. about this series?

Evidence of this are the number of transformations and special attacks performed each fight.

Rinse and repeat for 90% of the fights. This is both annoying and boring to watch. They should\'ve explored strategy and combos to keep things fresh and interesting. The fighting scenes were awful for this reason. However, the mini stories themselves are truly boring to watch, unlike the previous season.

It\'s been quite a wild ride... but here we go.  So the Director disregards Flora\'s seed as useless since it has no value, and he just wants to destroy everything that has no value. But despite the Cures attempts to tell him it doesnt need value, all it needs is to be loved and nurtured and it\'ll become something beautiful he refuses to listen. The Director destroys multiple worlds at once but something happens. Mailpo (who got lost earlier) reappears and delivers endless, literally endless streams of letters: born from the unbelievably strong feelings of everyone...in different worlds and their desire to help Precure. So the Cures power up and combine the powers of the red and blue roses with Coco and Nuts and Milk\'s help and the attack warps into an ULTRA ROSE!!!!!!!! instead of destroying him it transforms into Flora who simply hugs the Director, trying to help him understand life\'s care and such. He seems to say something like ""why didnt you tell me earlier"" before he succumbs to ULTIMATE FLOWER POWER and dies. The entire Eternal building and EVERYTHING in the collection is freed and returns back to everything\'s original owners, and the Garden revives. Flora, entrusting the Cure Rose Garden to Nozomi, also dies Well she semi-dies; she claims she\'s going to be ""reborn as a seed,"" and she literally is, which falls into Nozomi\'s hands.Nozomi decides to make the Cure Rose Garden public and Coco and Nuts help rebuild their own gardens I think, everyone achieves their dreams, and Milk becomes a tour guide for the Garden. Nozomi also plants the Flora-seed and waits for any sign of life caring for it with her friends. She writes a letter to Coco desperately wanting to see him and bumps into him just like the first time they met. And Coco sense that the Flora-Flower is blooming and indeed, it\'s become a little sprout! Everyone gathers and decides to tell the other kingdoms, and Nozomi invites all the Cures and all the mascots, and simultaneously, they all do Nozomi\'s KETTEI! (It\'s Decided/Settled!) pose. And the ending is a bit corny but it shows all of their dreams coming true in their own way: Urara gets to stand on the stage her mother performed at and play, Rin and Karen take care of the Rose Garden, Komachi gets Nuts to be her editor, I think was the implication? But YES!!!!! We have GoGone into a very interesting series, I think, a slightly better take on the ""life is precious"" approach than Max Heart, although I can\'t place my finger on why. Anyway, the episode score I\'ll get over with, it gets a 5/5 as if there was any doubt. But there is a LOT to dissect here, almost enough for a third paragraphI will say that the themes of life and roses worked out better than before, by a slow margin. The story was pretty good, even though it could be a bit sluggish at times and feel like it\'s retreading old ground. It was expected at least slightly due to it being a sequel season, but as I said, despite how happy the characters are, they\'re still barely any closer to achieving their dreams than they were at the end of Yes 5. THAT was their dreams coming true in my opinion, they never really changed from that perspective and it feels like the series is trying to act as though it\'s a new thing. Syrup\'s character arc was actually really well-built, as was the Director and Anacondy\'s specifically. The thing with Syrup is that his arc is way too slow, and the Director\'s motivation can be described as, how could you say it...overly simplified. His sole reason for wanting to see the Cure Rose Garden was to destroy it and kill Flora, for the singular reason that it ""has no value."" Anacondy was actually a REALLY interesting character (she came back when the Director saw the Flora illusion and went to go hug him). Flora\'s character is somewhat poorly explained I must admit; the Director himself states that Flora had power to protect the Cure Rose Garden, bringing into question why she didn\'t try to defend it and still held off attacking whatsoever in the series. Syrup\'s arc in particular was kept in the dark for too long and the villains were overly simplified, with the exception of Mucardio and Bunbee OH!!!!!! BUNBEE STARTS HIS OWN NEW BUSINESS WITH A KAWARINO LOOKALIKEAfter taking all these factors into consideration, I must admit that I didn\'t enjoy GoGo as much as I\'d hoped, sad as it is. I\'ll need to give it only a 5/10, possibly due to all the lukewarm elements.

Aikatsu Friends!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37204/Aikatsu_Friends,"['Just as a reminder, Aikatsu Friends, as the rest of Aikatsu entries, is stand-alone and you can start with this one without worries, which considering the length of the others can be a great idea if you want to see if this anime is for you in order to try out the others as well.In Aikatsu Friends we follow Aine, a cheerful and kind girl who can quickly make friends with anyone to terrifying levels. One day she meets Mio, a very popular girl from the idol division of their school and they quickly connect, the story focuses in their idol activities together as friends,...wanting to become the best duo someday.This anime is doing a fantastic job so far handling their relationship, Aikatsu Friends seems to be centered in ""becoming Best Friends"", with two characters forming a unit together, and this leads to heavy focus on the interactions between pairs of characters (be the main duo or the other characters that got protagonism, all with their fun and likeable personalities). Each episode is a lot of fun seeing in what events our characters are, be preparing dresses, participating in TV programs, or doing performances between others, while also seeing them develop and becoming closer as time passes and they get to know more about each other.Talking about the performances, the CGI animation of them just keeps shining with its quality, the dances are beautiful and full of movement and effects, making for a visual treat, the series as a whole looks nice, with very appealing character designs (I love the gradient hair of the main duo in special), the animation of the series is also solid, although as expected of long running series, some episodes can\'t keep the level of the rest.Aikatsu Friends has been fantastic so far and I can\'t recommend enough to give it a chance, be it your first Aikatsu entry or you having already watched others before. wanting to become the best duo someday.This anime is doing a fantastic job so far handling their relationship, Aikatsu Friends seems to be centered in ""becoming Best Friends"", with two characters forming a unit together, and this leads to heavy focus on the interactions between pairs of characters (be the main duo or the other characters that got protagonism, all with their fun and likeable personalities).

Aikatsu Stars! was great and I just couldn't wait for the next series.Then we have Aikatsu Friends!I was way too hyped for this series, I regretted it. First episode was okay, that was because we were first introduced to the new dressing room (I thought that was cool) and our brand new protagonist, Aine.I liked the art, the character designs weren't that bad except, they decided to throw in rainbow hair colours that matched their idol type. For example, Aine (cute-type): pink, Mio (cool-type): blue, Maika (sexy-type): purple and so on. The only characters that contradict...this is probably Karen and Mirai.I couldn't give the sound a 8 because of the voice actors. Karen and Mirai's voice actors were fantastic but I disliked the rest. I love the ending song, it's very catchy, the solos by Mio and Maika were amazing. The music part is probably the best part about this anime. (EDIT: Sakuya and Kaguya's songs made me change my opinion. The songs are amazing)I dropped this anime at episode 6, after they introduced Ema, I just couldn't continue on. I know there are new characters like Sakuya, a gothic-idol that you need for every aikatsu series but I still can't get into this series.Honestly, if you're new to the Aikatsu series, just watch Aikatsu! and Aikatsu Stars!

That's why some of the earlier songs are a little rough around the edges versus the seasons with professional singers, and honestly, I think that's just fine - in fact, it makes sense given their characters are supposed to be 'bad/new' at the start too!CHARACTER: 8Unlike Stars, which felt like someone slapped new names and hair colours on OG characters, FRIENDS actually creates a very unique crew, with surprisingly realistic arcs.I love Aine's growth from simply following Mio along, to actually being...a competitor in her own right. Similarly, Mio's journey from a walled-off professional into an actual friend was lovely to watch. Maika and Ema focused less on character arcs, and more on having fun - and they brought lots of it, complete with the kind of positive, girl-power competitive energy I love in Aikatsu. Sakuya and Kaguya provide a mature, gothic balance to the show with their songs, and their sisterly antics will feel very familiar to anyone with siblings.Karen and Mirai act as the mentor/rival pair Love Me Tear, and while I do like the way they push and challenge the younger girls, they sometimes feel a bit too distant and harsh.The growth of the cast - which numbers 8 leading ladies and many, many side characters - is done over the course of the season, making it much easier to consume and giving every girl a chance on screen. Their relationships and rivalries are truly what make the show worth watching.I also appreciated that they had more than one idol school, as well as independent idols, right from the start. It made the competition and industry feel truly competitive, and avoided several mistakes made by its predecessors.STORY: 8FRIENDS goes back to the OG, slice of life style that Aikatsu became so known for, but even with all cute girls doing cute things, there's still a clear goal - beating Love Me Tear. Friends does a wonderful job of making sure its characters work for it, to the point where I would have been genuinely mad had they not won (something I couldn't say about Stars.)The new idea of idol 'friends' units gives the show a unique spin, and allows the wonderful relationships between characters to truly drive the narrative, in a way that the changeable teams of previous incarnations rarely achieved.Art: 7The CGI has undeniably improved since the early days, and the 2d animation - while not always consistent - is at least decent. The dresses and cards are all utterly gorgeous, and the unit co-ords are well designed to suit both the individual characters, and make them co-ordinate. I particularly loved the various school uniforms.Sound: 9Aikatsu is one of few idol shows that include every genre imaginable, from rock to pop to dramatic ballads, with all of them enjoyable sans context, making each live stage insert a unique and genuine joy to watch.

The story is well written, animation is good and character development is one of its strong points.The main character Ruuji, a village kid and at first a bit naive but as the story goes along, his character grows to a point where in he could be a leader. Even though the story is a bit serious, there are times when you will laugh because of how other characters are shown throughout the series.Brand new zoids are shown which gives it a bit of originality.

The legendary white Zoid gained a fairly large Western fanbase because of Zoids: New Century and Zoids: New Century Zero, so they probably thought they were stretching it too thin to place the Liger as the main Zoid of another Zoids series (yes, I'm talking to you, Zoids: Fuzors).I thank that brave soul for what he did; it was a fairly smart move to get a new Zoid to play the lead role. I guess at this point they weren't focused on targeting some Western audience anymore, and just wanted to...revive a toy franchise with a new animé tie-in. And so, they introduce Zoids: Genesis.Knowing about the post-apocalyptic plot setup alone may turn some die-hard Zoids fans away from the show; knowing that such a small set of old Zoid favorites will be returning will be disappointing for others. But I tell you that turning away from this series is a mistake.The fresh storyline and the new Zoids themselves gives new life to a toy line that was once on the verge of stagnation. Of course, the hero-liger-enemy-dinosaur stereotype staple to the Zoids animé franchise is still present, but any ill feelings towards this stereotype is soon set aside once the plot of the animé kicks in. I personally think that the plot development for this series is by far the best out of all existing Zoids series.But enough of that; let's move on to the specifics.Story: 8/10 (Very Good)For a series whose goal is to simply revive an old toy line, the story is surprisingly well-done. Enough time is spent on the main character's background, and each member gets his or her own time on the spotlight every now and then. The plot's driving force (it's the usual resistance-against-oppressive-imperial-force setup) is simple and easy to pick up.Sound: 6/10 (Fair)Sound for this series, in my opinion, is not exactly the best. Most of the time the music is fitting to the scene, but at other times it gets old and somewhat irritating to the ears.Art: 9/10 (Great)What this series lacks in sound, it makes up for in art. For an animé series of its type and time, the animation is surprisingly fluid and well-done. 3D animations are reused throughout the show, but it's reasonable. I mean, come on. Animators don't have to make entirely new sequences just to present the same attack combination striking a slightly different spot. What stands out, however, is the protagonist's Zoid's transformation sequences. Both animation and music is fitting and well-done, even if it's just for a few seconds.Character: 7/10 (Good)Again, the series just beats my expectations. Character development may not be the best when compared to other series, but the series tries hard to depict the pasts of all main characters--and they do it quite well.Enjoyment: 8/10 (Very Good)I personally love the Zoids series, and this series is a welcome addition to the existing list. I certainly had a good time watching the episodes.Overall: 8/10 (Very Good)The show isn't perfect--as is to be expected from a toy-line-based series. But it's this expectation that allows this show to stand out--it goes beyond what is expected from it.

Also, I will try my best not to spoil anything.Zoids Genesis, or ZG for short, has a fairly good plot, and roughly half of the characters do get developed, though that leaves the other half with little to no development or backstory *cough*Seijurou*cough*. The plot starts off smoothly, with a rather…. “mediocre” goal, however, that goal changes as the plot progresses (and the original goal is never achieved). The change in plot however, makes it seem as though there wasn’t a change in plot, because they were basically doing the same...thing (Fighting the enemy army, Digald).The anime starts off slowly, first couple episodes being kind of a bore. However, the later episodes get pretty intense. One let down, is that when you see someone die, you think there dead. Then at the end of the episode, or a later episode, they are perfectly fine.The action in ZG is… what you’d expect of a Zoids anime, with the benefit of a fight in every episode, though unlike Zoids New Century there is a plot, and each fight has purpose. However, some fights have certain twists, which I aren’t “WOW THAT WAS AWESOME” worthy moments, but are enough to keep your interest.There is a tiny bit of humour. I can name maybe 2 episodes that made me laugh (though I admit, it isn’t exactly easy to make me laugh). So some may find humour in episodes I didn’t, but, the jokes weren’t ALL that.Towards the end however, the last 10 episodes to be specific, I was eagerly anticipating what was coming next (partly because I wanted to see what would happen next, and partly because I just wanted to add this to my ‘Completed’ list). However, there are some, “What the hell is that doing in a Zoids anime?” moments, and some even more, “What the hell just happened?” moments.Overall the anime could be better, but it isn’t downright terrible.Personally, because of nostalgia, and my love for Zoids when I was a child, I was generous and gave it an 8/10.For the sake of this review, I am not going to be so generous.6/10Still, I encourage you, if you like(d) Zoids, watch ZG. thing (Fighting the enemy army, Digald).The anime starts off slowly, first couple episodes being kind of a bore.

Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35220/Youkai_Apartment_no_Yuuga_na_Nichijou,"[""PLOT:Here's to the new adventures where Inaba decides to move into an apartment where it contains various youkais. (Typically a lot of people would back out from it... but with him, it becomes very entertaining and he will never be bored). While he gets to settle into the new apartment... he gets to meet his neighbours and various characters throughout the series. Overtime, Inaba gets to unlock another side of him that contains his spirituality powers.CHARACTERS:Inaba: New resident in the Youkai apartment, high school student, kind, & caring.Akane: Inaba's friend and neighbour, spiritualist, funny, outgoing, powerful, and kind.OVERALL:This is one of my favourite...top 5 animes in 2017. It is very refreshing to know that this anime contains 26 episodes. It gives us time to get to know the main and various characters that live in and outside of the Youkai apartment. It also contains comedic and [occasionally] dramatic moments. The vibes that I've seen in the anime is that everyone in the Youkai apartment is a FAMILY! They all have a role in their own way that helps bring the anime and chemistry of the characters together. Whenever there is a big event happening in the apartment... everyone gets to come together and have a great time. No one will ever be bored.IMPROVEMENTS?BUT, if I had to critique it, I would have love to see some of the other characters get more screen time to see their origins respectfully.Plus, some more scenes and adventures outside of the apartment and school would be nice too. top 5 animes in 2017.

As of now, I watched the first 5 episode and it blew my freaking expectations.By far the show showcases- great introduction- great characters- very good main male character- very interesting backstories...- explaining some of the hidden elements of the series- great opening and ending themes- and great voice actorsFor now, Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou is a very decent show that executes every category very very well. Characters are adorable and the main character is very relatable for other people. Simple story with complicated characters yet so fun to watch. Other people might think this show only showcases pure comedy, but it gets very very dark sometimes when they show detailed backstories of the supporting characters. This show must be on the top of the charts, Having the overall score below 7 is unforgivable, this show needs more attention. This is definitely one of the highlights of this season.(Don't ever skip this show, you'll regret it later) - explaining some of the hidden elements of the series- great opening and ending themes- and great voice actorsFor now, Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou is a very decent show that executes every category very very well.

Its heart is in the right place and it's trying its best to make the audience happy. Although it may be a bit on the amateurish side and it’s clumsily made, it’s so endearing in its struggle that you can’t help but cheer it along regardless.Story: 5/10It’s slice of life so there's no major overarching plot. In the first half of the show, the main character Inaba goes to the wonderful Youkai Apartment and we meet all of the fanciful inhabitants. Most episodes...take place within the apartment, at Inaba’s high school, or in the town he lives in. From his new roommates, he learns that about the good and bad ghosts that inhabited his world all his life. This structure is used through most episodes of the first half of the show; Inaba encounters an evil ghost, exorcises it, then offers a life lesson to close off the chapter. Many of the lessons are what you’d expect to hear from parents or teachers, but they’re the kind of lessons anyone should be taught at least while they’re growing up. Some of the morals were; do right by others, respect your elders, always be polite when you’re a guest, so on and so forth.While the lessons sometimes feel a bit forced into the show, they always do a great job of forming the main characters into role models as the is value in their words. Even if the characters come off a bit heavy-handed that’s part of their charm I suppose.There are only minor side stories that compiled together take up most of the screen time in the later episodes. After one minor plot thread is resolved a new one appears. One pretty big disappointment with the story is that the supernatural element becomes little more than an afterthought during the second half of the show. I really started to wonder if that “Youkai” in the title was really justified at all given how infrequently it was utilized by the show. The whole second half of the show felt overall very unnecessary. While there’s still a lot to enjoy, focusing on the Inaba’s classmates was a mistake. It totally wasted the far more interesting residents of the Youkai Apartment.Character: 6/10Your enjoyment of this show depends on how much you like the characters. Some of them have enough charm and charisma to keep you entertained while their on screen, but others just blend together due to a lack of defining traits. Nothing much really happens to the characters after 26 episodes. Looking back on the experience, for all the life lessons they preach we learn very little about the cast and they don’t grow or change in ways to make them believable as people. Many of the residents of the Youkai were still being depicted as lead characters by the end, with close-ups and all, yet I couldn’t for the life of me remember their names or why they’re special enough to deserve individual screen time.Art: 5/10The animation isn't outstanding because there isn’t a whole lot of it. Thanks to solid directing, I was always able to understand what was occurring in scenes. The Yokai Apartment is well designed so you understand where scenes take place in reference to the room layout. Each character has a simple design, at first they may look generic but they’re given life through well-defined personalities and enough chances to show their varied expressions.Sound: 5/10An upbeat opening prepares the viewer for an easygoing 20 minutes; the soundtrack that backs most scenes is really peppy and rhythmic. While it's not the most complex scores I’ve heard, it does a great job at setting the atmosphere and always feels appropriately used. Amateurish voice acting, hilarious engrish. The main character is in the Engrish Club so you better get used to hearing the actors struggle through their English lines (because it never gets better).Enjoyment: 7/10It's melodramatic at times, but its uplifting tone prevents the drama from becoming overwrought. Sometimes I found the long scenes (in the second half) of characters conversing boring because the topics wouldn’t interest me. Those conversations add very little to the characters so it was inevitable I would lose track of who’s who. Also, there’s a ton of fujobait in this show, not that I'm complaining, it actually made the whole thing way funnier and feel self-aware.Overall Score: 5.6/10Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou is a surprisingly lively ghost story that is content with its simplicity, occasionally it steps out of its comfort zone with varying degrees of success. Despite its flaws, it is uplifting enough to be watchable. I feel like I may have harped on it a bit too hard because it’s clearly not a show with a high budget. However, it is asking a lot of the audience to devout around 10 hours in total to it. 26 full-length episodes was definitely longer than it needed to be. I feel kind of bad for being so hard on the underdog, but even as when I went into it with underdog level expectations it’s still far from being great. take place within the apartment, at Inaba’s high school, or in the town he lives in.

The show is focused on speaking about and showcasing aspects of the human mind. A great watch. Now, I'm going to watch some bloody anime lol. Geez they want my review even longer? Why is that, the show was good and all i have left to talk about are spoilers. Even longer? So the main character is often hinted at being gay which was very humorous to me....The show gave me a lot of laughs. The show gave me a lot of laughs."", ""*This is my first time writing a review for an ongoing series so bear with me.6.73? Seriously? I mean this anime is not bad at all. This series deserves at least a 7 or even higher. *Deep breath* Okay here are a few questions to ask yourself if you want to see if this series is suitable for you:1. Do you enjoy relaxing anime series?2. Are you the type of person who likes character development?3. Do you like supernatural genre (like ghost)?If your answer to the above questions is mostly yes, then you need to give this a try. Since there is a synopsis...already, I will skip directly to the characters and the plot. The characters are actually quite likable. Each of the residents at the apartment have very unique past and personalities, which helps to make the whole series more interesting. The main protagonist initially was freaked out by all the residents at the apartment (because most of them are ghosts) and gradually opened up to them. There is also some development (in terms of personality) for the main protagonist as the series progresses (at this point episode 4 for me). Some may say that there are way too many characters in the series, but in my opinion, all these characters are vital to this whole series. Each of them contributes part by part and they are more or less like the base for this whole series.The plot is a pretty simple slice of life plot, with acceptable pace. Basically it is about how the main protagonist interacts with the residents at the apartment and slowly get close to them. It is not a series with twists or exciting climaxes, but interactions with the residents at the apartment and the personal growth of the main protagonist are enough to make this series interesting.For arts and sound, it is above average. The animation can obviously be better in a lot of ways, like the backgrounds can be drawn a bit more detailed. Though I guess it is okay. Not much worth noticing for music. The music used doesn't clash with the scenes.To summarise, I enjoyed this series quite a lot because it is relaxing to watch and the character + development is interesting enough for me to keep on watching. I like how all of the residents at the apartment is like a big family, where they support each other when they need help.I hope my review can somehow help you in choosing to watch this series or not. Please feel free to give me some feedbacks.

In fact, of the 5 youkai that appear in more than 1 episode with any role, 3 are unable to talk and 1 can only say ""welcome back"".On its own that\'s just misleading given the title of the series but the problem is the character work is poor and the plots and emotional...arc are a bit of a mess. I guess the closest thing to a theme of a series is the main character\'s maturation but the problem is we never really see him changing - he makes references to how he was ""before"" yet we\'re never given a glimpse of how he lived before moving out from his adopted family past their existence so there\'s no sense of development. At the same time, regardless of what he says he often behaves in weird exaggerated ways that don\'t match the morals he\'s supposedly learning. It\'s not clear what he wants either.The other characters are also given very little development - even though a few human characters appear in almost every episode, there\'s not really much difference between most of them. One is hotheaded, one has an impressive aura, but most of the lines could come from any of them. Lots of talking seemingly ""deep"" things that aren\'t particularly profound. We don\'t really get a sense of their lives or anything either.The plots are... flimsy. Within a day of watching the first 13 episodes I could only remember a couple of them. The last 3 of the first 13 episodes form a particular mini plot arc but it\'s extremely full of tedious filler dialogue and plot to pad out something that turns out unexciting. One episode is mostly taken up by ""researching"" whether something is possible that they literally just witnessed happen. There\'s no real excitement or emotional resonance except in one early episode because the characters are so thin and nothing much happens.One weird thing I noticed a few times is extreme emotional whiplash - the series is pretty lighthearted but there are a few flashbacks to stories of violent murders and then near instant return to lightheartedness.In the second half and the problems are basically the same. The youkai play very little role, which is a shame as the designs are cute. The second series revolves around school life but again the new characters are mostly weak and the series long arc around what could vaguely be described as the ""antagonist"" school characters is really really poor with very little development and with an unbelievably weak resolution. I complained about the moral messages in the first half but there were a few really awful ones here and some that contradicted themselves - early on there\'s a ""don\'t judge people before knowing their whole story"" moral *right next* to the same characters making up a whole story for another character and being very judgemental based on a single negative experience and their tastes in art! Overall the series felt like it wasted potential with a few real plot and dialogue clangers. I just wanted more youkai, mostly. arc are a bit of a mess.

While I was hoping that it would be reminiscent of Natsume’s Book of Friends, I always remained realistic in the sense that it wouldn’t be quite as extraordinary as Natsume’s. However… I never anticipated that the show would turn into a colossal and incoherent waste of my time.The series revolves around a kid named Inaba Yūshi. After his parents die, he moves in with his Uncle. But feeling like a...huge burden to them, he decides that when it’s time to go to high school, he’s going to move into the school’s dorm to make life easier for his family. As middle-school graduation approaches and he prepares to make the big move, the dorm that Inaba originally planned to shift into ends up burning down. Desperate to find a place to crash for the next six months as the dorm’s rebuilt, Inaba exhausts all avenues available to him, until one evening a mysterious looking kid offers him a suggestion. This leads to Inaba finding residence in a room within an old and gloomy looking house that turns out to be the home of numerous kinds of yōkai, or supernatural creatures and people.My first impression of the anime was that it felt a bit unoriginal to me, but there were charming characters and some minor plot development that had me intrigued. My biggest question after sitting down and watching thirteen episodes of this is: what the hell happened to those characters and where did the plot go?The first couple of episodes for the series, shows us Inaba as he moves into the apartment and begins to get situated with the yōkai occupants of his new residence. The humour was awkward and sometimes a bit forced, but the different supernatural characters with their anecdotes on life felt genuine and feel-good; exactly what I was hoping for. Yet, regardless of this small fluffy quality, the show is laced with predictable tropes, one right after another.Upon living at the haunted apartment, he moves into the school dorm when its finished. But soon after moving out, Inaba misses the camaraderie and homey atmosphere that came with living with the yōkai. Predictable. When an altercation with some schoolmates occurs, he realises what he gave up and moves back. Predictable. There are many more instances of it. My excitement plummeted very quickly, being replaced with boredom.In spite of being unimaginative and boring, that wasn’t where the show went wrong. Early in the series there is a vague mentioning of the main character having supernatural abilities, which piqued my interest even more. I felt that it would offer more depth to the seemingly straightforward and somewhat bland nature of the story. But aside from a quick reference to it at the end of an episode, we don’t see anything else pertaining to his “abilities” until four or five episodes later. This is where shit starts to hit the fan.For the sake of not giving any major spoilers, all I can really say is that the anime begins to severely deviate from the original concept into a whole other type of story. Instead of it being about a guy living with yōkai and learning from them, growing and maturing as an individual, it ends up being some kid who now has to learn to train and manage powers that have manifested out of nowhere. The yōkai turn into more of a background atmosphere than anything else. The transition from point A to point B was jarring, unexpected, painfully forced, and utterly terrible.The climax that arises as a contrast to Inaba’s fresh powers was horribly written and entangled in disjointed storytelling. While I was watching, I honestly felt as if each episode was written on the fly without much thought or consideration for the overall narrative at all; as if the writers themselves didn’t quite understand or know what they wanted to do with the anime.I mentioned earlier that we had charming characters. As Inaba struggles with his abilities and what he’s supposed to do with them, these charming characters are only seen a handful of times. Whenever they are shown, I will admit, were the moments that I found most pleasant. Their humour and on-screen presence was much more gratifying than dealing with Inaba.Another facet that annoyed me immensely was the pointless scene where Inaba’s cousin drops by to visit him. It’s pretty obvious from the first episode that his uncle’s family feel Inaba is somewhat of a burden to them. His female cousin is always depicted with having a mean, sour attitude. Nonetheless, one afternoon she hunts him down and has a breakdown about how Inaba doesn’t visit the family any more and about how she’s always cared for him. This scene doesn’t trigger or address anything else in the series up to the present episode. I don’t know if it will be addressed later, but it was a complete and total useless scene that had absolutely nothing to do with narrative. I felt (only slightly) that it’s a set-up for a future romance, however, Inaba has another person who’s quite open about them possibly being a couple. Did I mention that this scene came out of nowhere with no context to it whatsoever?After watching episode 13, and seeing that the series would be continuing onwards through the Autumn season, I decided to drop it. I wasn’t enjoying it and found myself to be wholeheartedly frustrated with everything that was going on. I suspect Elegant Yōkai Apartment Life is the reason I fell into an anime slump to begin with.Aside from the writing, the animation quality was pretty decent during the first half of the season. There wasn’t anything extravagant or special about it, but it was aesthetically pleasing enough and consistent. Yet as more episodes released, I noticed a significant dip in the details of the artwork. Characters had uneven eyes, certain design details would be missing from one scene to the next–it all took on a seemingly rushed appeal that made it even more challenging to enjoy.One of the main reasons I don’t watch as much anime as  I used to is because the severe lack of originality makes it difficult for me enjoy many titles. I have been learning to appreciate certain tropes when utilised with unique traits, because I know that some tropes are worth watching. It also keeps me engaged with the medium, which is what I really hoped for with Elegant Yōkai Apartment Life. But alas, it just didn’t happen. Storytelling-wise this was one of the worst damn shows. Granted I didn’t watch too many simulcasts during Summer, but trust me… it goes from zero to what-the-fuck very quickly.2 rice balls outta 10. huge burden to them, he decides that when it’s time to go to high school, he’s going to move into the school’s dorm to make life easier for his family.

I don’t know if it will be addressed later, but it was a complete and total useless scene that had absolutely nothing to do with narrative. I felt (only slightly) that it’s a set-up for a future romance, however, Inaba has another person who’s quite open about them possibly being a couple. Did I mention that this scene came out of nowhere with no context to it whatsoever?After watching episode 13, and seeing that the series would be continuing onwards through the Autumn season, I decided to drop it. I wasn’t enjoying it and found myself to be wholeheartedly frustrated with everything that was going on. I suspect Elegant Yōkai Apartment Life is the reason I fell into an anime slump to begin with.Aside from the writing, the animation quality was pretty decent during the first half of the season. There wasn’t anything extravagant or special about it, but it was aesthetically pleasing enough and consistent. Yet as more episodes released, I noticed a significant dip in the details of the artwork. Characters had uneven eyes, certain design details would be missing from one scene to the next–it all took on a seemingly rushed appeal that made it even more challenging to enjoy.One of the main reasons I don’t watch as much anime as  I used to is because the severe lack of originality makes it difficult for me enjoy many titles. I have been learning to appreciate certain tropes when utilised with unique traits, because I know that some tropes are worth watching. It also keeps me engaged with the medium, which is what I really hoped for with Elegant Yōkai Apartment Life. But alas, it just didn’t happen. Storytelling-wise this was one of the worst damn shows. Granted I didn’t watch too many simulcasts during Summer, but trust me… it goes from zero to what-the-fuck very quickly.2 rice balls outta 10.', 'MAL doesn\'t detail how many episodes this show will have but after the twelfth I felt comfortable enough that I\'d seen all this show has to offer. Due to such, and the biased reviews submitted so far about this anime, I thought I would go a step further than leaving a bad rating and jot down why it\'s not a very good anime.Youkai Apartment no Yuuga na Nichijou on paper seems like a promising anime, and it should have been; however, the execution of what is probably good source material, dropped the ball.Art; The style used for this anime looks dated when compared to other...modern day animes, although I feel that the animation in this case sets up an appropriate aesthetic - 8/10 (Very Good)Sound; With an op song that scores on the better side of those for the season, this anime\'s other sounds and music range from average to good - 7/10 (Good)Enjoyment; The main focus on this anime for episodes 2-9 is a causal life and simply enjoying the small things (health, friends/family, etc.). This causes the viewer, if they stick it out until at least episode 5, to come to smile at the residents of the Youkai Apartments when they have a party or simply enjoy a good meal. 7/10 (Good)Characters; While some of the characters for this show are unique (our MC included), all but the MC are one dimensional and do not show other sides to their characters. This one dimension for everyone else can be accepted if done well; however, by the last episode of the show I felt that the grin that I had on my face for the first episode, had slowly changed into a grimace. Some of this is played off as the Youkai and other residents of the apartments being slow to change or steadfast in their ways. Nonetheless, by the third and fourth time seeing the same characters saying and doing the exact same trope things, I was bored. 6/10 (Fair)*WARNING; With the story evaluation, I\'ll be getting into spoilers in regards to how the show is structured and generalities of the three main arcs present. I will not get into exact details but to evaluate things, I will have to explain where the show\'s major flaws are found.*BEGIN MINOR SPOILERS*Story; Oh boy. Where to start...well let\'s begin with the show\'s pacing. Being the simpleton I am, I honestly didn\'t notice the off-pacing until sometime between the end of episode 3 and five minutes into episode 4. At that point, I literally thought to myself, ""Really? Why are we even doing this? I thought we had gotten past this point."" But no, no. We must have two more episodes closing this arc before we can move forward. Now I get that residents of the Youkai Apartments were designed to give off a ""relaxed"" feeling while our MC gives off the ""I want to hurry up and grow up"" feeling. But why were 5 episodes devoted to this when it could have been handled in 2-3, I\'m not sure.Episodes 6 to 8 cover what let\'s call the ""training-arc"" where our MC becomes more and more immersed in a world involving Yokai and the various humans that live at the apartments. The biggest problem with this arc, is that there is no motivation for this change in our MC other than ""Well this seems interesting and I guess it comes with living here."" There was no other agency present for our MC and for what I just expained it is done weakly - it\'s not well presented nor developed properly. Furthermore, the training that the MC goes through is minimal at best and does little to any good during the third arc. This is very surprising given the introductions and time spent on the other residents of the apartments who employ much more complicated techniques and practices right in front of the MC. Granted, this show would not have benefited from a training montage; however, even if this arc was structured in a way where it was simply an episode for each instructor, this would have been much better than the arc presented.The third arc entails episodes 9 to 12 and despite this being the ""conflict"" or ""skills put to the test arc"", there is hardly any of this present. This arc mainly consists of episodes where for each of them; our MC bumbles his way through things, somehow things are resolved for now, he asks around the apartments for advice or help but all the other residents either brush him off or are simply MIA, and repeat. Normally, this is the time for our MC in most stories to learn from his mistakes and employ new tactics, techniques, or strategies however none of these happen.  It is not until episode 12 when a sensei from the apartments finally shows up to wipe the floor with our \'bad guy\' and the MC is left their standing saying, ""Man, they sure are strong."" Things don\'t end there though as our MC encounters the \'bad guy\' one last time by himself and bumbles his way through this encounter without showing any improvement. The show literally ends with our MC running away into the sunset promising himself that he\'ll eventually straighten out the mess left from this conflict.The structure of the story into these three arcs: exposition, training, and conflict is interesting but ultimately is poorly executed to the point where they could be relabeled: ""boring drawn out intro"", ""Why am I doing this? And you call this training?"", and ""half-baked hero gets it handed to him day-in-day-out"". 3/10 (Poor)*END SPOILERS*Overall; The show has good art, music, and setting but one dimensional characters and a poorly executed story.

Honestly wondering if those that gave it less than 7 have even tried watching a few more eps. Only downside for me is the opening track and somewhat redundant ""thinking out loud"" moments by MC Yushi.Firstly, the plot is interesting yet not too theoretical - personally, I feel that this is very crucial considering that a lot of an anime\'s intended meaning can be loss in translation and turn out gibberish. The episodes are also coherent and I like how each episode isn\'t ended on an abrupt note while keeping you...hooked. The pace in which the plot unfolds is brilliant.Secondly, the characters are well-drawn (could be a personal preference) and there\'s ample humour that\'s injected into the series.

Like most viewers, I found the initial episodes to be fairly interesting in addition to a great soundtrack.  However 18 episodes later (SPOILER ALERT!), my enthusiasm has waned considerably.The artistry whilst colourful has remained fairly stagnant with forgettable new characters all sporting the same elongated facial shapes just with different hairstyles and colours.Character development and the yokai premise of the anime have also gone out the window at the expense of a bizarre plot direction towards episodic stand-alonish kinda PSA (Public Service Announcement ) story...line : eg. violence towards women, workplace camaraderie, gangland participation etc.Initially such goody 2 shoe plots would at least involve some kinda supernatural encounters but the latest episode (18) basically comes across as an insipid tale of 'how to communicate effectively in the workplace' lazy plot line with nary a demon to be seen.One can't help but think that this must be heavily subsidised by some kind of government agency to steer the plot towards teaching little kids about adapting to the real school/working life and promoting the moral adage that 'no man is an island'.

Honestly, the quality of the visuals feel like they were made on budget, but if you can look past it, you will see that its a very chill, easygoing, and satisfying anime.The story is about Inaba Yuushi, who is starting high school and needs an apartment to stay in. He wounds up living in an apartment filled with supernatural creatures, and learns to get along with them. There doesnt seem like there is much to the...story at first, but it starts to develop as the anime progresses, exploring the characters and really making the protagonist grow as a person.Art is pretty average, its not like its terrible, but there is nothing outstanding about it. Its just sort of weak in comparison to alot of modern anime today (which is why i say its a budget quality anime), but hey, at least it isnt generic like animes that kinda slap in a moe style to their anime...There isnt anything that is really noticeable in the sound, which is good in my book, because it means that there are no weird interrupting sounds that ruin the experience. What is great though is the Opening, which literally gives you a good sense of what type of style the anime presents itself. Its just real chill and wholesome music, that puts you in a relaxing mood.The most notable thing about this show are the characters. They are all really welcoming characters, with a pure kindness at heart. The inhabitants of the apartment treat the main character like he is family, and that simple bond really brings the anime together. Also the main character is an important component to all of this, not like main characters in other animes that feel almost forgotten. Yuushi is our connection into the world, as his reactions to his experiences are ideally what the viewer would imagine if they were put into the situations. Yuushi has realistic concerns, but also an understanding personality to bring open-minded humane thinking into the show.I am currently on episode 8, and I feel as the anime is continuing in a positive direction. At first I wasnt sure if I liked the anime or not, but soon it definitely grew on me, and I am fully enjoying each episode, waiting on it each week. It really makes me want to read the manga, just so I can have my fill of it.Overall, I may be giving this anime too much credit, but I simply cant help but be a little biased in my review. I definitely think it deserves a higher rating than a lot of other animes on MAL, because 6.7 is too low for the content this anime provides. If I were to give an unbiased score, 7.5/10, but personally I think this anime deserves at least an 8/10. story at first, but it starts to develop as the anime progresses, exploring the characters and really making the protagonist grow as a person.Art is pretty average, its not like its terrible, but there is nothing outstanding about it.

Unfortunately, holding out hope that it\'s still good only makes the Baby Boomer garbled \'morals\' and other nonsense even worse as the series drags on.The first OP, ""Good Night Mare"" by Lozareena is really good. The 2nd ED, ""Nichijoshiki Broken Down"" by Abe Atsushi and Nakamura Yuichi is also pretty good....I\'m also really impressed with how much this series basically canonizes the romantic relationship between the male protagonist and his \'best friend\'. It\'s... I mean it\'s a thing that I still marvel at? Like even if you\'re not just desperate for something out of this to be okay it\'s so thrown in your face by basically every single character in the show... At times it seems like this is a shonen series written by someone who came off of a BL project. It\'s just very strange.Unfortunately... the plot. And at least some of the art. The art is by and large quite good. I say by and large because my respect for artistic ability dies when there\'s a character who exists solely for boob jiggle, even when she\'s not moving. And the. constant. pan. up. shots. Pan up shots for women are by and large insulting to start with - they tend to objectify women/female characters by focusing on their sexual characteristics over their personality and intelligence. The shot starts from the legs, moves over the crotch, then the boobs, and FINALLY gets to the face just about when the camera is done dealing with the character, so the audience is so focused on how sexy the woman is that they ignore what she\'s adding to the story or who she is as a person.These tend to be par for the course in shonen series, and as one of the tropes demonstrating the shonen leanings of the story, I was quite ready to eyeroll and ignore it as I am oft to do with these things. How else do you consume media these days? But for some ridiculous reason the series\' crew REALLY likes these shots? And uses them ALL THE TIME. For no apparent reason - not even \'fanservice\', really. The second or third that caught my eye was when Akine returns later in episode 1. She does a plot thing, and then starts talking. The pan-up starts as she\'s talking. She\'s wearing a sweater. It doesn\'t emphasize her boobs or show her cleavage. She\'s not wearing pants that emphasize her crotch, and the shot starts from around her mid-thigh, not emphasizing most of her legs. Usually pan-up shots are used when female characters are first introduced in a story or when they change outfits and present themselves in their new clothes to others. This series goes one farther and uses these shots when female characters who have already been introduced and haven\'t changed clothes are just... present or just talking about plot. As if the crew didn\'t want to draw their facial expressions or wanted to make sure the audience remembers YO THIS CHARACTER HAS BOOBS even if those sexually objectified features aren\'t even emphasized in the same shot?Like this trick got to the point where it was DISTRACTING. Not like ""oh, boobs"" -braindead- I just kept thinking ""wait, stop I want to see people talking now please. Why do I need another pan-up on this character now?""It\'s also pretty sad that so much of a series purportedly about the supernatural and with what seems to be a decent budget spends so much time on the human characters, because the supernatural characters are pretty much absent. The most often shown supernatural characters just look like ordinary humans - even if Mariko\'s boobs jiggle for no reason 100% of the time. I\'m fine with slice-of-life fantasy. Unfortunately, the plot has to actually be GOOD for that to be sufficient. Before I go to a complete segue to the biggest plot failings, series like ""Natsume Yuujincho"" and ""xxxHolic"" may only have one new, supernatural character every episode/arc, while focusing largely on mundane things (and by and large it\'s more than one character), like cooking (also this show\'s favorite thing for some reason), or mundane school stuff or romance or holiday presents... but they still introduce those characters and they\'re interesting to watch and there\'s neat-looking fantastical stuff involved. This... does nothing. Maybe off in the corner once an episode, on average, there\'s a non-human thing. Briefly. That\'s it. If I wanted a nice story about a bunch of weirdos with -by and large - hearts of gold in an apartment building I\'d reread ""Maison Ikkoku"". At least that had story.The base plot is fine. It\'s typical for these series. Sure, the magical powers gained really suck and that joke gets old very, very quickly. Like... right when they\'re introduced, actually. The issue isn\'t so much the base plot itself as the way the story treats its characters and spits out nonsensical ageist bs every single episode.I am aware that characters are usually not perfect. But Inaba is a moron (even moreso than usual for a sort of shonen protagonist) and a hypocrite with at least a bit of a sexist undertone. The current primary antagonist is a teacher - Aiko - who, at least according to Inaba, judges people based on little information and relies on that distorted frame of reference to base her ideas of them. He heavily dislikes this. The problem is that INABA does the exact same thing to every single person in the show, including his secondary crush and idol, Ryu, as well as his closest peer, Tashiro, and his sempai, Akine. In point of fact... ALL HUMANS DO THIS. That\'s just... that\'s how we work. You don\'t know everything about anyone unless you\'re, I don\'t know, omniscient and telepathic? I\'m unsure if this is a translation issue or what, but I believe the problem Inaba has is that Aiko STEREOTYPES, and then, upon being shown evidence that she\'s in the wrong, doesn\'t change her behavior and doubles down on her beliefs even against the weight of contradictory evidence, or that she\'s hurting people. Sure, in basic terms, the show describes that (or the translation does). But it\'s very muddled. The concept itself is good to follow with... if the stereotyping + refusal to change out of that is ACTUALLY the concept the show wants to go with.Conversely, Ryu exists. I don\'t hate Ryu. He\'s attractive. He\'s... not evil? He\'s clearly at least in lust with Inaba (as evidenced by his desire to give Inaba a bath, and then acting upon that desire quite happily at least twice, on top of calling Inaba ""a gem waiting to be polished"", and talking about how he enjoys watching Inaba\'s development and how he basically does nothing else in the story but creepily stalk Inaba; also, for all that he was rightfully pissed off that the Antiquary keeps stealing his hair to sell, he was quite happy for Inaba to have a bit as a gift). Although basically every adult(?) male on this show is in lust with Inaba, we know basically nothing about Ryu. He once had his shinigami patrol. He offered like three sentences of advice to Inaba in episode 1. He pops in to smile every few episodes and potentially gave Inaba a magical ability that by episode 18 Inaba has yet to make use of. His hair has magical properties? He\'s worked for the government doing... something. He\'s purportedly down on his luck. That\'s it. Shows time skip all the time, so we\'re not shown the entirety of characters interacting and getting to know each other. But it\'s heavily implied that we see most if not all of Inaba\'s interactions with Ryu on-screen. Which means they really barely know each other. Yet from the first time Inaba sees Ryu, he is smitten (with lust and/or idol worship, w/e). And seemingly worships the ground the man walks on. Admittedly we tend to give the people we care about/our crushes/idols more leeway than we do others. But this... I guess it\'s not bad because Inaba\'s adoration of Ryu doesn\'t bother Ryu, but Aoki\'s stereotype impression of Inaba insults him?Then the show shouldn\'t frame it the way it does! IT\'S JUST CONFUSING!As a simple example for Inaba\'s stereotyping versus Aoki\'s stereotyping, Inaba stereotypes based on gender a lot. In episode 1, his first reaction to learning that there\'s a female resident - who\'s older than him - living in the apartment complex, he says, ""Alone??? Even though she\'s a GIRL??"" Upon meeting her he later attempts to stop her from going out on her own. This complete stranger who is older than him. Sure, offering to go with her might be fine (still incredibly patronizing, but a one and done lesson makes sense for an anime). But like... dude, lay off the repeated attempts? And there are other things. It\'s just... it\'s exhausting. This show has major issues with gender dynamics and yes, the old ""boys will be boys"" bs gets used at least twice. It\'s subverted once in a cute way, because everyone plans for Hase and Inaba to get married and the subversion is tied into it, but that\'s about it.And Yamamoto. I have no idea what to make of this storyline. At its base, Yamamoto is an arrogant character who wants to show off her potential intelligence to her peers, which likely leads to no one liking her. But apparently the writing team for this series had no idea how to present that incredibly simple concept. So Yamamoto enters this English conversation club and is annoyed that they don\'t speak English all the time (which she doesn\'t attempt either; even while explaining, apparently, the different meanings of words used in English and Japanese, she\'s still speaking in Japanese; this would be intelligent reflection on her hypocrisy IF THE STORY ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP ON IT rather than just making it muddled like everything else in this train wreck). She then shows off that she seemingly reads Russian literature, and arrogantly suggests they translate a Western movie rather than an anime film, despite the whole club wanting to translate an anime film because people liked it the last time they did it.Inaba airs this to his colleagues in his usual ""I just don\'t understand"" because apparently arrogance is a foreign concept to Mr. I Am Younger Than Others But Still Feel More Prepared to Care For Them Because In Ep 1 I Beat Up My Boyfriend For Reasons. His neighbors, who have neither met nor seen Yamamoto, surmise for no apparent reason other than potentially her age, gender, and possibly nationality, that it\'s unlikely that she actually likes the Russian literature she\'s talking about/seen reading onscreen. Ignoring that baseless and at best stupid assertion - all demonstrated while we\'re seeing a naked Yamamoto crouching with her back to the \'camera\' for some reason - sure, arrogant and judgmental asshats do frequently fake liking ""intellectual"" stuff to get Brain points with people. But 1) there\'s no evidence she doesn\'t ACTUALLY like them, and 2) whether or not she likes them is immaterial because while making what could easily be a baseless ageist/sexist assertion about someone you don\'t know is also dumb, the point is that SHE\'S ARROGANT, not what her personal preferences are. Inaba doesn\'t read Dostoevsky. What\'s he going to do, quiz her on it like a gatekeeping fanboy? This story is so nonsensical.Which leads to the... morals? \'Life lessons\'? Better known as things some group of high baby boomers said while drinking somewhere? Because it\'s half typical ageist \'in my day\' bs and 3/4s complete nonsense. For instance, the episode I gave up on - spoiler alert it\'s not an important story episode - Inaba is dealing with new, dumb coworkers. That\'s it. They\'re just dumb. There is literally nothing else to this. But for some reason he so fails to understand how it is possible for people to just be dumb that when he airs his issues to his neighbors, they turn it into something about how ""information used to be earned"" and ""communicating with your body is important"" (this by two drunk, giggling, middle-aged(?)-styled male characters talking about two teenagers) and ""technology makes people stupid"" and then INABA STARTS THINKING THIS. This whole episode. It\'s not THAT deep. And this is so. many. of. the. episodes. It\'s one thing for a slice-of-life episode to overanalyze something for comedy or ""today\'s lesson in life"" or something. But this is just... meaningless. It takes Completely Missing the Point While On My Nostalgia-Revisionist Horse to Olympic levels. It\'s also not funny.So the art is good to dumb, the plot is utter nonsense, the humor fizzles out, particularly once you realize that a good chunk of it is various men molesting Inaba (seriously, even his HOMEROOM TEACHER DOES IT, oh but it\'s okay he had a good reason 9_9). I haven\'t even gotten into MOST of the gender stereotyping bs that Inaba and Aoki do.The story meanders at the best of times, makes no sense most of the time, and bad \'sense\' at its worst. The art is average for a modern shounen, but depressingly bad when it comes to its boobservice character and pan-up shots. It has two good songs, and the music is otherwise forgettable. It has terrible issues with characterization, underuses its fantastical elements, and seems to intentionally want to teach you stupid things.If you want to see a good slice-of-life supernatural show, watch ""Natsume Yuujinchou"" (but not the OVAs) or read ""xxxHolic"". If you want a quirky comedy about a bunch of folks at the same apartment building, read ""Maison Ikkoku."" Skip this. I\'m also really impressed with how much this series basically canonizes the romantic relationship between the male protagonist and his \'best friend\'. It\'s... I mean it\'s a thing that I still marvel at? Like even if you\'re not just desperate for something out of this to be okay it\'s so thrown in your face by basically every single character in the show... At times it seems like this is a shonen series written by someone who came off of a BL project. It\'s just very strange.Unfortunately... the plot. And at least some of the art. The art is by and large quite good. I say by and large because my respect for artistic ability dies when there\'s a character who exists solely for boob jiggle, even when she\'s not moving. And the. constant. pan. up. shots. Pan up shots for women are by and large insulting to start with - they tend to objectify women/female characters by focusing on their sexual characteristics over their personality and intelligence. The shot starts from the legs, moves over the crotch, then the boobs, and FINALLY gets to the face just about when the camera is done dealing with the character, so the audience is so focused on how sexy the woman is that they ignore what she\'s adding to the story or who she is as a person.These tend to be par for the course in shonen series, and as one of the tropes demonstrating the shonen leanings of the story, I was quite ready to eyeroll and ignore it as I am oft to do with these things. How else do you consume media these days? But for some ridiculous reason the series\' crew REALLY likes these shots? And uses them ALL THE TIME. For no apparent reason - not even \'fanservice\', really. The second or third that caught my eye was when Akine returns later in episode 1. She does a plot thing, and then starts talking. The pan-up starts as she\'s talking. She\'s wearing a sweater. It doesn\'t emphasize her boobs or show her cleavage. She\'s not wearing pants that emphasize her crotch, and the shot starts from around her mid-thigh, not emphasizing most of her legs. Usually pan-up shots are used when female characters are first introduced in a story or when they change outfits and present themselves in their new clothes to others. This series goes one farther and uses these shots when female characters who have already been introduced and haven\'t changed clothes are just... present or just talking about plot. As if the crew didn\'t want to draw their facial expressions or wanted to make sure the audience remembers YO THIS CHARACTER HAS BOOBS even if those sexually objectified features aren\'t even emphasized in the same shot?Like this trick got to the point where it was DISTRACTING. Not like ""oh, boobs"" -braindead- I just kept thinking ""wait, stop I want to see people talking now please. Why do I need another pan-up on this character now?""It\'s also pretty sad that so much of a series purportedly about the supernatural and with what seems to be a decent budget spends so much time on the human characters, because the supernatural characters are pretty much absent. The most often shown supernatural characters just look like ordinary humans - even if Mariko\'s boobs jiggle for no reason 100% of the time. I\'m fine with slice-of-life fantasy. Unfortunately, the plot has to actually be GOOD for that to be sufficient. Before I go to a complete segue to the biggest plot failings, series like ""Natsume Yuujincho"" and ""xxxHolic"" may only have one new, supernatural character every episode/arc, while focusing largely on mundane things (and by and large it\'s more than one character), like cooking (also this show\'s favorite thing for some reason), or mundane school stuff or romance or holiday presents... but they still introduce those characters and they\'re interesting to watch and there\'s neat-looking fantastical stuff involved. This... does nothing. Maybe off in the corner once an episode, on average, there\'s a non-human thing. Briefly. That\'s it. If I wanted a nice story about a bunch of weirdos with -by and large - hearts of gold in an apartment building I\'d reread ""Maison Ikkoku"". At least that had story.The base plot is fine. It\'s typical for these series. Sure, the magical powers gained really suck and that joke gets old very, very quickly. Like... right when they\'re introduced, actually. The issue isn\'t so much the base plot itself as the way the story treats its characters and spits out nonsensical ageist bs every single episode.I am aware that characters are usually not perfect. But Inaba is a moron (even moreso than usual for a sort of shonen protagonist) and a hypocrite with at least a bit of a sexist undertone. The current primary antagonist is a teacher - Aiko - who, at least according to Inaba, judges people based on little information and relies on that distorted frame of reference to base her ideas of them. He heavily dislikes this. The problem is that INABA does the exact same thing to every single person in the show, including his secondary crush and idol, Ryu, as well as his closest peer, Tashiro, and his sempai, Akine. In point of fact... ALL HUMANS DO THIS. That\'s just... that\'s how we work. You don\'t know everything about anyone unless you\'re, I don\'t know, omniscient and telepathic? I\'m unsure if this is a translation issue or what, but I believe the problem Inaba has is that Aiko STEREOTYPES, and then, upon being shown evidence that she\'s in the wrong, doesn\'t change her behavior and doubles down on her beliefs even against the weight of contradictory evidence, or that she\'s hurting people. Sure, in basic terms, the show describes that (or the translation does). But it\'s very muddled. The concept itself is good to follow with... if the stereotyping + refusal to change out of that is ACTUALLY the concept the show wants to go with.Conversely, Ryu exists. I don\'t hate Ryu. He\'s attractive. He\'s... not evil? He\'s clearly at least in lust with Inaba (as evidenced by his desire to give Inaba a bath, and then acting upon that desire quite happily at least twice, on top of calling Inaba ""a gem waiting to be polished"", and talking about how he enjoys watching Inaba\'s development and how he basically does nothing else in the story but creepily stalk Inaba; also, for all that he was rightfully pissed off that the Antiquary keeps stealing his hair to sell, he was quite happy for Inaba to have a bit as a gift). Although basically every adult(?) male on this show is in lust with Inaba, we know basically nothing about Ryu. He once had his shinigami patrol. He offered like three sentences of advice to Inaba in episode 1. He pops in to smile every few episodes and potentially gave Inaba a magical ability that by episode 18 Inaba has yet to make use of. His hair has magical properties? He\'s worked for the government doing... something. He\'s purportedly down on his luck. That\'s it. Shows time skip all the time, so we\'re not shown the entirety of characters interacting and getting to know each other. But it\'s heavily implied that we see most if not all of Inaba\'s interactions with Ryu on-screen. Which means they really barely know each other. Yet from the first time Inaba sees Ryu, he is smitten (with lust and/or idol worship, w/e). And seemingly worships the ground the man walks on. Admittedly we tend to give the people we care about/our crushes/idols more leeway than we do others. But this... I guess it\'s not bad because Inaba\'s adoration of Ryu doesn\'t bother Ryu, but Aoki\'s stereotype impression of Inaba insults him?Then the show shouldn\'t frame it the way it does! IT\'S JUST CONFUSING!As a simple example for Inaba\'s stereotyping versus Aoki\'s stereotyping, Inaba stereotypes based on gender a lot. In episode 1, his first reaction to learning that there\'s a female resident - who\'s older than him - living in the apartment complex, he says, ""Alone??? Even though she\'s a GIRL??"" Upon meeting her he later attempts to stop her from going out on her own. This complete stranger who is older than him. Sure, offering to go with her might be fine (still incredibly patronizing, but a one and done lesson makes sense for an anime). But like... dude, lay off the repeated attempts? And there are other things. It\'s just... it\'s exhausting. This show has major issues with gender dynamics and yes, the old ""boys will be boys"" bs gets used at least twice. It\'s subverted once in a cute way, because everyone plans for Hase and Inaba to get married and the subversion is tied into it, but that\'s about it.And Yamamoto. I have no idea what to make of this storyline. At its base, Yamamoto is an arrogant character who wants to show off her potential intelligence to her peers, which likely leads to no one liking her. But apparently the writing team for this series had no idea how to present that incredibly simple concept. So Yamamoto enters this English conversation club and is annoyed that they don\'t speak English all the time (which she doesn\'t attempt either; even while explaining, apparently, the different meanings of words used in English and Japanese, she\'s still speaking in Japanese; this would be intelligent reflection on her hypocrisy IF THE STORY ACTUALLY FOLLOWED UP ON IT rather than just making it muddled like everything else in this train wreck). She then shows off that she seemingly reads Russian literature, and arrogantly suggests they translate a Western movie rather than an anime film, despite the whole club wanting to translate an anime film because people liked it the last time they did it.Inaba airs this to his colleagues in his usual ""I just don\'t understand"" because apparently arrogance is a foreign concept to Mr. I Am Younger Than Others But Still Feel More Prepared to Care For Them Because In Ep 1 I Beat Up My Boyfriend For Reasons. His neighbors, who have neither met nor seen Yamamoto, surmise for no apparent reason other than potentially her age, gender, and possibly nationality, that it\'s unlikely that she actually likes the Russian literature she\'s talking about/seen reading onscreen. Ignoring that baseless and at best stupid assertion - all demonstrated while we\'re seeing a naked Yamamoto crouching with her back to the \'camera\' for some reason - sure, arrogant and judgmental asshats do frequently fake liking ""intellectual"" stuff to get Brain points with people. But 1) there\'s no evidence she doesn\'t ACTUALLY like them, and 2) whether or not she likes them is immaterial because while making what could easily be a baseless ageist/sexist assertion about someone you don\'t know is also dumb, the point is that SHE\'S ARROGANT, not what her personal preferences are. Inaba doesn\'t read Dostoevsky. What\'s he going to do, quiz her on it like a gatekeeping fanboy? This story is so nonsensical.Which leads to the... morals? \'Life lessons\'? Better known as things some group of high baby boomers said while drinking somewhere? Because it\'s half typical ageist \'in my day\' bs and 3/4s complete nonsense. For instance, the episode I gave up on - spoiler alert it\'s not an important story episode - Inaba is dealing with new, dumb coworkers. That\'s it. They\'re just dumb. There is literally nothing else to this. But for some reason he so fails to understand how it is possible for people to just be dumb that when he airs his issues to his neighbors, they turn it into something about how ""information used to be earned"" and ""communicating with your body is important"" (this by two drunk, giggling, middle-aged(?)-styled male characters talking about two teenagers) and ""technology makes people stupid"" and then INABA STARTS THINKING THIS.

I have no idea why it\'s received anything below a 7. Like seriously people. . . Don\'t you like growing with your characters and learning about them? It\'s not ""boring"" because there\'s no action. It\'s called development!For those of you thinking this is trying to copy Natsume Yuujinchou with the whole ""he can see youkai"" concept, you are way out of the ballpark. This is completely different than Natsume. The only similarities I think would be they are both relaxing anime, every episode isn\'t packed...full of action, and both are full of wonderful characters. But in Natsume, he rarely gets to share his youkai-seeing experiences with anyone. For Natsume, it\'s a blessing and a curse and he usually has to hide his ability. In this anime, Inaba shares his life with the youkai in the apartments and everyone sees them, even his best friend. So it\'s a much different experience.The music is amazing. The 1st opening (""Good Night Mare"" by Rozareena) is awesome. I have it on a playlist. But the rest of the OST is good as well it matches well with the story and provides the good foundation for whatever emotion the story is trying to portray.The characters are extremely loveable. I loved the depth of a lot of the characters.  I cried more than a few times during some backstories or just plain old character interactions. It also has some really good lessons in it about life and overcoming obstacles and how to talk to people. Also, there\'s a good focus on helping people, which is becoming more and more lost in today\'s society. And if you read up about this anime, most of their budget goes to the voice actors, not into graphics and animation (for anyone who dislikes the animation style). But I think the animation is lovely. This is actually my first anime by Shine-Ei animation. And although it takes a little while for Inabas best friend Hase to get a little more involved in the story, I enjoy the friendship they have.So far I\'ve finished 14 episodes and I will own this anime once it\'s finished airing. It\'s beautiful, it\'s heartfelt and it\'s funny. I mean, it\'s really funny. And not forced comedy. Just good humor from awkward situations that happen in life. And also being a normal kid who now lives in a world where he encounters spirits, ghosts, and magic on a daily basis. Inaba also tends to be a little on the gullible side, which can be cause for some fully moments.For someone looking for an action-packed anime, this isn\'t for you. This is something that\'s a little more mild. This is about a boy who lost both his parents and is now rebuilding his life and himself. It\'s a sweet, funny, emotional journey of Inaba as he sets off on his own in his new apartment, where he meets new friends, both human and youkai. This is a great anime for someone looking for great character development and genuine emotion. full of action, and both are full of wonderful characters. But in Natsume, he rarely gets to share his youkai-seeing experiences with anyone. For Natsume, it\'s a blessing and a curse and he usually has to hide his ability. In this anime, Inaba shares his life with the youkai in the apartments and everyone sees them, even his best friend. So it\'s a much different experience.The music is amazing. The 1st opening (""Good Night Mare"" by Rozareena) is awesome. I have it on a playlist. But the rest of the OST is good as well it matches well with the story and provides the good foundation for whatever emotion the story is trying to portray.The characters are extremely loveable. I loved the depth of a lot of the characters.  I cried more than a few times during some backstories or just plain old character interactions. It also has some really good lessons in it about life and overcoming obstacles and how to talk to people. Also, there\'s a good focus on helping people, which is becoming more and more lost in today\'s society. And if you read up about this anime, most of their budget goes to the voice actors, not into graphics and animation (for anyone who dislikes the animation style). But I think the animation is lovely. This is actually my first anime by Shine-Ei animation. And although it takes a little while for Inabas best friend Hase to get a little more involved in the story, I enjoy the friendship they have.So far I\'ve finished 14 episodes and I will own this anime once it\'s finished airing. It\'s beautiful, it\'s heartfelt and it\'s funny. I mean, it\'s really funny. And not forced comedy. Just good humor from awkward situations that happen in life. And also being a normal kid who now lives in a world where he encounters spirits, ghosts, and magic on a daily basis.

For anyone reading this review who hasn't...read the manga, just read the summary on MAL first, it'll take less time than me explaining it (and again, it's explained in the episode). This episode includes three stories from Class E's field trip to Kyoto: an issue that Nagisa and his group run into, an assassin that is working together with Class E to try and snipe Korosensei, and some antics back at the inn they are staying at.The animation is pretty good for a stand-alone episode, though seeing Nagisa, Karma, and Kaede's vividly colored hair alongside everyone else's brown/black hair was strange. Korosensei is well animated in all his weird, gelatinous, tentacular, alien-ness. His emotion color-changes are well done, and the only small problem I had with him was his voice actor. It's just my personal issue and not something that applies to everyone, but I always imagined his voice being higher pitched than that. The rest of the characters' voices (especially Nagisa's) fit them well.Whether you've read Assassination Classroom or not, I recommend watching this special.

I would highly recommend watching the series (linked on the MAL profile). I would watch this special episode if you can\'t get enough of the series.Okay so this was made before the series and it essentially is a shortened version of episodes 7 and 8. Personally, those are some of my favorite episodes in the series, so this special is appealing.Anyway, lets begin:STORY: 7Good old Assassination Classroom. This is a great arc that has good pacing...and (although predictable) a decent story line. The series is very humorous, which actually provides most of the twists.ART: 3Actually this is the worst part about the series. The animation is very pathetic and has pretty much nothing working for it. Granted that reflects the budget. Despite how poorly made the episode is, the characters are still distinguishable and recognizable.SOUND: 4I\'ll just come out and say it: most of the voice actors are all wrong and the acting is pretty weak, especially Koro-sensei. The sound effects are fine, but not notable. The series lacks any noticeable sound track.CHARACTER: 9The cast of this anime is fantastic, not matter how you spin it. The anime doesn\'t do a very good job at helping the characters come to life in that the animation and voice action is bad, but the characters as a whole reflect the greatness seen in the anime. This arch is very nice and touches on most of the cast for at least a little bit. It is also great how side characters (like Red Eye?) get enough screen time to develop and become likable.ENJOYMENT: 8I actually liked watching this special. Seeing how the series started is interesting to me as a fan of both the anime and the manga. As I said before, this is one of my favorite arcs, and you can see how much it improved when comparing the 2015 TV show to this.OVERALL: 7Okay so I weighted some of the aspects more than others. my statement on this would be ""A fun watch if you are a fan of the series!"" and (although predictable) a decent story line.

If one is looking for a completle remake of the original, this isn't it. This has only a few minor changes and a few minor additions.

One HAS to watch it to figure out if they like it or not really, but hopefully what I've said above will help make up ones mind to watch it or not.

The original graphic novel is much more adult orientated and while this adaptation isn't exactly for kids it's certainly been toned down a bit.

Stylistically and thematically Cybersix is an incredibly unique mix, there really hasn't been anything like it since, especially as far as international collaborations go.With all that said, if you're looking for a well done and unique series with engaging and realistic characters then I can't recommend Cybersix enough. going to talk extensively about the characters or story but give a few reasons why you should check it out.

It started out as a mature Argentinian comic series, and then was picked up by a Canadian company and animated by a Japanese company and made into a more kid-friendly cartoon/anime (to be honest I\'m not really sure what to classify it as, it was animated in Japan but for the most part it\'s a Canadian show). But you\'re not interested in the origins, you want a review not a lecture, so lets get to it.*DISCLAIMER*This show was first aired 1999 in Canada (and Argentina), I myself being a...Canadian born in 1994 was a young child when I first watched this show. Admittedly I came across it on youtube recently and was driven by nostalgia to watch it again. I tried to watch this show with a critical eye rather then watching through nostalgia goggles and hope the review also is free of it, but be warned that this review might be a bit biased due to that reason.anyway, moving on.Story 7/10 (warning, this is gonna get long):  The story of the show is fairly simple for the most part, a woman with superhuman strength and agility (Cyber 6) who cross dresses as a man to take on her secret identity (Adrian Seidelman) watches over a South American city fighting against the genetic creations of the evil Doctor Von Reichter and his equally evil eight year old son José. immediately I began to see some minor flaws with this show (Critic: 1, Nostalgia: 0), most prominant being the lack of explain certain things that seem like they would be important. What exactly is Cyber 6? What was that green stuff she drank in the first episode? What is Von Reichter trying to accomplish and why does he want Cyber dead? These are all interesting questions that the show gives tiny hints at but never really offers a sense of understanding, we get that Cyber is a cyber woman but that could mean several things. And at the very last episode we finally get an explanation of the green liquid, turns out it\'s something she needs to drink to survive (despite the fact that after the first episode it was almost never brought up again until the end). The comic apparently explains most these question, in fact a brief story synopsis on wikipedia of the comics will give you a much better understanding of some of the minor plot points that seem unanswered yet shown through the show. But as I said with my Akira review, you shouldn\'t need to look it up or read the reference material, the minor and larger plot point should be weaved into the story. (I\'d also like to make it clear that I have never read the comic, though from what I understand from many who have they aren\'t very good) Fortunately these are minor plot points that can be overlooked.One last thing I\'d like to state is something that I think brings the score for the story high then it normally would be. The ending is done well for once! Many shows (especially cartoons from the late 90\'s to early 2000\'s) always had the problem of ending on low notes as cliffhangers or a blatant ""hey, if we get enough money we\'ll make more episodes!"" Cyber 6 doesn\'t suffer from this, the ending subtly hints that there is the possibility of a second season yet still has a proper conclusive ending where something is actually accomplished rather then the typical ""I\'ll get you next time my pretty!"" Personally I enjoyed this immensely and although I feel the show could have gone on was glad they weren\'t completely counting on it by making a half-assed ending.Art 8/10: (sorry about the overly long story section, I\'ll try to keep the other areas shorter) As I said, the show was animated by a Japanese company so it has anime like elements to it despite being made mainly as a western show. However the animators rather then making the whole show follow the same anime template for character designs and such that\'s been used in... Almost ever anime ever! (Sorry, I just hate the lack of uniqueness in many anime) They stuck to a more cartoonish approach to the characters, however the movement is just as fluid as you would expect to see in any anime. I have notice some aspects where the it seems choppy (mostly during very fast or very large sequences) but for the most part the animation is solid and the design is quite nice actually (I\'ve seen some pages from the comics and believe they were trying to stay as close to the character designs from there).Sound 7/10: First, the voice acting. The voice acting is strange, for the most part it\'s solid, fits the characters well (most of the time), and is overall fairly decent... After the first few episodes. It may just be me but it seems like the voices are off in the first couple of episodes but then get better, almost like the voice actors weren\'t really sure what they were going for but figured it out later, this might just be me but it\'s something I can\'t overlook. And as noted early, some of the voice just don\'t fit, it\'s almost like the actors thought they were voicing someone completely different and the voices seem ridiculously out of place, this however only limits itself to a few bit roles and is not present a lot, enough so that it throws you off a little. Also, something I feel I should state, the show was owned by a Canadian company and so the show was primarily Canadian, and therefore the original language was indeed English, meaning on the whole sub vs dub debate, there is none, not an important fact but one that I felt should be mentioned. As for the music, as with the voices it\'s well done but sometimes out of place, occasionally you\'ll get things like the music being to cheery and uplifting for the situation being used and vice versa, this problem is present quite a few times and although it does drag the score down a bit it\'s not enough to derail the whole show.Character 9/10: The characters are an interesting topic, since the story (until near the end) is kind of lacking the characters are basically the meat of the show. If you\'re making a show that heavily relies on the characters they\'d better be good... Thankfully they are, although occasionally seeming a little one beat and overly silly they are present well and given enough personality to keep the show going strong. Nothing is played over the top with them and everything is fairly subtle, such as the relationship between Cyber 6 and her friend (and male personas co-worker) Lucas. It\'s not played as a ""Hey! Cyber! I\'m Lucas and I love you! Totally! We should go out!"" but rather more like a friendship with some definite sense of romantic feels between the two. Julian (a street kid who befriends Cyber) has a sad back story but nothing overdone like ""I\'m sad because my parents were killed by a rogue toaster,"" he has to do things he\'s not entirely proud of to keep a roof over his head but it\'s not done to the point where you should feel sorry for him because ""we told you to!"" One problem I do have that keeps the score from a ten is the villains, Von Reichter and José. These characters are evil, why? Because they want to kill Cyber 6 and take over the city. Why do they want to do that? Because they\'re evil. See where I\'m coming from, we have villains who are villains just for the sake of being villains, we\'re not even given much of a reason as to why Reichter want\'s Cyber dead, with José we can at least get where he\'s coming, who doesn\'t want to control a city after all? But Reichter just seems to be there because he was in the comics.Enjoyment 10/10: I\'m afraid if nostalgia goggles will play a role in any part of this review, this is most likely it. Cybersix is indeed a very enjoyable show, it has plenty of everything: action, comedy, drama, romance, and all are very well done and don\'t suffer the problem many other shows with several aims do, such as fighting over control of the shows main focus until there is none. The show knows it\'s an action, and romance, drama, and comedy rather then try to replace it just help accent it, keep it fresh and keep it enjoyable, this also allows it to be enjoyed by all ages seeing as how it doesn\'t just cater to kids love of seeing people being punched (well in all fairness I think everyone enjoys that), but the other more subtle areas definitely appeal to wider audiences. The show is just plain fun to watch. (Well nostalgia goggles, you had your chance, hope you didn\'t do too much damage)Overall 8/10: The verdict is that Cybersix is a good show (though criminally under-rated) and is definitely worth a look. It\'s fairly short and sweet so you can feel satisfied but not like you spent too much time with it. The characters and overall entertainment value of this show are very well done despite some minor downside that can be easily overlooked. So check it out if you don\'t have anything to do over the weekend, you won\'t be disappointed.*DISCLAIMER*Regarding the comic series, if you liked the show and want feel like you want more you can always check these out. They don\'t have an official English translation out but you\'re in luck if you can read Spanish, there are also a few fan translations floating around on the internet so you can try your luck there. But be warned, the comics (from what I\'ve heard from other at least) are not very good. They are also nowhere near as kid friendly as the show, I saw a picture that I thought was some of the weird fetishy rule 34 pics the internet loves to spit out (full out reverse pedophilia action) but turns out it was actually the cover for one of the volumes (no, not a page, the actual cover). You have been warned. Canadian born in 1994 was a young child when I first watched this show. Admittedly I came across it on youtube recently and was driven by nostalgia to watch it again. I tried to watch this show with a critical eye rather then watching through nostalgia goggles and hope the review also is free of it, but be warned that this review might be a bit biased due to that reason.anyway, moving on.Story 7/10 (warning, this is gonna get long):  The story of the show is fairly simple for the most part, a woman with superhuman strength and agility (Cyber 6) who cross dresses as a man to take on her secret identity (Adrian Seidelman) watches over a South American city fighting against the genetic creations of the evil Doctor Von Reichter and his equally evil eight year old son José. immediately I began to see some minor flaws with this show (Critic: 1, Nostalgia: 0), most prominant being the lack of explain certain things that seem like they would be important. What exactly is Cyber 6? What was that green stuff she drank in the first episode? What is Von Reichter trying to accomplish and why does he want Cyber dead? These are all interesting questions that the show gives tiny hints at but never really offers a sense of understanding, we get that Cyber is a cyber woman but that could mean several things. And at the very last episode we finally get an explanation of the green liquid, turns out it\'s something she needs to drink to survive (despite the fact that after the first episode it was almost never brought up again until the end). The comic apparently explains most these question, in fact a brief story synopsis on wikipedia of the comics will give you a much better understanding of some of the minor plot points that seem unanswered yet shown through the show. But as I said with my Akira review, you shouldn\'t need to look it up or read the reference material, the minor and larger plot point should be weaved into the story. (I\'d also like to make it clear that I have never read the comic, though from what I understand from many who have they aren\'t very good) Fortunately these are minor plot points that can be overlooked.One last thing I\'d like to state is something that I think brings the score for the story high then it normally would be. The ending is done well for once! Many shows (especially cartoons from the late 90\'s to early 2000\'s) always had the problem of ending on low notes as cliffhangers or a blatant ""hey, if we get enough money we\'ll make more episodes!"" Cyber 6 doesn\'t suffer from this, the ending subtly hints that there is the possibility of a second season yet still has a proper conclusive ending where something is actually accomplished rather then the typical ""I\'ll get you next time my pretty!"" Personally I enjoyed this immensely and although I feel the show could have gone on was glad they weren\'t completely counting on it by making a half-assed ending.Art 8/10: (sorry about the overly long story section, I\'ll try to keep the other areas shorter) As I said, the show was animated by a Japanese company so it has anime like elements to it despite being made mainly as a western show. However the animators rather then making the whole show follow the same anime template for character designs and such that\'s been used in... Almost ever anime ever! (Sorry, I just hate the lack of uniqueness in many anime) They stuck to a more cartoonish approach to the characters, however the movement is just as fluid as you would expect to see in any anime. I have notice some aspects where the it seems choppy (mostly during very fast or very large sequences) but for the most part the animation is solid and the design is quite nice actually (I\'ve seen some pages from the comics and believe they were trying to stay as close to the character designs from there).Sound 7/10: First, the voice acting. The voice acting is strange, for the most part it\'s solid, fits the characters well (most of the time), and is overall fairly decent... After the first few episodes. It may just be me but it seems like the voices are off in the first couple of episodes but then get better, almost like the voice actors weren\'t really sure what they were going for but figured it out later, this might just be me but it\'s something I can\'t overlook. And as noted early, some of the voice just don\'t fit, it\'s almost like the actors thought they were voicing someone completely different and the voices seem ridiculously out of place, this however only limits itself to a few bit roles and is not present a lot, enough so that it throws you off a little. Also, something I feel I should state, the show was owned by a Canadian company and so the show was primarily Canadian, and therefore the original language was indeed English, meaning on the whole sub vs dub debate, there is none, not an important fact but one that I felt should be mentioned. As for the music, as with the voices it\'s well done but sometimes out of place, occasionally you\'ll get things like the music being to cheery and uplifting for the situation being used and vice versa, this problem is present quite a few times and although it does drag the score down a bit it\'s not enough to derail the whole show.Character 9/10: The characters are an interesting topic, since the story (until near the end) is kind of lacking the characters are basically the meat of the show. If you\'re making a show that heavily relies on the characters they\'d better be good... Thankfully they are, although occasionally seeming a little one beat and overly silly they are present well and given enough personality to keep the show going strong. Nothing is played over the top with them and everything is fairly subtle, such as the relationship between Cyber 6 and her friend (and male personas co-worker) Lucas. It\'s not played as a ""Hey! Cyber! I\'m Lucas and I love you! Totally! We should go out!"" but rather more like a friendship with some definite sense of romantic feels between the two. Julian (a street kid who befriends Cyber) has a sad back story but nothing overdone like ""I\'m sad because my parents were killed by a rogue toaster,"" he has to do things he\'s not entirely proud of to keep a roof over his head but it\'s not done to the point where you should feel sorry for him because ""we told you to!"" One problem I do have that keeps the score from a ten is the villains, Von Reichter and José. These characters are evil, why? Because they want to kill Cyber 6 and take over the city. Why do they want to do that? Because they\'re evil. See where I\'m coming from, we have villains who are villains just for the sake of being villains, we\'re not even given much of a reason as to why Reichter want\'s Cyber dead, with José we can at least get where he\'s coming, who doesn\'t want to control a city after all? But Reichter just seems to be there because he was in the comics.Enjoyment 10/10: I\'m afraid if nostalgia goggles will play a role in any part of this review, this is most likely it. Cybersix is indeed a very enjoyable show, it has plenty of everything: action, comedy, drama, romance, and all are very well done and don\'t suffer the problem many other shows with several aims do, such as fighting over control of the shows main focus until there is none. The show knows it\'s an action, and romance, drama, and comedy rather then try to replace it just help accent it, keep it fresh and keep it enjoyable, this also allows it to be enjoyed by all ages seeing as how it doesn\'t just cater to kids love of seeing people being punched (well in all fairness I think everyone enjoys that), but the other more subtle areas definitely appeal to wider audiences. The show is just plain fun to watch. (Well nostalgia goggles, you had your chance, hope you didn\'t do too much damage)Overall 8/10: The verdict is that Cybersix is a good show (though criminally under-rated) and is definitely worth a look. It\'s fairly short and sweet so you can feel satisfied but not like you spent too much time with it. The characters and overall entertainment value of this show are very well done despite some minor downside that can be easily overlooked. So check it out if you don\'t have anything to do over the weekend, you won\'t be disappointed.*DISCLAIMER*Regarding the comic series, if you liked the show and want feel like you want more you can always check these out.

It's got this unique Halloween feel mingled with a French/European setting that just sets it apart from most other animated shows. It's beautiful to look at, and it's painful to know how little attention it's gotten since its completion.Cybersix is about a Genetically engineered woman named Cybersix, and her battle against the many monsters sent by her creator to cause trouble. By day she poses as a male literature teacher, hangs out with her BFF Lucas, and acts like a geek. By...night, she's an ass kicking sex-symbol that frequently visits her love interest, Lucas. It's also episodic, so you'll never have to worry about a boring arc lasting more than one episode. Personally, I was never bored.The characters are cool, spunky, unique and likable. While the majority of the characters outside of the main four or five rarely get any screen time, they only add to the already action-packed story. Cybersix herself is one outstanding individual, being both tough and gentle at the same time. Awesome.The music isn't orchestrated, but man that main theme is catchy.I highly highly recommend this one! Since it's only 13 episodes, you have very little to lose. Be warned the ending is slightly unsatisfying. night, she's an ass kicking sex-symbol that frequently visits her love interest, Lucas.

Ayashi no Ceres,https://myanimelist.net/anime/104/Ayashi_no_Ceres,"[""Ayashi no Ceres presents a beautiful love story, which intertwined with great action and characters makes for a sad, yet heartwarming story that can grip your heart.It starts off very peacefully, with Aya Mikage and her twin brother Aki spending time with their friends, celebrating the twins' 16th birthday. However, this peaceful day is interrupted by Aya falling off a bridge, down on the highway underneath. Miraculously, she lands without getting a scratch, and she's saved from cars on a collision course by a mysterious, red-headed man. And that day marks the end of the happy days for the two.They are summoned to the...family mansion to celebrate their 16th birthday, but instead, they end up being the victims of the Mikage family's gruesome rite of killing off female descendants with strong tennyo powers in them. Said powers suddenly awaken, preventing her from getting killed.From here on, the story goes darker, deeper and angstier as we're thrown into the mess that Aya suddenly finds herself in, being hunted by her own family all of a sudden. She has to deal with the fact that her twin brother has turned into a reincarnation of an evil man from the past, and she has to make sure Ceres doesn't take over her body completely. This leads to some great action scenes, as Ceres emerges to fight the Mikage family from time to time, with her astounding powers.And then there's the love, the beautiful, yet sad love that is Aya's and Toya's love - Toya is the guy who saved her, but also a Mikage henchman, which means he's out to get her. However, he slowly falls in love with her, and her with him, despite the two of them being enemies. Now they must find a way to live out their love without the Mikage family or Ceres, who has a vendetta against the Mikages, getting in the way. Of course, there's Yuhi, and there's actually some mutual love between Yuhi and Aya as well, creating a love triangle that can rip Aya apart.The characters in the anime are all very realistically portrayed. From Toya's quest to find his place in this world to Aya's struggles to remain herself through all that happens around her. The love that slowly develops between Toya and Aya is never forced, and their relationship progresses nicely over the course of the series.The side characters are all good too, and despite not having so major roles, they fulfill them excellently, and they are portrayed very well too. Most of the characters you will see have some depth to them, which causes your heart to be with them as well, and not only Aya and Toya.I'm also fond of the character development that takes place during the course of the series - at the end I could see how much they had matured, obviously having learned a few things about life and love during the events that took place during the course of the series.Studio Pierrot did a nice job on the animation, and despite it being a bit old, it's very good. The lighting effects are very well done, though the same can't always be said about the special effects - they had their moments they too, though. The overall detail is very good, but there's one thing that bugged me, and that was the fact that their hair seemed transparent when in front of their eyes.

So quoth Aki, local sage and official series craziest person, which is really saying something for this series. I mean, between Toya, Aya\'s cousin, Aya\'s OTHER cousin, Yuji, Mrs. Q, Grandpa Mikage, and Aya herself, we got crazy coming out of the walls.There is precisely one good thing about this series, which is the opening, ""Scarlet"" by Junko Iwao. Not the weird animation, just the song. I have the Japanese version and the piano only version and they\'re quite pleasant and pretty.You want generic tropes with good ol\' 90s animation? You got it! Toya\'s got like double or...triple plot amnesia which gives him extra doses of mangst, because what\'s a bad shoujo without amnesia? He then meets Aya and for reasons unbeknownst to me, cept that she got through his ""cool dude mystique"" and decided that he was safe and that she felt safe with him she falls in love with him, because I guess you fall in love with people because of that? Even though she knows nothing about him and barely knows him. Toya then ""rediscovers his memories"" and then gets Harry Potter syndro-I mean, convenient headaches! And goes back to the dark side! And then we find out that his memories aren\'t his memories after all! Because some time ago he was brought in covered in bruises and given false memories that gave him pain when he thought of Aya. When did any of THAT happen, exactly? Who cares, because ONWITHTHESTORY!And if you think THAT didn\'t make sense, I\'m not going to get into the rest of the plot because it REALLY doesn\'t make sense. Possession, reincarnation, abusive scumbags, spoiled kids with creepy obsessions, underage sex, incest, lots and lots of obsession, attempted child murder, attempted fratricide, stalking, sexist stereotypes... It\'s got all kind of fun in it, I guess.It also really bothered me that the Smart Dude had incredibly tiny glasses which wouldn\'t have helped if they were normal-size anyway cause he had these ridiculous bangs in the way and I kept grumbling to myself ""cut your friggen hair you incompetent you\'re a SCIENTIST"" and I LOVE long hair on men so this was incredibly confusing.Also, common sense? Hahahahaha WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT THIS IS A TERRIBLE SHOUJO NO ONE USES THEIR COMMON SENSE HERE! It\'s verboten! (I like shoujo but gods help me I can\'t STAND this anime).Despite the implications of the ending (it\'s hilarious, really, you just have to lose your sanity to appreciate it), this series also presents a double standard that\'s tropic of reverse harems. Women don\'t get harem endings (where the end result is left open to interpretation and more than likely they have an open marriage), so one of the guys (there are typically only two) have to either die or vanish. It\'s typically the hotter one, so the underdog who\'s ""better"" for the woman (despite her preferences hahaha women making choices what\'s THAT about, amirite??) gets a chance. Well after the woman\'s lost her virginity, anyway, since that\'s a BIG part of their character development, donchaknow? Interestingly, guys in harem stories typically don\'t lose their virginity, if they have it, although male harem stories arguably have the men get sexually assaulted far more often, as a gag joke, so... Yeah I don\'t think it evens out but trying to understand this series hurts my brain.Anyone telling you this series has character growth is a LIAR and you SHOULD NOT listen to them. Unless they mean that after about 18 episodes characters with pretty much zero personality suddenly get backstory at 100 miles an hour. Backstory does not equal character growth but sure, whatever floats your boat.You want a good shoujo? Well... watch ""Yona of the Dawn"". It\'s arguably a reverse harem set in a fantasy world. It\'s hilarious -on purpose- and well-written and includes a lot of great character development and the animation is pretty.

This show ends up moving in some wild and frankly implausible directions, even aside from the usual angst and drama we come to expect from a shoujo anime. It's not light, that's for sure.Art: What can I say? It's typical Watase Yuu, but the art, especially for the male characters, is delicate and pretty. As with...most shoujo, it's colorful. I imagine if the work was done today, the colors would be even more vivid and glossy and less faded, but they're not at all bad.Sound: The theme song was awesome. :)Character: Unfortunately, as happens with many anime that suddenly choose a villain from among the main cast, we can't really say much about the characters because their personalities change wildly when they suddenly become villains or suddenly embody the reincarnated soul of a vengeful spirit (yes, it happens). The characters become plot devices themselves. Events move this story along rather than the characters.Overall: If you like your romance staid and centered on relationships and characters, then this anime is not for you.

If you're a Watase Yuu fan, go for it."", ""If you'd like to see my full review then leave a comment on my profile.Characters: The relationships of the family members were the most fascinating in the series. Aya and Aki had the typical brother/sister relationship of bickering and understanding, but after their 16th birthday it became more intense. Aki now desired the maiden inside of Aya. Aya also had a lot of growth, as she fought to control Ceres and save her brother from their power-hungry family. All of the characters have inner demons that they are constantly fighting in order to protect the ones they love. "", 'Why can\'t we have more Shoujos like this!This show is full of win!Let me get this out of the way.The main reason why i can\'t give this a 10/10 is because I wish the main character,Aya could do more or be more PROactive.However,her role is well defined and established in this story,never did i feel that she had no reason to do what she did.Which is not something i could say for most anime these days.And at least she has some real character and personality.Not being made artificially strong just for the sake of the tired \'strong girl""trope,implying girls need bs plot armor to be...strong.The 2 dudes she loved are allright,and do have a meaningful love triangle.a heroic yuuji and our emo boy Toya.Fortunately both of them are more complex than they seem.And you kinds get why she choose the one.(hint.Nice guys finish last). Unlike some shows, this nice guy isn\'t a loser.He makes some tough choices and goes through a lot.The other guy is tied too well to the plot for me to go too deep into him.He is a lost dude whose struggle to find himself isn\'t cringe worthyThis show is very ecchi for a shoujo.There are shonen harems with less service than this.That is because this anime had a source material which was once a PORN manga for GIRLS( Girls like porn too lol)But the show knows when how to tell a serious story.Or tone it down when it needs too.The story also has Aya host a spirit called Ceres(Goddess host from TWGOK is the best modern equivalent) .She is the"" Diana to the Tenri.She basically is gonna kill if she doesn\'t get what she needs.There is a whole mystery surrounding Aya ,Ceres and her family line.Conspiracies and corporations around.One of the best original Conspiracies in anime around.I love the fantasy in this anime, it has well established rulesso when the fantasy happens, it  didn\'t feel that the author pulled stuff out of nowhere to make stuff happen(unlike madoka).This can get very over the top,but it has a realism to ground the story.The villans ,I\'d say one of them needs a tag team of Keima,lelouch and Kira to take him on.He is a very focused dude who works towards the shows theme,""perfection"".He isn\'t just the bad guy.More is shown rather than said for this dude ,which is what makes him stand out.The other villan seems so generic at first.However,he has however one of the most realistic motivations out there.The violence is brutal.and i\'ve seen a lot of violent anime on my day.......When I say ""Is shoujo a dead genre"" ,This is the kind of show I am talking about! strong.The 2 dudes she loved are allright,and do have a meaningful love triangle.a heroic yuuji and our emo boy Toya.Fortunately both of them are more complex than they seem.And you kinds get why she choose the one.(hint.Nice guys finish last).

It's a story filled with a lot of drama, love triangles, teenage angst...not to mention, it's got that whole crazy sci-fi, mystical and trans-generational angle thrown into the mix as well. With all of that, it should suffice to say that we've got ourselves a pretty complex story going on with this anime series, but even so, it's really not that hard of a story to follow....and that's precisely why I'm giving this story high marks because no matter how awesome...a story maybe, no matter how super smooth and modern the art might be, if the story isn't told well enough to make a connection to it's audience then it fails as a program....and ultimately it all amounts to a steaming pile of crap. So even though this show, Ceres has had it's uber-EMO moments with all these characters that are either suffering from some sort of bipolar or MPD = Multiple Personality Disorder, I still give it high marks because not once did I roll my eyes in disgust nor did I get bored with it. Mysterious Ceres does tell a good enough story that you'll be able to follow through to it's conclusion all the while being entertained the whole time.AnimationThe animation isn't the best in the world, there's a lot of freeze-frame shots during the fight scenes and sometimes you have the characters making these jumpy, erratic movements when they walk, run or fight. Plus I spotted a few inconsistencies with the coloring as well as with some characters' wardrobes and even inconsistencies with the lengths of their hair. Do I care about all this? Am I that nit-picky? No, but it might bug other viewers so I'm stating it as a matter of fact.Overall, to me at least, all those flaws and errors made the show more unique and somewhat valiant. Also all those little imperfections in the series help to create [however unintentionally] a kind of vintage feel to it all, like it was something out of the late 80's/early 90's.That's how I was able to cope with it anyway.......SOUNDBoth the OP and 1st ED Theme songs have this very 80's retro vibe to them. The OP especially sounded like one of those cheesy 80's soap opera theme songs. It's all kinds of dramatic and melancholy. And then there's the 2nd ED Theme was more of that forgettable 90's electro-synthesizer POP sound. Was this on purpose? Who knows....but it does kind of fit the overall feel of the series since it did kind of look a lot older than it actually is.ANIMATIONI think the most important thing to keep in mind when watching this series is that this is really a love story, even though there are tons of action scenes with lots of gunfire, explosions and bloodshed. That somehow even with all the dual personalities, back-stabbing and betrayals worthy of most soap operas, the plotline still remains incredibly basic which is that everyone wants or is somehow connected to the Aya/Ceres character.At first while watching episode 1, I thought &ldquo;GAH! What a yucky cheese-fest!&rdquo; but as soon as they get to Grampa's house for their birthday &ldquo;celebration&rdquo; things got pretty good pretty fast.....and that's what make this show a good show to watch! It's not just a cheesy soap opera in anime form nor does it adhere to just one type of basic shtick. This series has a whole bunch of stuff to offer, of course it has the more obvious romance and drama elements, but there are tons of gritty, bloody fight scenes, suspense, shocking revelations and freaky plot twists. Though sometimes I do think they get carried away in some scenes, like for example, which government is going to allow some agency [multi-conglomerate, big business, mafioso or otherwise] to fly a helicopter around the city armed with live ammo and missiles to go around chasing civilian cars and blowing up the highway in the process?But even with those incredulous moments, I still must say it was a very good story that will shock you and leave you questioning, &ldquo;how will it all end?&rdquo;CHARACTERSThough Mysterious Ceres isn't considered a 'bishonen' anime exclusively, in my book, it still falls in that category since it's jam packed with lots and lots of extremely good-looking, if not somewhat effeminate, pretty boys! I'm not opposed to bishounen animes...in fact, the more the merrier I say. However I do think these guys kind of looked too similar. Only their hair and eyes were colored differently but they were basically from the same mold as if they were the products of mass production not unlike a certain factory line of Ken dolls. Speaking of mass production, Ceres' face seemed to be the main template being used when drawing women's faces, tho it was rather ingeniously explained away in the story as simply being a coincidental phenomenon thru genetic heredity.Personality-wise, the main thing I noticed was that the dudes seem to do way more crying than the girls and while it's nice to see a little male sympathy &amp; compassion, they did seem to go a teensy bit overboard with all that bawling, but it's to be expected sometimes with female oriented shows where the girls are empowered in all sorts of ways while the guys are considerably much weaker and also much more emotional.Also I thought that the Mikage family at times seem a bit too overwrought with all this drama with people dying all over the place it was like something out of one of those ancient Greek tragedies. Every time you met a 'family' member they had a tale of death and personal tragedy to tell, it made you wonder if anyone had a happy childhood or even a happy adulthood for that matter.ENJOYMENTAll in all this was a pretty good series and despite it's shortcomings art-wise and music-wise, it was still a pretty compelling story that was told in a way that's enjoyable and pretty easy to follow. It's the kind of story that will get a reaction out of you. I found myself saying &ldquo;Daaaaaaaamn!&rdquo; out loud lots of times and there are many episodes that will end leaving you wide-eyed with shock and racing with anticipation to see what happens next in the following episode.It's a show, I would definitely recommend to those interested in this type of show or is a fan of shows with lots of bishounen a story maybe, no matter how super smooth and modern the art might be, if the story isn't told well enough to make a connection to it's audience then it fails as a program....and ultimately it all amounts to a steaming pile of crap.

Its been from my mind , &quot;ok going to watch it because it seems very interesting and not going to be a great story just another romance plot  with dramatic shocking moments for anime with pretty boy and girls&quot; Though i do cry but sometimes force myself. I do cry on Samurai X: Trust  and Betrayal, Makoto Shinkai's films for example. Thought in series just a force but for this series,  I WAS WRONG!!!! This is my second series to cry so hard with Elfen Lied....If not seen that show too, you better :)I watched this only 8 episodes yesterday and then Saturday the rest of the time till right now. I forgot that i finished the whole thing till 23 thinking, &quot;OMG I AM in near the last episode already&quot; let me tell you i didn't get tired one bit.The story in the beginning begins a typical shojo high school teenager of Aya hanging with her twin brother Aki and her friends having so much fun like kareoke. Aya happens to be the best singer in her high school let me say. Then a womens bag got stolen and Aya came to grap the bag from the burglar but then fell off the cliff from the bridge when she tripped. though without her dying, she started to float with a strange ancient symbol. though she landed carefully but was about to get hit by a car but a handsome guy came to save her in time. the guy whose name is touya. Thats just the beginning. From then it was time the twins 16th birthday to celebrate but not going with their friends but to grandpa's house. What happens they didn't expect is as a gift a ancient that awakens them of the ancient fairytale. the fairy tale about a women named ceres came down to heaven and something to her precieces is taken by a man who wouldn't let her leave so beared children together. so yes mixed humen of ceres and the mans blood. Which happens was a true story. For Aya she is the awaken of CERES and AKI is the man who beared her children. So for that rule is Aya for any women that is born a CERES has to be killed from her whole family. So yeah start out cute to intense sci fi, fantasy. Yes  has a bunch of love triangle soup opera going on and some cartoonie faces but you forget that. Its not just for girls, its for boys to love this show too. LOTS OF VIOLENCE AND BLOOD!!!the characters, you might love all of them. Though be one character might hate is Touya. AT first might but then later on the series get to love him which i really did too for wondering why AYA loves them. I promise you, you will. Sadly, characters you'll get to love will die tragically. I kept screaming in my mind with tears.The theme song &quot;Scarlet&quot;, i loved it before found it was in the series. When it was i was surprised my favorite voice japanese voice actress sang this and is the voice of ceres :) Great theme that won't get sick of.So its an OUTSTANDING SHOW that shouldn't be missed which is my personal favorite :)For other stuff enjoy which is in the manga FRUITS BASKET.

Coming into it without high expectations and thinking that they might have strayed from the story, watching it i should have kept those same expectations because the anime brought it out so perfectly.Story: 9/10I give the story a 9 because to me the story was completely original. Celestial robes, and incarnations have never been brought out this...way. Yu Watase mixed blood and gore well with romance and drama. It flowed smoothly and was fast paced exactly like the manga. Right when i thought things couldn't get any worse it did and kept me hooked till the very end. The romance was brought out perfectly not too mushy and over the top and was original how Watase brought it out.Art 8/10Understand the show is old and not up to date on new technology so this art then was considered exceptional. I love that they stayed true to Watase's original look. The only thing I ever hated about her drawings were how a bang covered one eye but yet we could still see that one eye. That they could have not used. But overall the art was great to me.Sound 6/10Same thing an old anime so the sound wasn't great at all. Not bad enough to stop watching but there were some weird sounds that didnt belong where they put them.Character 7/10The characters were well developed and expressed themselves greatly. Every character had their own problems to deal with and approached them in different ways. But also every character were tied together in a certain way that made everything combine and made problems worse to the point where some of the characters went crazy. Most characters are likeable and some are hateful but all have a backstory to make you sympathize with them.Enjoyment 10/10I enjoyed Ceres fully. I couldnt stop watching once i started. Every bit of information sucked me in and made me want to know how it happened, where it happened, and what they were going to do to solve it. The emotions the characters protrayed made me want to cry with them, laugh with them, and get mad with them.Overall 10/10Ceres Celestial Legend is a show i would watch over and over again. The characters and story are something that will stay on my mind and will be very hard to forget. Ceres will stay with you even if you don't want it to. A very powerful story. way.

He saw the ""celestial robe"" and took it with him. Unable to go back to heaven, the celestial maiden was forced to marry the young man.Story:Based on the manga with the same title. The series is a a mix of drama, fantasy, adventure and romance. Much darker than the author\'s previous work. A love story that will appeal to everyone.Art:Studio Pierrot did a really great job with the animation. The satisfying character designs are so pleasing to...the eye.SoundThe Japanese voice acting for the characters was exceptionally amazing. They depicted their sentiments persuasively and conveyed their lines with the control and originality. Also, the songs are haunting.Note: I really like the opening song. Very emotional.Character:I like how strong-willed Aya is (the main female protagonist). She was able to endure the hardships of her situation and was able to confront the enemy. Her brother (Aki) is vise versa since he lost control of himself. Touya, on the other hand is sometimes too depressing but all of them complimented each other.Enjoyment:I really enjoyed this series because of it\'s unique plot. The mystery of the Celestial Beings is really intriguing and the romance between Aya and Touya is so heartwarming.Overall:One of the best series for me. Awesome story and music. I would recommend this series to anyone, but be warned... be ready with a box of tissues lol the eye.SoundThe Japanese voice acting for the characters was exceptionally amazing.

And boy was I wrong. I can\'t even begin to point out how wrong I was. I just saw the picture and thought ""Hey, stereotypical reverse harem. I\'m bored, let\'s watch"", and that, my friends, is how I slowly entered the hell that is Ayashi no Ceres.Story 9/10The story is about the twins Aya and Aki, though Aya takes the main lead pretty fast.What I thought...would be the fluffy lovestory with many males around one female quickly became this train to my feels utter destruction. Every stop had tragic events right around the corner, and while we did get to see some romance and happiness, that would quickly get to a point where we would just wait for the next lightning to strike. The tragic events actually came to a point where the characters just couldn\'t handle it and was like ""Yea, it was tragic, but like, we are used to it, so let me freak out a bit and get back to you tomorrow"".The story in itself messed me up pretty badly. But if it was only tragic I wouldn\'t have watched it to the end. The tragedy in this is so freaking beautifull that I just couldn\'t take my eyes off.Art 6/10I know this is an old anime, but the art still kind of took away something of the enjoyment for me. I found myself forgetting to concentrate on the events of the story, only to keep thinking ""Just move those mouths two cm down or something"". It just really annoyed me a lot, and I thought I would get used to it, but I didn\'t really. Other than that I guess the art is what to expect.Sound 8/10I don\'t really notice the background music unless it\'s totally off, so I guess it was okay. The reason for giving it 8, however, is because of my love for both the OP and the ED\'s. They just embody the whole feeling I get from the anime, and the OP especially is so powerful and sad. Thinking back I should have gotten a clue, that this wasn\'t a ""Kiss kiss fall in love"" kind of a deal...Character 9/10So let\'s talk characters, because even though the plot was kind of original (Only kinda), the characters would be the thing that would make or break a show. And these really made it.Aya, our heroine, starts out just being a normal girl. She is only 15 when the anime begins, and at her 16th birthday, where the anime really takes hold, everything just changes around her. Like, literally everything. She finds out she has a celestial being (I think it was called) inside of her, her whole family wants to kill her, and so she has to flee. The way she grows as a character is outstanding. It\'s very human, and not as if she is either too weak or too strong all the time. She shows both her strong sides and weak sides. I don\'t know if I imagined it, but as the anime progresses it almost feels like she matures a lot. Both her clothing and facial expressions. And everything in between I guess.Toya, a very important character, also really evolves. I would go in-depth with it, but that would be kind of a spoiler.Same with Aki, Ayas twin brother.The one, however, I am mostly pleased with is the character named Alec, but I would really suggest people to watch it.In general the characters mostly have very noticable personality changes in the good way. There is a few exceptions, of course, and other characters whom aren\'t given any time to shine, but because of the time I can see as to why they did as they did.Overall enjoyment 9/10As I started with, I thought this would be a normal reverse harem anime, and then I boarded the train to hell instead. I was not, the least, prepared mentally or emotionally for this bormbardment of feels I got thrown at me. I cried, I hurt, I felt with the characters, and I truly ended up feeling with them in not that much time. Now I feel empty and sad, because even though this anime was tragic, I really loved it. I really enjoyed it. I like anime that can get me to feel something, and with this I went through almost my whole feeling register. So well. I\'m sad that I\'m finished. would be the fluffy lovestory with many males around one female quickly became this train to my feels utter destruction. Every stop had tragic events right around the corner, and while we did get to see some romance and happiness, that would quickly get to a point where we would just wait for the next lightning to strike. The tragic events actually came to a point where the characters just couldn\'t handle it and was like ""Yea, it was tragic, but like, we are used to it, so let me freak out a bit and get back to you tomorrow"".The story in itself messed me up pretty badly. But if it was only tragic I wouldn\'t have watched it to the end. The tragedy in this is so freaking beautifull that I just couldn\'t take my eyes off.Art 6/10I know this is an old anime, but the art still kind of took away something of the enjoyment for me. I found myself forgetting to concentrate on the events of the story, only to keep thinking ""Just move those mouths two cm down or something"". It just really annoyed me a lot, and I thought I would get used to it, but I didn\'t really. Other than that I guess the art is what to expect.Sound 8/10I don\'t really notice the background music unless it\'s totally off, so I guess it was okay. The reason for giving it 8, however, is because of my love for both the OP and the ED\'s. They just embody the whole feeling I get from the anime, and the OP especially is so powerful and sad. Thinking back I should have gotten a clue, that this wasn\'t a ""Kiss kiss fall in love"" kind of a deal...Character 9/10So let\'s talk characters, because even though the plot was kind of original (Only kinda), the characters would be the thing that would make or break a show. And these really made it.Aya, our heroine, starts out just being a normal girl. She is only 15 when the anime begins, and at her 16th birthday, where the anime really takes hold, everything just changes around her. Like, literally everything. She finds out she has a celestial being (I think it was called) inside of her, her whole family wants to kill her, and so she has to flee. The way she grows as a character is outstanding. It\'s very human, and not as if she is either too weak or too strong all the time. She shows both her strong sides and weak sides. I don\'t know if I imagined it, but as the anime progresses it almost feels like she matures a lot. Both her clothing and facial expressions. And everything in between I guess.Toya, a very important character, also really evolves. I would go in-depth with it, but that would be kind of a spoiler.Same with Aki, Ayas twin brother.The one, however, I am mostly pleased with is the character named Alec, but I would really suggest people to watch it.In general the characters mostly have very noticable personality changes in the good way. There is a few exceptions, of course, and other characters whom aren\'t given any time to shine, but because of the time I can see as to why they did as they did.Overall enjoyment 9/10As I started with, I thought this would be a normal reverse harem anime, and then I boarded the train to hell instead.

Also, her family is experimenting with the population in Japan to discover who has the genes of the Ceres' powers, called...C-Genomers. Also, when Ceres takes over, Aya has incredible powers. Everyone could do a great series with lots of action, drama and romane, but unfortunetly, the romance and drama feels abused, while the action is little and boring.Instead on focusing the plot, the story focuses on the lame love story  of the main character with Toya, generic bishonen with mysterious past who deeply fall in love with her despite they never met before...Oh, no, wait, they've met before, when Aya was a little girl, and this so valuable memorie is only remenbered when the main couple need to remenber it¿Could it be more cliché?Ok, now i've told what i dislike from this anime, let me tell you what i like. Like i've said before, the plot is interesting, the idea of make a shojo based in the legend of the supernatural lady who married a human after he stole her clothes is really creative. The idea of Aki, the beloved Aya's twin brother turned into the villain looks brillant, and Aya has a lot of chemistry with Yuhi, a character more interesting and appealing to me than Toya. The show has alot of potential, but it wased because the creators prefer to sell the typical love story to whiny teenage girls. C-Genomers. Also, when Ceres takes over, Aya has incredible powers.

I was actually enjoying the anime in the beginning, but I\'m at episode 17 and it\'s going SO downhill.The first couple episodes were pretty good. We got trauma, drama, directed almost like a thriller that actually had me on my toes, and some kind of character development from our main characters (oh except Toya, that guy literally never gets any until AFTER episode 16/17 LOL).This anime gets pretty dark at certain times, and the way it\'s depicted gives a thriller/suspense kind of feel. That\'s what I found really cool about this, was that it was able to build up suspense and drama in a good way.However, I notice after episode 13-14, the directing starts going to shit. The transitions and story-telling in the anime become ABSOLUTE CRAP halfway through the season and so much stuff is happening without proper explanations that it gets really confusing.||| Often times when I start a new episode, it seems like it does a time-skip and doesn\'t pick up where the previous episode left, so I have to check to make sure I\'m watching the right episode. |||This happens a lot. I notice that it glosses over really important and drastic things / turn of events that I\'m wondering ""when did they do this??? why is she attending a new school all of sudden??""Furthermore, there\'s SO MANY PLOT-HOLES. A lot of the stuff doesn\'t make sense, no proper explanations and it becomes so irksome that it\'s ridiculous.The only character development we\'ve seen is Yuhi and the celestial being herself, Ceres. Suzumi, although seemingly introduced as a major character, actually ends up being on the sidelines and out of the story a lot, so not much from her.The romance in the show started off good in the first couple episodes, but by episode 13-14, it starts falling apart.Why does it fall apart? Well, in the first couple episodes we have one guy who has gotten close to Aya and always protects her. They even have their \'moments\', Aya doesn\'t really mind it either and even says she doesn\'t mind being kissed by him and may actually fall in love with him. We have ALL that chemistry built up for a good TWELVE EPISODES and lots of scenes where they get to know each other. So they have this guy here as the possible love interest, and you\'re led to believe they\'ll be together because he\'s been there for her in all of her roughest times and saved her every single time, /and/ they\'re progressing in their relationship.Then we have another guy who seems like the main love interest based on the OP, except what? He doesn\'t have ANYTHING with Aya. This guy literally responds to Aya with 1-2 lines in the first 12 episodes and she rarely ever saw him. Yet somehow she\'s in love with him??? This is a weird love story. She fell in love with a guy she barely knows, a total complete stranger that remains a stranger until around episode 13-ish. And the guy barely knows her either, yet he says he\'s in love. Not only that, but around episode 16-17, they start throwing ALL KINDS of new stories to make up for his lack of character development.The story at this point doesn\'t make sense anymore. I notice that a lot of times the story drifts away from the plot. The story keeps drifting away from finding the celestial robe. I\'m really close to dropping it at this point lolAlso, I don\'t know what it is with the mangaka\'s obsession with rape, but yes this show does have several scenes that mention it or hint at it. There\'s also a lot of sexism and misogyny in this /sigh/----[ Final Review ]----I finally willed myself to finish watching the last couple episodes in hopes that the show will redeem itself. No, it does not.|| I really had to ask myself if I was just watching a really bad Hentai. || The plot became something you\'d find in a hentai, but even more disappointing and cringey. No more suspense or thrill felt from the first episodes, which sucks.It didn\'t improve. It just kept building and building onto the clusterfuck called its \'plot\'. I felt like I was watching several different animes jumbled into one, or like the mangaka thought ""what if i kept adding random stories that didn\'t make sense and was never hinted EVER in the story?"" And the amount of plot-holes was astonishing, like nothing ever made sense.Remember, this is a story on a 16 year old girl. Everyone is trying to rape her, she gets pregnant and is like ""I will carry your baby"" to a guy she\'s barely known, becomes reduced to a character that really doesn\'t do shit after episode 13-ish except for screaming.I mentioned before about plot-holes.

Often times the audio doesn\'t match up with the mouth, and often times the official licensed translation is very off and awkward.!!!!!! Lastly, there\'s a lot of rape and incest themes in this.

It is about Ceres who is trapped in the body of Aya to retrieve her mana which was lost on Earth. The main villian, Mikagi, was trapped in the body of Aki to bring damnation to the world and prevent Ceres from giving the freedom she wants.The art is beautiful and the soundtrack was all right. Art: 8 Sound: 6Yuu Watase still creates the main character who is a crybaby just like Miaka Yuki. We have Aya Mikage who is a crybaby and could not defend herself. So yes, here...is another damsel in distress.Toya is basically Aya's love interest and he always become a good person as the series progress.The only redeemable aspect of this show is Yuuhi Aogiri, without him this show will be trash. He is kind, loving, and always willing to risk his own life to protect people dear to him. He in fact protected Aya from the Mikage groups. He is also a smart and capable person and I can relate to him in so many ways.This is just like in Shattered Angels, where the only redeemable value is Setsuna, she has the same likable traits as Yuuhi but she is just more than that. Without her, Shattered Angels would be trash.Yuuhi is really one of my most favorite male characters and he made this show enjoyable to me. In fact, Yuuhi did his really best to protect Chidori and when he cried in episode 19, I really started to understand how much he really cared for Chidori. I also wanted to cry just like him.But overall, this anime is still worth watching.

I want to say this is a masterpiece, because it has brilliant moments where you will laugh or cry, but there are also moments where I wanted to hit my head in the wall because of the frustration. (Spoilers at the end)This anime is fast to watch, with only 24 episodes. The plot is inconsistent at some points but at the end everything ties up beautifully and gives an overall sense to the serie, which is always appreciated.I find the plot to be quite simplistic at the beginning, then...becoming more confusing and complicated. Lots of questions are left without an answer and I honestly couldn\'t find any explanation of some of the mayor events in the plot, where everything is safed at the end of the day thanks to the ""hero"".Why you\'ll like it?This story is filled with emocional deep relationships between the characters, lots and lots of romance and a hard quest.

Ayashi no Ceres explores the human heart and the search of the self, the risk of playing god.

It is also understanding them, it is also maintaining what is between the two of you. It is kinda funny to think of the main plot of this story. It is like a lovers quarrel due to the misunderstanding between two person in love. What makes it interesting is the way that little thing turns out into a big one that cause disruption, not only just the two of them, but also the blood running next to them. It is also fascinating to know something...about a myth or historical love story flashing in my eyes. This anime has its twist that you'll never expect it to be. The only thing I kinda doubted is how the bond  between the other two main characters bloom. Love should be shown naturally. It does not create a feelings out of nowhere. It always, always have its root. It always come from something lovable, with flaws, but with understanding. Apart from that, the concept of it, how twisted human can be, how different people is from each other, how greed can control emotions, how revenge can turn so bad, it's all in here. And it will just depend on you how you'll see and enjoy this series.CHARACTER: 7There's always that character who really is like a character. While there is also a character who is more like human than the main one. I think, the best character who show what real human can be is the antagonist of the series. He has the most developed character. Along the series, he learned his mistakes and accept the consenquence of his actions. While he has his good sides, the protagonist of the story is kinda neutral and descending. Yes, the story progress because of her falling in love with a guy with all his heart. However, her changes is minimal, and it is kinda irritating how she can only cry, hurt, use not her powers, for the sake of her loved ones.SOUND AND ANIMATION: 9I freaking love the opening song. It's heartbreaking, it is really sad and you can feel the emotions put into the song. It's like its inviting you to cry along with it. Though the language is a foreign one, the feelings suppressed on it is not. The emotions wanted to burst is real. Additional point with the animation of this series which really looks like my first favorite anime, none other than fushigi yuugi. Same author, yes. Though the animation is old, the expression of the character is fine and some of it will really get you goosebumps, or rather excited. The psychotic gesture of one of the characters is really something.ENJOYMENT: 7The main historical story is really amazing for me. That's what I enjoyed the most. An angel goes down from heaven, unable to leave the earth and so on. I'm really a fan of stories like this. It has its unique taste on its own. Watching historical anime is already an enjoyment for me. What more if it is a good one?ENDING: 8If you ever write a story, you will sympathize with the author, I guess. Imagine you have written a story, two guys fall sincerely inlove with a girl. Don't you think it is very hard to pick one of the two? If you mold your characters the best way you can? I think Yuu Watase follow her soft side when thinking of an ending. She picked an ending where everybody understands each other, no one was left behind, no one has regrets, all is happy, all has planned. Cliche is not the best term for it, I think it's more of just a peaceful ending. about a myth or historical love story flashing in my eyes. This anime has its twist that you'll never expect it to be.

It's a powerful archetypal story about women, and the wild woman inside us. It's a story about the emotions, feelings, personal truth and accepting ourselves.

At first, I was going to rate it a 5 because the art was good but the storyline was definitely a 3. Plus, the audio definitely was not the greatest. The first few episodes was definitely naff. I continued watching because I am a curious person and wanted to see what would happen in the end.The more I watched, the more I got invested into the drama. There was one shocking death where a girl jumps off a building. And by the last two episodes I was so invested in the soap opera story line, I cried.

Can't believe the lack of love for ANC!tl;dr- watch it if yr a fan of shoujo love stories, but with a twist (think psycho pass-esque dark themes littered throughout), watch it if you want to have a good cry, watch it if you are currently bumming around and have nothing to watch...its definitely a 'must watch' on my top 10 list.Story:Maybe I haven't watched enough anime, but I think that this is one of the most heartwrenching shoujo anime out there.

I felt like it needed more episodes to expound on the plot. Hence my rating. Other than that, I love everything about Ceres!This anime was a classic! It's not your normal reverse harem shoujo type themes! It has a darker tone, definitely not for kids below 15. The plot was original and impressive.The characters were all great. I liked that Yuu Watase always make it a point to create her side characters really likable. All the more so, for the main ones.ART...was astonishing, a little old-ish but (personally) it's how I like my anime anyway so it doesn't bother me at all.

Fortunately, only one of those is a mediocre rip off of Yu-Gi-Oh. So, there\'s some hope for this. For the end of horror anime month, let\'s take a look at Ayashi no Ceres.Story:Everything seems to be going right for Mikage Aya. She has a good relationship with her twin, Aki. They\'re about to celebrate their sixteenth birthday. And she just floated to safety after falling from a high place and was caught by a handsome passer-by to boot. Then they...find out that they have to celebrate with their entire family and Aya quickly finds herself marked as a danger to the family and with the personality of her own celestial ancestor, Ceres, inside her body.Let me start by saying, there are some interesting ideas in this. Sure, the whole body swapping thing was also in 3x3 Eyes and it isn\'t the first anime to be about a powerful family turning on one of their own but that doesn\'t mean it can\'t use those ideas very well. And there was a point where I thought it might turn out to be a decent anime, possibly even really good.Unfortunately, the series goes out of its way to drop, weaken or outright destroy every potentially interesting idea it uses with horrendous execution. Tooya\'s back story is absolute rubbish once it gets explained. The whole element of examining the dark side of old fables is destroyed towards the end when the ultimate facts are revealed. Aki\'s struggle against the Progenitor gets dropped until the very end where it suffers a very anti-climactic conclusion. Even a potentially interesting loss gets reversed because the writer doesn\'t have the ovarian fortitude to let tragedy befall the main cast.Everything with the potential to be interesting falling apart isn\'t even the only narrative problem with the series. The romance is absolutely horrendous. It pretty much starts with ""I barely know you but I love you so huggy muggy much."" Moves into ""I love you, but we can\'t be together because plot contrivances are happening."" And just keeps going with more melodramatic nonsense and a complete rubbish dynamic betwixt the leads. The series also suffers from that old syndrome of bad writing, All these characters are morons whenever it suits the plot. The powerful, ""secretive"" Mikage family literally sends attack helicopters after people on crowded roads on more than one occasion. Because nothing helps keep your evil plans secret like a massive public display that anyone within a twenty kilometre radius will notice. There\'s also Aya who quite literally lets herself get captured and nearly has horrible things happen to her multiple times because she can\'t be bothered to let Ceres take over for no adequately explored reason.Characters:At best, the characters in this series are mediocre. And that\'s mostly the Aogiri family characters. Aya is a rubbish heroine. She never moves past the whiny little damsel in distress stage. She makes Fushigi Yuugi\'s Miaka look like a strong independent woman who doesn\'t need any man. Tooya is a boring character with less personality than a bit of lint stuck in your navel. The antagonists are basically just scumbags who do bad things that make very little sense so that they can twirl their imaginary moustaches. Ceres starts out as the most interesting character but a lot of what makes her interesting is the whole element of exploring the dark side of folk tales and she just becomes dull as soon as that element gets dropped.Art:The artwork is mostly fine. The character designs are a bit bland. The action sequences aren\'t very good but they\'re passable. The backgrounds are pretty decent. The animation uses some definite short cuts but it\'s fine.Sound:The acting is sub-par, at best. Remember how in 3x3 Eyes Hayashibara Megumi did the voices for both Pai and Parvati but managed to make them sound distinct and very different? Well, the director for this series clearly didn\'t have that much faith in Aya\'s actress, Kakazu Yumi, since they got a second actress, Iwao Junko, to voice Ceres. I know Kakazu isn\'t a bad actress since she voiced both Yuffie and Aizawa Mint. That being said, I understand that decision when I listen to her acting in this. It\'s a pretty pitiful performance. Very whiny, over the top overly melodramatic during the rubbish purple prose scenes. Whereas Iwao has the strongest performance in the series and even hers is just okay. Definitely not on par with her performances in anime like Perfect Blue or Cardcaptor Sakura. Sakai Ryou\'s music is definitely the best element of the series. It\'s quite good. Well composed, nice to listen to, it would be suitable for the series even if the series had decent execution.Ho-yay:There\'s none to be seen. Which is probably for the best given how bad this series is at romance.Areas of Improvement:1. Know when to commit. One of the huge issues with this series comes down to the simple fact that they back pedal on certain aspects that could have been interesting and just undo them or heavily weaken them to make the story more generic. Which only serves to make it utter tripe.2. Actually develop your romance. This purple prose, melodramatic shite they\'ve got is not a good romance. It\'s not even good enough to be sub-par romance.3. Have your characters do things that make sense. Does it make sense for a powerful, secretive family to try to eliminate certain people it sees as threatening to its power? Sure. Does it make sense for them to use the most bombastic, attention grabbing methods possible to eliminate people? Fuck no. That\'s exceptionally stupid, in fact.Final Thoughts:Ayashi no Ceres is a pretty bad series. It didn\'t have to be. It had good ideas. It had potential. It started out pretty decently. But then you factor in the terrible romance, the crappy characterisation that never improves and to top it all off they toss out everything that could have been compelling and make it all rubbish.

My final rating for Ayashi no Ceres is going to be a 2/10.', 'As requested, story summary is not included.I almost passed this anime up, but decided to preview a few episodes after reading other member reviews.  Okay... I was hooked by the end of the 1st episode.  The whole series is Saturday afternoon matinee adventure good as in never stopped having a good time all the way through to the ending credits.  I kept wanting to watch the next episode right away because there was so much happening and ended up watching the whole series in two days. (You\'ve been warned.)The story is really well told and the characters are wonderfully complex....Seems to move forward at a really fast pace and even what might be predictable just doesn\'t feel that way. Character design is a bit stylized (1990\'s?).  Took a bit of time to get comfortable with that.Konishi Katsuyuki (one of my favorites) is the voice actor for Toya.  Excellent casting.  However, it actually took a while to realize Toya\'s ""voice"" is done by Konishi.  I guess that\'s just indicative of the range available to a really good actor.

It was good but the whole story in general never really made me go ""wow! i love this!"". I thought the art was ok, ive seen better but i have also seen worse.But i will admit that I loved how tooya was always there to protect aya! no matter what, like even at the cost of his life! but i was like no! when i thought he was gona leave aya. over all its a fairly good show :) ', ""Don't go into this show thinking it'll be your typical magical/fantasy Shoujo. Ayashi no Ceres is a dark and often-times terrifying anime with a lot packed into 24 episodes. From start to finish, it's an intense ride.1. The StoryThe titular character, Ceres, is from the legend of a celestial being who descends onto Earth and has her celestial robe stolen by a human man when she's taking a bath. The man forces her to become his wife, hiding the robe from her, until many years later she retrieves it and is able to return to the heavens. Her story is based off a fairy tale,...and personally I found this the most original thing about Ayashi no Ceres - the marriage of the fantastical with hard reality and science. If you ever wondered what modern man would do with an angel if they ever found one, this show attempts to answer just that. Another interesting feature in the story is how everything is given an explanation - granted the science of it probably isn't very accurate, but even Ceres herself is (sort of) made sense of.The anime is very plot-heavy - almost from the get-go you're tossed into its story, which just continues to build tension up until the very end. There's lots of drama, action, tragedy and horror - definitely nothing you'd expect from your usual Shoujo. But there are enough light-hearted and funny scenes in the earlier half to balance all the darkness.Ayashi no Ceres is also incredibly gory and violent - the show doesn't shy away from gruesome deaths or killing off characters in horrendous ways. And that's what I like about it - the anime is bold and uncompromising, especially given its target audience of adolescent girls. Other mature themes include attempted rape, incest, abuse and psychological trauma, to name a few. But nothing feels forced, it all fits in to the context of the story or characters, so the show doesn't delve into such things just for the sake of being 'edgy'.That being said, you do get a heavy dose of the usual cliches like amnesia, false memories, coming back from the dead, the miracle-worker Q-san and a plot-device in the form of Mana. But given how such an intricate story concludes within 24 episodes, there are fewer holes in the plot than would be expected, and the tropes can be forgiven - most of the times.- - -2. The CharactersThe main protagonist is a regular 16-year-old girl named Aya, who by virtue of her bloodline is suddenly thrown into a series of horrible events that really make you feel for her, even if her character comes off a little poorly constructed at times. She's joined by a host of others, all different enough in their own ways to bring something new to the table.The show focuses more on the story than it does on character development - few of them get any real growth, which is a shame considering the drastic events they have to go through. But they all have enough backstory to keep them interesting and relatable.The show is also pretty kind to one of the main antagonists, Kagami - we're given enough insight into his past and thought-process to understand why he is the way he is. Sadly the same can't be said for the main baddy (not gonna spoil anything here), who really needed a more valid excuse for himself.Without giving too much away, the most intriguing character was definitely Ceres herself. Is she good? Is she evil? Is she justified in her actions? The show tosses a lot of the characters at you and leaves you to pass your own judgement - with the exception of Aya, who you're supposed to root for throughout.- - -3. The PairingsWhile the pairing isn't _the_ main focus of the anime, it's definitely a large part of it. Again it's a little disheartening that the show had to resort to shoving in a love triangle, but with that ignored, the main pairing is nicely done. It's paced out pretty well throughout the show, and Aya is refreshingly honest with her feelings and decisions. She doesn't dilly-dally like most Shoujo heroines and is proactive in her love life at least (if not in much else), which is such a breath of fresh air.Considering how much the characters have to put up with, the romance is believable and sometimes the only ray of hope against the depressing backdrop. I personally liked it, even if it wasn't anything to write home about.- - -4. Art & MusicAlthough the drawing style - especially for the characters - may come off a bit outdated for modern-day viewers, the show does a brilliant job of creating atmosphere through the background designs.  For instance, scenes take on vulgar, disturbing reddish hues when you know something bad is about to go down, and really help make the moment more dramatic. In contrast, the more tender scenes are accompanied by music pieces that really fit the mood.Scenes that are meant to be scary really come off so, and the show doesn't shy away from being grotesque at times. So despite being over a decade old, Ayashi no Ceres holds itself up well. Not a pinnacle of animation, but decent enough to get you through it, and sometimes good enough to leave an impression.- - -In conclusion, it's worth watching if you're looking for something out-of-the-ordinary, especially in terms of Shoujo anime. The story keeps you on the edge of your seat, with enough twists and turns to keep the viewer's attention. It's an unforgiving story - bad things happen to good people - but that's also part of its charm. Ayashi no Ceres is a rare gem that doesn't set out to please anyone, but to tell a story - and what a great story it is! I thoroughly enjoyed it, and would definitely recommend it. And since everything concludes within the span of 24 episodes, it's not like you've lost a lot by watching it.It's graphic, disturbing, unforgettable and the ending isn't a particularly happy one, but then why should it be? Watch Ayashi no Ceres if you want a show with a story the creator was really passionate about - otherwise, I dunno, stick to those shows about cute girls doing cute things. and personally I found this the most original thing about Ayashi no Ceres - the marriage of the fantastical with hard reality and science.

In the end I was a bit disappointed. I do like the voice acting, and the overall feel of it. The anime captures the melancholy vibe, but every once in awhile brightening it up with some humor.The love story between the lead characters is very underwhelming. Their relationship and backstory is more fleshed out in the manga, so I had the context in which to enjoy the relationship, but for those that haven't read the manga it'll be really difficult to grasp why...Touya and Aya fall in love so quickly.This is a show that I think could benefit from a reboot, because the graphics are really dated, and the heart pumping action that came across in the manga was poorly showcased in the outdated animation.Still the story is interesting, and I wasn't bored watching it so that's a plus.

On their 16th birthday they are called to the family home to be given a special gift. Instead they find themselves the victims of an ancient family ritual. Aya is proven to be the reincarnation of a celestial maiden called Ceres, the tennyo. And Aki gains the ability to manifest as ""Shiso Mikagi"", the ancestor of the Mikage family who stole Ceres\' celestial robe, without it she cannot return to heaven.My thoughts:This anime has everything. Action, love, romance, paranormal... I really enjoyed it....Aya is a strong character that will do anything to right the past wrongs her family has done. Aki at first is gentle and caring, but once host to Shiso, his attitude and demeanor changes drastically to one of violence and hate. Ayashi no Ceres is a story that encompasses a host of emotions that leaves the viewer with a sense of satisfaction. I recommend this anime.

Denki-gai no Honya-san,https://myanimelist.net/anime/24031/Denki-gai_no_Honya-san,"[""Welcome to Umanohone bookstore, one of the bookstores across Japan that sells manga, light novels, and doujins - even the dirty ones. The bookstore has an interesting workplace with a variety of characters that you won't feel dull encountering at. Denkigai no Honya-san is one of the few slice of life anime this season, and as the first few anime starting this season, it shouldn't be ignored nor forgotten.The story is simple - just characters interacting together and partaking activities in and out of the bookstores. Nothing much can be detailed further. But what I can say is that the comedy is great. Certain tropes...and same jokes may have fallen but it's great that it has sustained well from episode to episode. There are plenty hilarious moments from the characters which may be memorable for a while, and these show what's true in their character. What is not expected in the anime is the romance. Halfway through it, I can spot a few relationships between the characters. While they are not very developed as the story progresses, it is sweet to see how two people in one relationship interact. Of course, you may feel tired seeing similar interactions, but like I said, it really didn't develop much.But both comedy and romance in the anime are balanced well, and nothing had overshot to break the story and hence it becoming worse.The anime uses a number of references from manga, light novels and anime. I wouldn't have spotted all of them since a lot of references are not very similar to the real counterpart. A few of them do give away, try your best. The fanservice doesn't really exceed to become an ecchi anime, but there are still some of it throughout. Some may say they are definitely not needed, but looking at the context, I think a bit of them is enough.Each character in the anime is special. It might have been a typical cast of slice of life characters, but in this anime, they have a nice range of emotions and thoughts. They are likeable and funny, depending on how they act. Development-wise, not really much for a slice of life anime. But looking at how the characters feel in their relationships, I think they are trying hard to be normal, since he first steps of romance can be hard and shaky. Also, looking at Umio, as the most recent hired employee of the bookstore, he adapts well with his co-workers and that's great!It's also great that the cast is small and it didn't introduce a ton of characters. There are a lot of anime with has a huge cast and it's really hard to keep track of all of them. But in this anime, even with a small cast, there are a lot happening in the story.The anime's art is simple but not very dull. I like the colour palette to pull of a bright cheery feel. The scenery, both interior and exterior, look good, enough for a slice of life anime. I like the character designs as the characters look cute in them. The facial expressions are funny and adorable. Not much noticeable visual effects but overall, I think the atmosphere is fresh and sometimes lively, depending on the story.I really don't know how the opening relates to the anime. Sang by one of the voice actresses in the anime, Taketatsu Ayana, its theme is about apples. It doesn't really match the context of the anime, although the animation of it does. Ignoring that fact, I think it's sweet and lovely. Who knows, I think it's a perfect Spice and Wolf S3 opening. The ending song, sang by four voice actresses of their counterpart working in the bookstore, is more cheery and catchy to hear. The background music doesn't really stand out a lot but they are nice and chilling to listen to. The voice acting is great as the voice actors tried their best in acting out the emotions of the characters. Most of them aren't relatively new to the voice acting industry, so there shouldn't be any screw-ups.I read some chapters of the manga before watching the anime and I love how the anime adapts almost all of the manga used. Maybe the last episode may have been an original, and trust me, that was an awesome episode to end off the anime. Back to point, I think that the director did a good job in using most of the source material and added a few originals in.Overall, the anime is fun to watch. It doesn't lack anything much, so it shouldn't disappoint you. If you need some laughs now, it is a good time to watch it. I don't mind a second season and I don't know if there will ever be, but for now continue reading the manga. and same jokes may have fallen but it's great that it has sustained well from episode to episode.

Also, because it is my first time writing something like this, minor spoilers and misjudgments are expected.I will begin by stating how I quite enjoyed Denki-Gai no Honya-san. After getting to know about the show and reading a bit about it, I sincerely did not expect much from Denki-Gai. As time went by and episodes kept airing, I began to like it more and more and ended up being a good, short one season...anime.Story - 6I believe that the story of Denki-Gai was quite simple. Definitely not the strong point of the show. Although that doesn\'t mean it was bad.What I took from every week\'s episode was that the story was about the people who worked at the bookstore, how the bookstore itself worked and it gave me a bit of information about the manga industry in Japan. More specifically, about ""doujinshi"", a word I heard a couple of times but had no idea what it actually meant.There were also references to other anime which were quite smart and amusing, but the one which takes the cake, in my opinion, (SPOILER ALERT) is the one in the last episode, in which the characters cosplayed other characters from different shows voiced by the same seiyu. It\'s a shame that I only recognised the simplest one, Kantoku as Kirito from SAO (Matsuoka Yoshitsugu).Art/Animation - 6To clarify things, I did not found the animation bad. It was not that good, but in hindsight, I felt that it was appropriate to the anime.I won\'t say/write anything else about it, because I have very few knowledge about anime animation.Sound - 7I found the OP and the ED songs enjoyable and quite cheerful. Other than that there was nothing about sound that stood out for me, except for, the (SPOILER ALERT) ""Boys don\'t hate underwear"" voice.Characters - 8With Denki-Gai no Honya-san you don\'t get a lot of characters overall. What you do get are quite a few characters very relevant (Hio-tan, Umio, Sensei, Kantoku, Fu Girl, Kameko and Sommelier), two not so relevant, which still matter (G-Men and Tsumorin) and finally the rest, which I feel that are only there to make the store look legitimate and provide some extra laughs, for example, the manager.My opinion is that the character development is acceptable. You get to know more about the characters\' past and you see, in some, them changing a little bit gradually.I would just like to add that I kept thinking that Umio was being ignored midway and at the end of the anime, but with the last episode, that ""issue"" was fixed. Also the seiyu for Sommelier should receive an award for best seiyu of 2014 because those lines were just class. XDEnjoyment - 9This is where, in my opinion, the show shined. It was so entertaining, I started laughing in the beginning and would only stop after the episode ended.Needless to say that was always happy to know it was Thursday and I would be able to see a new episode of Denki-Gai.All in all, for me, this show was comedic gold. No matter how I was feeling before watching an episode, I always felt much better after watching it. The anime certainly gave me a lot of smiles while it was airing.I apologise if the review/commentary is a bit long so...tl;dr: Great comedy and characters, short and enjoyable anime;  Tomita Takahiro best seiyu 2014 AHAHA. anime.Story - 6I believe that the story of Denki-Gai was quite simple.

A hobby or talent that brings one more joy than anything else. We understand this easily. For us, anime is one of our passions. Talking about a compelling story, comparing favorite characters, and listening to opening and ending music tracks are just some of the many varying attributes that anime entails.And through anime, through our passion, we are able to converse and connect with others. This situation pops up with all groups, not just in anime. Take the world of manga. For Denki-gai no Honya-san, manga is the passion and...the setting, but little is found beyond the panels.STORYDenki-gai follows the lives of the crew working at Umanohone, a local manga store. Umio, Sensei, Kantoku, Hio, Fu Girl, and Kameko deal with everyday life while attempting to juggle work and relationships.This anime is first and foremost a comedy. The situations involved are often silly in nature, with the characters usually taking part in gag-like humor. Sticking to its ""seinen"" roots, the jokes are usually sexual or more adult-oriented. Despite where it all takes place, the comedic moments require the viewer to be a bit older to understand let alone appreciate the funny events for what they are.But already two problems arise, one small and one big. Starting with the smaller, the anime attempts to incorporate romantic developments between the characters. That is, instead of focusing solely on the humor, it shifts its attention at times to romance. Not only are these elements unsatisfactory and largely unexplored, but their inclusion deters from the comedy that is at the show\'s core. Moving to tackle this issue, the anime tries to then use the romance as a stepping stone for the comedy. But it doesn\'t work because the feelings and emotions between the characters feel weak and unwarranted. In other words, it tries and fails to be a romantic-comedy.The bigger of the two problems is located within the comedy itself: repetition. What\'s strange is that Denki-gai actually contains some rather unique jokes or funny dialogue during certain moments. But in-between these exist the same exact set-ups time and again.Examples include Sensei\'s ""girl power,"" Fu Girl\'s zombie hatred, and Umio\'s obsession with Tsumori. Repetition isn\'t necessarily a bad thing; characters can have hilarious shticks that can see quite the degree of variation. Denki-gai, sadly, doesn\'t do this. A clever joke involving Sommelier\'s talent in the past or an ""inspiring"" speech by Kantoku is drowned out by the use of the previously mentioned, already-used jokes. In conjunction with the poorly executed romantic elements, much of the comedy that the show aims at presenting is ultimately lost.Beyond the comedy, romance, and repetition, Denki-gai gives us at least one life lesson. Whether you are having fun with your friends, staying up late to finish some work, or pining after the one you love, at the end of the day, life is what you make of it. The events you experience are shaped by you and those around you, and they become everlasting memories. Even when tomorrow becomes ""work per usual,"" as long as you had fun in the moment, its impression will last a lifetime.ANIMATIONDenki-gai offers a mixed bag when it comes to the art and the animation.The art style feels both unique and generic at the same time. The locations are often typical (work place, someone\'s home, in the city), but it all feels devoid of detail. The character designs, on the other hand, hold a different vibe. Fu Girl\'s sharp upper teeth, Kameko\'s afro, and Hio\'s sparkling eyes are simple examples that show off how different they tend to be when compared to other shows. Also of note are their general body heights. They all (minus Sommelier) appear quite short, but they are in fact older than at first perceived.The animation within Denki-gai errs on the side of caution. It contains some rather well done moments with a good amount of character action, typically thanks to them exploding the situations. However, during its downtime, there isn\'t as much extravagance to be had.CHARACTERSThe characters of Denki-gai play their parts, generating an overall nice cast.There really isn\'t a main character within the anime. If anyone gets the title, it falls on Umio. As ""otaku"" as they come, his initial reason for working is to be close to the subject he loves most. Helpful towards his friends and understanding of the situations they find themselves in, he more often than not experiences more trouble than the majority of the cast. He\'s your typical, everyday enthusiast, ""one of us,"" if you will.Having a strange nickname, Sensei is an aspiring ""mangaka"" to be. Her low girl-power, low self-esteem, and low tolerance for difficulties may make her out to be a rather annoying person to deal with. But behind these layers of low lie a much more refined young woman. She constantly seeks to better herself, be it with her drawings or in the art of love. At the same time, she is no stranger to accepting aid, giving the audience the opportunity to contemplate such actions. That is to say, everyone can always use a little help.Hio is known for her general clumsiness and large bust. While quiet, she is prone to outbursts, especially when dealing with Kantoku. Among the whole cast, she is often the most at odds with the feelings she maintains. It\'s difficult for her to properly express herself because she cannot seem to comprehend the idea of the person she loves feeling the same way towards her. Complex emotions are generally hard to articulate, and she serves as a nice example.As a gentle giant, Sommelier is the watchful guardian. Silent at all times, with eyes almost never noticeable, he seemingly has a sixth sense when it comes to people\'s tastes. Even from a young age, his heart has always been in the right place. For him, his motto is ""actions speak louder than words.""Fu Girl has a strange name and an even stranger personality. Reserved in all things but the zombie apocalypse, she\'s a kind young girl looking to have the one person she holds most dear look at (and consequently, down!) at her. Part of what makes her special is how out of place she seems, even among everyone working at Umanohone.

While the characters represent more than their outward appearances may show, the story and animation elements just don\'t reach the same level. The workplace can be quite the hilarious topic, but Denk-gai no Honya-san couldn\'t capture this feeling.SUMMARYStory: Bad, ""adult"" comedy lost among misplaced romance and misused repetitionAnimation: Fine, art style, character designs, and animation are each averageCharacters: Good, Umio, Sensei, and the rest personify more than just their quirksSound: Fine, bad OP, okay ED, okay soundtrack, average VA workEnjoyment: Bad, laughs are few and far between with unsatisfying romancesFinal Score: 4/10 the setting, but little is found beyond the panels.STORYDenki-gai follows the lives of the crew working at Umanohone, a local manga store. Umio, Sensei, Kantoku, Hio, Fu Girl, and Kameko deal with everyday life while attempting to juggle work and relationships.This anime is first and foremost a comedy. The situations involved are often silly in nature, with the characters usually taking part in gag-like humor. Sticking to its ""seinen"" roots, the jokes are usually sexual or more adult-oriented. Despite where it all takes place, the comedic moments require the viewer to be a bit older to understand let alone appreciate the funny events for what they are.But already two problems arise, one small and one big. Starting with the smaller, the anime attempts to incorporate romantic developments between the characters. That is, instead of focusing solely on the humor, it shifts its attention at times to romance. Not only are these elements unsatisfactory and largely unexplored, but their inclusion deters from the comedy that is at the show\'s core. Moving to tackle this issue, the anime tries to then use the romance as a stepping stone for the comedy. But it doesn\'t work because the feelings and emotions between the characters feel weak and unwarranted. In other words, it tries and fails to be a romantic-comedy.The bigger of the two problems is located within the comedy itself: repetition. What\'s strange is that Denki-gai actually contains some rather unique jokes or funny dialogue during certain moments. But in-between these exist the same exact set-ups time and again.Examples include Sensei\'s ""girl power,"" Fu Girl\'s zombie hatred, and Umio\'s obsession with Tsumori. Repetition isn\'t necessarily a bad thing; characters can have hilarious shticks that can see quite the degree of variation. Denki-gai, sadly, doesn\'t do this. A clever joke involving Sommelier\'s talent in the past or an ""inspiring"" speech by Kantoku is drowned out by the use of the previously mentioned, already-used jokes. In conjunction with the poorly executed romantic elements, much of the comedy that the show aims at presenting is ultimately lost.Beyond the comedy, romance, and repetition, Denki-gai gives us at least one life lesson. Whether you are having fun with your friends, staying up late to finish some work, or pining after the one you love, at the end of the day, life is what you make of it. The events you experience are shaped by you and those around you, and they become everlasting memories. Even when tomorrow becomes ""work per usual,"" as long as you had fun in the moment, its impression will last a lifetime.ANIMATIONDenki-gai offers a mixed bag when it comes to the art and the animation.The art style feels both unique and generic at the same time. The locations are often typical (work place, someone\'s home, in the city), but it all feels devoid of detail. The character designs, on the other hand, hold a different vibe. Fu Girl\'s sharp upper teeth, Kameko\'s afro, and Hio\'s sparkling eyes are simple examples that show off how different they tend to be when compared to other shows. Also of note are their general body heights. They all (minus Sommelier) appear quite short, but they are in fact older than at first perceived.The animation within Denki-gai errs on the side of caution. It contains some rather well done moments with a good amount of character action, typically thanks to them exploding the situations. However, during its downtime, there isn\'t as much extravagance to be had.CHARACTERSThe characters of Denki-gai play their parts, generating an overall nice cast.There really isn\'t a main character within the anime. If anyone gets the title, it falls on Umio. As ""otaku"" as they come, his initial reason for working is to be close to the subject he loves most. Helpful towards his friends and understanding of the situations they find themselves in, he more often than not experiences more trouble than the majority of the cast. He\'s your typical, everyday enthusiast, ""one of us,"" if you will.Having a strange nickname, Sensei is an aspiring ""mangaka"" to be. Her low girl-power, low self-esteem, and low tolerance for difficulties may make her out to be a rather annoying person to deal with. But behind these layers of low lie a much more refined young woman. She constantly seeks to better herself, be it with her drawings or in the art of love. At the same time, she is no stranger to accepting aid, giving the audience the opportunity to contemplate such actions. That is to say, everyone can always use a little help.Hio is known for her general clumsiness and large bust. While quiet, she is prone to outbursts, especially when dealing with Kantoku. Among the whole cast, she is often the most at odds with the feelings she maintains. It\'s difficult for her to properly express herself because she cannot seem to comprehend the idea of the person she loves feeling the same way towards her. Complex emotions are generally hard to articulate, and she serves as a nice example.As a gentle giant, Sommelier is the watchful guardian. Silent at all times, with eyes almost never noticeable, he seemingly has a sixth sense when it comes to people\'s tastes. Even from a young age, his heart has always been in the right place. For him, his motto is ""actions speak louder than words.""Fu Girl has a strange name and an even stranger personality. Reserved in all things but the zombie apocalypse, she\'s a kind young girl looking to have the one person she holds most dear look at (and consequently, down!) at her. Part of what makes her special is how out of place she seems, even among everyone working at Umanohone. Her actions are usually either non-existent or extreme in nature, lending credit to the argument that everybody is different.Last, and indeed perhaps least, is Kameko. Placed on the sidelines for nearly the entire season, she is quite dishonest with herself. She prefers peering at the world through a camera lens as opposed to with her own eyes, giving her the chance to capture those all-important memories. In a way, she acts as the audience member; never contributing much to the on-screen antics, and merely along for the ride.SOUNDThe best part of the OP comes in the beginning.

Keep them too broad and you’re bound to, eventually, be met with disappointment, but we still need them to prepare ourselves whenever we began experiencing a work from the media we love. When I first began watching Denki-gai no Honya-san, I had just come out of watching the first two seasons of “Working!!”, which remains one of my all-time favorite anime, so I wanted to experience another slice-of-life focused on the day-to-day of people at work. Being the workplace in question a manga store and the people in question passionate Otaku, people like me, I was in for a treat....It just wasn’t the treat I was expecting.Story and CharactersCredit where credit is due, the show actually makes a nice move by utilizing two distinct characters in order to develop the setting: Umio, a very passionate otaku with no restraint to displaying his affection for the hobby, is the new employee, which gives the anime the proper excuse to explain the situation of the cast; Hiotan, in the other hand, is the one character who has no experience with the one true religion of Otakudom, so it’s in relation to her that the show gets to comment about anime, manga and other aspects of otaku culture. Not a bad setup, now allow me to explain why it fails: remember how Genshiken, for example, actually spent the first episode giving away the characters main traits and easing the protagonists in to then begin developing the conflict? Denki-gai is not very good on that. At all. Right off the bat it’s easy to see that the series is more worried about setting the scenario than the characters, which is ironic since once the conflicts begin, this setting seems more like a backdrop to bring the cast together than something actually meaningful to the plot.The running motif of the story here are the different couples who form amidst the various gags, so before progressing, let’s do the presentations:Sensei is an aspiring manga artist and the only one to seems to have what is immediately recognizable as an actual character trait, rather than a simple quirk, that of being slovenly and easily stressed. As early as the first episode, she and Umio start developing romantic feelings for each other, although it displays the most barebones chemistry possible: nice guy helps desperate girl. I realize this might sound hypocritical, given some of my favorites, so I’ll address it properly in a moment. A running gag involving Sensei is her lack of “Girl Power”, and that happens to be one that eats away a lot of her “development”, since frequently all of the traits the show applies to her end up invariably playing to this same gag.Next is the growing bond between Hiotan, whose quirk seems to be excessive and trivial panicking, and Kantoku (director in Japanese), nicknamed this way because he apparently likes to film his employees in awkward moments. Truth be told, Kantoku seems to be the only one with the semblance of a diverse personality: he’s a pranker, but not a mean spirited one, which doesn’t clash with his behavior when he needs to act as a leader or be responsible with his employees. The way the romance between this couple springs into existence, though, is piss-poor: at one point in the story, Hiotan clings to Kantoku, initially for comedic purposes, and then begins to take his kind acts, in contrast to his usual behavior, as the result of romantic feelings, up until the show decides to treat their clichéd, innocuous and barely eventful interactions as the marks of a “soon to be”, “maybe someday” couple. Please, craft bigger quotation marks in your mind, these ones are not enough.One relationship that seems to be already going on is the one about the backfired moe bullet Fu-girl, who is obsessed with anything related to zombies and has a mad crush on Sommelier, a tall and silent man who acquired the nickname by doing manga recommendations to the clients. It’s obvious that the feelings here are mutual, but none of them really progress in their efforts because both don’t know how to properly communicate that. As I write this I noticed that none of my notes over the series actually addressed their relationship, and that is because, frankly, all that can be said I just summarized right above. The two are easily the most vapid creatures in the whole anime and their interaction is a very clear example of the general problems plaguing the show.Couples out of the way, now we can get to the lone candleholders on the block: firstly, Kameko is a girl who enjoys taking pictures with her camera (get it? CAMEra, Ko = child, get it?), who is revealed later on to have a crush on Kantoku, but got left behind for trying to keep low profile for too long. Why should the audience be invested in the late-to-show-up emotional grievance of the second most insipid block of ink in the show is not properly conveyed, but hey, at least she’s not Fu-girl, whose brick-like presence and complete lack of meaningful personality drags the scene down from painfully average to just painful. Did I come off as bitter? Anyway, next in line is Tsumorin, a former employee at the shop and now a cosplay celebrity/ doujinshi author who ALSO had a crush on Kantoku. Is there any kind of projection going on here? I hope you like attempts of empathy for a character that has barely been established and offers no reason for the audience to care about, cuz this show sure is going to try! Possibly the only real reason she exists in the story is to make the idea of a romance between Hiotan and Kantoku a little more credible.Ok, let’s dial back a bit and address the issue of Umio and Sensei, Some might find a bit hypocritical of me to criticize their dynamic, since some of my favorites (Toradora!, Working!!) have similar ones going on between their main characters. The point of my criticism, though, is not the set up itself, but the way it’s handled, which is why I don’t think it displays good chemistry between the two, so please hold on while I attempt to expose my perspective. Building good chemistry between love interests in a story involves crafting this idea that both play off of each other’s personalities and visibly add something to the other part. That can’t work properly if it happens to be a one-way street, as it is here: Umio acts kindly, helping Sensei with her manga, she pretends to bring out some semblance of confidence, backpedals and the situation devolves into a gag. Being fair, as a plot point, the relationship between Umio and Sensei actually does something to Umio’s character, by portraying him as a very supportive person, even if in a simplistic way. That, however, never goes beyond the “nice guy/awkward girl” archetypes they are set into and the show doesn’t properly convey how they could really work as a couple. Truth be told, the notion that they are meant to be in a romance is kept simply by the shackles of the genre, which we’re all knowledgeable of already, and by how heavy-handed the anime is about it.You might have guessed already what the main problem here is: the underdeveloped cast. At the top of the characterization pyramid is Kantoku, but even then he only reaches the Decent mark, while the rest of the crew is stuck between completely vacuous outside of a simple quirk, or one-dimensional. You may argue that the way they act within the jokes lay out more details in a subtle manner, but I think the point of having effectively subtle characterization is by getting the various traits about a character to connect in the big picture (personality), so when these traits fail to connect in a cohesive manner is that the attempts of characterization become meaningless. The point I’m trying to get with this diatribe is that the characterization in Denki-gai is disjointed and the show’s attempts at it end up creating a shallow picture instead. To make matters worse, the romantic progression is close to nonexistent. Romances get introduced, for sure, but no proper confessions are made and whenever any kind of development (or at least what the anime passes for it) is attempted, the show seems to take a step further, just to step back and shove its head in the ground, dreadfully afraid of making the status quo any less stale.As expected, these problems spread over to the humor too. Now, I have no issue whatsoever with establishing comedy based on character quirks; “Working!!” has about 80% of its comedy crafted in the same principle, Tanaka-kun wa Itsumo Kedaruge drives this home in every chance it can get away with (which is every time) and I have no complaints with the way these shows do it. The matter of the issue here, besides the lack of additional layers to the characters to help endear them to the audience and make their reactions comically effective, is the application. In both of the shows mentioned, the quirk in which the jokes were based on was a constant, but the punchline was handled with a twist in every opportunity, either a difference in timing or the situation in which it was applied, while the same doesn’t come out much in Denki-gai, and knowing each character’s main trait makes the joke quite predictable already. This anime tried a lot, in many forms of humor, but none of them displayed the cleverness of writing required to actually pull it off and set the timing to the appropriate moments.PresentationThis is not turning out pretty. At least the presentation section comes out shorter than the Story one in my reviews.So, how else does this anime drops the ball? Well, we have the character designs, for once. It’s not that uncommon for different characters to have similar faces in the same anime, but it’s uncanny how the models in Denki-gai seem to have identical facial structures, with only hair and accessories used to differentiate them. Add to that a sickeningly excessive use of blushing and I wouldn’t exactly call this an example of variety in visual presentation. I’m not kidding when I say that with a third of the show left to watch I was having pavlovian style reactions of disgust every time I saw someone’s face go red, Fu-girl herself I couldn’t even look at because of how much her character became an eyesore with her face that screamed “I’m about to start crying desperately” in every frame.When it comes to the voice acting, the show is surprisingly tame for a gag manga, although this might also be an effect of how stretched out are the skits, and the acting doesn’t reach very emphatic degrees for the genre. To be fair, this particular approach might resonate better to the comedic preferences of other viewers than they resonate with mine, so it isn’t really a point I can use to detract from the anime. That same trait also spills over to moments that are more dedicated to “characterization, although perhaps with the exception of Matsuoka Yoshitsugu as Kantoku, and thank goodness for at least his presence in this anime. Fun fact: Hiotan shares the same seiyuu, Takamori Natsumi, as Miyano, from Tanaka-kun. She doesn’t have the friendly demeanor or the dedicated personality Miyano displays, though.Personal RamblingsJust comes to show how connecting to the work in the first place helps a lot when you watch it, it’s a lot harder to find enjoyment when the first episodes failed so hard to get you involved. Sometimes I wonder how much more I’d speak highly or poorly of any work if it managed to be something I had special attachment to, or no attachment at all. Were my disposition towards a show like Steins;Gate, for example, superior to indifferent, would I be among the people shouting endless praise to it and stamping a 10/10 in my review? There were some instances, sadly not many, of my re-watch of Denki-gai when I looked at what had just played out in a scene and thought to myself “This normally would be something I’d laugh at, if my disposition weren’t so low”.That doesn’t mean I don’t stand by everything I said here or in my other analysis, but it really makes me ponder how much our initial attachment or to a work can makes us more prone to catching up faster to the qualities or shortcomings it might exhibit. Tell me if you never thought about it: watching a show you already like in the first episodes makes you see more than other viewers do when getting to specific moments that might come off as meaningless to others, while if you dislike the show from the beginning the multiple little grievances stack up to form a larger problem, making the whole picture seem uglier, to the point where its qualities end up becoming mute.I didn’t expect to turn out this bitter when I first decided to write this, but among my set of opinions that have changed over the years, this one didn’t turn up for the better. It just wasn’t the treat I was expecting.Story and CharactersCredit where credit is due, the show actually makes a nice move by utilizing two distinct characters in order to develop the setting: Umio, a very passionate otaku with no restraint to displaying his affection for the hobby, is the new employee, which gives the anime the proper excuse to explain the situation of the cast; Hiotan, in the other hand, is the one character who has no experience with the one true religion of Otakudom, so it’s in relation to her that the show gets to comment about anime, manga and other aspects of otaku culture.

Tell me if you never thought about it: watching a show you already like in the first episodes makes you see more than other viewers do when getting to specific moments that might come off as meaningless to others, while if you dislike the show from the beginning the multiple little grievances stack up to form a larger problem, making the whole picture seem uglier, to the point where its qualities end up becoming mute.I didn’t expect to turn out this bitter when I first decided to write this, but among my set of opinions that have changed over the years, this one didn’t turn up for the better.', 'Well, after a long absences, I\'m back (no thanks to that S.O.B K***h) to make my review , so I\'m not gonna go around the bush and just present my review as simple as it is, btw, my review is only for this anime, it ain\'t perfect but its my review. So let\'s get down to business:Story: Poor 3.Because, there isn\'t any, there is no plot, just the characters and the setting. It isn\'t unusual for an anime with a comedy/ Slice of life genre in it, Let\'s face it, this anime is a gag anime so a plot has no place in it.Art:...Fair 6.Ok, so Sensei\'s wardrobe makes her look like a grandma than a 20 something character, but then gain I can forgive it, hummmmm maybe just a little. But you know, the way the characters where illustrated does have some cute side of it, but only just a little. Now I do have some issues with the way Fu Girls was illustrated as a teenager in a 8 year old body and Sommelier who would pass as a criminal. there is also Kameko\'s 60\'s floppy hat that doesn\'t seem to suit her. Then again I did mention about the illustrations cute side which is why I gave it such score.Sound: Good 7.Forget about the op and the ed, I just love the seiyuus who did the voices of the female characters, most specially Hio-tan\'s voice, but I was unforunate that we never hear Sommelier speak, if he was to have no speaking lines then why did studio ""Pony Canyon"" have to get the services of Tomita, Takahiro, when all that the character does was to hum? Well, I guess only the creator, Mizu, Asato knows.Character: Good 7.All I can say it that the characters really did entertained me and I\'m sorry if I have nothing much to say.Enjoyment: Very Good 8.For a plotless anime this funny, was enjoyable, though some gags maybe cheesy, then again it\'s forgivable, since that what original creator Mizu, Asato intended to be.Overall: Good 7.I gave it such score, since it is good, there where situations that present some annoyance, like the way Sensei does her everyday things in certain episodes, where it kinda gross me out, now I can\'t spoil it, you\'re just gonna have to watch it. All I can say is that it maybe good but there few stuffs that may wanna make you puke.

Among the cast is Umio, newest employee at Uma no Hone, Sensei, a mangaka by the name of ""Jona Taro"", ""Director"", acting leader apart from the manager, Hio-tan, a newbie to the manga world, Sommelier, a quiet guy whose face is never seen, Fu Girl, the zombie lover, and Kameko, the camera shy photographer. This anime is pretty basic -- it\'s about the workers at...the shop, and their interactions with each other all orbiting the manga world.While it didn\'t have much of a story, Denki-gai was the perfect light hearted comedy to watch. Each episode covered a different experience, with different characters. I was glad to see that the anime focused on all the main characters instead of just following one and their interactions with the whole group. Each episode had to have at least one inappropriate happenstance, whether it was a ramble about the panty shot, a speech about boobs, or a talk about girl power. Each inappropriate aspect of the anime was approached so uniquely, that it turned out comedic, and fun to watch. It was a pleasant surprise that this anime also includes budding romances between characters. It\'s really a sweet sight to witness.Asato Mizu\'s, the author of Denki-gai, art style is pretty simple, but exceedingly cute. Each character, while you can tell they\'re from the same anime, has its own unique look, and Mizu displays her artistic prowess quite nicely throughout the animation. There wasn\'t a single episode that seemed kind of off in someway, nor were there any awkward transition, to my knowledge. The backgrounds were fully developed, and the art style helped give this anime its light-hearted feel.The music fit perfectly with every action scene. The opening and ending songs are very catchy, and by the twelfth episode, I was humming along to both of them. What bothers me is, why is the opening all about an apple?! The lyrics are about an apple, the animation\'s about an apple -- it leaves me very confused. This anime isn\'t even about and apple, and the place they work at is called AmaUsa....Bunnies plus apples equal confusion.Each character is well-developed, and each gets their well-deserved screen time. Umio, being the newest employee doesn\'t have a nickname yet, but he\'s a hard worker, has some talent in drawing, and is an anime nerd to the bone. Sensei is a capable girl, and very good mangaka, but lacks ""girl power."" ""Director"" is a pervert. But an attractive pervert when drawn right. Hio-tan is the least ""cultured"" of the group, not very well-versed in anime culture. She\'s the girliest, and is very clumsy, often resulting in accidents of some sort. Sommelier is a big, quiet guy with an immense knowledge of anime, manga, and the like. He has a deep fondness for cats, and his face is hardly seen. Fu Girl is, surprisingly, a high schooler with a love for zombies. She\'s the loli, but very cute, even with her zombie quirk. Kameko is the supporting loli, with exploding curly hair that she tries to hide with her hat. She takes photos of the group, and doesn\'t interact very much, preferring to stay on the sidelines. Every character is so diverse from the other, it\'s refreshing. None is developed too much over the other, and they all make the anime seem balanced.I rather enjoyed watching this anime. It was produced very well, and kept my attention for all twelve episodes it showed for. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to take a break from animes with storylines, and just needs a good laugh. This anime is hilarious, and had me holding my sides at a point.-Story - 7Not much of a story, but the characters are developed, each gets an appropriate amount of focus, each episode is funny, relationships develop, and it\'s good for a laugh.Art - 7The artwork is simple, but cute. Offers a lighthearted atmosphere.Music - 7Sweet OSTs that match the anime\'s mood, catchy OP and ED. I\'m just SO CONFUSED by that apple in the OP, though.Character - 9Beautiful character development. Each gets perfect amount of screen time. None majorly more developed that the other. Interesting characters, all differing in personality.Enjoyment - 9Great for a good laugh. Nice, easy going pace. Kept my attention the entire time.Overall - 7.8Overall, this anime was very enjoyable. It was nice to take a break from all the serious plots this season.

It is almost nostalgic to watch, as the different weekly goings-on in the show are reminiscent of various cartoons one might watch, though of course with a lot more seinen added in.Most of these episodes are a bit cliche in nature, which...brings the experience down a notch as we all hope for something fresh and original in our own personal anime viewing expeditions, but the comedy with in is well managed. Most jokes land without failure, and I did find myself entertained for the 20-minute period of watching. This can most likely be thanks to decent scripting, clean art, or passable voice acting.Whatever the case may be, old material is knowledgeably funny, and if it isn't the viewer's cuppa tea, there are properly managed characters to keep track of.The cast is easy to comprehend, again, reminiscent of a simple childhood cartoon. It is believed that among Umio, Sensei, Kantoku,  Hiotan, Fu Girl, Sommelier and all the others, a viewer will be able to find several personalities to take a liking to.Interactions between them are, if not entirely interesting, at least natural, and well balanced. The supposed protagonist, Umio, spends about as much time on screen as his co-workers, given each of them a good chance to show their stuff.As well, I liked how the romantic aspects were handled, with a good bundle of couples to develop episode to episode, despite the otaku personalities each character harbors. It's almost as if the show brings out a sort of hope, where a mostly unconventional person can find someone and simply enjoy their company--one of the shining characteristics of this show is how the characters enjoy one another's company.Mentioned previously, the art is bright and suits the overall atmosphere. Round faces and bubbly colors fit nicely in place of the typical seinen mold, and successfully, the characters are cute while avoiding ridiculousness or poorly placed eyes. Admittedly, there was something a bit off about seeing so many small, round figures hungover and falling all over themselves, but in the end Denki-Gai is well put together.I am guilty of skipping the OP a large number of times, reasons being that it doesn't fit in with the tone of the show at all for me, and there's something off-putting about all the main characters laughing hysterically at being presented with apples. I suppose it seems a bit like a bad sitcom.If anything, the ED gives one a better idea of what sort of experience Denki-Gai is, but sadly I don't think anything in this aspect is particularly memorable.As a whole, Denki-Gai no Honya-san is not a must-see anime, but one that provides the seinen/comedy/slice of life that it initially promises. In short, it gives that and does not go beyond, fitting superbly into its twelve episode span. If a second season is to be released, it's predictable that the next set of episodes will follow the same pattern, using different traditional anime tropes that were missed the first time around.Solid comedy, but no more than that. brings the experience down a notch as we all hope for something fresh and original in our own personal anime viewing expeditions, but the comedy with in is well managed.

Kuma Miko, Servamp, Re:ZERO, Taboo Tattoo.The story and ""plot"" is pretty simple. Bunch of co-workers, friends working at a manga shop. It\'s nothing too special except for the fact that there are romantic tension between a majority of the characters.What bothered me is how the story introduced the romance between the girls and the guys. They kept it subtle at some-points during the story. Then there were scenes where anything could happen like kissing or... maybe sex but not really.The second bothersome part of the story is that...nobody was paired together towards the end. I couldn\'t fathom what the point of adding all of those intense scenes where characters could have potentially had created a romantic relationship; if there was no intention of acting upon on it. It left a bad taste in my mouth.As for the comedy that the story has to offer. It\'s actually not that bad. There are a bunch of random moments where hilarity ensues and those moments are quite effective! Besides the romance, the comedic moments where something that I had fun looking forward to seeing each episode.Overall the story was good however, I felt like if the romanctic intentions were acted upon, then the story would have been much more satisfying to sit through. Too much teasing and not enough action were my main reason of giving the story a low 5.The art and animation was certainly unique. I think the character designs were the best thing about the show. I felt like the character designer did a great job of making characters both stand out and... cute. Background settings were pretty nice too. As I mentioned earlier there are a lot of shout-outs to other popular light novels and manga featured in the background of the work shop.The sound department could\'ve been better however, I don\'t really think it had much of an impact on the show. When I went back to re-watch this, I noticed that the soundtrack doesn\'t really play a part in a majority of the scenes that play out in Denki-Gai. The voice actors were great. They did a pretty amazing job with the romance scenes. I felt that they put a lot of emotion into their characters and that made them feel ""real.\'The characters themselves were great to a certain extent. I felt like each of them had a good personality to them. They were likable and there interactions with each other were always fun to watch. Especially when they would do competitions with their rivals. My only problem with the characters would have to be the lack of pairing. As mentioned earlier the romantic tension between most of the characters was play a big part in why I loved the series. However, not having the characters properly confess and pair up in the end ruined my experience.Enjoyment for the series was above average. I was able to remain engaged in the story, there were plot developments that took me by surprise, and I was happy with the comedic moments. It\'s sad that the only thing that killed a lot of my hype and good impression for the series was the lack of pairing the couples together.Overall Denki-gai no Honya-san is pretty good, despite the failed relationship pairing and romance. I gave it a 7/10 because it manages to remain interesting as well as hilarious at times. When there are romantic scenes I like feeling involved in them. I would highly recommend this series for casual watching. nobody was paired together towards the end.

But it's good if you want to pass your time laughing.Story:A group of friends or co-workers working in a manga store spend their daily lives working in the store or dealing with their own problems. Not one character is the spotlight rather it's a mixed story about all of them. So, each episode is divided into 2-3 skits just like in Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou or Lucky Star.

There\'s not really a story here, plus the sexualization of minors and the other ecchi funny content is not funny, it\'s clearly stupid...The anime revolves around the workers of a manga store which are very underage girls and a minor and two dudes with no personality! The anime is supposed to be about their lives with ecchi ""funny"" content but the content is extremely fantasized, no effort behind this. I would\'ve given this a higher score but they failed so miserably with the characters that I won\'t be watching the other episodes. ', 'Work.  It\'s a fact of life that we all have to get a job in order to make money and support ourselves.  In addition to the hard labor that we must endure, we also have to deal with co-workers and the omnipotent boss that rules over what we do in the workplace.  But what kind of life would you have if you your job was working in an otaku store, surrounded by members of your kind?  Well, that\'s the kind of thing that Denki-gai No Honya-san provides.Story (6.88/10): Denki-gai\'s story is really what\'d you expect in a show like...this.  As a slice of life show, the tone of the show is rather mellow, using comedy as its gateway for entertainment rather than a standard plot with rises, a climax, and an ending, thus following the lives of seven individuals and two outsiders as they work in an otaku store filled with manga, eros, and boxed anime sets, showing us that working at the place where your hobby is stored might not always be a good idea.The plot is shown in a sort of 4-koma style where every episode features several minisodes about certain characters and their interactions both inside and outside the workplace.  While this has been shown to be a time-tested formula of storytelling that has worked well for some anime such as Lucky Star and Nichijou, Denki-gai somehow lacks slightly on the flair and charm that it has in its storytelling.  By no means is the storytelling bad, but while watching it, the show felt a little bland to me personally as a viewer as rather than using cunning wit and sharp tongues, the show uses over exaggerated scenes with crazy facial expressions, close-ups to make things look far more extreme and overall a more loud and crazy style of comedy.Which also brings me to the central part for any given series similar to this, comedy.  The comedy is varied.  On one hand, some of the comedy scenes provide some decent laughs, making the show enjoyable.  However, on the other hand, the show also has some scenes that were supposed to be funny, but rather fall flat, being more awkward more than anything else.  In addition, the show also flip flips through different moods, showing a more focused scene centered around two characters and delving into one of three romantic subplots that go nowhere, then goes into an entirely different thing featuring a crazy day at work, then reverting into something involving alcohol, a more serious scene, or about girl power.  The transitions aren\'t really very smooth from one scene to another but don\'t hinder the show much overall.As for an ending, I have to give the show some props for how they ended the show.  Normally I find it hard to see a good ending for a slice of life show since many shows following this sort of format haven\'t been able to find a decent ending due to the non-existent plot, usually as a result, becoming a more open ended ending that leads people to beg for more.  Honestly, I can say the ending as far as I could see was quite ingenious because of how they made a scene where they referenced their own seiyuus.  (Basically a cosplay picnic where every character dressed as their perspective voice actor\'s or actresses\'s past roles.  It\'s true.  Look them up.)Overall, Denki-gai was an interesting watch.  There were points in the show where it tried way to hard to be funny with its over-the-top comedy, as well as some awkward mood transitions from one scene to another, but overall, it did entertain.Overview:+  Good ending+/-  Mixed Comedy-  Awkward transitions from scenesCharacters (7.10/10):  You can\'t have a slice-of life without good characters; it\'s a known fact.  Characters can be even considered even more important than plot in slice of life shows due to the fact that the comedy and charm of the show can only be executed or be memorable through the use of the show\'s personalities.  Denki-gai...has a mixed bag.The show features seven very unique individuals as the main characters.  Umi, Sensei, Hio, Sommelier, Kantoku, Fu-girl, and Kameko.  What makes the characters unique first-hand are their names, seeing as how a good deal of them are called nicknames rather than actual names.  Without going into too much detail, each of these characters are...unique.  They each all have their own quirks and traits about them that make them each a character that has not been overtrouped or overused, which is a plus for the show.  However, as a result of this, the characters don\'t get a lot of traits as a result, more or less resting on their more ""unique"" traits and make them more one note above anything else with the only exception being Kantoku in terms of character depth as he is shown several times to be more than just the manager of the store.Aside from the main cast of seven, there are two other side characters that make occasional appearances.  What\'s interesting to me is the fact that these so-called side characters actually get some backstory and a bit more explanation and exploration to their personality and why they do what they do, which always struck me as odd seeing as how the side characters become more interesting than the main ones.Overall, the cast of Denki is rather mixed.  On one hand, we do have some VERY unique personalities to the cast of only nine characters, but as a result of their unique traits, forces them to rely on those traits in order to sustain that unique quality, ending most of them up to be one-note characters above anything else.Overview:+  Unique non-trouped personalities+/- Side characters are more interesting than main characters. (It should be the other way around.)-  Main characters stay with static personalities.Art and Sound (7.00/10 and 6.22/10):  The animation for the series is well...kinda meh.  There\'re no real standout points for the series as everything is rather consistent visually and the style doesn\'t really stand out above other shows.  The show utilizes a lot of crazy facial expressions to compliment its crazy and wacky comedy style, disfiguring their characters to suit the situation, and giving the characters a blush on their cheeks that make them look like they have a constant fever.  Overall, the animation is decent, but nothing extraordinary.The music is honestly not even worth the time to listen to.  There aren\'t any standout tracks and everything is rather generic.  They\'re all kinda meh.Overview:+/-  Meh AestheticsOverall Enjoyment (6.88/10): When I first found this series, the first thing I thought of was Working!!, as the concept for the series was quite similar, what with the whole interaction with one\'s coworkers and possible interwork relationships due to romantic subplots.  But as I continued watching the show became something more of an over the top exaggeration more than an actual slice of life.  It wasn\'t particularly bad with how the show took this direction, but it wasn\'t as far as I could see, beneficial to the series.Did I like this series?In some ways, yes.  The show\'s characters regardless of their one note flaws, are characters that don\'t particularly follow any sort of troupe.  This gives a very fresh feeling for the show and even makes some of the subjective comedy somewhat easy to laugh to.  In addition, the overall feel of the does give a very casual and non-serious tone, making it somewhat relaxing to watch to.What didn\'t I like about this series?The transitions inside each minisode in terms of mood were definitely a big issue as you laugh in one scene then have to become serious as you watch it without word or warning because some of the characters do get a bit serious at times.  In addition, the comedy as I have mentioned before is a subjective style of comedy where it bounces off people in different ways.  Some people are guaranteed to laugh at the antics of this show, and other may not.Would I recommend this show?That really depends on your taste.  The show is definitely one of those turn off your brain shows because there aren\'t really any moments that really require you to think deeply.  It\'s mostly just a show that you would want to sit down and watch in order to kill time.  However if you\'re not a fan of ecchi humor, talking about eroge constantly, or romantic subplots, this show will not be for you.  It\'s not the best show ever, but it does have some positive points.Overall Score: 6.97/10 this.  As a slice of life show, the tone of the show is rather mellow, using comedy as its gateway for entertainment rather than a standard plot with rises, a climax, and an ending, thus following the lives of seven individuals and two outsiders as they work in an otaku store filled with manga, eros, and boxed anime sets, showing us that working at the place where your hobby is stored might not always be a good idea.The plot is shown in a sort of 4-koma style where every episode features several minisodes about certain characters and their interactions both inside and outside the workplace.  While this has been shown to be a time-tested formula of storytelling that has worked well for some anime such as Lucky Star and Nichijou, Denki-gai somehow lacks slightly on the flair and charm that it has in its storytelling.  By no means is the storytelling bad, but while watching it, the show felt a little bland to me personally as a viewer as rather than using cunning wit and sharp tongues, the show uses over exaggerated scenes with crazy facial expressions, close-ups to make things look far more extreme and overall a more loud and crazy style of comedy.Which also brings me to the central part for any given series similar to this, comedy.  The comedy is varied.  On one hand, some of the comedy scenes provide some decent laughs, making the show enjoyable.  However, on the other hand, the show also has some scenes that were supposed to be funny, but rather fall flat, being more awkward more than anything else.  In addition, the show also flip flips through different moods, showing a more focused scene centered around two characters and delving into one of three romantic subplots that go nowhere, then goes into an entirely different thing featuring a crazy day at work, then reverting into something involving alcohol, a more serious scene, or about girl power.  The transitions aren\'t really very smooth from one scene to another but don\'t hinder the show much overall.As for an ending, I have to give the show some props for how they ended the show.  Normally I find it hard to see a good ending for a slice of life show since many shows following this sort of format haven\'t been able to find a decent ending due to the non-existent plot, usually as a result, becoming a more open ended ending that leads people to beg for more.  Honestly, I can say the ending as far as I could see was quite ingenious because of how they made a scene where they referenced their own seiyuus.  (Basically a cosplay picnic where every character dressed as their perspective voice actor\'s or actresses\'s past roles.  It\'s true.  Look them up.)Overall, Denki-gai was an interesting watch.  There were points in the show where it tried way to hard to be funny with its over-the-top comedy, as well as some awkward mood transitions from one scene to another, but overall, it did entertain.Overview:+  Good ending+/-  Mixed Comedy-  Awkward transitions from scenesCharacters (7.10/10):  You can\'t have a slice-of life without good characters; it\'s a known fact.  Characters can be even considered even more important than plot in slice of life shows due to the fact that the comedy and charm of the show can only be executed or be memorable through the use of the show\'s personalities.  Denki-gai...has a mixed bag.The show features seven very unique individuals as the main characters.  Umi, Sensei, Hio, Sommelier, Kantoku, Fu-girl, and Kameko.  What makes the characters unique first-hand are their names, seeing as how a good deal of them are called nicknames rather than actual names.  Without going into too much detail, each of these characters are...unique.  They each all have their own quirks and traits about them that make them each a character that has not been overtrouped or overused, which is a plus for the show.  However, as a result of this, the characters don\'t get a lot of traits as a result, more or less resting on their more ""unique"" traits and make them more one note above anything else with the only exception being Kantoku in terms of character depth as he is shown several times to be more than just the manager of the store.Aside from the main cast of seven, there are two other side characters that make occasional appearances.  What\'s interesting to me is the fact that these so-called side characters actually get some backstory and a bit more explanation and exploration to their personality and why they do what they do, which always struck me as odd seeing as how the side characters become more interesting than the main ones.Overall, the cast of Denki is rather mixed.  On one hand, we do have some VERY unique personalities to the cast of only nine characters, but as a result of their unique traits, forces them to rely on those traits in order to sustain that unique quality, ending most of them up to be one-note characters above anything else.Overview:+  Unique non-trouped personalities+/- Side characters are more interesting than main characters. (It should be the other way around.)-  Main characters stay with static personalities.Art and Sound (7.00/10 and 6.22/10):  The animation for the series is well...kinda meh.  There\'re no real standout points for the series as everything is rather consistent visually and the style doesn\'t really stand out above other shows.  The show utilizes a lot of crazy facial expressions to compliment its crazy and wacky comedy style, disfiguring their characters to suit the situation, and giving the characters a blush on their cheeks that make them look like they have a constant fever.

It’s super funny, it’s all over the place, it makes very little sense, it’s a ton of great fun. The girls are all really cute, the way everything melds together works so well too.Working in Umanohane, we have a nice large cast of characters: Sensei, the manga artist who’s trying to go pro, Fu Girl, a crazy zombie loving girl who loves horror manga and will imagine things in her favor to try and kill “zombies” (she’s really funny), Kameko, the...one who takes pictures of all the events that occur, a slightly sad tale for her, but she has fuwa fuwa afro hair and is super cute, Sommelier, the silent one who knows what you like just by looking at you, specializes in ero ero goodness, Hio-tan, the clumsy one who is super embarrassed around the Director and tends to get picked on because of her body shape, Kantoku, or the Director, he loves to take video of things happening and is always a huge tease to everyone in the store, also manages everyone around and lastly Umio, the new kid, super shy, has a huge passion for otaku related things, daikimaru’s, pantzu, waifu’s, you name it, he’s pretty funny.So what happens when you work in a manga store, well a lot, you deal with wild customers who are desperate for the latest manga releases, everyone wants the latest ero books, things in the work place are occurring, love is blossoming, tons of things. There are events that happen both in and out of work and as such, that’s what you’re watching in Denki-gai. Yes, it’s very slice of life, yes it’s 100% episodic and yes, it’s laugh out loud funny with what appears to be info on actual work in manga related places, so it’s pretty great!I mentioned in my Ninja Nonsense review that I’ve never seen an art style as unique as it before, but here comes Denki-gai and what do you know, it actually has some striking similarities, especially in the way faces and eyes are drawn, so I think that’s pretty cool. Denki-gai utilizes some really cute colors for its’ art and is also very nicely drawn. I think it’s a cute anime to watch.OP and ED, like always I have no complaints, I think they’re very cute, fun and upbeat, makes it easy to listen. A lot of great sound effects and BGM too, but the best thing were the seiyuu for sure. The girls, when they get flustered and embarrassed, so unbelievably cute, all the stuttering, all the high pitched voices, all the yelling and running away, all the squeeing when the girls are next to the boys they like, Ahhhhhhhh, I love it all and there is so much of it in Denki-gai, just soooooo goooooood ~, seriously ~ gao gao ~Denki-gai, it’s a good watch, gao gao ~ one who takes pictures of all the events that occur, a slightly sad tale for her, but she has fuwa fuwa afro hair and is super cute, Sommelier, the silent one who knows what you like just by looking at you, specializes in ero ero goodness, Hio-tan, the clumsy one who is super embarrassed around the Director and tends to get picked on because of her body shape, Kantoku, or the Director, he loves to take video of things happening and is always a huge tease to everyone in the store, also manages everyone around and lastly Umio, the new kid, super shy, has a huge passion for otaku related things, daikimaru’s, pantzu, waifu’s, you name it, he’s pretty funny.So what happens when you work in a manga store, well a lot, you deal with wild customers who are desperate for the latest manga releases, everyone wants the latest ero books, things in the work place are occurring, love is blossoming, tons of things.

The art style was simple, yet cute. The characters interactions with each other was well done and extremely enjoying to watch.Overall, this anime is great for winding down after a long day of work, or even after a shower or bath. The story line is fun, and involving, but it is very easy to leave off after an episode or two and pick it up...the next day. the next day.', 'I think this anime targets the specific audience of otakus and anime lovers alike. It’s definitely a show where people go “I relate to that” or “Yep, that’s me”. It’s extremely funny when you understand the jokes and situations and can somewhat relate to them. I feel like if your new to anime this show would confuse you and probably won’t be as funny as you don’t really understand Otaku culture. Not saying you can’t watch it, but it’s way more funnier when you understand certain Otaku-ness if I can say that.STORY 9/10It’s meant to be an anime where each episode is like a...short story of their own little world. I love anime where it doesn’t make you have to recall something that was 10 episodes ago just to understand what’s happening. Especially now since I don’t binge anime in one go as I used to. I definitely love how they develop characters in their own relationships and bring in some extremely funny jokes into the show. Every episode I was laughing so hard I almost had tears rolling down. I also was a huge fan of Skull face bookseller Honda-san with its sense of humour and storyline about working at a Japanese bookstore. Denki Gai opened up another anime which I could also watch a similar storyline and laugh just as hard. It also brought so many memories of being in Japan and going into bookstores, especially the layouts and the special events in the anime (although in real life they weren’t as crazy haha)CHARACTERS 8/10The characters are really cute and I love how each has their own personality and likings which creates really different interactions with other characters. I will admit, sometimes some characters got a bit too much for me on trying to be cutesy, but I think everyone has their preference in that.ART AND MUSIC 7/10It’s got standard art and music for it’s time. Nothing too amazing but nothing too shabby. Not much to say hereOVERALLIt’s a fun loving anime that’s easy to watch. I think it depends on your preferences of what kind of anime you like but for me, I love comedy with funny and somewhat relatable scenes.

It was the pretty and clean art style that got my attention. After that I watched the first episode and then came the rest.

The interaction of characters in love was also sweet, there was a lot of blushing and embarrassing moments, also lets not forget the awkward ones. They all were innocent when it came to love and I felt like watching a couple of kids fall in love with each other. I just wanted them to hurry up and get together already but, sadly, that didn't happen, which brings me to my only disappointment with this show.From how they always acted I was sure that they would get together at the end, half my disappointment is because I just really wanted them to be happy together.

Still, even as it manages to sow the seeds of compelling characterization, it ultimately fails to follow through and become more than it is, what I feel it is meant to be. Beginning with the story, it is simple and episodic throughout, while managing to be consistently funny and in many cases heartwarming, even if it is far hornier than one would expect at first glance. It is simplest in the first half, but grows with the struggles faced by the employees of Umanohone, and builds up...several storylines which seem at first to promise later payoff. Be it the various romances or career aspirations, I found myself invested by the end, only to have all the loose threads left blowing in the wind, and nothing to show for it. Indeed, for all the fanservice they managed to cram in 12 episodes, it would seem they're pretty damn nervous about a kiss or two! The art is the strong point of this anime, far exceeding all standards of quality one would expect from either the time period or genre. The color palette is vibrant and reflects the spirit of the show, the backgrounds are fully detailed and painstakingly worked, the character designs are pleasing to the eye and distinctive in a variety of ways, and the fluidity of the visual gags speak to the talent of the team behind it, as well as their cohesion with the writers which shows itself in its impeccable comedic timing. The sound is surprisingly good, with a fun, emotive soundtrack, engaging voice work, and sounds of life which make the world feel more grounded and believable. The characters of course provide major forward momentum for the show as a whole, and through rock solid line delivery coupled with a kinetic visual language, prove themselves as more than just vehicles for the story or comedic elements, but instead as surprisingly three dimensional characters which enthusiastically drive the show towards its conclusion. Many comedy anime feel as though they abandon their characters to the whims of the story or for the sake of comedy, but they avoid that pitfall here. From the large and engaging cast, I have to say the best characters are Sommelier and Sensei, though Kameko was the most personally engaging for her unique position among the cast and distinct characterization from the rest of the Umanohone girls. Overall, I feel it must be said that this anime is a 6 only because it straddles the line too much. If it remained a lighthearted comedy with no aspirations of character growth or romantic culmination, then it would be a 7, or if it managed to stick the landing and give the audience a satisfying ending, then it would also be a 7. Unfortunately it does neither, and is demoted to a 6. Still, if you enjoy shows dealing with the chaos of retail or otaku culture, then you'll find both here. several storylines which seem at first to promise later payoff.

The color palette is vibrant and reflects the spirit of the show, the backgrounds are fully detailed and painstakingly worked, the character designs are pleasing to the eye and distinctive in a variety of ways, and the fluidity of the visual gags speak to the talent of the team behind it, as well as their cohesion with the writers which shows itself in its impeccable comedic timing. The sound is surprisingly good, with a fun, emotive soundtrack, engaging voice work, and sounds of life which make the world feel more grounded and believable. The characters of course provide major forward momentum for the show as a whole, and through rock solid line delivery coupled with a kinetic visual language, prove themselves as more than just vehicles for the story or comedic elements, but instead as surprisingly three dimensional characters which enthusiastically drive the show towards its conclusion. Many comedy anime feel as though they abandon their characters to the whims of the story or for the sake of comedy, but they avoid that pitfall here. From the large and engaging cast, I have to say the best characters are Sommelier and Sensei, though Kameko was the most personally engaging for her unique position among the cast and distinct characterization from the rest of the Umanohone girls. Overall, I feel it must be said that this anime is a 6 only because it straddles the line too much. If it remained a lighthearted comedy with no aspirations of character growth or romantic culmination, then it would be a 7, or if it managed to stick the landing and give the audience a satisfying ending, then it would also be a 7. Unfortunately it does neither, and is demoted to a 6. Still, if you enjoy shows dealing with the chaos of retail or otaku culture, then you'll find both here.""]"
Date A Live II,https://myanimelist.net/anime/19163/Date_A_Live_II,"['A series based on dating. Date a Live wastes no time adapting this concept by having Shido Itsuka date various girls/spirits, earn their feelings, and kiss them to seal the deal. As a harem show, you’d expect all the girls drooling over him. While that’s partially right, it also adds additional elements because those so-called girls aren’t actually normal as part of society. Instead, they are spirits, born with supernatural powers who are viewed as a threat to their world. Date a Live II continues directly after the events for season 1. It continues to mush around its formulation of dating and turns it into...some gimmicky show – dating becoming the solution to save the world.Based off the light novels written by Koishi Tachibana, one noticeable attribute to this adaption is the shortened length. Rather than a full one cour show (the typical 12-13 episodes), this sequel only focuses on 10 episodes adapting volumes 5-7. The main concern is rush and this should be expected. I confess to myself that the sequel is disappointing when it comes to adapting faithful material. The show decides to omit various parts to get more time for the main actors and actresses. In this case, it’s the spirits. After all, Date a Live II is a stardom for some new characters such as a pair of twins, new AST (Anti-Spirit Team) members, and even a rising idol. The catch is that some of the focus on other character are scrapped to replace their stardom.The sequel is essentially divided into two halves although the first arc has slightly less material than the second. Still, Shidou remains the focus of the show as the bachelor as he tries to save spirits and the world. The first episode has mostly anime original material but this comes off as disappointing. There’s harem antics thrown in your face fused with a whirlwind of misunderstandings. To make matters worse, the show decides to add elements from classic soap operas to appeal to these misunderstandings to somehow make them more amusing. And this comes out as dishonest as Tohka falls for every single scenario she feasts her eyes on. Neither does the initial set up show any improvement with other characters as they still want to get into Shido’s pants such as Origami. On the other hand, Shido himself has become more confident. He finds adjustment to his new lifestyle now that Tohka, Yoshino, and Kotori are living together. His relationship with these girls/spirits almost feels like a family as they give him the same pleasure as he gives them. And while the show is still regarded as a harem, the feelings the characters show are more honest and innocent especially in the case for Tohka.Comedy is indulged in this series with some welcoming aspects. While a lot of it seems repetitive, there are also other more refreshing parts such as a little gender bender not previously seen from season 1. The characters behave the way they should be with various personalities. Origami for instance is still her usual self and tries every single moment to get close to Shidou using some questionable yet amusing methods. Then, there’s the classic Date a Live gimmick: the multiple choice. While it is featured once again as a strategy to deal with runaway spirits, it has less prominence with some of the questions lacking flavor. Yet, it isn’t really what’s being asked that shows the humor but rather Shido’s way of responding.  It flirts with the idea of how Shido pretends to get attention of the spirits while methodically see how they react to them. While it makes its point effectively, it still falls under the wish fulfillment and generic tropes. By this time though, it should probably be something the audience should expect from Date a Live. Emphasis on the date.Director Keitaro Motonaga crafts his ideas from behind the scenes. Known for some of other series in the harem genre such as Akane Iro ni Somaru Saka, Majikoi - Oh! Samurai Girls, and the first season of Date a Live, one might question the direction of this sequel. This can come as a hit or miss especially for fans who are familiar with the material, specifically from the light novels. As mentioned before, the pacing suffers with certain elements omitted whether it would be part of the plot, humorous gags, or even character cameos. But an important factor to take notice of is the way characters are depicted. For instance, while the Yamai twins retain their personalities, the focus on them seems to be shortened with other characters. Even though Shido is the main protagonist, the subtle relationships he develops with the spirits can feel crude and stereotypical. It doesn’t even attempt to hide itself whether it’s be the fan service (such as the classic beach episode) or the seductive poses characters throw into Shido’s face. In essence, Date a Live makes the show looks itself more like a mission, to accomplish a purpose and move on. This at least applies to most of the supporting characters in the form of conquests for Shido. It doesn’t necessary develop his character or even express his personification in any ample way.But for someone like Shido, responsibility becomes part of his life. When there’s trouble, he needs to be prepared. While the first arc didn’t give Shido’s impression of this, the latter half sees an improvement with his strategies. He isn’t just more confident but also fights for beyond the scope of the mission. In retrospect, he becomes more mature and takes his job more seriously with even some admiration to see how far he goes when trying to save a friend. After all, the spirits gets stronger and his life becomes more in jeopardy. For the spirits, they offer diversity. We see a sharp contrast in their persona when comparing the first and second half of the story. Shido has to respond accordingly and think outside the box in order to prevail. He does get a little bit of help though from an unlikely ally, and one that fans adore from the first season with her yandere tendencies.Taking in the account of action, the show doesn’t cease to make this its way whether it’s aerial battles, ground level warfare, or even a battle of psychological integrity. Shido finds himself in moments of despair and desperation as events become more jeopardizing to peace. Even Kotori finds herself outmatched in some circumstances. And with new characters introduced such as Sir Issac and Ellen from the DEM industries (a military corporation for developing mecha units), you can expect a bit of clash of egos. Not only has that but characters such as Origami also found herself on the edge and in trouble throughout the season as she battles against her adversaries. Despite the mecha gears looking more suggestive though, there is credibility to the action with high caliber weapons in operation, superhuman maneuvers courtesy of the spirits, and even Shido’s risky moves.As the majority of the cast returns to the sequel, you should be familiarized already with their personalities. Unfortunately, their development lacks in terms of characterization as the show focuses more on sealing the spirits and less so when Shido isn’t on dates.  Furthermore, the fan service never ceases as the first arc is saturated with ecchi. But again, this is Date a Live we’re talking about a – franchise that pokes at fun the concept of dating to add its own ‘save the world while you get to date girls’ trite.Artwork remains generally the same as characters returning from the first season hardly goes undergoes any significant physical changes. In other words, it still remains generic as hardly anything stands out with Shido’s character design. On the other hand, the new spirits such as the Yamai twins and the idol Miku has some attractive figures. Background visuals remains stale although more lively and natural when the series takes on a beach setting. But remember that fan service never ceases whether it’s be the traditional swimsuits or the libidinous camera angles. It doesn’t cease to hide the teasing either and tires honestly to appease itself with stupidity. There are some cute moments though and decorative outfits in particular with the show’s second half that is more colorful. But overall, it’s still lacking.Although soundtrack isn’t a powerhouse, it does improve more in this sequel whether it’d be the action scenes or emotional scenarios. The bittersweet moments are focused more intensely to bring out some credibility to character relationships. Some of the dialogues may also seem cheesy but offer humor with their speech mannerisms (i.e. the contrasting tones of the Yamai twins). On the other hand, Miku’s voice feels egoistic, lacks serenity, and in general aspect sounds like a spoiled brat with annoying tones. The song she sings aren’t attractive either with her soft but squeaking style. Thankfully, the OP and ED songs has more features that makes the franchise what it is.10 episodes and that’s how Date a Live II decides to adapt the second season. The disappointment of story development in terms of a more accurate adaptation puts a stain on this show. At the same time, the fan service is like a bed bug that infests itself at any opportunity it has the chance. The first half of the season focuses on this exclusively with the twins while the second part tries out a little different with a bit of gender bender. But still, the comedy can be pleasant if you’re into the show’s gimmicks. The characters also offers something new; contrasting greatly between the two arcs but still refreshing. There’s even a favorable character that makes her ultimate return with great anticipation. But if you’re anticipating to watch this sequel, just be ready for another journey of dating sim and shenanigans. some gimmicky show – dating becoming the solution to save the world.Based off the light novels written by Koishi Tachibana, one noticeable attribute to this adaption is the shortened length.

Although I reserved my expectations heading into this sequel, I certainly anticipated more than ten episodes of a disgrace. Date A Live II strayed away from the merits which put its prequel on the map, such as the charms of the vivacious heroines or remarkable humor tied to a spectrum of dating simulation choices. It was only yesterday that an udon shop launched an eventful assault on the core group (en route to a local hot spring). It was only yesterday that Shidou matched wits and fists...against true adversity, juggling a batch of pressing demands with everything on the line. It was only yesterday that players were ripe with presence and not confined to restrictions of a dismal cause.While Date A Live's strengths permeated well through a lively bunch headlining season one, there was no vibrancy to replicate that success in this second act. The Berserk twins were pure lighter fluid to one of the most staggering time sinks I have witnessed in this genre. Was it really too much to ask for with yin-yang personalities serving no purpose other than to get Shidou hot? And as for the Diva, I hated to see her unique sexual preference and tastes overshadowed by her foully variable and one-dimensional personality.The premise for this sequel was collectively lacking in soul and impact. Most of, if not all the battles, were saturated with cheap chatter among combatants stirred together with a high concentration of pretentious drama. The most obvious misunderstandings were blown well out of proportion while new rivals and antagonist powerhouses seemingly made their appearances out of thin air. The more easygoing school events and concerts did little to support the effort or lighten the atmosphere.It would be great if the upcoming movies, OVAs, and/or TV sequels can rebound and inject Live-liness back into this series. Nonetheless, the signature trademark of the glasses schoolgirl accurately sums up this installment.

Date A Live 2, continues the story about Shido, who is a boy who has the ability to seal spirits, thus preventing them from doing large-scale damage, through dating them and eventually kissing them.  In this second season, the story is slow to start, but it introduces the Twins spirits and the Diva spirit, along with an inverse version of an earlier spirit (no spoilers here lol).I enjoyed Date A Live because of the unusualness of the plot.  I mean, I haven't heard of a show where a person dates someone, and...then kisses them to seal their powers before, so of course it had my interest.  Season 2 has been a disappointment for the first few episodes, but finally it has gotten back to what it was known for, which is spirits fighting, mecha suit girls fighting, dates occurring, and other things of the sort.  The art style of the show is nice because it keeps things light-hearted and not too deep, although there are a few sad moments in the show, but those few moments, are kept short and are many of the times, resolved.Sound wise, the music is great.  It's not 10/10 masterpiece by any standards, but its fitting and just sounds great, especially the opening theme.  The characters are easy to remember special in there own way.   Between the twin spirits, the Diva, Shido, the other spirits, etc. they are all memorable and in my opinion, likeable.  Personally, I like Kurumi because of her craziness and time control ability, but they each have their own little niche that they fill in character development.As I said before, the story is unique in it's own respects, and I've enjoyed it, even though this season was much slower at starting than the previous one.  Since the show has picked up the pace and has shown more action, I've enjoyed it more and more, although when comparing this to the light novel, the anime is flying through the story, much faster than the LN ever did.  To some, this is an issue, while for others, it helps to cut the small details and get the main story.  I'm split on this but the LN is a good reads.All in all, if you liked Date A Live, then you will like this but just hang in there if you think that it is slow.  This season was largely about introducing new characters and revealing new things about older characters.   If you haven't watched DAL and think that this show is weird, bad, confusing, etc. then give DAL a shot first then kisses them to seal their powers before, so of course it had my interest.

But for me and my easily-satisfied outlook on anime, this 'itch' is most commonly a dumb harem show with beautiful girls and a dash of action! So when I found out that one of my favourite harem was getting a sequel? Well that was all gravy for me!Story - 7/10:I've...got to be honest, the story really isn't the strongest part of this show; which is pretty standard for the genre its from. It continues from shortly after where the first season left off, Shido is still the Spirit Pimp, Tohka is still annoying and the rest are just...there.The second season covers roughly volumes 5-7 of the Light Novel which means the introduction of two new Spirit types; the Hurricane Twins, Yuzuru and Kaguya Yamai and the Diva AKA Miku Izayoi. Of course the formula of 'Kiss the girl, save the world' doesn't change, but the story managed to break away from the formulaic first season thanks to the personalities of the two new additions.Art - 5-8/10:I had to look this up to see if it was actually a Gonzo show because the art and animation varies so much its unbelievable, the first episode looked awful in regards to art style and the character styles in the OP urked me to the point i skipped it, i mean, what the hell was up with Kurumi? Nevermind. It seemed they focused their budget solely on the second half of the series once the new spirits where introduced and we could get into the real meat of the story. The fight scenes looked absolutely stunning with the wide range of colours creating some of the most satisfying and complimenting action scenes i have ever witnessed in a harem show (or is that not saying much? I don't know) however in the less interesting parts of the show they pulled an Evangelion and skimped wherever they could during scenes of dialogue. Another part that annoyed me was the lack of quality during Miku's live performances where her mouth wouldn't even come close to matching the sync of the song being played, its not that much of a problem as the song's themselves were amazing, but it was noticeable enough for me to mention it here.Sound - 9/10:As a Japanese speaker myself, i can openly and happily say this dub was pretty strong, Kurumi's voice actress was brilliant at nailing her slightly Psychotic yet simultaneously adorable personality, where she could switch between the two on a whim. The OP sounded beautiful despite somewhat cheesy lyrics and the ED was also pretty strong if albeit containing nothing particularly noteworthy to mention. Miku's songs made specifically for this season were a nice treat as her final song in episode 10 was one of the best songs i've heard from within an anime show.Character - 7/10:The biggest strength and biggest problem of this show was the characters; the one's who got a lot of screen time were developed nicely despite the shortage of episodes, Miku's tsundere personality and view on men was a whole was a nice touch and amusing thing to watch considering what Shido must do to seal her powers. The Yamai twins were also great, with one having an unmoved, somewhat 'Rei ayanami/Yuki Nagato' personality- often submissive but very calm and collected, contrasting to her abnoxious and loud twin sister who is often very reckless.The characters who weren't developed at all or any further, however, was a HUGE problem for me. The most abvious lack of development was that of the character 'Jessica' who's motives and ambitions would have completely gone over my head if i hadn't already read the Light Novels, she was so poorly developed that i was becoming rather impatient that she was still a 'thing' almost 4 episodes after she was introduced. Another example of poor development was that of the fan-favourite loli, Yoshino, who spent the entire first half of the season at home, irrelevant, watching TV dramas that just so happen to either match the situation going on with the other characters or predicted the future. Finally, the antagonist of the story, Westcott, was also poorly developed, but considering he is probably going to be the antagonist of the recently-announced Date A Live movie, i can kind of forgive it and respect that they didn't rush him.Enjoyment - 8/10:I consider a Date A Live franchise as one of my guilty pleasures, i'm aware that there's nothing really special to make me want to watch it, but I watch it anyway because its just pure mindless fun. The second season doesn't necessarily to as good a job as the first season but that all depends on what you expected from this show in the first place, at the time i watched this, i wasn't in the mood for anything thought-provoking and it was there to satisfy me. The character arcs were incredibly fun to watch, throwing in new twists to the typical 'win them over and kiss them' formula that was rather refreshing and i respect Tachibana-san (the mangaka) for not rehashing the same archetypes over and over again. the ending was slightly rushed but that's what I expected after the plot twist in episode 9 so its not really affected me - especially knowing more is to come.Overall - 7/10:It wasn't a clean-cut show, in fact its pacing and execution of the arcs were poor, however, like every harem, its the characters that matter; the characters that you can really get behind and root for and the second season did the job well for the ones it did bother to develop. The music and voice-acting was on point and the story was above average for the genre its from if albeit a little too ambitious and convoluted for a 10 episode series, the show does indeed scratch the itch of a dumb fun show, and really, what more could you ask from it? got to be honest, the story really isn't the strongest part of this show; which is pretty standard for the genre its from.

Miku's songs made specifically for this season were a nice treat as her final song in episode 10 was one of the best songs i've heard from within an anime show.Character - 7/10:The biggest strength and biggest problem of this show was the characters; the one's who got a lot of screen time were developed nicely despite the shortage of episodes, Miku's tsundere personality and view on men was a whole was a nice touch and amusing thing to watch considering what Shido must do to seal her powers. The Yamai twins were also great, with one having an unmoved, somewhat 'Rei ayanami/Yuki Nagato' personality- often submissive but very calm and collected, contrasting to her abnoxious and loud twin sister who is often very reckless.The characters who weren't developed at all or any further, however, was a HUGE problem for me. The most abvious lack of development was that of the character 'Jessica' who's motives and ambitions would have completely gone over my head if i hadn't already read the Light Novels, she was so poorly developed that i was becoming rather impatient that she was still a 'thing' almost 4 episodes after she was introduced. Another example of poor development was that of the fan-favourite loli, Yoshino, who spent the entire first half of the season at home, irrelevant, watching TV dramas that just so happen to either match the situation going on with the other characters or predicted the future. Finally, the antagonist of the story, Westcott, was also poorly developed, but considering he is probably going to be the antagonist of the recently-announced Date A Live movie, i can kind of forgive it and respect that they didn't rush him.Enjoyment - 8/10:I consider a Date A Live franchise as one of my guilty pleasures, i'm aware that there's nothing really special to make me want to watch it, but I watch it anyway because its just pure mindless fun. The second season doesn't necessarily to as good a job as the first season but that all depends on what you expected from this show in the first place, at the time i watched this, i wasn't in the mood for anything thought-provoking and it was there to satisfy me. The character arcs were incredibly fun to watch, throwing in new twists to the typical 'win them over and kiss them' formula that was rather refreshing and i respect Tachibana-san (the mangaka) for not rehashing the same archetypes over and over again. the ending was slightly rushed but that's what I expected after the plot twist in episode 9 so its not really affected me - especially knowing more is to come.Overall - 7/10:It wasn't a clean-cut show, in fact its pacing and execution of the arcs were poor, however, like every harem, its the characters that matter; the characters that you can really get behind and root for and the second season did the job well for the ones it did bother to develop. The music and voice-acting was on point and the story was above average for the genre its from if albeit a little too ambitious and convoluted for a 10 episode series, the show does indeed scratch the itch of a dumb fun show, and really, what more could you ask from it?"", ""This is hard for me because I am a fan of the Date A Live light novel series. It really is hard. Date A Live II was the planned second season of Date A Live and it covers Light Novel volumes 5, 6, and 7. It was only 10 episodes long which in itself was already disappointing before the series even started. The story for Date A Live is silly. Even in the first season there isn't much, but it's much better than what we saw here in this second one.Date A Live II starts the season with filler which was a disaster since...there were only 10 episodes and the episode itself is dreadful. It then proceeds to stumble all over itself for the next few episodes and never really gets going. The 5th volume was done fairly well, but it was just boring. 6 was terrible, and 7 was good.Overall I can't say much about the story, but it's just dry. It lacks any punch and there is no driven plot until late in the series. I'll give it a 6/10 because though the last arc is predictable it offers some enjoyment.The real problem here is the art and animation. I don't know where to begin. Date A Live season 1 had some of the best animation of any show of 2013; meanwhile, this series doesn't have any place in 2014. The mistakes in animation are just ghastly. There is no budget for this series at all . It looks terrible and that is very sad considering the tsunako designed characters are very appealing and easy on the eyes. To not be able to capture this was just sad and ruined the entire season for me. I can't go over 2/10 for art.The sound is pretty good and soundtrack once again is pretty decent, but the use of music is extremely questionable. There are sometimes completely silent battles and it does not make sense. 7/10 for sound.Now in this season we meet a lot of a new characters, and I can't say you feel any attachment to any of them. Instead of building on what we already had in season 1 which was fairly likeable, most girls are barely even seen in favor of mediocre characters and bland plot lines. It's just not well done at all. 4/10 for character.Overall I didn't enjoy DAL II. It was one of those things that was just bad. And it's disappointing because I am a huge fan of the light novel series and the whole DAL franchise, and I love the story, but this was just done horribly. I couldn't believe it myself and I am extremely disappointed. 4/10 for enjoyment and an overall score of 5/10.Date A Live II fails to capture the same feelings of Date A Live season 1 and loses it's own identity. It gets lost in a sea of mediocrity and just when it begins to try to pick itself up it ends. A regretfully poor experience. I just wish it had been better. there were only 10 episodes and the episode itself is dreadful. It then proceeds to stumble all over itself for the next few episodes and never really gets going.

While Harems aren\'t the most favorite out of all of the genres of anime, it doesn\'t always mean that there aren\'t some really good ones out there.  Date A Live II, an anime in which I can safely say, is one of those few.Story (7.89/10):  For those of you who haven\'t seen the first season, Date A Live is an anime series that revolves around our main...protagonist Shidou, our sixteen year old main protagonist, who has the ability to seal these otherworldly beings called spirits, who just so happen to all look like attractive/adorable human females from this world.  The main idea of the series, is that our main protagonist must seal these spirits away peacefully by no other means than by making them fall in love with him, and sealing them with a kiss.Now, from an idea standpoint, the story is as cliched and redone as it can get, as a similar series, called ""The World God Only Knows"" has done a similar sort of story focal point already.  As far as idea originality, this series gets a six point rating at best.  But why does the story get a higher rating you ask?  That my dear readers is in the story arcs.What makes this season in particular more interesting is the way the story was written out.  Compared to its predecessor, Date A Live II has a lot more focus on its characters rather than general fanservice that other harem anime do.  In fact, I personally can\'t even consider this as a true harem, as only a small fraction out of all of the girls in the series actually like the guy in that way.  Each of its two story arcs give growth to the new incoming characters to the series, and to our main protagonist, making them feel a bit more real and less platonic.  While the development did feel a bit rushed, it was commendable that the writers actually spent time on making the characters more in-depth and important rather than just one here, done, another, done with its characters.Above all, what separates this story from a good chunk of harems out there, is mystery.  THe series actually has a good mystery element that is sadly only really explored later on in the series.  There\'s a lot of interesting questions that need to be answered, and that intrigued me, as the story felt like it was evolving into something greater than it would\'ve been at first glance.Aside from that, there were some downfalls of the series.  Number 1 is well, the first episode.  The first episode was quite a turnoff, as the actual story was really just a big misunderstanding that felt more like an OVA rather than a part of the main story.  It did introduce the first arc somewhat, but overall, felt really unessecary and probably turned off some of its fan base due to how excessively comedic (even by date a live standards) it was.  Number two is pacing.  Some of the episodes admittedly did feel a bit rushed in what they were trying to achieve, making some stuff to go along in order to advance the plot.  Given the small time frame of ten episodes, it was sad to see some details that could\'ve used a little bit more explanation.The ending itself felt a bit rushed.  I wish the final episode was sort of drawn out into two episodes because it felt really rushed.  It was a part of the series I was really itching to see, and to see the arc I anticipated so much become just a half episode standoff, it was quite disappointing really.All in all, Date A Live II had a pretty decent story.  It built on what it had before and made the story a lot more deeper and in depth than its predecessor, which is always a plus.  On the other hand, there were some time issues with the series that just made it shine a little less than it could\'ve.Overview+  Good story arcs+  Great character development+  Good mystery element-   Disappointing final arc-   10 episodes.  (The first season was 12.)Characters (7.77/10):  The characters of this series is definitely a high point.  For every fan of this show, there is a girl that they love.  (Kurumi all the way.)  Of course, the series itself is a harem, so the gender ratios are well, a bit off.Itsuka Shidou, our main protagonist of Date A Live who has the ability to seal these creatures called spirits with a kiss.  (This guy gets quite a bit of action.)  At first glance, one could call him just an average harem lead, a guy who\'s nice to everyone and doesn\'t want to hurt anyone\'s feelings, all the while with several girls after his D.  (In this case, two girls.)  So what sets him apart from many other harem leads?  For one thing, he\'s not dense.  He\'s actually fully aware of the love that some of the girls in the series give him, which makes the experience of watching not so hair-pulling worthy.  (Unlike Infinite Stratos)  As the series goes on, you can clearly see him prove his worth in the series as he shows himself to be very proactive in doing his job of protecting and saving spirits.  The comical dating sim choice thing that occurs regularly in the first series becomes obsolete due to the fact that he chooses and says his own words, making his character feel all the more better.Yatogami Tohka is the main female lead of this series.  While personally, I\'m not that big of a fan of Tohka, I was a bit saddened to see her role become more of a supportive one rather than a more proactive one.  Throughout the series, Tohka served little more than the role of just being there and coming in at the right time to make stuff happen.  It wasn\'t until the final episode where her role really shined, only to be cut in half due to the small time frame.The series on the other hand became quite focused on the three main spirits featured in this season; the Yamai sisters, and Miku.  What I can say is the fact that these three are some of the most animated and thought out characters that I\'ve seen in Date A Live other than the main two characters.  The reason being is because their stories are quite thought out and detailed.  Their stories made the series better on account of the fact that they grew alongside out main protagonist in terms of character development, turning into three dimensional characters that have more to offer than at first glance.Aside from the more focused characters of the series, we have a whole slew of side characters that range from amount of screentime and importance in the series.  What I didn\'t like was the fact that so many characters in the series that had quite a bit of significance in the first season, had barely any significance in this season.  Kotori, who was a prominent character, was put in the backseat, along with Origami and my favorite spirit Kurumi, who had barely any screentime altogether.  While it didn\'t impact the series too much as a whole, I did wish I could see these characters a bit more in this season than what was given.But what I can say was a positive, was the fact that we now have established antagonists in the series.  This season gave us some pretty interesting antagonists with motives that weren\'t quite clear to the characters or us, adding into the ever growing mystery of this show that I like.  It was a good addition that could only really make the show grow even more.Overview:+  Good character development+  Good established antagonists-   Important character demoted to supporting role-   Lack of screentime for some more important side charactersArt and Sound (8.00 and 8.01/10):  The art for the series was definitely stepped up.  The visuals of the series looked fantastic and glorious, the fight scenes were crisp, fluid and amazing.  Every character looked great; there wasn\'t any sort of screw ups for the look of the characters.  While the art did look good, there was one big flaw, and that is, darkness.  For a good portion of the series, the show looks like Another.  The entirety of the frame in some parts of the show looked completely black and made it really hard to see what was going on.  It didn\'t really feel like a good experience and took away parts of the show overall.And the required section for any ecchi show, fanservice.  Date a live, with its cast of for the most part, largely chested females, has a quite significant amount of fanservice.  Any time a spirit gets her powers sealed, their astral dress will fade, thus baring everything to our main protagonist. (I told you this guy gets some.)  What I noticed is the fact that the fanservice seemed to be downgraded, as in there wasn\'t as much as there was in the first season.  Because they put so much time into the plot, there wasn\'t as much fanservice as there could\'ve been, and that made the series, at least for me, a more pleasurable experience to watch.  Though there was some...unnecessary imagery that was used that I preferred not to have seen.For music, the series came with a set of new OP and ED tracks, to me, far exceeding the original series\'s tracks.  The opening sounded similar to the original OP, but different enough to make me like it even more.  While it was a memorable track to me, it didn\'t stick out as something for a long term favorite.  The ending on the other hand was a song in a storytelling sequence.  The lyrics were that of a fairytale about a hero saving the princess, making this personally my favorite track of the whole series, as it teased about the final arc of the season, that ended up to be quite disappointing.As for background tracks, the series reused practically all of them, from the quirky ones to the battle tracks, to my ever favorite mystical opera one that added suspense and mystery to the scene.  The background tracks are actually quite good and make Date A Live, Date a Live.Overview:+  Upgraded visuals+  Good new tracks-  Unnecessary imagery in some fanservice scenesPersonal Enjoyment (9.89/10):  I\'m not adding personal enjoyment to the overall average score for all categories, as it will skew the results.  I won\'t lie, this series is a favorite of mine.  It is my guilty pleasure anime, it was my friday afternoons, it was really the first series I marathoned in an entire night when the first season was finished airing.  When I first saw that Date a Live was getting a second season, I was ecstatic, itching for the spring season to come out, as this was my most anticipated series of the season.  Coming out of it now, I can say a few things seriously.  (I\'m coming out of fanboy mode now.)Date A Live is one of the better harems you\'ll find.  It\'s not the best one, but it\'s one of the better ones.  Date A Live isn\'t a masterpiece.  In fact, it has some negative feedback on some points on which I can agree on.  By harem standards, it\'s a good choice to watch.  By anime standards in general, you can find a lot of other things to watch.  This season did a lot of things well that made the series shine more than before, but at the same time, it did some things wrong.  If you don\'t mind fanservice or harems and like a decent plot that has mystery, action, and romance elements to it, then this series is for you.Overall Score: (7.91/10) protagonist Shidou, our sixteen year old main protagonist, who has the ability to seal these otherworldly beings called spirits, who just so happen to all look like attractive/adorable human females from this world.

If you don\'t mind fanservice or harems and like a decent plot that has mystery, action, and romance elements to it, then this series is for you.Overall Score: (7.91/10)', ""Ok, where do I start with this massive disappointment. I'll start off with saying that I loved the first Date-A-Live anime and I do not consider myself the biggest fan of this series and I have not read the light novels but this sequel was so disappointing. If this sequel follows the light novel exactly then good job but this sequel pales so much in comparison to the first one because nothing new happens! Date-A-Live II feels like an exact copy and paste of what happened in the last anime but with new spirits. Yes I know it is a sequel or second season to...be more exact, but shouldn't sequels and especially second seasons be exploring the mysteries that the previous left behind? I'm going to stop ranting and get into the review.Story: 3The story is exactly the same, but only with the introduction of new spirits and our previous spirits are living peacefully with Shido until the bad guys mess everything up. (I'm assuming everybody that is reading this has either heard the gist of the story in the last anime or has watched this series) I understand this is a second season so it should be similar in terms of story but this is almost an exact copy of the previous story. Now is the story bad, not exactly. This is a parody series so don't expect a great story and I honestly like the twist of instead of fighting the spirits, you date them. But it's the fact that  they did not do anything new other than introduce some new spirits that become pointless in the end. They could have focused more on the origins of the spirits or Shido's power, but instead we get the exact same thing as last time. I'm not sure if I made my point clear or not but I'm moving on.Art: 7One thing that is good about this series is the art. It has not changed too much from the first anime and I do like the fact it has not changed a lot because I really like the art. The colors are bright and vibrant yet dark and malevolent when need be. The characters are well drawn, and the battles are still amazing. Edit: I have just re-watched an episode and I noticed that the character designs do change slightly when shifting from different scenes for whatever, but not all the time. But still very annoying. I have bumped the score down to a 7 from an 8Sound: 7The sound isn't too great. I loved the OP, it was very catchy but that's just my opinion. The ED was decent, it has been a while since I watched it so I can't remember the song but I do remember skipping the ED song so I personally didn't like it. As for the insert songs, nothing stood out but everything felt like it belonged, again it has been a while since I watched this so I may be wrong.Character: 6I would give this score lower if only it was based only on the new characters introduced, but the old ones do appear quite frequently (I did like the previous spirits better but I do find Tohka and Tobiichi quite annoying at times) The new spirits that appear are the twins: Yuzuru and Kaguya both controlling the power of winds. I do like these two but I felt like there introduction and getting them into the harem took way too long. And finally we have the new spirit Miku. Just like Hatsune Miku her power is her voice, most notably singing. (Coincidence, I think not) As for her character, I found her very annoying and made me want to drop this series. And there is some noticeable change  within our main Hero and Heroine Shido and Tohka. Shido for some reason gets a huge power spike out of nowhere, it is implied that it comes from his power to seal spirits but we learn nothing of that, and Tohka becomes very clingy to Shido, and she was already pretty clingy before but it felt like it has been toned up a bit. Not to mention the fact that she seems very useless, as in weak for no apparent reason and now needs to depend on Shido for everything unlike before when she could haul ass and only need Shido for food. Back on track, new characters were okay, Tohka for some reason becomes very weak and Shido becomes overpowered. In short character related stuff was okay but could have been better. Oh yeah, and the new villains are cool but needs more explanation behind what they are doing and why they are doing it.Enjoyment: 5The copy and paste story was okay when I first started watching this, because I liked how it hasn't changed but became annoyed when I realized I am watching almost the exact same thing as last time. I know what I said was a bit contradictory but my underlying point is that I don't like watching the exact same thing especially when a sequel repeats what happens before just with different characters. Another thing I did not like about this is how many times they reused the jokes from the first season. The jokes were funny at first but they used it too many times that it just got annoying.  I do like how this season there was an actual villain, but the villains motive was never explained well. In short, this had a good start but lost momentum as it progressed.Overall: 6With a copy and paste story, boring spirits compared to the first season and a plot that loses steam as it progressed, it's surprising how it gets a 6 in my book. Well with the previous spirits occasionally making appearances, especially Kurumi (my favorite spirit) who plays a big roll in the final battle, good animation and a really catchy opening saves it from complete disaster. Also it was only 10 episode, thank god for that. be more exact, but shouldn't sequels and especially second seasons be exploring the mysteries that the previous left behind? I'm going to stop ranting and get into the review.Story: 3The story is exactly the same, but only with the introduction of new spirits and our previous spirits are living peacefully with Shido until the bad guys mess everything up. (I'm assuming everybody that is reading this has either heard the gist of the story in the last anime or has watched this series) I understand this is a second season so it should be similar in terms of story but this is almost an exact copy of the previous story. Now is the story bad, not exactly. This is a parody series so don't expect a great story and I honestly like the twist of instead of fighting the spirits, you date them. But it's the fact that  they did not do anything new other than introduce some new spirits that become pointless in the end. They could have focused more on the origins of the spirits or Shido's power, but instead we get the exact same thing as last time. I'm not sure if I made my point clear or not but I'm moving on.Art: 7One thing that is good about this series is the art. It has not changed too much from the first anime and I do like the fact it has not changed a lot because I really like the art. The colors are bright and vibrant yet dark and malevolent when need be. The characters are well drawn, and the battles are still amazing. Edit: I have just re-watched an episode and I noticed that the character designs do change slightly when shifting from different scenes for whatever, but not all the time. But still very annoying. I have bumped the score down to a 7 from an 8Sound: 7The sound isn't too great. I loved the OP, it was very catchy but that's just my opinion. The ED was decent, it has been a while since I watched it so I can't remember the song but I do remember skipping the ED song so I personally didn't like it. As for the insert songs, nothing stood out but everything felt like it belonged, again it has been a while since I watched this so I may be wrong.Character: 6I would give this score lower if only it was based only on the new characters introduced, but the old ones do appear quite frequently (I did like the previous spirits better but I do find Tohka and Tobiichi quite annoying at times) The new spirits that appear are the twins: Yuzuru and Kaguya both controlling the power of winds. I do like these two but I felt like there introduction and getting them into the harem took way too long. And finally we have the new spirit Miku. Just like Hatsune Miku her power is her voice, most notably singing. (Coincidence, I think not) As for her character, I found her very annoying and made me want to drop this series. And there is some noticeable change  within our main Hero and Heroine Shido and Tohka. Shido for some reason gets a huge power spike out of nowhere, it is implied that it comes from his power to seal spirits but we learn nothing of that, and Tohka becomes very clingy to Shido, and she was already pretty clingy before but it felt like it has been toned up a bit. Not to mention the fact that she seems very useless, as in weak for no apparent reason and now needs to depend on Shido for everything unlike before when she could haul ass and only need Shido for food.

This time around the stakes are even higher and the conquests more difficult.There is a huge problem with Date A Live II and that is they changed the formula of the show. It used to be a decent comedy with really good action sequences and now it\'s more of a show with decent action sequences with overused comedy. On top of that the ""Date"" part of the show is gone. Do...you remember when Shidou took the girls in S1 out on dates? Doesn\'t happen in S2.To be fair one of the reasons there are not really dates it the difficulty in the conquests themselves this time around are more akin to the difficulty the entire cast had against Kurumi back in S1. The first conquest are twins, Kaguya and Yuzuru. The former being a tsundere and the other one of those quiet types. The other girl is Miku, whose gimmick is that she really hates men.As for the rest of the cast nothing really changes. They make returns, but you might be surprised which ones actually get some of the spotlight. That said none of them make any types of growth. For the most part most things stay the same. This includes Kotori where the ending of S1 kinda made you feel like there would be some big revelation in this season. There isn\'t. You\'ll also notice I didn\'t even talk about the new characters in any detail. That\'s because what I told you is essentially their entire character. They are just kind of boring. In S1 the characters were one-dimensional but entertaining. Here they are one-dimensional and boring.Now let\'s get to the main villain, or for that matter all the villains. Like last season they don\'t show up until near the end of the anime but they are handled even more poorly. They don\'t really explain their motives or why they have to do what they are doing in the first place. That or they are simply extremely shallow.Now for some good things. The animation is really good and flashy.Action sequences are pretty crisp, despite not being interesting. The anime also makes great use of sound effects. From a production stand point it has a lot of the flash.I know I might have seemed some what hard on the show but in all honesty it\'s not a terrible anime, but it is a pretty significant step down from a show that was only pretty good to begin with. you remember when Shidou took the girls in S1 out on dates?

It’s obvious from the pictures that something here is going to go wrong. We already have enough goofy characters. We don’t need more. We want to see more of Tohka, Yoshino, Tokisaki and Reinne – all entertaining personalities that tend to light up any scene they’re in. Tokisaki wasn’t really defeated in the previous season, so there’s clearly more to do with her. Why add more?The additions are not that bad, but they’re bad in a very predictable way. It starts with the twins. The problem they introduce is different enough, but just look...at them. The character design is sexy, but it’s more sexy than pretty. The previous Spirits’ design tried to tell us more about their character than to make them sexually appealing. Tokisaki is the only one with an actual sexy design, but in this case it’s part of her character.It’s not like they’re completely empty shells. They are pretty entertaining in the scenes they’re in, and the conflict they’re in could lead to a very interesting relationship. You quickly forget that they’re dressed for an S&M club because their antics come from the same creative mind that gave us Yoshino’s wide-eyed fear and Tokisaki’s creepiness. Their fights are just as fun as anything in the previous season.Sadly, there is not enough of that. We spend two episodes with the twins and some embarrassing fanservice. The previous season never had that amount. What happens in these episodes feels like it came from those shows that just want to push the envelope. It’s not funny and it’s out of place. The show still rolls along mostly without ecchi – you’d expect the camera to linger on Reinne when she appears in a bikini, but you barely have time to register there’s a teddy bear between her breasts. What was the point of those awkward scenes in the bedrooms?Miku is a little better. There is something slightly off-putting in her design. Maybe it’s because she looks like Coco from Mermaid Melody with a new paint job. Still, her character is interesting and she provides a good conflict. Once you get over the over-sexualizing, the new Spirits offer problems that are different enough than the previous to show the creators haven’t run of new ideas.In fact, they have too many ideas. We have a new antagonist who is interesting until the climax. Jessica appears, which could help add some depth to the whole wing of the AST. Ellen, the Bad Guy’s sidekick occasionally looks like there is an interesting personality underneath that cool hair. There is even a school festival that slides smoothly to the plot instead of feeling tokenistic.It doesn’t build to anything. The climax is the real weak point of the series.. The previous climax was also messy, but Tokisaki lead it. It felt unhinged, out of control and unique to the series. Somewhere around the eight episode, the series becomes one extended action scene Shido mows down a lot of mooks, but the real causalties are the personalities.Some characters are already halfway to gone before the finale. Kotori and Yoshino are barely there, which makes no sense. The few times Yoshino appears, struggling with understanding a soap opera are what made the original so fun. The climax finally kills them all. Kotori and Yoshino go AWOL. The twins are pushed to the back, almost as if they were never there. Jessica is thrown into the action scene with a conclusion that deserved a much better build-up. Origami is still an unnecessary part of the harem. Miku becomes a tsundere. Bad Guy reveals he’s bad because he’s bad and Mana is still just as useless.Tohka is the only one who’s given some room to do things. Her clinginess to Shido is pretty annoying, but there’s enough of the fish-out-of-water antics that make her fun. She eventually becomes the center. If so, why introduce the new Spirits, if they’re just pushed to the back in the end?Why is this so generic? What happened to the bravery? The series used to flinch at violence, to question whether it’s a legitimate method to solve problems. It was its whole charm. It forced the hero to interact with the ‘bad guys’. Violence is frowned upon. Now Shido mows down faceless soldiers like he’s Sylvester Stallone in a generic building. There aren’t even cool visuals to accompany it. He just swings his sword and people fall down.Speaking of Shido, he hasn’t changed. He’s still boring and has no charisma. He’s still given a lot of situations that can be great for character development, and he does nothing with it. How can you even write such a dull character? Asimov isn’t exactly the master of creating human beings, but he gives the game pieces (In Asimov, there are no characters, just game pieces) some traits that make them recognizable. Shido is nothing but a plot-mover. The story is clearly about him. He’s the star of the climax this time, so make him worthwhile. Alas, everything he does is just for convenience.It’s not a problem of length. 10 episodes is a little too short, but there was enough time that was better spent on other things. We didn’t need all these fanservice and the finale could have been a bit more exciting than just killing faceless people. There is still some fuel in this franchise. Most of the new ideas that were introduced are pretty good. The new Spirits are a worthwhile addition. This season does even less with everything, and the result is just a shopping list of cool ideas. The series doesn’t deserve this as a swan song, but I worry that feature developments will stay, will, undeveloped.2 dates out of 5 at them.

But neither way, let\'s talk about the latest season of Date A Live, Date A Live II.So Date A Live II just follows the story from the first season. This sequel adapts the Light Novel\'s Volume 5-7 that only lasted for 10 episodes so the story is pretty rushed. And also, the first episode itself was a filler so basically, if you hate Tohka, just skip it to the second episode.Keitarou Motonaga still directs this season. Notably known for directing Legend of the Galactic Heroes, School Days and more,...he did a good job for directing this series although there are some failures and sorts.I\'m not kidding if I\'ll say the quality of the animation in this season was terrible. Sure, the fanservice scenes was kinda good but the action scene was poor animated. The last 2 episode\'s animation really proves that AIC Plus+ is really short in budget. So in short, the art was mediocre.A good thing about this season is the sound. Pretty comparable to Sidonia no Kishi\'s sounds but the main point here is when there\'s an action scene, I felt that it was an action scene because of the OST. sweet ARMS returns to perform the OP song ""Trust in You"". Kaori Sadohara (who is an actual member of sweet ARMS) performs the ED theme ""Day to Story"" which is pretty good and a reliever of the show.If you\'ll ask about the voice acting. The casts from the first season returned but I\'ll pinpoint Marina Inoue here voicing Tohka. I thought that she gave justice to develop Tohka\'s voice in this season, maturing her voice and her song performance beats up Minori Chihara songs. And going to Minori, voicing Miku Izayoi not fits for her. The truth is, I\'m pretty hyped for her voice but it turns out that it lacks something. Maaya Uchida and Sarah Emi Bridcut did a good job voicing the Yamai twins. But overall, I don\'t have any complaints besides Miku\'s voice.Lets go to the characters. Well, Shido took a level to become a baddass which is a good character development for him. But same old as in the first season. Still oblivious and acting like an hero wanting to save a Princess and only relies to Kotori\'s orders. Either way, his baddassness is pretty good.Tohka returns as your naive but a sweet Princess which I think also developed too in a way that she tries to understands Shido and its actually good for her to be honest and rather became a supporting character rather than the main character. She too, took a level to become a baddass and Episode 6 and Episode 10 managed to make her shine.Origami, Yoshino, Kotori and Kurumi just pushed to a side to become supporting characters. But if you love Kurumi, she will appear later so don\'t rage about it. The three new Spirits will not be spoiled for you but they are still, added to Shido\'s harem.Overall, a simple \'very good\' is my enjoyment in this series. There are a lot of pros and cons but still, Date A Live II is a heck of a ride for its fans and viewers.

The first half of the show deals with these competitive Yamai Sisters, Kaguya and Yuzuru, who were the same spirit until one day the two were split up into two. Now they compete with each other to prove that they are the real Yamai. They have had 99 matches (25-25-49) and there last competition is to see who can seduce Shido and he would be the deciding factor. The second half of the show is Shido trying to save a spirit called ""Diva"",...Miku Izayoi, but the problem is that she is bias against males because she use to be a pop star who got caught up in a false scandal after refusing to sleep with a TV producer. She later lost her voice due to psychogenic aphonia and made contact with a sprit named ""Phantom"", the same spirit that gave Kotori her spirit powers, and regained her voice to sing again. Aside from the spirits there is a new threat called Deus Ex Machina (DEM) and I\'m going to be honest I forgot what their goal was, but I think it\'s on the lines of world conquest or something like that.Let\'s talk about the Yamai sisters. Kaguya is very childish and has an outspoken personality. Yuzuru speaks very robot like by stating her response and then giving the actual response. Like if I said, ""The Giants won the World Series"". She would more or less say ""Confirmation. The Giants did win the World Series."" Miku is not only a pop star, but also she is attracted to those of the same sex making her fall for Shidou would prove to be quite the challenge.There is one joke that is set up at the beginning of the show where you could see coming a mile away and you know it\'s coming, but you just want to see the reactions of the characters.Once again the animation is pretty good.The one downfall is the increase in fan service. I really don\'t mind fan service in general, but when the show has more fan service than it\'s previous season it gets awkward.Date A Live II is still a very good show. This show is just a guilty pleasure for me and once again it\'s a show that I could just sit down and just enjoy it and not think is it as good as others say it is.

If you have been, then you must feel like you\'re probably missing out on something otherworldly, something you can\'t quite understand. Date A Live is, in short, a figurative abomination and requires aforementioned brain shutdown sequence to even get the slightest inkling of enjoyment. I entered searching for a quick time-killing fantasy action anime with some cute waifus & some harem, and I left...literally feeling empty inside. There\'s nothing. All the cynicism I\'ve been harboring inside my heart has been purged within 22 episodes. I have nothing unique to offer to the world anymore - except this review.*NOTE: This review encompasses both seasons, as well as the overall rating of two*Shows like Evangelion, SeL, TLOGH, etc., are often put in that category of ""if you didn\'t like them, you didn\'t understand them"". I think Date A Live deserves a spot in that bubble, to be honest. I\'m a firm believer that there\'s nothing in this world we can\'t understand, as long as we give it enough time and research. Yet, this show alone has broken me, has changed my very views on storytelling. This has got to be the biggest pile of massive shit the writer has ever taken on my brain since the inception of mankind. I\'ve read hundreds of books, hundreds of fan-fiction short stories, watched hundreds of movies, TV shows & anime, and never once in my entire life did I want to put a massive fucking nuclear bomb between writer\'s eyes and then piss on his/hers corpse with all my might. This is a disgrace to writing. No, scratch that. This is the end of storytelling - this thing, right here. It has warranted the title of \'The Death of Storytelling\' for being the biggest shitstorm in the history of mankind.I can overlook plotholes, I can overlook deus-ex machinas, I can overlook bullshit thrown in our faces for the sake of drama/comedy/horror, but this thing here goes beyond that. At this moment I\'m angry with MAL because I\'m unable to grade the ""story"" of this thing below zero, below the levels of sanity and any conceivable comprehension. Whoever wrote this thing, I beg you, kill yourself. I fucking beg you. If you want to, I\'ll kill myself with you so we can both leave this world. You don\'t deserve neither a pen nor a keyboard ever put in your hands. You are stupider than the main girl from Aho-girl. You reached levels that even the lowest of bacterial forms have surpassed millions of years ago. Yes, that\'s how bad the ""story"" is. It\'s as if you put the story of High School DxD on acid, heroin, cocaine, crocodile, massive doses of lithium, xanax, and virtually every conceivable drug in the universe, and then took a huge steaming dump all over it, and created this. This. Fuck this to the damning hell. Burn it. Burn it before it breeds. This is the lowest level of storytelling I have ever witnessed in my entire life. 50 shades of grey seems like a masterpiece now. Twilight is the 21st ct Shakespeare. End this. Bye. I\'m not even going to bother jotting down the things I found to be abhorrent; if you didn\'t catch them yourself, or if you consider this to be a good story, you\'re as good as dead to me.Art & sound, for the first time in my life, are the only reason I was able to finish something - and you know what? I hate myself for it. I should have dropped this in the 4th episode of the 1st season and never looked back, but I always thought it\'d get better. For the most part, animation is stiff and average, and even during some of the major battles I wouldn\'t expect much. It\'s colorful, yes, but it\'s nothing mind-blowing to be honest. It has some decent animation here and there, and I hate myself for giving props to this anime for any department, but I have to.Music is sparse, but some of it that\'s in there is quite good. There are 2 tracks that I still remember, and were the high point of this anime. Then why 4 to sound? Because of everything else. Sound effects were terrible, voice acting was near-unbearable, reaching dub-levels, and that randomly-thrown pop song by the end of the 2nd season sealed it for me. I\'m done.Now we come to the characters. The only reason I gave 2 here is because I couldn\'t, in my right mind, even them out with the story, because they\'re not that bad - mind you, they\'re still dreadful, just not as bad as the story. Our main character is every harem lead in the history of everything, with 0 deviation from the norm. Why do these girls like him? Because they\'re fucking insane and mentally challenged, that\'s why. There\'s no other reason to like him. If girls fell in love with the first guy that told them ""I\'ll save you"" and ""I\'ll never reject you"", every low-life would have a girlfriend. This character gets no development for 22 episodes, nill, nothing. He\'s ever-shouting piece of plank that pathetic fuckers can ""relate to"" and ""immerse themselves with"" and he has no other purpose. You can literally switch him out with any generic harem lead and nothing would change. Abso-fucking-lutely nothing.Ooh, you think other characters are better? Think again my friend. Have you ever watched harem anime? You must have. Everyone has. It\'s the most widespread genre in anime. So, if you did, you\'ll have recognized these girls the moment they appear on the screen. Why? Because all of these are by-the-book harem girls you\'ve seen about a fucking bajlitionth time before, and if you aren\'t tired of them by now, then Lord Spaghetti help you. Energetic, shy, calm, weird, imouto, 2nd imouto because 1 wasn\'t enough, all these things may just as well be replaced by other things from other harems. There\'s so little development in this anime, that evolution of mankind was faster. You might say that every girl ""develops"" because at first they ""hate him"" and then they ""love him"". You know what? Fuck you. That\'s not development you uneducated ape. Go back to school.I\'ve never seen such generic, insane and demeaning cast in any anime I\'ve ever watched. No, not even Sky Wizards Academy (which is still worse, by the way, only because it has worse animation; rest is pretty much on par, I\'d argue even better in certain places). Relinquish in this feast of stupidity and insanity, relinquish and join me in madness, for that is the only place the poor ones who\'ve watched this belong.Believe it or not, I gave season one 5. Why? Because it was, by all means, your average harem. It had some decent action, at times it was funny, and I didn\'t feel like I was marathoning LoTR Director\'s Cut Edition each time I watched an episode. First season felt like a set-up, kind of like HS DxD, and I was fine with that. Yet, second season tried to be more than it already is and, well, you already know the result. I hope to every manmade spiritual thingy that this thing never gets any more seasons. I feel sorry for animators who had to animate this. I feel sorry for everyone even remotely involved with this outside of the writer. I feel sorry for TV stations that had to air this. I feel sorry for new anime viewers who know nothing better. Ugh ... I\'m done.This is abomination. End. Disgrace. Everything that\'s supposed to be the backbone to a creation is instead a rotten piece of shit, born only to pollute the innocent minds. Fuck.

This.', 'This is my first review, so please don\'t hurt me. Also, this is my second time writing this due to the face >.(then an arrow pointing to the left) causing everything after it to be erased after submitting. Apologies on rushing.This anime needs justice, and it needs it now.Story (8):Alright, so many parts were rushed due to the anime being only 10 episodes. The first 2 or so episodes were, in my opinion, crap. After that, the anime really got its sh*t together. First off, consider all the genres this anime has. Don\'t expect it tohave extremely good plot like other anime that don\'t...focus on the genres this does. Now that we got that out of the way, onto my actual thoughts.Sometimes, I would stop and think ""is that it?"". I myself have never read the light novel or read the manga. The manga hasn\'t actually progressed past Shido talking to Tohka for the first time (I believe). So I can\'t really say that the story was great. Nonetheless, it really good for what it is. I can\'t delve too much on this without spiling anything, so I\'ll just have to say that it was excellent.Art (10):Can anyone really argue that the art isn\'t anything short of amazing? All the girls have their own special and unique design with lots of colors. Nothing to complain about here. The scenery is also beautifully designed and never boring. Oh, and did I mention the girls? They are just absolutely beautiful. I doubt many people would disagree on me with this. No character designs look alike (except for the Yamai sisters which doesn\'t count).I just love it, can\'t get enough of the beautiful art.Sound (9):It was nice to have Diva actually voiced by the singer Chihara Minori. Some may think her voice can be too high pitched, but I\'m completely fine with that. She sang the OPs (and EDs?) of Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere.The OP,in my opinion was great and memorable. I find myself listening to it from time to time. As for the ED, I don\'t have much to say about it since I\'m not a fan of music with that kind of tune.The background music is never out of place and can describe the scene well. It can set the mood for certain yanderes or a funny scene.Character (7):Don\'t get me wrong, I love the characters. But there just wasn\'t enough time to get enough airtime for all the characters.for example, the Uamai Twins didn\'t get much development and I was a little disappointed. If only it got 2 more episodes or they didn\'t mess around in the first episode, maybe, just maybe, the characters could\'ve been developed on much better. Just my 2 cents on that topic.The characters are very love able (Kurumi is the best girl!) and can just be soooooooo cute. Kurumi is just one of the most awesome characters (and OP) in this series.Also, drum roll please, our protagonist (Shido) grew some balls! Ironically he grew them while cross-dressing but it was a glorious moment. Can\'t go much more on that topic to prevent spoilers.Enjoyment:I found myself watching episodes 4-10 in a single sitting. I just couldn\'t tell myself to not watch the next episode. The suspence would\'ve killed me! I slept at 5 AM just to finish the anime!Sometimeswe forget that anime is all about entertainment, and whether we enjoy it or not is what determines if it was good or not. It\'d be like giving a hentai a bad review solely because the story was crap. It\'s so we can enjoy it, no matter what flaws it had.Yes, I didn\'t touch up on the flaws, and it is you to decide whether you absolutely can\'t watch this anime with those flaws. But for me, this is my review and I\'m sticking to it.Date a Live II, an excellent anime.This is LolCaptain signing out.*please excuse the rushed review, it\'s 2 AM and I really need to start watching my anime.* focus on the genres this does.

First thing that struck me was the change in art, which, for me, was very unwelcoming. The opening soundtrack was, undeniably very good (as expected from SWEET arms), and the closing wasn't bad either.The second season was meant to be the general plot development season, however, the studio was too disorganized and couldn't notice that it was beyond their budget. They had to kill the story off right when the main plot twist was meant to happen and they spent too little time developing and concentrating on the...different characters, I read the light novel, and most of the details were left out.I heard that the studio is going to make a movie to finish it off, so if you ask me, just save this season for when the movie comes out. different characters, I read the light novel, and most of the details were left out.I heard that the studio is going to make a movie to finish it off, so if you ask me, just save this season for when the movie comes out."", 'Rarely do I say the second season was as good or even better than the first.

Lets just hope the finishing movie I\'m about to watch next follows suit...The story is obviously how it continues from the first season (which I must say is also very good), when you read the plot in your head, understandably you might think ""what a shit story line"", but it only really starts to makes sense once you watch it, and although it is slightly ridiculous, you have to remember... This is a fucking anime.Overall I did enjoy the story although there is room for improvement...to which I could drone on for hours about little niggly bits I wont bother, its fucking half 12 at night, I have work tomorrow and I\'m knackeredThe art work I cant really fault, but it would nicer if it was a tad more crisper and sleek, but hey ho I cant expect too much.I watched the dub because I\'m not ""A Hardcore Anime enthusiast"", but fuck what people think about dub, It was licensed by funimation so its obviously going to be good.

The voice acting was very good, but I did feel at certain points the should have been more sound, or at least a better sound in certain scenes, but this didn\'t bother me too much.The Character development sort of tailed off from the first season, it didn\'t really expand too much on the new characters, but it was probably for the best, otherwise it would have gotten rather complex.Overall I have enjoyed this anime well; it nicely balanced comedy and ecchi scenes (some of which I think I enjoyed a little too much) and the super duper serious dramatic stuff, it had an interesting and ... different plot to say the least, but somehow it really does work, and lastly good sound and animation to execute it all quite nicely.

I was a little against the mecha genre, but this anime has a really good balance between mecha, school, and harem. With this second season, I enjoyed the advancement in the plot and relationships. Although the plot is nice, some of the major plot points came out of nowhere and still confuse me (introduction of characters, the cause of major plot points like the ending). I really enjoyed the music in the anime especially in the final scenes of the last episode. Overall, if you enjoyed the first season, then the second season is the same....I hope for some OVA or hint at a next season, because the last episode just drops a plot point and ends it right there.

Each character has their own sinister track that fits them perfectly. The story is an incredibly cool twist of fate that manages to hinge on the humor of dating. The relationship bonds that develope are strong and standing. The character art is also very impressive and the action that ensues during battles is packed. This series will have you rolling in laughter with each episode. The only thing I have a problem with are a couple of aweful charcaters that were injected... If it weren't for the brat sister archetype and increadibly...awkward hyper-sexualized puppet child, this anime could have come very close to squeezing an impossible 10/10 from me.

You must watch this."", '*MINOR SPOILERS*Ah this one, it\'s one of my favorites, and for good reason....So starting with the story, it\'s pretty much an ""Addition"" to the first season, as Shido still tries to seal away more spirits. Toward the ending it ramps up, as Shido tries to stop the DEM and save Tohka. But, not much else ""Story"" wise here.This, like many others, has a really nice artstyle and animation to it. Everything is so fluid and it\'s all so pleasing to the eye.The OST is alright, i enjoy it, and the English Dub is also really well done, i love the how everyone sounds. But again,...not much else to say here.So here is where the anime shines. You have some characters that you may be familiar with, and then you have a few new ones. Now, this anime does a perfect job at having a diversity of personality from each character..and i love that. Being a harem anime, expect a lot of new girl characters and only one guy character, as far as i\'m aware. But overall, the anime has a good diversity of personalities, and the characters are all very memorable.The overall enjoyment for this anime is a 10/10, i loved every minute of this anime. Many won\'t agree with me, as they\'ll say things like, ""Oh well there\'s no story"", and i personally think that THESE type of anime, where it focuses HEAVILY on characters and not the story, and just has that fun, playful vibe, just makes it all the more enjoyable to watch. And i personally think it\'s good to just watch this type of anime to get a bigger diversity, and to take a break from the other story heavy anime that i have or am watching, again, this is all my opinion. I do however, hope they do make a season 3, i can see some more development there, as we don\'t know what Kurumi is going to do with Shido...anyways this is a good watch if you\'re ok with lackluster story, and memorable characters. not much else to say here.So here is where the anime shines.

And i personally think it\'s good to just watch this type of anime to get a bigger diversity, and to take a break from the other story heavy anime that i have or am watching, again, this is all my opinion. I do however, hope they do make a season 3, i can see some more development there, as we don\'t know what Kurumi is going to do with Shido...anyways this is a good watch if you\'re ok with lackluster story, and memorable characters.', 'There will be no big difference from the 1st season of Date A Live series (the 1st season: Spring 2013, 12 eps + OVA, Studio AIC PLUS+ and the 2nd season: Spring 2014, 10 eps + OVA, Studio Production IMS). The story still tells about the spirits, whose destroying power are so damn dangerous for the future of the world. These women spirits then being haunted by the AST, somewhat futuristic organization with so many handy weapon to handle spirits, and even the missions to kill \'em. On the other hand, there is an organization called Ratatoskr whose mission to seal the spirit powers by...luring them with ""a date.""The one who carries the task of dating the spirits is Itsuka Shidou, As time passes, Shidou discovers the true form of his younger sister, Itsuka Kotori, as a spirit too. Itsuka Kotori is the one behind the Ratatoskr organization, the head of Fraxinus under Ratatoskr\'s command. Later, Shidou makes his move and successfully bring the spirit under control, sealing their powers by dating [Shidou makes them believe that they are precious and wanting by someone so they will learn how to love and embrace others rather than destroying living being with their unbelievable spirits power]. The 2nd season brings the same story, but with new characters to fill the scenes.\u200bThe show indeed silly and funny while the battle scenes are good. As the starter, the humour was very bad. Tohka powers are fluctuating due to her suspicion over Shidou and Origami affected by the television show she and Yoshino routinely watch. This and all jokes of story opening irritates me since it makes everything looks like silly coincidences, and it turns worse when analytically it happens just for the bridge to the main course of story.The detected Spirit power comes from Tohka makes her being targeted and immediately be pursued to get killed. Summary the silly television show raises Tohka\'s power and lead her into a mess faster. In the middle of our main course, we are entertained by new characters and so many fan services out of nowhere as  a downfall. I don\'t mind with fan services as long as it places right on certain situations like the 1st season. The 2nd season presented the ecchi-ness in such low level of beast.Due to many newcomers in this series, I can\'t identify clearly the development of characters. It feels like all of them forced to involve in every new conditions and troubles that lead to the main course but vaguely, weakly developed. The character introductions seem not natural anymore, the coincidental meetings are not making sense.If I should combine two aspects, animation and character development, then my opinion is the animation went so damn well but the story was in rush, it was not good since I could feel the tense of the fighting without the good story and development followed. From the story aspect, Date A Live II series is my guilty pleasure, an average but has a pretty nice animation. The enjoyment boosts a bit around the end of the show, two last episodes are such a blast! All hail war among AST & Spirits ⁽ˆ⁰ˆ⁾The music is so-so. OP theme is sung by sweet ARMS ""Trust in you"" and ED theme is sung by Kaori Sadohara ""Day to Story"". Sadly the catchy character songs aren\'t my favorite either. Only the insert songs are quite nice, but just by the insert songs won\'t help much. What needs to be underlined is Kurumi\'s seiyuu scintillating voice, gives only Kurumi extra point in my sight. The mysterious, psychotic aura of Kurumi is increasing unstoppable whenever she speaks in absorbing tone.I still enjoy the series because of its graphic and intense fighting, especially last two episodes it\'s still burning in my brain. Feels like the story shows us the meaning of trusting someone and try the hardest even if others stop to looking at you. My rate is 7 only.Pros:Good animationIntense fighting scenesCons:Overwhelming amount of fan serviceThe progress of story is somewhat so silly (like ecchiness only) luring them with ""a date.""The one who carries the task of dating the spirits is Itsuka Shidou, As time passes, Shidou discovers the true form of his younger sister, Itsuka Kotori, as a spirit too.

That was essentially my first thought as I tried up to sum up my feelings about Date A Live. The main reason why I started watching this anime was because someone I know has it in her favorites list and I thought to myself 'eh. Why not.'... So I watched the first season and was pleasantly surprised. Harem anime have been some of my least favorite in the past, so I expected this one to be fairly similar... but honestly, the first season of this anime was really, really good. Mainly because...it managed to escape quite a chunk of the normal things that harem anime go through, while still putting a spin on the things that it did do like almost every other harem out there. One scene that's still stuck with me is the Onsen episode in the first season, which was genuinly funny and was something I hadn't even remotely witnessed before. So after that first season, my expectations for the second season were quite high... and as you might've guessed from the very first sentence and my rating, I was thoroughly disappointed.So why's that?? Well, mainly because the second season was missing both the cleverness and the heart of the first one... though it started out promising. The first episode felt just like something from the first season... but from the second episode onward, everything went straight down. Just like the first season, there was an Onsen episode here... but unlike back then, this one was just a plain, generic and unfun one, which would go on to set the tone for the remainder of the anime. The somewhat unique setting of the MC going on dates with characters and being 'supported' by a team of 'professionals', choosing his answers Visual Novel style was replaced by dull drama and fights that just weren't interesting whatsoever; the interesting characters of the first season (especially Yoshino) were put on the bench in favor of new characters that turned out to be as lively and engaging as a round of chess on a graveyard and the humor that gave the first season its charm was replaced by one-dimensional characters pretending to hav serious conversations during silly Mecha-suit fights... so in short, everything that made the first season stand out was switched out for generic things that are about as unique as water in Atlantis.That said, it wasn't ALL bad (otherwise my score would've been even lower)... As mentioned above, the first episode was still really, really good and also there was a brief part during the beginning of the second arc where the humor of the first season flashed up again, when he had to dress up as and pretend to be a girl in order to get close to a spefic girl. Also on the rare occasions that the other characters from the first season DID show up, their personalities were kept intact, which was something I had feard would not be the case ('Dark Tohka' notwithstanding). Another thing that the second season did was make me realize just how good the first one had truly been, causing me to retroactively change my rating for that season from 7 to 8 points (which is something I almost never do. Once I've finished a season of an anime, I normally don't touch the score anymore).So in the end, what I'm trying to get at here is that the second season was just completely lacking the heart, genius and charm of the first one and just felt like something that was thrown together with minimal effort just to rake in as much money as possible. Maybe it's just coincidential that there was this huge of a difference in quality once it was produced by a different studio, but I personally don't believe that. Especially since Production IMS is a studio that likes to put out low-effort harem anime (see also 'Hundred' and next season's 'Masou Gakuen HxH')So... that was it for my first review here. To be honest, I've always wanted my first review to be either my favorite anime (Chuunibyou demo koi ga shitai) of all time or my least favorite one (Ookami Shoujo to Kuro Ouji), but the jarring difference in quality between these two seasons just made me want to open my stupid mouth in order to complain a bit. To anyone that's still reading this, thank you for doing so... and sorry for making you read this shit ^^'. Anyhow, have a wonderful day (or night, who knows) and make sure not to fall for scammers.

Goodbye! :D"", 'Now this was unexpected, I had totally forgotten that they were going to do a second season on this. Date a Live is apparently still alive and strong, returning with a second season and apparently an upcoming movie as well. This second season, which relies heavily on the first season for background information, is a more focused, action heavy show than its predecessor. Apparently, the harem in the first season was not large enough so now they\'re adding on three more girls. If you\'re watching this to try to fill some of the galaxy-wide plot or setting holes remaining from the first season you\'re going...to be disappointed, if anything the series just goes and introduces additional plot holes. If you\'re watching this to kill time and enjoy a story driven action/comedy/harem, then this is, admittedly, not that bad.Animation:The animation styling is very similar to the original show. It has nice lighting and shading effects and a wide variety of scene locations. The second arc was a bit abusive in the CGI department but nothing atrocious. All the characters are all easily distinguishable though I must admit it took me an episode or so to catch up with the relevance of all the characters. Facial animation is only average and behaviors of some of the spirits are definitely not in the realistic category. Note that many of the supporting cast from the original return in only marginally-supportive roles, almost like slightly-extended cameos.There is a good deal of action in this show. For the genre, it is definitely one of the more entertaining action pieces with lots of effects and decent choreography. The show is also, indeed, ecchi based so expect a very cliché onsen scene as well as plenty of scantily clad ladies. The ecchi is relatively innocent (intent-wise) as compared to other shows like Maken Ki or Mangaka-san.Sound:The series opens with a fairly nice and purposeful sounding piece. The ED follows a similar vibe with a decent melody and similar instrumentation. The BGM didn\'t catch my attention as much as the original but it serves its purpose well. There are a few insert songs in the second arc, which can be good or bad depending on your take of the VA.The strong VA cast in the original returns for the second season, though a large portion of the screen time is dedicated to new harem candidates. Nevertheless, Marina Inoue is always welcome and Asami Sanada\'s performance as Kurumi is instantly recognizable. I have no qualms with the first arc\'s VAs but Minori Chihara\'s voice just doesn\'t seem to sound that fitting for a diva role, especially the insert songs.Story:Though the second season starts out a bit slow, it soon becomes pretty engaging despite the hilariously bonkers premise behind it all. The show is divided into two separate arcs, with the latter arc being slightly heavier weighted in terms of tension. Both arcs feature a good mix of plot twists, cliffhangers, comedic ecchi, and light romance play. Thus, if you\'re watching from a low involvement level, it\'s pretty good.However, taking a step back, you realize that the story is actually quite lacking compared to the first season. The original ""date"" concept and usefulness of Kotori and her gang are severely diminished, as are the role of many of the other girls from the original. In its place, the story focuses on the new characters and events. As mentioned earlier, the story doesn\'t address much in terms of open questions and only adds further mystery as the plot unfolds. So yes, they will probably sell plenty of copies of the material, but I don\'t feel that they advanced the actual underlying story very much. Likewise, the actual climax could be predicted episodes in advance, and yet still felt very artificially put together.All in all, I\'m very mixed here. I felt that the pacing and mixing of story elements was much improved over the original. However, they sacrificed a lot in doing so.Character:This is still the weakest category for this show. Never do you really feel that the spirits are human-like. Their seemingly unavoidable gravitation towards the protagonist\'s lack of charm is a bit disturbing, and their sudden realization that he supposedly cares for them is weak at best. While some interactions are enjoyable, you never really feel that Shidou has earned the right to be with, well anyone. In addition, there are still way too many supporting characters that do virtually nothing for the user except add confusion and distraction away from the character that matter (such as Jessica Bailey). In summary, my criticism from the first season still rings true here; too much character spamming with little meaningful development.Value:On the bright side, this is a rather short show. If you at least marginally enjoyed the first show, it won\'t take you long to make it through this one. Don\'t expect stellar characters but the entertaining plot should keep you engaged. Let\'s just hope they bridge some of those plot holes one day. to be disappointed, if anything the series just goes and introduces additional plot holes.

It only has two arcs, and only ten episodes unlike its predecessor and it's next season who both have 12 episodes. Certain characters get sidelined like Yoshino, the Yami twins after their arc, Origami, Mana and Kurumi barely gets any screen time, in favor of the Diva and the DEM sideplot , which honestly feels convulated...and unecessary like at least give us some explanations to why you're doing all this shit, then at the end we get another form of Tohka that is a completely different spirit, and Shido saves the day with dates and kisses. Honestly tho that first arc sucks, its barely detailed, and it only last to episode 3 or 4 don't remember at the top of my head. I legitimately don't give a crap about the Yamai twins I don't hate them but I don't like them, and I would be pretty happy if their arc was actually good, but it wasn't so I think they hold this season 2 back. The second arc was kind of a banger tho, The Diva is a really interesting spirit, the fact that she's lesbian, forces Shido to crossdress just so he can interact with her and that she can control people, it felt like something new, it wasn't just see spirit, date spirit, seal spirit, while she does have a pretty standard backstory, for some reason it just works, and it makes me care more about her than the Yamai twins. This second season is definetely worse than season 1, it's only salvaged by its second arc, if it weren't for it I would have given it a 5/10.Pros:-Great artstyle and animation-Great second arc-More Tokha, even tho after all that I still feel the same about her like I did in the first season, still think they could have emphasised her a little bit more.Cons:-The characters that you care about are sidelined except for Tokha-The first arc was not well executed and very lackluster-Ed wasn't good-Introduction of a convulated villain sideplot, like I know it's a sideplot, and that it's only ten episodes but can I get some info on Westcott and Ellen, I have no idea what their trying to achieve, and if their good villains or not.Overall Date A Live season 2 is a inferior product to its predecessor, with it's lackluster first arc, and convulated villain sideplot, the show got carried by its second arc for christs sake, I don't care about the Yamai twins, better characters like Origami, Yoshino, Kurumi are sidelined in favor of new characters that aren't all that looking at you Yamai twins, diva is fine I guess. I would be lying tho if I said I didn't enjoy this show, now would I recommend it to people, not really only watch this if you're a Date A live fan or enthusiast, otherwise don't bother with this and the third season.

I give Date A Live Season 2 a 6/10 for my overall anime score."", ""A series of which I've had fond memories of, Date a Live II incorporates the main gimmick of dating to survive in the previous series and amps it up a notch.New characters are introduced, which, although being pretty much a Harem Anime, I've realized I can still feel sympathy for their situations, rather the average Sword 'Ass' Online anime, Date a Live has many enjoyable scenes for those whom are interested in both the Plot and 'Plot' utilizing comedy to accentuate the characters motivations while also maintaining a relatively serious tone.Date a Live II makes multiple mistakes that the previous series had, but through further...explanation later in the story, those make sense, but since this is a review on the Second Series specifically, one would have to attempt to overlook these 'Hints' to the future, due to the lack of spoilers I must have in this review, I cannot explain what these are, however.Character wise, it still has the same cute and cool cast from the previous series with some new characters I originally thought would be borderline Sadists after seeing their outfits, thankfully, or for some, sadly, this wasn't the case, where their personalities give an overview that in reality these spirits, though having immense power, they are still young women and the emotions conveyed not only by these newcomers but by the old cast perfectly emphasizes the growth made as they are constantly fighting new threats, the only exception to the character growth in their personalities is the primary female protagonist, Tohka, whom still feels that she can't trust the main character even through all the S%@! they have been through, which to me, is only partially understandable, where the protagonist has multiple relationships, this would normally be a problem, except each girl is also friends with each other, so that, in reality is my primary gripe, but hey, one needs at least some tension or else their relationship would get stale, i guess.Overall, I rate it an 8/10, because I'm extremely harsh in my review, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly. explanation later in the story, those make sense, but since this is a review on the Second Series specifically, one would have to attempt to overlook these 'Hints' to the future, due to the lack of spoilers I must have in this review, I cannot explain what these are, however.Character wise, it still has the same cute and cool cast from the previous series with some new characters I originally thought would be borderline Sadists after seeing their outfits, thankfully, or for some, sadly, this wasn't the case, where their personalities give an overview that in reality these spirits, though having immense power, they are still young women and the emotions conveyed not only by these newcomers but by the old cast perfectly emphasizes the growth made as they are constantly fighting new threats, the only exception to the character growth in their personalities is the primary female protagonist, Tohka, whom still feels that she can't trust the main character even through all the S%@! they have been through, which to me, is only partially understandable, where the protagonist has multiple relationships, this would normally be a problem, except each girl is also friends with each other, so that, in reality is my primary gripe, but hey, one needs at least some tension or else their relationship would get stale, i guess.Overall, I rate it an 8/10, because I'm extremely harsh in my review, but I still enjoyed it thoroughly."", ""Don't read this if you want to read a short review or one with a lot of positive stuff in it, I will mainly write about what I didn't like and it became quite long. Since it was quite long, I also couldn't be bothered to read it again to check for grammar or redundant parts. This might be interesting to read if you wonder about the flaws of the show from the point of view of someone who actually enjoyed watching it overall.A fatal flaw of this show is that while it’s kind of like a harem series and the very idea of making...girls fall in love with you, at least to some extent(since “date” is even in the title and going on dates and trying to make people fall for you is most of what this thing is about) means the ending should be one in which he’s married to everyone, right? He should get all, or at least most, of the girls that he’s seducing. That’s the very point here, that’s what this is about or should be about. It’s not a story where he should romantically fancy just one or two people and decide upon who he likes the most. That’s not the deal here, or at least it shouldn’t be. But all too often, harem stories are just fake garbage, sadly. I don’t care whether or not it’s realistic to keep several girls with different personalities, love them all somewhat equally and for them to be satisfied with the situation. No, of course it’s not realistic irl. That, however, doesn’t mean it’s not perfectly plausible in a fantasy story, especially when the plot is far weirder and riddled with holes and chaos than something like having several wives could ever be.Monogamy and polygamy and the romance stories born from those settings are very different and comparing them is just, excuse my language, retarded. In monogamy, it’s about deep love with a single partner, in polygamy, it’s more about an unified love between several people and the beautiful bond all of them build as they pretty much become one big family, more focus should be put on the balance between all of them than deep, individual love. When you make a story like this and it somehow seems more like many of these girls just love you as a friend rather than lover and you, the mc, doesn’t love anyone for real, it’s just irritating, very much so. Especially when he seems to zoom in on just one person much more than others, which quite obviously is the first spirit he seduced(seems there's a law where the first girl introduced=most important). Am I asking for too much? Well, perhaps. I just hate it when authors write up several love interests and give all of them pretty much equal yet differing charm while feeding us the “he’s going to end up with a harem” idea from the very start, but seems to fail following through with it. Well, if the mc himself was actually a very likeable character that wasn’t something of an incompetent playboy that just wants to have everything but give nothing and decide upon nothing, I wouldn’t have minded that much in the first place. Even if he made it clear that he would only love one person, that would still be good enough. It’s that he keeps on seducing people and there’s this mood going on where he can’t commit to anything whatsoever, be it polygamy or monogamy, that pisses me off the most here.The anime/novel also takes itself too seriously at times. Bringing too much tragedy or drama into a story that has no potential to ever be a serious, good story with a solid plot. This is NOT a truly great story by any means of the word. I like the relationships in the story and the characters, the interactions are fairly nice, but the story is a huge mess and the attempt to introduce excessive drama and plot into something that shouldn’t have one just feels alien to me. It doesn’t do the novel/anime any good, it’s just a detriment. How could I ever take a story seriously and enjoy the drama when the settings and story is all over the place and, quite frankly, subpar with holes everywhere. Hell, just the simple fact that he can spend dozens of seconds TALKING OUT LOUD to the empty air while chatting with the people on the ship giving him instructions or that he can wait for at least a dozen seconds before giving a reply is ridiculous enough, the girls freeze up as if they’re truly from a game while waiting for his reply, but that’s far from the only cringeworthy and stupid thing going on, things like only girls being able to use any of the combat gear with no explanations as to why that is(what? is it powered by girl power? Breast milk? something somehow only female humans have? If you tell me some bullsh*t like that, I’ll punch you, it’s just stupid) another one of many, well, we don’t actually know anything about any powers in this anime, it’s just left at it being “Fantasy, magic, ‘nuff said” level. Not saying I didn’t find the story fairly enjoyable, I just feel like the author tries to grasp for things he’s not capable of ever grasping, at least not with the basic settings and the previous “story” we have been presented with in this novel/anime.Let’s be perfectly honest here, this setting isn’t that good and saying it was meant to be serious is just a giant joke in and of itself. Writing a serious story with good drama and even tragedy, horror or anything else, takes a lot more thinking than just writing a random comedy with some elements you like. If the story isn’t solid, it’s never going to be good if it’s supposed to be serious and if you want it to be ridiculous, even cringeworthy, silly and utterly childish at times, you can’t just randomly put in serious drama whenever you feel like it. It doesn’t work like that. Not saying comedy can’t be combined with drama and tragedy, good lord, it can. Just not this type of comedy that relies on things being absurd and the setting being sketchy at best. So, my tip to you is to skip the obviously serious parts, it’s very easy. It’s really not an anime that goes on for long enough even with both seasons for it to matter if you skipped all serious parts that didn’t interest you. I recommend not to skip kurumi’s scenes though.Well, let’s add one more complaint to the list. Like in season 1, the mc is still a giant pushover who screams “friendship” and “sacrifice myself” all the time. He’s essentially just a chatterbox that talks and talks with passionate speeches and more often than not, he’s screaming the names of the girls whenever something happens while being able to do nothing yet he’s constantly rushing headlong to his death as if he has some weird masochistic suicidal urges. He also shows no will to increase his powers whatsoever, he seems content being a pushover that can do nothing but push his ideals and petty feelings around, trying to force everyone to accept it, this is despite the fact that he obviously has supernatural powers that he can use and should be able to harness with training, but he doesn’t care, as if it would all just happen by itself(which it obviously will, I guess).I mean, he’s not the worst japanese mc of his type, but he’s sure as hell not a good one either. Going with the flow and selfishly trying to save everyone while giving zero considerations to his own limitations or life, nor any consideration towards the feelings of everyone who loves him, seems to be his special skills, he's certainly not a smart guy, he's pretty damn stupid and never uses his head for anything noteworthy. It’s as if he’s trying his damn hardest to prove to the viewers that he’s such a goodie-two-shoes that cares so much about everyone that he puts them above his own life, as if that’s a desirable trait(it’s not, proving that you're a good guy by acting like a suicidal retard is never a good way, it just shows he's a moron who has no grasp on his own abilities or situation). Well, I guess no japanese fantasy woman can resist falling in love with anyone who willingly sacrifices themselves for them… Oh, wait, we’ve seen that happen with other characters too(in other manga/anime/novels), them sacrificing themselves for love, sadly they get nothing but a grateful nod or a few tears even if they die, sucks to not be the mc who has special protagonist pheromones that enchants any woman in their proximity. It’s amazing, you know, it’s like an on/off button. As soon as he gets too close to them, they suddenly become completely enamoured with him, there’s no gradual love development, they either love him with all their heart or doesn’t think anything much of him, there’s no middle points.It doesn’t get better when he’s also a fool and pushover when it comes to following up on his actions and romance in general, he doesn’t truly fall in love with anyone, yet he seduces them and like any other japanese mc in works like these, he seems perfectly content pretending to be ignorant and not answering to any character’s feelings despite knowing perfectly well they love him, doing his utmost to push aside any event where they try to confirm his feelings. Tsk, I don’t know about you, but I often want mcs like these to be kicked to death by a horse. Sure, they’re nice guys, but their personalities are infuriating when put into a mc. It’s one thing to have side characters that are eager to die and has no grasp on the situation while being indecisive and reluctant to move on with anything at all, but the main character? I don’t see how it’s ever a good idea unless it’s a comedy manga/novel/anime and he’s SUPPOSED to be a hopeless cretin. Sure, some people won’t agree with me, we all have different preferences, but I honestly detest idiots like this mc. However, luckily enough, he wasn’t actually THAT bad, he was just annoying at times. Most of the times my feelings for him were kind of neutral, he wasn’t that infuriating most of the time, maybe because comedy was the main focus of this show despite a third being serious. The girls easily balanced the show up as well, generally possessing vibrant personalities that offset the mc’s foolishness and shallow personality.I liked this story a lot, but going above 7/10 is just not possible, that’s me being generous because I truly did enjoy big parts of this anime thanks to its relationships and the characters, most of whom felt alive and truly likeable. It’s enjoyable, but it has massive flaws as well. Disregarding my pure enjoyment and judging it just from how I view the show overall, I’d say 5/10 for average would be a fair score. I might make it look like I actually hate this show, but I just don’t have that much positive to write about it other than liking most of the characters and their interactions along with the mood and pace of the show, writing up the negative parts is much easier because that’s what caught my attention the most. By the way, the comedy in this anime is so-so, I can see where it tries to be funny while often ending up as cringeworthy, but sometimes it does manage to tickle my funny bone. Had I been several years younger, I might’ve bust a gut laughing at it at times, but after being through around fifteen years of thousands of works, be it manga, anime or novels, japanese, chinese or korean, I’ve become numb to most stuff. Just like when you’ve seen a certain thing or heard a joke too many times, I just don’t find it that funny anymore and I find it very easy to find flaws that I didn't find when I was younger. Well, being numb to it doesn't make it impossible to realize if something would be funny for other people. If you’re a teenager or at least not that experienced when it comes to these things, I can probably assure you that this is going to be hilarious for you and a truly awesome anime in more ways than one, well, that is if you’re into some fair amount of fan service and silly jokes often regarding juvenile topics, like ones regarding out of place and surreal eroticism.That's all, sorry for the long review, you can have a cookie if you actually read it all. girls fall in love with you, at least to some extent(since “date” is even in the title and going on dates and trying to make people fall for you is most of what this thing is about) means the ending should be one in which he’s married to everyone, right? He should get all, or at least most, of the girls that he’s seducing. That’s the very point here, that’s what this is about or should be about.

You can attack a wall, or you can can attack the guy with the remote control for the wall who is standing right next to you ? What\'s your choice ? The wall of course.The art is still very good, you have lovingly done backgrounds and well made and drawn characters.  The music however is deployed in the most annoying manner of trying to manipulate your emotional state.  It\'s good music but bringing out the schmaltz  and overwhelming everything is just insulting.Recommendation: If you haven\'t seen it yet and have seen the first season. Stop. Don\'t watch it, it will just further bring down the series for you.  If you haven\'t seen the first season, and are looking for comedy don\'t look here. After the first season this franchise doesn\'t rate the tag.', '***THIS IS A SPOILER FREE REVIEW***If you somehow find this show appealing to watch, I recommend you watch the first season before taking this one on.Ok. *Takes a deep breath* Let\'s get this over with. Because of money, a new season of Date a Live is here and well if you were expecting more character development from the previous season\'s characters then well be prepared to be very, very disappointed.Story: 4/10It\'s the same as the first season plot wise; mythical creature taming stud Shido has to go seal the powers of new female characters for the love of ""plot"". I cannot believe I am saying...this...but I actually think that the first season did a better job with the pacing of the arcs than this new season. This season in my opinion had a lot of ""dead"" spots where I just didn\'t give any sh$%s for what was going on. And what the f$#^ leaving out some of the original characters almost entirely? Yoshino is pretty much sidelined and the only decent character Kurumi isn\'t utilized until the very end. All this season accomplished was putting new bait under Shido\'s belt and unfortunately I really did not like any of the new characters.Animation: 6.5/10Looks pretty much the same as last time. It actually might have look better during some scenes but it really didn\'t wow me because it was obvious that they put the real mustard of effort during the ecchi scenes. It\'s a real shame because some of the fight scenes actually looked pretty decent.Sound: 5/10Average.Characters: 3/10The newly added characters connected with me as much as a human\'s a$$ and a cactus. None of them seemed likeable and were actually quite annoying to watch. The decent ones from last season like I said before were pretty much sidelined and very under-utilized. Since this is a character driven harem show, if you do not end up liking the cast, it\'s going to be a sh#@ show.Overall: 4.6/10Say what you want, ""Oh you just hate the IP so much that you are not being unbiased in your review."" If you think you are correct then by all means leave a comment below. I hoped that we would see more character development for the previous season\'s characters but nope a totally new fresh cast was handed the baton and they fumbled big time. I can only recommend this show if you were a fan of the first season.Enjoyment: 2.5/10Thanks for reading my review!

If you liked my writing style, would like to see some other reviews, or just want to talk, please stop by my page!Sincerely,Awesome Drummer', ""Here we are for the second season. I was looking forward to watching this since I liked the first season. I definitely was wanting more and I got more. So let's hop right in.Story: 7So the second season wastes no time and jumps right back into it, giving fans one episode to refresh them on the way the plot works. The plot here works in two, VERY noticeable arcs. One is based around a school field trip and the other around a school festival. without giving away too much, the first arc feels more enjoyable while the second arc has more plot progession. Not...to say there isn't any plot progression in the first arc, it's just that the new things you learn are things you figured were going to happen. And that's also not to say that the second arc isn't enjoyable, it's just that most of what the plot is centered around is unlikeable. Overall, a nice continuation but not as good as the first.Art: 7A noticeable downgrade this time around. Ok not that noticeable but it is there. Characters still look nice and the backgrounds still feel a bit alive, it;s just that the animations a little lacking this time around.Sound: 10Still a great job by the sound team. The OST is great with the Op and Ending being two great highlights. the background pieces are also very nice with a few tracks returning from season 1. there is also a nice little effect that I liked with one of the new characters Miku. Whenever she used her power, there was a nice accompanying organ note that played along with it that I liked.Characters: 8So like a mentioned there are a few new characters this time around, three of them being main characters. The first two, (whose names are excaping me right now and I don't fell like looking it up so shut up lol.) are met in the first arc. The last, Miku, is met in the second. Now if you have followed everything I've said up until now, you can probably figure out how I feel about Miku. She is a new problem I had with the series. I understand the reason why she acts the way she does (thank you guys for doing that this time), but she still comes off unlikeable and her coin flip of a personality doesn't help. Speaking of characters who needs their backstory explained, Origami is back and no, her back story is still not exlained. So we can sit here wondering some more. On a final note, Kurumi doesn't show up a lot and that is a problem lol. When she does it's great but that is for about two episodes. (#KurumiBestWaifu #NoShame lol)Enjoyment: 7At the end of the day, I will walk away from this season satisfied but not to the same level as season 1 left me. Season 2 was good in a lot of ways but opened up a new set of problems that show more this time around. I enjoyed it though so if you liked the first season, you can enjoy this one.Overall: 7This averages the series up till now to a 7. to say there isn't any plot progression in the first arc, it's just that the new things you learn are things you figured were going to happen. And that's also not to say that the second arc isn't enjoyable, it's just that most of what the plot is centered around is unlikeable.

I watched Date A Live II in 2017, just when I was getting acquainted with the Date A Live anime and it was good. It wasn't as engaging as season 1 but was still worth watching. Since I've watched in Japanese, I decided to re-watch it in English. So, does Date A Live II hold up? Well, let's hope on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StorySeason 2 continues season 1's basic story, as Shido has gotten used to having Spirits in his life. His harem is set to increase with the addition of...the Yamai twins, who have been in an extreme form of sibling rivalry since they become Spirits, and Miku Izayoi, a proud and haughty singer who dislikes men. Watching Shido struggle to reconcile their complicated personalities and get them to solve their personal problems is very interesting, not to mention that the increasing presence of Spirits leads to the introduction of a greater narrative for the series.Season 2 introduces Deus Ex Machina Industries, a conglomerate led by Isaac Westcott, who seeks to use the power of the Spirits for some unknown purpose. It feels refreshing for the series to introduce an actual antagonist for Shido and his friends, as the Spirits are less victims of their own powers and the world at large, while Westcott and his forces are actively malicious. Unfortunately, because this season got only 10 episodes instead of the usual 12, there wasn't much development for this particular plotline.As the season reaches its climax, we're left with more questions than answers. Where did the Spirits come from? Why does Westcott seek to harness their powers? Who is the Spirit that Kurumi seeks to destroy? Those unanswered questions are bound to frustrate some viewers who have been keeping with the light novels. In my opinion, the show felt a bit too fast-paced and I barely had time to process what's going on.For what it's worth, I do think the show does a fine job at introducing dark and gritty scenarios. Date A Live II is not afraid of showing violence and blood, but never to the point of becoming obscene. We see characters suffer terrible injuries and even bleed, but fortunately, Date A Live II doesn't dwell on this scenarios for too long and instead moves on to lighter and more comforting scenes. You know what they say: it's always darkest before dawn. (7/10)CharactersOnce again, Date A Live proves that its greatest strength is its character work, and season 2 continues to hold that standard high. The already colorful cast of Date A Live sees the addition of new Spirits, like the Yamai twins and Miku Izayoi. Kaguya and Yuzuru Yamai have been struggling for an unspecified amount of time, with the winner earning the right to become the true Yamai and continue existing. Kaguya is flamboyant, Yuzuru is monotone. Kaguya is expressive, Yuzuru is taciturn. Shido sees that this struggle has not done wonders for the twins, however, as they care for each other too much to conclusively end their struggle. The show makes it clear that there is no Kaguya without Yuzuru, just like there is no Yuzuru without Kaguya. Their personalities are almost complete opposites, but that difference is what binds them together and Shido realizes that.At first, Miku comes off as arrogant and vengeful towards people, even willing to brainwash them and treat them as playthings. As time passes, however, we understand the circumstances that led Miku to develop this way of thinking and it's clearly something that many people working at the entertainment industry will have an easy time understanding. While the show doesn't go about deconstructing showbusiness, Miku's experiences do go a long way in explaining how cruel and arbitrary that world can be. I admit I found Miku's personality a bit annoying, but her character arc was certainly one of the best Date A Live delivered.And now, we move to the villains. With his dark and imposing personality, Westcott becomes the closest thing Date A Live has to a primary antagonist. His presences manages to put the lively and cheerful aura of Date A Live to a disturbing halt. His servants, Ellen and Jessica, aren't nearly as threatening as him but they still manage to deliver some of the show's darkest moments. I would say they manage to complement the new dark and gritty atmosphere this new season brings to the series. (9/10)ArtI'm no much of an art expert so there is no much I can pick apart here. The visuals look fine, especially with the characters and the action scenes. The use of CGI for the Bandersnatch units feels a bit off and can sometimes take you away from the story. Other than that little detail, I'm satisfied with the visual quality and it's not something to worry about. (7/10)SoundOnce again, the music is of cinematic quality. The soundtrack of Date A Live wouldn't look out of place in a big-budget Hollywood production and it does wonders in complementing the story. I'm also pleased by the vocal performances of the English cast, particularly with Josh Grelle and Michelle Rojas. Those two really bring the scenes with Shido and Tohka to life, especially during the endgame. Also, special praise should be given to Brittney Karbowski and Megan Shipman, who definitely nail their respective parts of Kaguya and Yuzuru.Jad Saxton also does a fine job as Miku, conveying her arrogance, her confidence and, in the show's more emotional moments, her insecurities. I'm also surprised that they got her to sing for the musical parts. The show could have left Miku's song in their native Japanese but instead, they took a chance and translated them to great effect.I just have a problem with the voice acting: Ryan Reynolds gives Shiori (Shido's female alter ego) a boyish voice. What's up with that? It gives the impression that Shido is trying to imitate a female voice even when he has been given a voice changer to get close to Miku. I don't mean to take away anything from Ryan, but Shiori is not one of finer characters.Other than that, the show deliver some fine voice acting, especially for the more emotional moments. I would say the English dub is more enjoyable than the Japanese version, but that's just my opinion. (8/10)OverallI must admit I didn't enjoy season 2 as much as season 1. Sure, with the show's basic premise already established in season 1, season 2 is where Date A Live kicks into high gear with the introduction of new characters and plotlines. Unfortunately, the show's reduced episode count means a faster pace, meaning that season 2 didn't get to creatively flourish the same way season 1 did. Although it's not as compelling and accessible as its predecessor, Date A Live II does more right than it does wrong. The story is interesting, the characters are likable and the ending leaves you wanting for more, and fortunately, Date A Live delivered.

Sırf uzasın diye saçma sapan hatalarla ve klişelerle dolu olan bir sezondu.Bu konuyu çok daha iyi işleyip bize sunmalarını beklerdim, bu şekilde hem çok klişe olmuş hem de aşırı mantık hatalarıyla dolu saçma bir sezon seyretmiş olduk.Açıkçası seyrettiğim her türlü yapımı keyifli vakit geçirmek adına fazla mantık çerçevesinde seyretmesem de, Date a Live'ın ikinci sezonu o kadar çok göstere göstere bu mantık hatalarını ve saçmalıkları gözüme soktu ki ben bile dayanamadım artık.Hele o son ise...çok aşırı basite kaçılmıştı daha iyi işlenmesini isterdim. Madem ki böyle güçlü bir etki-tepki olayı yapıyorsun bu kadar yüzeysel sonuçlandırmayla sona ermesini sağlamak çok yanlış bir seçenek olmuş.Spoiler vermeden sanırım anca bunları diyebilirim.

In this way, we watched a ridiculous season that was both very cliché and full of excessive logical errors.Frankly, although I do not watch all kinds of productions with a lot of logic in order to have a good time, the second season of Date a Live exposed these logical errors and nonsense to me so many times that even I could not stand it anymore.Especially that ending was oversimplified, I wish it had been handled better. Since you are doing such a strong action-reaction event, having it end with such a superficial conclusion was a very wrong option.I guess that's all I can say without giving spoilers.

Enjoy watching ^^"", 'Strap in for Date A Live II, the anime sequel absolutely nobody asked for and progresses the plot in no way whatsoever, but still manages to entertain by being a dumb harem comedy show. It has lots of pretty colored lasers and those wonderful “pew pew” sounds that accompany the beams! An anime that introduces us to a bevy of characters while still focusing on a main character as flat as the plateau on which this anime doesn’t stand. Get ready for ten rousing episodes packed to the brim with all the things we were mildly amused by in the first season.In all seriousness, Date...A Live II is more entertaining than its predecessor. It only focuses on the conquering of three females (and two are technically one) while giving us a lot more action and a lot less stupid. Trust me, this anime is still stupid, but less so than the first season. Which could be because it’s mercifully shorter or because the show jams a lot more “plot” into the ten episodes than most shows of its’ length. That said, it’s still going nowhere fast and only serves to introduce characters rather than build on the cast already there, and also introduce bad guys who run away at the end, perhaps to return for a third season or the upcoming movie.The anime picks up where the last season left off. The first episode is an ill foreboding of things to come. It attempts to remind us that Tohka is an idiot while also annoying us to death by retreading territory we’ve already seen. Thankfully, after that, the series gets much better. We are introduced to twins who are two parts of a whole, fighting to find out who will disappear and who will attain the title of the true spirit they belong to. Neither character is impressive at all as one is basically Tohka and the other is basically Origami.The other introduction is the obligatory idol character. Named Miku. Never heard of an idol named Miku. She’s a lot like Kurumi to me. Very weird and manipulative. So as far as new characters, very little new ground is established. Everything’s a new face on someone we’ve met before.The characters from the first season barely get any time or development. Kurumi returns and seems like a completely different character. Instead of the weird, crazy-ass yandere of the previous season, she’s a very moe lunatic. She helps Shido, the sort of thing I didn’t think a character trying to kill him only a season ago would do.While characters aren’t impressive, the plot is decent enough to keep it interesting. Evil organization. Fighting. Kidnapping. Pretty arbitrary plot devices that culminate in an uninspired ending followed by a quick epilogue punctuated by the obligatory original pop song by our idol.Animation has been downgraded from season one. The budget is obviously cut and the team worked with what they had. It’s not that the animation is bad; it’s just not as crisp as it was before. And truthfully, the animation was probably the best thing Date A Live had going for it.I can’t fault this season for as much as I did the first one though. I thoroughly enjoyed everything beyond the first episode. It wasn’t smart by any means but its focus on two threads rather than three or four made it more bearable. The fact it was plot-centric over comedy-centric also made it more fun to watch. You do root for Shido and Tohka to get together and care about the finale even if the characters aren’t as three-dimensional as you like. But with all that, it sidelines the great characters of the first season. Yoshino’s just along for the ride. Origami is there but not at all as funny or interesting as she was in season one. We’re given a lot of the new rather than balancing that with the old. And even if the new meat is freaking adorable and Miku is a great addition (the twins, eh), you can’t sideline characters that a lot of fans came in to see more of. In that regard, it’s like a cocktease. You want Origami? Tohka? Kurumi? Too bad. Origami’s too busy not being in the show, Tohka getting kidnapped, and Kurumi is being a completely different character.I hate that I enjoyed this so much, but it’s one of those dumb harem/comedy shows that gets it right. While Ben-To and The Devil is a Part Timer stay stagnant because of one good idea and an inability to  expand upon it, Date A Live II’s open enough to allow for nonstop action and stupidity without it getting stale. Hell, this season doesn’t even use the idea of the folks on the ship deciding what Shido says to the girls but for twice. This is like a departure from everything that the first season had going for it, but it’s better because of that. It’s let loose the stupid and made me realize that maybe I don’t need Tohka or Origami to make Date A Live work. Maybe they were hindering the first season. Why else would this one work better for me? Maybe putting more focus on a smaller group of characters produced better results, even if the characters weren’t that memorable or well thought out.  Maybe focusing on a bad plot instead of underwhelming humor is a good thing. Even the few instances of humor this season managed to be funnier than anything season one produced.Huh.Date A Live II is sure to please fans of the first season, though they might find problems with the execution. I found it to be a much better, shorter, and more enticing product. Much as the second season of Chuunibyou did a better job of making me care about a series I cared little for, Date A Live II makes me somewhat excited to see what the future holds. It may not be great, but it’s good, dumb entertainment. A Live II is more entertaining than its predecessor. It only focuses on the conquering of three females (and two are technically one) while giving us a lot more action and a lot less stupid. Trust me, this anime is still stupid, but less so than the first season.

Never heard of an idol named Miku. She’s a lot like Kurumi to me. Very weird and manipulative. So as far as new characters, very little new ground is established. Everything’s a new face on someone we’ve met before.The characters from the first season barely get any time or development. Kurumi returns and seems like a completely different character. Instead of the weird, crazy-ass yandere of the previous season, she’s a very moe lunatic. She helps Shido, the sort of thing I didn’t think a character trying to kill him only a season ago would do.While characters aren’t impressive, the plot is decent enough to keep it interesting. Evil organization. Fighting. Kidnapping. Pretty arbitrary plot devices that culminate in an uninspired ending followed by a quick epilogue punctuated by the obligatory original pop song by our idol.Animation has been downgraded from season one. The budget is obviously cut and the team worked with what they had. It’s not that the animation is bad; it’s just not as crisp as it was before. And truthfully, the animation was probably the best thing Date A Live had going for it.I can’t fault this season for as much as I did the first one though. I thoroughly enjoyed everything beyond the first episode. It wasn’t smart by any means but its focus on two threads rather than three or four made it more bearable. The fact it was plot-centric over comedy-centric also made it more fun to watch. You do root for Shido and Tohka to get together and care about the finale even if the characters aren’t as three-dimensional as you like. But with all that, it sidelines the great characters of the first season. Yoshino’s just along for the ride. Origami is there but not at all as funny or interesting as she was in season one. We’re given a lot of the new rather than balancing that with the old. And even if the new meat is freaking adorable and Miku is a great addition (the twins, eh), you can’t sideline characters that a lot of fans came in to see more of. In that regard, it’s like a cocktease. You want Origami? Tohka? Kurumi? Too bad. Origami’s too busy not being in the show, Tohka getting kidnapped, and Kurumi is being a completely different character.I hate that I enjoyed this so much, but it’s one of those dumb harem/comedy shows that gets it right. While Ben-To and The Devil is a Part Timer stay stagnant because of one good idea and an inability to  expand upon it, Date A Live II’s open enough to allow for nonstop action and stupidity without it getting stale. Hell, this season doesn’t even use the idea of the folks on the ship deciding what Shido says to the girls but for twice. This is like a departure from everything that the first season had going for it, but it’s better because of that. It’s let loose the stupid and made me realize that maybe I don’t need Tohka or Origami to make Date A Live work. Maybe they were hindering the first season. Why else would this one work better for me? Maybe putting more focus on a smaller group of characters produced better results, even if the characters weren’t that memorable or well thought out.  Maybe focusing on a bad plot instead of underwhelming humor is a good thing. Even the few instances of humor this season managed to be funnier than anything season one produced.Huh.Date A Live II is sure to please fans of the first season, though they might find problems with the execution. I found it to be a much better, shorter, and more enticing product. Much as the second season of Chuunibyou did a better job of making me care about a series I cared little for, Date A Live II makes me somewhat excited to see what the future holds. It may not be great, but it’s good, dumb entertainment.', ""Date A Live IIOnce again after season 1,you never disappoint me. This had been one of my favourite anime! The story is outstanding! Shido still maintaining his duty to save all the spirits by dating them and make them fall for Shido!I love how they start the beginning of episode 1, flashback 30 years ago! And the new OP is WOW! Very enticing, they really had the beat going on!The characters design were somehow I think improved if I say so myself. Honestly it's one of the best anime I ever watched!Starting from episode 9 really makes me chasing it! How he planned his next...move. I also kinda shocked for what happen at the end.

Although fair warning, it's my opinion that the show has gone down hill in quality, their is more fan service then ever, though I guess that might be a plus for you, the story is even dumber and more contrived. On the plus side this season introduces a legitimately malicious villain. On the down side, one of the new...characters Diva is kind of the worst and she isn't really punished for it. I mean I'm pretty sure she's a rapist and they don't really call her on it, probably because this shows not popular enough and she's a lesbian so I guess people find that sexy. characters Diva is kind of the worst and she isn't really punished for it.

It's decent, nothing to write home about, but it gets the job done. I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10.Now, when it comes to character development, I have to say, it's not too shabby. I'd give it another 7 out of 10. But don't get too excited, folks, it's not like we're talking about a Shakespearean level of character depth here. The story, on the other hand, is where things get interesting....It's actually pretty good! I'd give it an 8 out of 10. There's a lot of interesting plot points, and it keeps you engaged throughout the entire season.Moving on to the art style, it's quite impressive. I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10. The attention to detail is impressive, and the character designs are memorable.Now, when it comes to voice acting, it's solid. I'd give it an 8 out of 10. The actors do a good job of bringing their characters to life.Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the music. It's forgettable at best, and at worst, it's downright annoying. I'd give it a measly 3.6 out of 10.Now, did I enjoy watching Date A Live II? I'd say so. It's an entertaining show that kept me engaged throughout the entire season. I'd give the enjoyment experience an 8 out of 10.So, what's the overall score for this anime? it's a 7,333 out of 10. Not bad, not bad at all.  It's not a bad show by any means, but it's not exactly a must-watch either. If you're a fan of the genre, then give it a shot. But if you're looking for something groundbreaking, then you might want to look elsewhere.--------------------------------------Kali ini, kita membahas Date A Live II dan saya harus mengatakan bahwa anime ini memiliki beberapa aspek yang menarik.Pertama-tama, mari kita bicara tentang animasinya.

Although none of them matter, as the only one that does is Tohka.Art is the same as usual, enough to satisfy someone\'s desires. But it is also used to express Tohka\'s purity and wholesome nature.Sound is, once again, mediocre.

The core stories are still centered around Shido getting a spirit to fall in love with him. However, these stories felt a bit more drawn out than in the first season with each of the two arcs this season having more time spent on them. Though at the same time, it does continue adding more characters each arc, which results in it...simply not being possible to involve everyone in every arc, though the second arc in this season does make a really solid attempt at doing so though many characters role are pretty small.In terms of the new heroines, the Yamai sisters are amusing due to how they still have chemistry despite their contrast, with Yuzuru being incredibly logical and monotone while Kaguya is an emotional chuunibyou. Miku felt like the first genuinely unlikable heroine though in my opinion, in that she’s completely unbearable for the majority of her arc. That feels intentional in that she follows a traditional tsundere arc and has character development at the end, but at least as far as this season goes it’s not enough to make her anywhere near likable, though we’ll see what the story does with her next.The action this season gets a lot better with a lot more going on and the final battle being intense and chaotic. It also has more emotionally intense moments that aren’t just the expected heartwarming endings to arcs as was the case with the first season, so it actually felt pretty gripping at times. A number of new elements were added to the overarching plot, but it’s still mostly mysterious for now and it’s not really clear where it’ll be going eventually. In exchange for the heavier focus on more serious elements, this season has less portions that are purely amusing, though the portions that it does have are still really solid.The art and animation are both solid. Animation felt like a step up over the first season, especially in battle. It’s done by a different studio from the first season and they seem to be better I’d say. The OP and ED are both pretty solid and the maintenance of the serious not-serious narration before the OP is appreciated. The insert songs with Miku’s voice actress were all solid. The soundtrack felt more solid than the first season, but Kurumi’s battle theme is still the track that stands out the most by far. simply not being possible to involve everyone in every arc, though the second arc in this season does make a really solid attempt at doing so though many characters role are pretty small.In terms of the new heroines, the Yamai sisters are amusing due to how they still have chemistry despite their contrast, with Yuzuru being incredibly logical and monotone while Kaguya is an emotional chuunibyou.

Doraemon Movie 30: Nobita no Ningyo Daikaisen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6988/Doraemon_Movie_30__Nobita_no_Ningyo_Daikaisen,"['My overall take: One of my least favorite Doraemon movies, filled with logical inconsistencies and unsatisfying payoffs.In this movie, Nobita and Doraemon accidentally strand a mermaid princess in their yard. I distinctly remember this being the first Doraemon movie that I actively thought was bad, and sadly, my opinion has not changed much after a rewatch. I wish it weren\'t so, because the undersea setting and mermaid concept could have been a lot of fun.To briefly discuss a few of my main issues with this movie:-The mermaid princess Sophia is amazed by cars and doesn\'t realize they\'re dangerous, yet we later see that she comes...from a society that has roads and vehicles.-Dorami suddenly shows up to deliver some exposition about mermaids, apparently at Doraemon\'s request, even though mermaids have barely been mentioned by that point.-When the villains are about to invade, the mermaid queen dumps the responsibility of leading the war onto Sophia, and this is portrayed as a good thing for some reason.-There\'s an abrupt scene cut into the middle of the final battle. (I seriously wondered whether I\'d been watching a faulty copy of this movie when I first saw it.)-After everyone spends much of the story trying to figure out how the obtain a legendary mermaid sword, the end result is that Sophia can just summon it without even intending to, because she happens to be the chosen one, rendering most of that subplot pointless. (Also, why couldn\'t the protagonists use Translation Konjac to decipher the ancient texts about the sword again? They\'ve done similar things in previous movies.)-Despite that, Sophia ultimately doesn\'t do much to help neutralize the villains. The sword she summons immediately gets taken by the villain leader, making him more powerful, and it isn\'t even directly used to defeat him later. The other main thing Sophia does during the final battle is attempt to fight the villain leader herself, and... she gets disarmed in one hit. Yet her actions in battle are enough for her to be crowned queen in the aftermath. Huh?-The porcupinefish-boy Haribo (who is somehow the leader of the merperson army) is a leading contender for the most annoying character in a Doraemon movie.-As if all of that weren\'t enough, this movie includes one of my ""favorite"" recurring Doraemon tropes: Shizuka getting captured and needing to be rescued. As far as I could tell, this doesn\'t even serve any narrative purpose here other than to add some tension before the final battle begins. The rest of the story probably would have played out essentially the same way without that subplot.This next observation is not necessarily a flaw, but Nobita\'s Great Battle of the Mermaid King is another movie in which the main characters seem rather unfriendly towards each other, more typical of the main Doraemon series than of the franchise\'s cinematic lineup. Gian and Suneo shamelessly bully Nobita in the beginning of the story, and even Shizuka doesn\'t show any sympathy or concern for him upon witnessing this.There is also a strange scene in which everyone else chews out Suneo for being unable to point out a specific constellation (which they suspect to be the planetary system where Sophia\'s people came from) out of hundreds if not thousands of stars in the night sky. They apparently take this as an offense to Sophia\'s feelings, though Sophia shows no signs of being upset by it.To be absolutely fair, I don\'t think this movie is entirely devoid of merit: the underwater scenes are often quite pretty, and it\'s nice to see Dorami get screentime that amounts to more than a voiced cameo. If I had to pick a least favorite Doraemon movie though, this would almost certainly be it. from a society that has roads and vehicles.-Dorami suddenly shows up to deliver some exposition about mermaids, apparently at Doraemon\'s request, even though mermaids have barely been mentioned by that point.-When the villains are about to invade, the mermaid queen dumps the responsibility of leading the war onto Sophia, and this is portrayed as a good thing for some reason.-There\'s an abrupt scene cut into the middle of the final battle.

Dr. Slump: Arale-chan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2222/Dr_Slump__Arale-chan,"[""Before Akira Toriyama created the battle manga Dragon Ball that was adapted to an anime, he made the Dr. Slump gag manga, also adapted to an anime. The manga was very popular in Japan, so of course an anime adaptation was made.Unlike Dragon Ball, which is an action-adventure anime with an overarching plot, Dr. Slump is an episodic comedy anime. So anything can happen in an episode. As a comedy, it doesn't fail to make me smile. Arale is likeable, and has catchphrases. Senbei is easily the funniest character in the show. He's a pervert, and he is in love with Arale's teacher Yamabuke. Akane,...Peasuke and Taro are troublemakers, but are all likeable.The art is the best thing about the show. The characters look similar to Dragon Ball characters and I've always admired the art style of Akira Toriyama's works. The animation is fine. The sound is above average. The music is lively and gets you in the mood. But when the characters talk, it sounds low quality for today's standard, probably because it's a very old anime. Senbei tends to shout a little too much, and characters tend to fall down in embarassment a lot of times.From what I've seen, I've enjoyed it so far. The gags are funny and I like the art style. But the anime hasn't aged as well as Dragon Ball. Definitely a must-watch for Dragon Ball fans. Peasuke and Taro are troublemakers, but are all likeable.The art is the best thing about the show.

Arale & friends make me laugh so hard throughout the entire show, I sometimes have to pause it just to keep from falling out of my chair, and to catch my breath. This show is a true expression of Toriyama\'s genius. I watch this show when I am irritated or depressed, and it works like an instant-happy pill. Arale is one of my heroes now, and ""Dr. Slump"" will forever occupy a top-spot in my favorite things in life.Here\'s hoping I some...day get to watch all of them! day get to watch all of them!', 'While there isn\'t an official English sub for this anime as it was never brought to the West, there are still a number of multilingual fan subs out there, with one faithful ongoing English sub (oddly titled shiteatersubs) that\'s, as of November 8 2017, at the 61st episode. They have a long way to go and I wish them the best of luck and give them my sincerest thanks, for I would not have found this hidden gem of an anime if it weren\'t for them.Before Goku from Dragon Ball, there was Arale from Dr. Slump, Akira Toriyama\'s first published manga and anime series. Arale...is a robot girl with a bubbly personality, endless spirit and lungs that won\'t quit. She processes super strength, super intelligence (despite having the mind of a naive 13-year-old), and is basically invincible to any harm except low fuel. She was invented by genius scientist Dr. Slump, a somewhat pervy, hopeless romantic bachelor who originally wanted her to serve him with house duties as a sister would, much to his dismay in regards to Arale\'s spastic, child-like behavior. The series revolves around their wacky adventures, including, but not limited to, Arale fitting in with the town and her school friends, traveling through space and time and Dr. Slump trying to win over the school\'s blonde teacher, Midori Yamabuki.

She processes super strength, super intelligence (despite having the mind of a naive 13-year-old), and is basically invincible to any harm except low fuel. She was invented by genius scientist Dr. Slump, a somewhat pervy, hopeless romantic bachelor who originally wanted her to serve him with house duties as a sister would, much to his dismay in regards to Arale\'s spastic, child-like behavior.

Figure 17: Tsubasa & Hikaru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1126/Figure_17__Tsubasa___Hikaru,"['Characters/DevelopmentThere are two aspects within the series. The first is where the characters fight off the Magyua threat one by one. Each fight is different from the last as we see the technology and weaponary being improved and new tatics thought up as each of the Magyua is different and stronger than the last in their own ways, which remains interesting throughout. The second is where Tsubasa struggles to become more self confident, especially during the fights with Magyua. There&rsquo;s also the life of Tsubasa and Hikaru on the farm and during school as they both support each other and play with their friends during...free time. There is both happy and sad moments which can bring a tear to your eye as the emotion feels realistic. Both aspects flow very well together as both are developments during the series that I felt were perfect. The relation between Tsubasa and Hikaru developing were very sweet and cute moments as they were there for each other.Animation/SceneryAt first the anime feels quite old for its time as it does appear slightly dull. The picture is too soft and the colours aren&rsquo;t very good during the first two or so episodes but eventually it gets a lot better. The picture gets more clearer and sharper. There is also very few repeated scenes throughout the series, but everything else is unique and animated well during the given situation, be it calm or a fight with a Magyua. Other than that the animation remains very good without too many complaints. The main character designs are great but a few of the other characters aren&rsquo;t anything too special but overall it does have its own style without anything excessively cute either. Characters always wear different clothing, keeping it a little more realistic and develops the personality of characters more by the clothing they wear. There is a wide variety of scenery in Figure 17, but most of them are usually natural areas, but many scenes on the farm,in Tsubasa&rsquo;s school and even some space scenes and other minor locations. They are beautifully designed with a lot of colour that mixes perfectly, nothing that goes out of place and since there are scenes during different times of the day and year add to the variety.Audio/MusicAgain at first the quality of sound is quite dull but later improves. Voice acting is great, nothing to complain about there. The anime however didn&rsquo;t seem to have a wide variety of sound effects at first so those are heard quite alot throughout some time. I also noticed very few sounds started late during the animtation but nothing too major. Background music was fantastic for both aspects of the anime, most that can be easily remembered too. Music for the calm moments had both happy and sad moments, some with a reconisable tune being used that I liked the most, the same goes for the music used during the battles that brought tension and excitement to those bits. I found the track used when the Figure 17 fights the Magyua was the best for these situations, but the other ones were still good.ConclusionWith the two aspects to the anime, it can be both exciting or upsetting. I enjoyed every moment while watching this one, but I enjoyed the relation between Tsubasa and Hikaru grow the most. It is a serious anime with very light comedy, but filled with emotion that felt realistic thanks to the good voice actors and music helping achieve this too.

One of the best anime series I&rsquo;ve watched in a while, everything about it I felt was really fantastic.', ""What is Figure 17? That's exactly my question when I first heard about it.  I asked everyone I knew, and found only one other person who knew about it.  No one seems to know about this obscure yet I first found it while browsing through Saimoe 2002.  The first thing that interested me about Figure 17 was how cute the characters in the show are.  However, as I watch on, not expecting anything great, Figure 17 somehow evolved into one of my favorite anime of all time.I see Figure 17 was having two separate stories.  One part of Figure 17,...the &quot;main plot,&quot; was the story of Tsubasa Shiina's encounter with the aliens at a UFO landing site and her attempts to help destroy the Maguars (alien creatures).  The other part is Tsubasa's friendship with Hikaru and their daily lives, either studying/playing in school or helping out their neighbors.  It is the second part of Figure 17, the slice-of-life-like adventures and the subtle development of Tsubasa, that is where the series shine most.  Eventually, the two stories would combine into an amazing finish.Story: 5/10Most of what Figure 17 is character development, and it excelled at it.  However, the alien plot was a bit...bad.  Well, it wasn't bad, but it was clich&eacute; and uninteresting.  In short, characters can use these hourglass devices to transform into a figure, which gets boosted abilities.  Tsubasa's case was a bit difference since her figure did not revert back to the hourglass device but into a duplicate of her with her memories.  (Don't worry all of this is in the first episode so you are not getting majorly spoiled.)  Along with D.D., the alien trying to defeat all the Maguars, Tsubasa and Hikaru would &quot;merge&quot; into Figure 17 to dispatch these creatures.The action was actually pretty good, but the figure designs (are they naked?) were quite bad, the Maguars had little new moves, but worst of all, the figures had no new moves.  In fact, the action was so repetitive (except for the last episode) that the &quot;main plot&quot; seems distracting.  I would rather watch Tsubasa and Hikaru spend time with their friends.  Taking all things into consideration, the alien plot was definitely necessary for the ending, but they could have reduced the repetition or introduce something new in both sides' attacks.Art: 7/10For an anime that was made in 2001, the art was pretty good.  The character designs were exceptionally good...except for the designs of the figures and Maguars.  When D.D. first transformed, I expected something more exciting than the silver surfer.  Other than that, the animation was solid and every scene was animation well, even the action scenes.  In fact, it was just short of amazing, but nothing amazing when it comes to the designs for the &quot;main plot.&quot;Sound: 8/10The repeating theme song of the series was undoubtedly catchy and encouraging as well.  I'm not a big fan of the OP and the ED was about romance (?) which does not really fit the series at all.  However, I liked how background music was used in a series.  Have you ever watched an anime and realized that without the background music, the show would not be as good?  This was the case.  It was beyond &quot;just there&quot; and very noticeable as an important part of the series.Character: 9/10I have touched on the amazing character development that took place in this series and now I will expand on it (with minimal spoilers).  Tsubasa starts out as a new student in class who just moved into town.  She is exceptionally shy, to the point of mild annoyance, not sociable with her classmates which leads to some bullying.  Even when some of her classmates try to talk to her, she would not reply and isolate herself even more.  Of course, this would all change when Hikaru, her duplicate, transferred into her class.Of course all of this sounds very corny at this point because it is obvious that somehow Hikaru will help Tsubasa overcome her shyness or something.  But it's not really just that simple.  Tsubasa's transformation is subtle and gradual.  It is not where this event happens which led to Tsubasa being this much braver.  In the later half of the series, Tsubasa will undergo some of this transformation on her own and in many ways surprised me quite a bit.  What I thought to be just some corny story became a very interesting journey.  Someone once said that Figure 17 was like breathing life into its characters.  I wholeheartedly agree.Enjoyment: 8For the most part the alien plot was boring, but I already said so many bad things about it anyways.  Episode 1 was actually quite annoying at how Tsubasa was so emo in school (and even at home).  Episodes 2-4 were slow but nice to watch, since character development don't happen overnight.  Starting from episode 5, an episode mostly dedicated to Tsubasa and Hikari helping out at her father's workplace, the stories revolving around Tsubasa's daily life became amazing.  Episode 7 was surely relaxing and nice development, and episodes 9-11 will be some that I will definitely remember.Figure 17 definitely had its share of sad moments, and anyone who have seen it will not disagree.  One thing about Figure 17 is how realistic it is, despite its alien plot.  I have watched many anime which had something along the lines of what episodes 9 and 10 showed, but nothing was overdone.  At one point, I wanted to scream out, &quot;This is what anime should be,&quot; because it took something not original and perfected its presentation.  That is truly the magic of Figure 17.  Through the sad times and through the fun times, through the tough times and through the relaxing times, Figure 17 is impeccable in its portrayal of human emotions and that is why I enjoyed Figure 17 so much.Overall: 7/10Figure 17 may have been spot on in one aspect but that doesn't mean the entire series was perfect.  The one indication of something usual about this series is that the &quot;main plot&quot; was often pushed aside for the slice-of-life aspects of the show, and frankly, it was the less enjoyable portion of the series.  It seems like the series wanted to explore Tsubasa's development but chose a terrible medium (alien transformation) to show the development.  To me, it felt like the action aspect of the show got half-assed.But the real question is, &quot;Does it matter?&quot;  From a technical point of view, the series is not perfect hence the 7 score.  However, this would be the series that I would recommend to everyone.  It can be relaxing and it is also emotional.  And don't forget that Tsubasa and Hikaru and very cute.  It is probably enjoyable by a large audience since there is pretty much something for everyone.  Why am I reviewing this series?  Because this is a series that is memorable.  There a many series that delivered the &quot;wow&quot; factor but then become forgettable.  But Figure 17 is one that had a lasting impact, and for that I will praise it.&quot;You can keep dreaming, but this love can never be put into words.&quot; the &quot;main plot,&quot; was the story of Tsubasa Shiina's encounter with the aliens at a UFO landing site and her attempts to help destroy the Maguars (alien creatures).

Not so much for the action sequences, but for the dynamics of the relationship between the 2 girls that become the main characters and watching their friendship develop and Tsubasa slowly finding herself with the prompting of Hikaru.I enjoyed seeing their interaction with their friends and dailly lives, and how they dealt with the ever sinister threat presented by the Magyars, and how each time Tsubasa finds the courage to stand up and fight when called upon by her &quot;sister&quot;....Sadly, the last few episodes were weepies, but  in my case it was tears of joy at seeing our heroine blossom, with cherished memories and the hope of a new life back home in Tokyo.The background artwork is beautifu, the production is slick, and I was not left with the sense of &quot;to be continued.&quot; The only gripe I had was the episode length, at times I felt like I was watching a movie!It's highly recommended, but only if you are more interested in human relationships than alien invasions.

OLM, the same studio behind Gunsmith Cats, Disgaea & Pokemon, was responsible for bringing it to life. It was written by Yonemura Shouji, who also worked on scripting episodes for both Doki Doki Precure & Hunter x Hunter. So, that\'s all a positive sign as far as I\'m concerned. Let\'s get into it.Story:Shiina Tsubasa is having a rough time. She\'s lost her mother and just moved to a new area for her father\'s work. To top it all of, she\'s very shy and doesn\'t make friends easily. At least the place she moves has a...nice dog that she gets to look after. I immediately relate to this character. Change the parent she lost and that\'s my childhood. One night things change when there\'s a loud crash. Tsubasa wakes up and finds a UFO with an alien pilot and a hostile alien life form called a Maguar. Maybe it just wants Reese\'s Pieces? Tsubasa accidentally combines with an alien called a Riberus to take on an armoured form capable of fighting the hostile creature. After the battle, an unusual thing happens. The Riberus takes on Tsubasa\'s form. She calls herself Hikaru and the newly created twins have to balance their school lives while secretly combating the alien menace before it overwhelms Earth.Now, my big problem with the narrative is with one specific side story. Namely, the reporter\'s. Basically, we get segments throughout the series of this researcher turned columnist wandering around the scenes where they\'ve fought Maguar and trying to figure out exactly what happened to cause the ecological damage. And throughout the series I kept wondering how this random dude\'s story was going to tie into the main plot line. So, how does it ultimately pan out? It doesn\'t. This character and his bullshit segments could have been completely cut out and it wouldn\'t have had any impact except to give more time for the characters who matter. Frankly, they could\'ve given us scenes of the dog playing around and those would have been better. At least the dog\'s cute and interacts with the main cast. Maybe Yonemura thought it would be interesting to get an outsider\'s perspective (it\'s not) or maybe he had plans that didn\'t pan out. Still, ultimately, all the time we spend with this guy is completely pointless.With that gripe out of the way, there are a lot of positive aspects to the plot. It melds the sci-fi monster hunting aspect with more personal, day to day life drama really well. There are stakes for both elements and there are points where there are problems trying to balance them or where things that happen in one will cause issues with the other. I appreciate that the trained adults can get help from Tsubasa and Hikaru while still coming across as capable in their own right, occasionally even battling the creatures by themselves. That\'s not something you see often in this type of narrative and it\'s not something that\'s easy to pull off. Then we have the ending. I won\'t spoil it, but it\'s a strong bittersweet ending. Which works phenomenally in no small part due to the way it foreshadows the tragic elements. And the tragic elements may have made me tear up... a lot.Characters:One of the significant reasons that the marriage of daily life drama and monster hunting works so well is because the characters are so strong. So much of this series is dedicated to Tsubasa\'s personal growth. Not just as a reluctant heroine who has to come into her own but as an individual learning to cope with things like loss, loneliness and how to tap into her strength. Hikaru is a superb character as well. The ""twins"" are handled in a semi-complementary way with each one having strengths the other lacks but they also have aspects to their personalities that are very similar. And after the sheer number of twin characters I\'ve seen who are basically one character, this is a refreshing take.They also have a strong dynamic in spite of them both knowing they aren\'t actually twins. Normally, I would say that it\'s unrealistic for them to bond so quickly but Figure 17 makes it work by showing us what Tsubasa\'s life is like before all of this happens and showing us how isolated she feels. So, it makes sense for her to latch onto a girl who opens up to her and treats her as family.The side characters also get a good amount of complexity to their characters. Sakura may be one of the strongest representations of those aspects of adolescence that make teenagers difficult to deal with while also showcasing those parts of life that are hard for teenagers which makes her come across as pretty relatable. Even the pointless reporter has depth to him. It\'s part of the reason his segments waste so much time.The only things that don\'t have complexity are the Maguar. We basically learn that they\'re artificially created but they don\'t seem to have sentience. They just kind of want to feed and spread.Art:The character design is pretty nice. It\'s interesting the way some minor changes between the twins make it readily obvious which one you\'re looking at even when they\'re wearing the same outfit. That\'s a good touch. The armoured Riberus forms are interesting looking. The alien technology is neat looking. The Maguar themselves have some interesting designs. At least, they do at first. After a while, they kind of gave up and started giving you a bunch that basically look the same. To be fair, there is an explanation for it.The action is pretty well animated, although some of the motion blur and such can be a bit over-used. There\'s also an action sequence near the end that takes place in tunnels where everything has a red tint. Which was a bit hard on the eyes and not that good looking. When we got to see the tunnels from inside the Riberus and they had normal colours, they looked great. But, unfortunately, most of it is spent with the redness.Sound:The performances are great. Orikasa Fumiko & Yajima Akiko pull off the leads really well. There are also particularly good performances from Koyama Rikiya, Horie Yui & Inoue Kikuko. Although all of the performances are good. The music works quite nicely with the action on screen.Ho-yay:There really isn\'t any. The crushes we do see among the children are hetero-normative. Although I do appreciate that they\'re presented subtly.Areas of Improvement:1. Cut out the Reporter Segments. This is definitely the most obvious thing, and for good reason. These parts do nothing. I\'d honestly replace them with segments giving some spotlight to the side characters who actually spend time with our heroines.2. Colours for the tunnel scene. I mentioned this a bit when I talked about the artwork, but I\'d show the tunnel scene the way you see it from the Riberus perspective instead of with that awful red filter.3. The Hikaru Question. One thing that comes up in the series is that no Riberus has ever done what Hikaru did. IE: take on a physical form like that. I\'d like to see DD and Oldina discuss it from a scientific perspective and from a philosophical perspective. They don\'t really touch on it that much in the series proper, which seems a bit weird.Final Thoughts:The young man who requested this review said this was one of his favourite anime of all time, and I understand why. While it has some problems, most notably those pointless segments, it is a bloody good series. It has a fantastic sense of character, a compelling story, strong acting and artwork. It might not be one of my favourites, but I can respect it and what it does. Personally, I\'ll give it a solid 8/10. nice dog that she gets to look after. I immediately relate to this character. Change the parent she lost and that\'s my childhood. One night things change when there\'s a loud crash.

That\'s not something you see often in this type of narrative and it\'s not something that\'s easy to pull off. Then we have the ending. I won\'t spoil it, but it\'s a strong bittersweet ending. Which works phenomenally in no small part due to the way it foreshadows the tragic elements. And the tragic elements may have made me tear up... a lot.Characters:One of the significant reasons that the marriage of daily life drama and monster hunting works so well is because the characters are so strong. So much of this series is dedicated to Tsubasa\'s personal growth. Not just as a reluctant heroine who has to come into her own but as an individual learning to cope with things like loss, loneliness and how to tap into her strength. Hikaru is a superb character as well. The ""twins"" are handled in a semi-complementary way with each one having strengths the other lacks but they also have aspects to their personalities that are very similar. And after the sheer number of twin characters I\'ve seen who are basically one character, this is a refreshing take.They also have a strong dynamic in spite of them both knowing they aren\'t actually twins. Normally, I would say that it\'s unrealistic for them to bond so quickly but Figure 17 makes it work by showing us what Tsubasa\'s life is like before all of this happens and showing us how isolated she feels. So, it makes sense for her to latch onto a girl who opens up to her and treats her as family.The side characters also get a good amount of complexity to their characters. Sakura may be one of the strongest representations of those aspects of adolescence that make teenagers difficult to deal with while also showcasing those parts of life that are hard for teenagers which makes her come across as pretty relatable. Even the pointless reporter has depth to him. It\'s part of the reason his segments waste so much time.The only things that don\'t have complexity are the Maguar. We basically learn that they\'re artificially created but they don\'t seem to have sentience. They just kind of want to feed and spread.Art:The character design is pretty nice. It\'s interesting the way some minor changes between the twins make it readily obvious which one you\'re looking at even when they\'re wearing the same outfit. That\'s a good touch. The armoured Riberus forms are interesting looking. The alien technology is neat looking. The Maguar themselves have some interesting designs. At least, they do at first. After a while, they kind of gave up and started giving you a bunch that basically look the same. To be fair, there is an explanation for it.The action is pretty well animated, although some of the motion blur and such can be a bit over-used. There\'s also an action sequence near the end that takes place in tunnels where everything has a red tint. Which was a bit hard on the eyes and not that good looking. When we got to see the tunnels from inside the Riberus and they had normal colours, they looked great. But, unfortunately, most of it is spent with the redness.Sound:The performances are great. Orikasa Fumiko & Yajima Akiko pull off the leads really well. There are also particularly good performances from Koyama Rikiya, Horie Yui & Inoue Kikuko. Although all of the performances are good. The music works quite nicely with the action on screen.Ho-yay:There really isn\'t any. The crushes we do see among the children are hetero-normative. Although I do appreciate that they\'re presented subtly.Areas of Improvement:1. Cut out the Reporter Segments. This is definitely the most obvious thing, and for good reason. These parts do nothing. I\'d honestly replace them with segments giving some spotlight to the side characters who actually spend time with our heroines.2. Colours for the tunnel scene. I mentioned this a bit when I talked about the artwork, but I\'d show the tunnel scene the way you see it from the Riberus perspective instead of with that awful red filter.3. The Hikaru Question. One thing that comes up in the series is that no Riberus has ever done what Hikaru did. IE: take on a physical form like that. I\'d like to see DD and Oldina discuss it from a scientific perspective and from a philosophical perspective. They don\'t really touch on it that much in the series proper, which seems a bit weird.Final Thoughts:The young man who requested this review said this was one of his favourite anime of all time, and I understand why. While it has some problems, most notably those pointless segments, it is a bloody good series. It has a fantastic sense of character, a compelling story, strong acting and artwork. It might not be one of my favourites, but I can respect it and what it does. Personally, I\'ll give it a solid 8/10.', ""The first thing that captures your attention is the art. The cute characters and the flowing lines attract you to it.The background music is also very enjoyable and entered at the appropiate time.The story is quite good actually. I won't tell anything of course, but it is definitly worth to see :).The only down thing for me was the length of an episode. At almost 45 minutes long I think the storie is a bit stretched out and could have been even more enjoyable if it had been shortened. "", ""If you're looking for a unique anime, this is the one!The thing that is most interesting about this anime is that while it does have some pretty neat sci-fi aspects to it, that's not the point of the anime. In fact, the sci-fi/fight scenes in the anime are overlooked by the incredible character development. Most animes either have a stagnant character, or they grow fairly quickly. The amazing thing about Figure 17 is the fact the character growth is actually fairly slow, which makes it feel incredibly realistic.Another thing about the anime is how invested you become with the characters. Some might say...that the 42-minute episode length is unnecessary, but given the fact that there are only 13 episodes I think having longer episodes is very important to the investment of the characters. I honestly feel like if the episodes were shorter I would have missed out on the incredible relationships and growth throughout the characters.However like I said before, while this anime does have its sci-fi aspects it really does get overshadowed. It's always there and it's quite interesting to see the different technology the people from another world have, but its role in the story is basically only to keep it rolling. I certainly wouldn't recommend this anime to anybody who's looking for a more sci-fi geared anime, as they'd be very disappointed at how much it's overshadowed. I would recommend this anime to people who enjoy sci-fi, but also are really into human growth and development as this anime is completely focused on the growth and bond between the two main characters Tsubasa and Hikaru. that the 42-minute episode length is unnecessary, but given the fact that there are only 13 episodes I think having longer episodes is very important to the investment of the characters.

Figure 17 is about a little girl who follows a shooting star to a spaceship in which contains a clone named Hikaru. I haven\'t seen this anime in a long time, but let me explain. Her twin sister tries to teach her courage, confidence, and happiness. And they all go on adventures, expierence many different things, and try to defeat beastly Maguars with the help of two aids named D.D. and Olienda (or whatever her name is).

As I said, it features a slice of life drama to about 5 minutes of action. The thing about the two twin sisters teaching themselves about life is really unique.The art is very beautiful. Yes, I know it looks old, but the background of scenary and the characters are very interesting.Sound, I always thought some of the characters sounded like the ones in Cowboy Bebop. Which really made me smiled. The music is very enthusing to watch and some of them are very sad compared to what this anime may be like at the end.The characters seem to be a little shorter than I expected, but they had really great personalities. Tsubasa is kind of inevitable, Hikaru\'s selfless, the dad is caring, and Oldina and D.D. are both very helpful.I enjoyed this anime from episodes 1-9 but throughout the rest, it becomes sad. And therefore, the anime always put me to sleep for a reason because Tsubasa and Hikaru are always worrying about defeating the Maguar\'s babies and not the mother. It\'s very boring to see, and that\'s why I give this anime a 7/10. it raises up to about 13 episodes with 45 minutes of drama and 5 minutes of action and goes between summer and winter.The story is the most enthusing part of Figure 17.

In the case of Figure 17, it works very well.We follow the story of Tsubasa and Hikaru, two little girls who end up becoming twin sisters.As much as it has action and a lot of science fiction, this is far from being the focus of the anime. The focus is everyday life and the relationship between the characters.But what makes this anime so special? Simple: Realism. An anime where it treats everything in a very realistic way, even more so when it...comes to the interaction of the characters. But not only that, he also talks about dependency. Tsubasa is very shy and depends on Hikaru for a lot (which reminds me of Doraemon, watch Stand By Me Doraemon, here\'s my recommendation), or maybe almost everything. As the work progresses, characters develop in an Iyashikei atmosphere that is very pleasant to watch, until episode 09 arrives, where the atmosphere of the work changes completely.In the end, it\'s a work that talks about dependence, and at the end it has a very beautiful message of ""You can do it without depending on others"".It\'s an excellent anime, and I see myself in Tsubasa a lot in some ways.

She bumps into a crashed spaceship where some eggs of extraterrestrial monsters hatch and scatter over Hokkaido, they fed off of it and evolve that way. At the same time she accidentally fuses with an alien weapon/battle armor/life form thing to fight them, which out of battle takes her form, and thus she begins to live on her house as her new twin sister, Hikaru.How is any of that cute you may ask? Because of the way it’s presented. Let’s clarify that this show is a cutesy and relaxing slice of life and coming of age story first, and a sci-fi action monster of the week series after. The focus is clearly placed on how Tsubasa no longer feels lonely thanks to her new more optimistic, energetic and extrovert sister who is always by her side, cares for her and encourages her to talk to others, get new friends, try more things, and be more confident with herself, while also fights alongside her and protects her from the aliens they face. Since their father is a baker and they live in a farm, the first thing they learn together is to make some breads and cakes and all that stuff, while also stuff about different animals, particularly cows. Then at school they go to class together, practice and compete in sports together, and rehearse and later star on a stage play together, that kind of usual stuff.As the series goes on, however, after a tragic event, where the more cynical view of the situation which I began this review with gets acknowledged and addressed, and with the acknowledgment of their inevitable parting once all the monsters are defeated, both girls will be a little more apart of each other and Tsubasa will effectively learn to be more sufficient by herself and less dependent of Hikaru.But how does the action sci-fi part of the show fits in? Well that’s the thing, initially it doesn’t, it feels tacked on and it even drops the overall quality of the show actually, since those monsters are just horrible things with zero dimensions of personality to them, which exist just to be killed on each episode. Not only that but the fights, despite having some battle choreography and strategies to them, usually start with alien policeman D.D getting defeated, and get resolved by Hikaru convincing Tsubasa to not be scared of the opponents, and they defeat them with one punch, even when the more experienced characters couldn’t win.Fortunately this appear to have been realized on the writing room at some point, and as the show goes on, the monsters keep evolving and sharing information with the others, gaining new characteristics and forcing the heroes to face them together, form new strategies and use new weapons in order to win, by the end of the show no alien can be defeated by the girls all by themselves, they have to fight alongside the two veteran space police officers in order to win, even survive.But that’s just an improvement action wise, how it ends up connecting with the main plot? Well, first, by having D.D and the later introduced other officer Oldina have a little, but very little, lives on Earth on their own as well while they gather information about their enemies. Second, by having them changing a little from their cold initial attitude to be more comprehensible and respectful of the things the two sisters go through the show, even letting them out of a few fights and having a few instances where they take the monsters on their own. Although short lived, it was a very welcomed change to have the two veteran space police officers be the ones to kill the aliens. Third, since the majority of the series is dedicated to the slice of life moments on Hokkaido, having all of the characters the girls interact with at stake as the show goes on, makes the following fights to be and feel important. And fourth, part of the growth Tsubasa goes through ends up playing a part as well, since it leads to an improvement on their way of fighting, and she even gets to save Hikaru at some point, an even more welcomed change.Another way the writing tried to connect the two plot points with each other was with the presence of an investigator who realizes weird stuff is happening in the environment of Hokkaido, even appearing in the final battle. Although this portion of the show is necessary to understand the actual effects that the monsters have, it is universally considered filler, and to be honest everything regarding this character feel as such. Which is a shame since it is something very easy to solve, just have D.D and Oldina be the ones to investigate this stuff, they already use some pseudo-science to learn more stuff about their enemies, might as well have them look into what those monsters are doing to the Earth, that would help them in their own investigation, and give them more screen time to have a little more lives on their own on our planet, and thus have a bit more presence and character outside the action bits. Eventually this investigator ends up getting a catharsis, but like I said, everything about this character feels unnecessary and tacked on.Another thing worth mentioning is the unexpected but welcomed lack of plot armor, especially with how many times D.D could have died but didn’t in the initial episodes. This I find to be positive, since despite being primarily a slice of life show, Figure 17 still has stakes, and having important characters dying permanently is the proper way to make said stakes feel real and their consequences important for not being taken away. And is not like the deaths come out of nowhere for shock effect, they are properly anticipated and it’s great that the series does not chickens out with them, even leading to a somewhat bittersweet ending.To continue with the positives, I was surprised by the visual quality of the show, since it is a rather minor production from 2001. There are quality drops and characters go off model when seen from afar, and the designs are simple and generic, even very lookalike to what the designer would do later on Planetes, for example, but still the visuals are usually very good, very good special effects, very little and well rendered CGI for its time, in turn well mixed with the rest, and some of the most beautiful hand drawn backgrounds you’ll get to see on anime. The motions, though not always, are usually pretty good as well, and even the slice of life bits have vivid enough body language to not feel those bits as visually inferior.As for the sound, the children sound very cute and convincing, every voice fits perfectly and is well performed. The adults however, partially because of their part on the show, sound a bit more typical, not bad, just not special in any way. The background music is good, composed of cute and relaxing themes for the slice of life portion of the series, and heavy rockers for the sci-fi half of it. With that said, the soundtrack ends up coming off as repetitive because some themes have many different versions and are reused in the exact same way every time in similar scenes. The opening is also a cool rock track, and the base for some tracks of the soundtrack, but it almost does not feel like the overall vibe of the show, luckily the more relaxing ending song fits better, and compliments it well, just like the two different genres don’t fit together at first but end up making a proper whole later on. The sound effects are nothing special but they are fine.And now for the issues of the show, aside from the ones I already mentioned.-Brainwashing is one of the laziest plot devices to use in writing regardless of what it is used for, thus it is an issue here.-Although somewhat explained, having just one human notice what’s happening it’s impossible to buy, another major flaw and another reason to get rid of that investigator.-By the end of the show all memory and track of what happened is erased, except for Tsubasa’s, this way it does not takes away the most relevant aspect of the show, but still makes the ending to feel like very little mattered in the end.-The sisters are away of all the people they live and interact with everyday every time they get called to fight, and no one notices them going away to fight and get back to their house late at night at times, how convenient.Despite the minuses, I still found it to be a pretty good slice of life and action hybrid, each genre is ok by itself at first, and they get tied together properly as the series goes on. Plus, it’s a slice of life show with plot continuity, stakes, permanent consequences and actual character growth by the end of it, quite rare within this medium, and somewhat valuable and memorable because of it. It is also one of the atypical and unusual oddities coming from OLM, the Pokémon studio, worthy to check out when they make something outside their comfort zone, like this, or Odd Taxi, or Berserk, to name a few. Still, with each episode being 45 minutes long, the simplicity of its plot and how it takes a while for its two genres to feel like they belong in the same series, I don’t find rewatch value in here, but for a one time experience, it is a good choice.For similar stuff, there are actually way too many options, but just to name a few:For the slice of life portion of it-Gin no Saji, a coming of age series about high school students from the countryside.-NieA_7, a slice of life comedy about a woman living with an alien.-Hinamatsuri, a slice of life dramedy about alien girls living on Japan.For the sci-fi action bit of it-The Guyver action franchise, about a guy who accidentally fuses with a bio-organic alien armor to fight against extraterrestrial monsters invading Earth.-Brigadoon, a science fantasy action romance dramedy about a girl being protected by a bio-organic extraterrestrial being from other soldiers like him, as well as many other monsters.-The Tetsuwan Birdy action franchise, about a guy who for plot reasons shares body with a female space police officer who captures space criminals.And more, there are a bunch more similar titles out there, damn.

Another title that it’s usually recommended along this one is Blue Drop, but as I will explain next time, it’s best to stay far away from it.']"
Druaga no Tou: The Sword of Uruk,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4726/Druaga_no_Tou__The_Sword_of_Uruk,"[""Tower of Druaga is a two-season anime (Aegis of Uruk - 1st season; Sword of Uruk - 2nd season) that isn’t anything spectacular, but manages to deliver great fun and enjoyment. Each season haves 12 episodes but season one has an extra episode, it’s an alternative version of the first episode. This is only funny stuff but explains some things so I recommend watching it.Mainly I’m going to review Sword of Uruk but there are going to be some comparations and references to Aegis of Uruk so this could be considered the full anime review. Firstly I must say that I don’t usually watch...this type of anime. This is the typical “save everyone” character (incredibly stupid at that) that has to save the world by defeating a great evil at the top of a tower. Pretty common story huh? Well don’t be fooled because the anime gets really interesting at the end of the first season and literally forces you quickly jump into the second one because you desperately want to know what happens next.The story is set on a medieval/fantasy world that seems somehow modern. The events revolve around Jill, the main character, and his struggle to get to the top of the Tower Of Druaga. Those who climb the tower are called “climbers”, there are lots of climbers although the series focuses on some especifics groups of them. In Aegis of Uruk the characters will usually find themselves in really absurd and funny situations. In fact the 1st season doesn’t get serious ‘till the last 3 episodes. Sword of Uruk gets serious at the beginning and unfolds a story that is a lot more dramatic than Aegis of Uruk. It's a story full of hate and betrayal.In Aegis of Uruk Jill is a rookie climbing for the first time. He thinks he is climbing to defeat the evil god Druaga but his brother (Neeba) has other plans. First Jill gets dismissed from his party and joins another one with very funny and important characters in it, Kaaya being the most important. At the end, when they reach the top another conflict unfolds and Neeba leaves alone joined by Kaaya. Sword of Uruk plotline unfolds six months after the events in Aegis of Uruk (3 years inside the tower due to some flow of time issues) the story is less funny and more serious, it concludes the anime for real. The battles are more fierce and the drama more intense. The objetive is basically the same: climb the tower again to reach another one (Mythical Tower) and defeat another evil being.One thing to note is the pace in which the story develops. In Aegis of Uruk the story feels fast while the party climbs the shirines and gardens. In one episode they are on level two shirine and in the next one the party magically appears on level five. In Sword of Uruk the story is more paused and seems to be slower. It goes on in a more drama-oriented, detailed way. The story has it twists, almost all of them happening at the end of the first season and in the second season.I was fooled when I first saw the Aegis of Uruk opening on the second episode. The opening has some amazing sequences that are really well done, but have nothing to do with the real anime, only some character behaviors are loyal to the anime plot. Sword of Uruk has some “nothing-to-do –with-the-anime” sequences as well. The two openings are just fun to watch and the design of every little thing is beautiful. Theese work like fanservice but at the same time indicate that the anime is far from serious, being it mostly a comedy.Overall the anime looks good. The spaces are diverse and go from lively and beautiful to dark and scary. The main leads are very well detailed and very distinctive from each other. From Kaaya to Fatima the girls look gorgeous and really do make a diference from other animes girls. But some things like Jill’s armor and weapons are poorly detailed. On the first episode you see Jill with this huge shield, but after he leaves his first party he get’s to wield a really lame tiny shield. Another thing is the sword that he get’s from Kaaya: you only see it on the first season and them in the second season only in the last 3 episodes, and it isn’t anything special. I was hoping for a more powerful and mythical looking weapon (with some sort of power?) The only weapon I liked was the flame staff-gun that Fatima wields; it’s really awesome and original. The monsters are varied as well: they can be lame and simple looking or really ferocious and complex. I was as well dissapointed with Druaga’s looks.As I said before the openings of boths seasons are just creative and beautiful. The singles that acompain the openings are really good as well. The music is completetly different from the one that is inputed during the anime. These are J-Pop songs that, after listening two or three times, become incredibly adictive. On the other hand the endings are slow and tranquil. So the basic formula: an agitated and fast opening to start up the action and to end up a light and somehow sad single to leave the animation on a nice mood.The BMGs are really dramatic and have that medieval/legendary feeling. These give more drama to battles and more enjoyment to the, pretty random, humor moments. The sound quality is awesome and the BMG’s sound like taken out from a movie. The seiyuu cast is awesome as well and do irradiate each personality with their voices.Everything is varied and fantastic in the world of The Tower of Druaga, the characters are no exception. In Aegis of Uruk there are a lot of interesting characters and in the Sword of Uruk you get to see all theese characters again and some new additions. Again the girls look awesome and sexy, Fatima being my favourite. Definitely I love Kaaya’s personality, she’s just weird and likes things that nobody else likes, she doesn’t get bothered by nothing and works really hard. On the other hand Fatima is an aggressive girl that gets bothered by practically anything but works hard as well. These two characters suffer a transformation after Aegis of Uruk ends. In Sword of Uruk Fatima starts up being a lay down and really quiet girl. Kaaya doesn’t show up too much until the last episodes but she seems sad and quiet as well.But characters like Jill, suffers minimal changes. He starts up the second season sad and gloomy, but when he gets to know how to get where Kaaya and Neeba are he regains that irritating “save everyone” actitude. The problem is that he is indecisive and isn’t aware of anything at times. In my opinion a bad main character.The main thing about secondary and other less important main leads is that they do have an important development and are not left alone. They do have important roles in the story development and one’s never kept wandering where a certain character is: they all participate and develop amanzingly well in the story.At the end The Tower of Druaga is an enjoyable anime. It doesn’t have a strong story or great animation either but everything else make up for it. The anime has a big enjoyment factor: when you finish the first season you’ll quickly jump to the second one. And when you finish the second season you will end up loving the anime, mostly because of the relationships between the characters. I really enjoyed Tower of Druaga and I recommend everyone to watch this, you’ll get to laugh a bit, to experince sad moments and to, most impotantly, appreciate everything  this world has to offer. this type of anime.

Instead of ""everyone happily going on a hiking trip"", the story is centered more on betrayal and vengeance - PG style. Unfortunately, the animation quality hasn\'t improved much from season one, but they have finally stopped cramming in weaksauce CG like Gonzo\'s previous projects (ie. Druggynaut, BlAss-rater, etc.). Fans of season one are more likely to enjoy this due to the obvious reason of ""sequel"", but they are enough flashbacks to make season one optional.Art: 7Hokay, so its no longer a secret that Fatina is so bangin\' hot and every man in Uruk wants...to have her babies. But not even the Scarlett Johansson of Meskia can keep us entertained if all the fights in this show look like Street Fighter Alpha. Hell even Pokemon had more exciting battles. So... what I mean to say is don\'t expect any Soul Caliber from this show.Sound: 7Fairly catchy OP, although most of the attractiveness is in the form of a smokin\' hot blonde mage (magess?). There\'s really not much to say about the sound, cuz honestly, who cares?Character: 9If there is one redeeming aspect of the Sword of Uruk, it would be the addition of new characters, as well as the expansion of previous ones. One gripe I had with season one was the shallow-ness of the entire cast. This just... happened, no one knew, no one asked, no one explained. This time around, there is some back-story to explain the reasons for the characters\' actions in season one. As random as they may be, any explanation is better than no explanation. Jil forming a new party with Neeba\'s old comrades was a good move since it gave an opportunity for them to say things that they couldn\'t in season one.Enjoyment: 10To be honest, I probably wouldn\'t have enjoyed this show if it wasn\'t for Fatina. There must be something about that bangin\' hot body that makes me laugh at all the lame gaffs in this show. For those of you who don\'t like hardcore, bloodthirsty, action animes I high recommend you to give this a look. Ditto for those of you with a soft spot for tsundere blondes.And oh yea, Fatina is a hottie. to have her babies. But not even the Scarlett Johansson of Meskia can keep us entertained if all the fights in this show look like Street Fighter Alpha. Hell even Pokemon had more exciting battles.

Nothing compared to the first season, which I enjoyed WAY more. I\'m gonna try to keep this spoiler free, but that may be hard to.Story - 6The story for ToD had POTENTIAL. But it lost it for me. Most of the episodes felt like a burden to watch, and I only watched cause I wanted to see the end. There\'s Jil and his friends climbing the tower, little girl with some back ground story following them, and then some things happen etc etc. But what I HATED about it was how...DULL they made it all. It all seemed so familiar like I was watching the same episode over and over. And then when things do change up, it\'s some type of stupid plot twist. If you decide to watch the ending, you will see what I\'m talking about.Art-8I liked the art, it was colorful, it was nice, and the action scenes were well done. But you know what kills a good fight scene? Crappy CG monster models. Seriously, that KILLED it for me. At first I thought ""Oh, they trying to do more like they did with the Druaga fight from the first season"". But it looked pretty stupid at most parts, and it rarely got better. May sound like I\'m wailing on it, but to be truthfull, the CG was the only thing that bugged me besides the story plot.Sound-9I liked the voice acting and the action sounds were fitting. Never really much to talk about in this area.Characters-10Best part of the anime. The unique characters. To be honest, some of them just sucked, but than they decided to give us gold in the form of Fatina and Melt. My favorite thing about the whole show is how they all seemed to have their positions in the plot. This character is the nagger, this character is leader, this character is gonna be a bitch. Reminded me of an MMO. Real diverse, and filled with jerks.Enjoyment-7It was kinda hard to enjoy because of the story, but I still managed to give it a 7 (which stands for gooooooooood). It was dull and boring at some points, but than theres points where I thought to my self ""this anime is worth my time"" and in a way, it was. The jokes are funny, most of the actions scenes are well done, and the characters are well built. As long as you don\'t mind the CG monsters and the rather boring story line (Untill you get to the end. There you can decide if it was worth it all or not) this anime was good.Overall, I rate this anime a 7. Worth my time, but wasn\'t all that great. DULL they made it all. It all seemed so familiar like I was watching the same episode over and over. And then when things do change up, it\'s some type of stupid plot twist.

Worth my time, but wasn\'t all that great.', 'It\'s generic fantasy done fairly well on the surface, but ultimately it\'s a hollow experience which reeks of missed potential. Though I haven\'t really spoiled anything explicit, I do refer to a fair amount of events in this review, so it won\'t be for those who don\'t want to know any details of what they\'ll see.Plenty of SoU\'s merit rests on our shared experiences with the characters from the previous season. It also does a satisfying job of tying things from AoU\'s storyline into this one, though unfortunately it fails to improve on AoU\'s foundation or deliver satisfying resolutions of its own. SoU started off...pretty strong, with an exciting build-up in the first two episodes as the old crew gets reunited, and some fun adventures through exotic landscapes and fiendish new enemies in the more threatening Mythical Tower, culminating in the somewhat emotional 7th episode which was in my view the high point of the series. Some of the characters here receive interesting glimpses of characterization and there\'s hope that the story will continue to do things with them. And yet, by its end the show has devolved into a chaotic, ugly blend of clichés, yet more boring betrayals and often shaky dialogue whilst seeming to take itself far too seriously for the crap that it\'s giving you. It features a very weak and kind of ridiculous ""battle against heaven"" and unimaginative fights lacking the animational potency or enough unconventional features to be interesting.The most frustrating aspect of the DRUAGA story is that none of the characters ever received as much investment and care as we could have hoped: At the end of the day they\'re just vocational ""Climbers"" who seem to do it without even needing an objective, apparently because there\'s so little else to do in their world. This is pretty aptly conveyed by the point at which Utu, carrying a wounded Fatina, angrily demands to know why they\'re putting themselves through all of this to follow Jil, and what his reason is for going on (out of the blue, after seeming perfectly fine with not having an objective this whole time). I could only put my head into my hands when Jil replied ""because I\'m a Climber"", with both of his sidekicks seeming mightily impressed by his response and no longer questioning what the hell they\'re doing. There are a huge amount of characters all aiming to reach the top, but all this does is weaken the focus (that might have been used to make core characters more interesting) and muddy the waters as to who wants what, or most importantly why they want it.At the end of the day the show just fails to get you to care enough about the characters given that their purpose, backstory and aims seem so empty and unexplored. The old crew are by the end of the season your typical auxiliaries who can\'t really participate in the end battle alongside Jil by dint of not being the ""chosen ones"", so they ended up pretty much spectating. The deaths of a few mostly forgettable side characters really fail to make things feel more serious, while lazy writing ensures that some characters don\'t even receive any worthy closure to their stories at all, and feel utterly pointless. Betrayals will also have as little effect on the characters as they do on you and we can\'t even relate to the characters because of how undeveloped they are, how ambiguous their blank faces are about their emotional states, and how little detail we have upon their motives when they make decisions which often don\'t seem logical. Female characters are mostly seen falling for male ones, being rescued or fighting supportively rather than independently so there\'s nothing refreshing there, while the \'chosen couple\' is also very bland, given their dull personalities and almost universal lack of real bonding between them throughout either of the two seasons, with most of us inevitably having opted for Fatina over Kaaya.What kept TToD - SoU alive is that it remained a pretty fun adventure, it was easily watchable and had a nice atmosphere almost entirely thanks to its good OP\'s and ED\'s - these are graced by fun songs that draw you into the world a bit more and wrap each episode in nostalgic, magical feelings. I\'d imagine it\'s because of these feelings and the (albeit somewhat primitive) connections we established with Fatina, Utu, Melt and Coopa that we\'re all a little sad to leave the world of Uruk for good. Despite this, it just didn\'t manage to make its best characters more than fun sidekicks for the most part, or to make its story compelling enough given how unclear and shallow the reasons behind everything relating to the plot are. It suffers from the same weaknesses of its predecessor in the domain of animation (gaping lack of facial expressions) and just doesn\'t really have what it takes to be a superior anime. With attempts at humour that are passable but no real improvement on its predecessor, it\'s as if SoU tries to be lots of things but in the end doesn\'t really do anything that well.4.5/10 pretty strong, with an exciting build-up in the first two episodes as the old crew gets reunited, and some fun adventures through exotic landscapes and fiendish new enemies in the more threatening Mythical Tower, culminating in the somewhat emotional 7th episode which was in my view the high point of the series.

With attempts at humour that are passable but no real improvement on its predecessor, it\'s as if SoU tries to be lots of things but in the end doesn\'t really do anything that well.4.5/10', '----Rundown:1) Pros- Good story- Solid characters- Story is told mainly from 3 point of views2)Cons-Bad art , and i mean bad (excessive use of CGI, bad animated faces)-Not much of a satisfying end...*Overall 9/10The tower of druage is a great anime overall , great story, good characters, decent art.It is sad to see that the animation aspect is full with crappy CGI and really bad drawn expression ""faces"", the anime could have been literally in my favorites if it hasn\'t been for this annoying downside.If i have to sum it up : high caliber story with bad execution!*Story 9/10The story is interesting as it is told but the ""brave hero king"" point of view in many cases, his Rationalization for his actions which are raise a philosophical dilemma at points mixed with glimpses of his heroic past are really interesting for me to watch.Also told from the hero Jil POV coupled with his brother Neeba (not much maybe just half an episode) which give us yest another way to look at the current situation from different set of eyes and circumstances.The story pretty much follows the first part which i wish not so spoil as you ""the reader"" might have not seen.*Art 4/10Bad , just bad.The overuse of CGI really repulses me, alot of the pivotal points could have been drawn in a way better style that makes you just go awe!This is definitely the shows weakest point, i really wish if they picked another studio or something :(*Sound 7/10Nothing special here.*Voice acting 5/10Medicore, no feelings and no stimulation it felt so generic which makes me really sad and frustrated at times. *Overall 9/10The tower of druage is a great anime overall , great story, good characters, decent art.It is sad to see that the animation aspect is full with crappy CGI and really bad drawn expression ""faces"", the anime could have been literally in my favorites if it hasn\'t been for this annoying downside.If i have to sum it up : high caliber story with bad execution!*Story 9/10The story is interesting as it is told but the ""brave hero king"" point of view in many cases, his Rationalization for his actions which are raise a philosophical dilemma at points mixed with glimpses of his heroic past are really interesting for me to watch.Also told from the hero Jil POV coupled with his brother Neeba (not much maybe just half an episode) which give us yest another way to look at the current situation from different set of eyes and circumstances.The story pretty much follows the first part which i wish not so spoil as you ""the reader"" might have not seen.*Art 4/10Bad , just bad.The overuse of CGI really repulses me, alot of the pivotal points could have been drawn in a way better style that makes you just go awe!This is definitely the shows weakest point, i really wish if they picked another studio or something :(*Sound 7/10Nothing special here.*Voice acting 5/10Medicore, no feelings and no stimulation it felt so generic which makes me really sad and frustrated at times.', ""What the hell happened?Those four words generally sum up my disbelief at the second season. Granted I know this show isn't a beacon of comedy, I understand that but holy crow did they ever suck the humor out of this show, except for the third episode you may be hard-pressed to find any sort of humor in this season, it's like the creators decided no we're not going to include any comedy in this season. Without the comedy this show ultimately suffers, the pacing starts to slow the show down considerably and you feel like watching this show is almost like a chore instead of...something you want to watch.But I have to digress, the Voice acting is sharp, However, I think it's a shame Melt does not have as many lines as he did in the first one and thus the comedic factor is lost. The leads do a great job though but sometimes it feels as if they are sleep walking through the script.Nothing bad to say about the animation, it's really gorgeous and it seems that reducing the amount of CGI helped the show for the better.As for the new characters I have to say I was dissapointed, without trying to spoil anything I have to admit I was suprised with Henaro, I never saw that coming, that character was well done. Elevating Utu and Fatina to major characters helps the show out a lot, and it's great there is a new group this time instead of the previous group. The Four Coffin Knights were not interesting. I have to say I ended up caring for none of them including Mite.So frankly I have to say that I wish GONZO had thought harder about how to write the Second Season because it felt rushed and at times incomplete. something you want to watch.But I have to digress, the Voice acting is sharp, However, I think it's a shame Melt does not have as many lines as he did in the first one and thus the comedic factor is lost.

The new attitude of Fatina made me really happy when I noticed she calmed down and wasn't so prissy anymore. I extremely enjoyed the first season although I could have done without some of the comical satire they aired in the first two episodes. Overall I can see this anime going places. The artwork pleased me just as much as the first season as well as most of the other aspects of it.I would definitely say give the anime a chance....It has excellent potential to glue viewers to their seats.And obviously watch the first season before you try to watch this or you will have no idea what's going on :) It has excellent potential to glue viewers to their seats.And obviously watch the first season before you try to watch this or you will have no idea what's going on :)"", 'Irony. Harsh or not, unbelievable or not, this word describes this season of Druaga perfectly. Normally I would be against such a broad generalization, but as I was writing the rest of the review, no matter how much I struggled, how much I fought against it, every respect of this season always came back to it, and in the end I had to relinquish all my hopes.Even while holding true to this concept, don’t rush to judgments, Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk is an overall enjoyable experience, and does indeed have strong points worth mentioning, this is undisputable. Instead the question about this...season is how well a show that ends every string of events in contradiction with itself, can manage to remain entertaining despite its ups and downs.Some traits of the first season are obviously carried here, but other than the introduction and the cast all the rest is pretty well hidden under layers and layers of “safe plot devices”, and all the drifting between genres that existed has been streamlined, but saying more here would make my first statement devoid of purpose, so I will hold the conclusion for when I am not specifically writing an introduction.It is important to note that I will avoid repetition by rushing through some aspects that remained unchanged from the previous season, reading my other review before hand would be advised (but not mandatory).----------------------------------Story----------------------------------The main aim of a sequel is to move the plot forward, and in this respect Druaga delivers. The problem makes itself apparent when we start worrying about character development, dilemmas, and a few other crucial aspects that usually a good plot is compromised of, and these are all seldom scattered throughout the episodes, never shinning enough to make the predictive nature of this season go anywhere interesting. It hints otherwise every now and then, but ultimately it boils down to the safest way to create just enough attrition for the plot to not stagnate completely.This is where the irony begins. If you watch the very first (and wonderful) episode of the first season and the very last one of the second season you will cringe and run away. Luckily this doesn’t happen right at first so you can enjoy the momentum quite well, and while it lasts details like the characters having no coherent reasoning behind any of their actions, the plot unfolding like it’s chained on trails with holes the size of canyons and expectations being crushed with every single dialogue line seems minor, and if you have happened to grow enough affection for the protagonists even reasonable.At any rate, the story is one aspect that degraded from the first part of the show, and as awkward as it might be, they borrowed heavily from the worse aspects while leaving the bare minimum of the good ones. It is still enjoyable if you are looking to find out what happens with the characters, but without this previous emotional bound to them, I find it hard to believe anyone else would be able appreciate it as much.----------------------------------Art / Animation & Sound----------------------------------It’s is pretty much the same as the first one, strong character design, vivid colors and weak motion animation summarize it perfectly, including both the 2D and CGI aspects of it as well as the unevenness that plagued the first season. The sound also didn’t drop the bar below what we have seen before, with the possible exception of the intro song that I found to be marvelous (not to mention addictive), as well as the animation that accompanies it that is at the same time top quality and refreshing.The main gripe here lies in the fact that the animation quality doesn’t follow the climax of the plot, in other words, non important sequences get bumped up in quality, while the decisive ones are plagued with out-of-context CGI, stock footage (tons of it) and stiff character motion, and the more the climax escalates the worse it gets, culminating on a terribly weak decisive battle, that is not only incredibly predictable, but thanks to the animation pretty dull as well.----------------------------------Characters----------------------------------The first season had the habit of performing drastic changes on character mid way thought it, but this is all long gone. Characters here start and finish at the same place going back two steps every time they move one forward. But perhaps this is not the best metaphor to describe it, since in reality they are so stagnant throughout the whole story, that from time to time the only noticeable difference from scene A to scene B, is in their dialogues and to whom they are talking to at the moment.The outcome might be a bit iffy, but they try really hard (really Hard!) to make this as epic as possible. They throw in tragedies one after the other, make ground shaking battles at every opportunity with over proportioned explosions (including even atomic mushrooms!) and create the most awkward romantic interactions I have ever seen, just trying to raise the emotional relevance of everything, and the irony here is that they try so much so many different things, one end up getting in the way of the other instead of improving them overall.They do attempt to give motivation to the enemies and feelings to the people that eventually die (something somewhat lacking in the first season), but since they have to share screen time with the six to seven main characters and still throw in detractions in the form of redundant characters that conveniently disappear from the plot, nude bath scenes for pure fanservice (tons and tons of them), and even a few remnants of humor from the last season, what we end up getting is an indecisive pile of  expectations without much delivering.----------------------------------Enjoyment & Value----------------------------------As I said, it is unusual for me to be able to resume a season of a show in one word, but irony fits so perfectly in every aspect that I can’t help myself. This fact alone is bad, and if a characteristic like this was this abundantly present on the first season, I probably wouldn’t have got around watching the second one, but since it is not the case, the bonds with the cast helps us endure the bad times and enjoy the good ones out of reasonable proportion.Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk is a worthy sequel where it counts, and even if it loses some of the qualities the first part had, the remains still deliver a coherent follow up and an outcome adequate for the people that enjoyed the first season. Despite the fact that many (myself included) will have to forgive a few disappointments to truly enjoy it, it is still recommended for the ones that liked the first part. The characters still manage to remain interesting and this subjective asset alone holds our interest in the unfolding of the tale persistently, even if it might perish with the last blows dealt by the ending. season is how well a show that ends every string of events in contradiction with itself, can manage to remain entertaining despite its ups and downs.Some traits of the first season are obviously carried here, but other than the introduction and the cast all the rest is pretty well hidden under layers and layers of “safe plot devices”, and all the drifting between genres that existed has been streamlined, but saying more here would make my first statement devoid of purpose, so I will hold the conclusion for when I am not specifically writing an introduction.It is important to note that I will avoid repetition by rushing through some aspects that remained unchanged from the previous season, reading my other review before hand would be advised (but not mandatory).----------------------------------Story----------------------------------The main aim of a sequel is to move the plot forward, and in this respect Druaga delivers.

Along with its romantic undertones, the show never forgets to remain comical. The first episode of the first season may have mislead viewers, but the new episode switches to the main narrative, which is closer in terms of time and place, although the opening sequence is still different from the main plotline.The show kicks off at the point where the first season ended, and the sequel does a great job of catching...up on all the storylines that were left hanging, offering a glimpse of a world that has dramatically changed over the years. Strikingly, the animation was created a year after in 2009, and it still maintains the same engaging nature as the original one. Nudity and fan service are still the part of the story but they're presented with moderation, avoiding any excessive indulgence.The soundtrack blends beautifully into the fantasy atmosphere, combining majestic orchestral pieces with some delicate moments of silence which are carefully used for the maximum effect. The Japanese voice actors are impressive and worth mentioning.In sum, Tower of Druaga: The Sword of Uruk is a successful sequel to the first season, which continues to appeal to the already loyal fan base. For people who are engaged in the story, this sequel is definitely something that worth your time. up on all the storylines that were left hanging, offering a glimpse of a world that has dramatically changed over the years.

It accomplishes what it sets out to do with (mostly) fun characters and a weight that while mostly fantastical in tone and nature, still delivers a few mild punches to the viewer that weren\'t entirely expected. to be insufferably stupid and naive on occasion; not to say that unless every lead has to be a labyrinth of emotion and thought or Machiavellian, but the heroic ideal that he embodies seems to clearly hinder his progress for little more than thinly-veiled egotism that\'s never addressed or worse, seemingly encouraged as part of the tone and message.Child-like innocence and ignorance make for great contrasts to gradual transitions in a long-term arc, but I felt that without a few secondary characters bluntly stating ""Man, that Ji guy has come a long way"" I would\'ve scarcely seen that major of a change between episode two and twenty.This is a bit of a minor point and I think one that might be more personal than anything.I enjoyed watching the series and would recommend it to someone that wanted a lighter anime that wasn\'t too cliche or trope-ridden to be un-watchable.

If you could say that the story in the first season wasn\'t very innovative , the story in the second season is even worse. It\'s so predictable that from the beginnig I already knew what was going to happen . As you probably guess , Jill and the rest of his friends are going to try to get to the Mythical Tower and see...what happened to Neeba and Kaaya . And to get there they\'ll need a help of a small girl called Kai , who looks like Kaaya, only in small ""format"" :D. Also , many things happened in the last six months. King Gilgamesh became more cruel and didn\'t reward the climbers for killing Druaga. Instead he took all the glory for himself. Jill\'s party borke up . Kelb quit the army. Etc. Together with the small girl , the survivals of Neeba and Jill\'s party  formed one party and started , again, their journey to the top of the tower , and in the same time , trying to escape from Uruk\'s army, led by Uragon and the new enemy party, lead by Gremica , a distant relative of Neeba.In this sequel , some of the supporting characters from the first season , such as Fatina and Utu gained more airing time , but also some new characters appeared , like Henaro (who will join their party) , but also some new enemies , like Gremica and Uragon. As the story goes , you will find out Kaaya\'s and Neeba\'s reason for betraying their comrades , but also the goal from the new character in their party , Henaro.Similar to the first season , the story will follow  their  journey (Jil\'s , Uragon, Neeba\'s and Gremica parties) to the top floor of the Mythical Tower . Unfortunately, there won\'t be many varieties of enemies , and it\'ll be focused on the fight between the parties and some other ""guests"" from the four boxes that Pazuz opened in the first season.Jil is still the naive kind of guy who believes everything he\'s told and he forgives everyone no matter what they have done to him. There is a well known saying : ""Fool me once,  shame on you , fool me twice , shame of me"". In his case , he has been fooled and betrayed by almost everyone , so I really don\'t know whom should he blame :D . But what\'s even worse he always find some way to forgive them.....It\'s not related to the story , but I noticed that Kai has a very weird habit . She likes to stick the spoon in other people\'s butts (this is not a joke). Very weird . I guess it was meant to be fun , although I didn\'t found it fun at all .......The other members of Jil\'s party are more normal , and not so naive as Jil , but since their goal is already known , there won\'t be many flashbacks on their past. Instead it\'ll focus more on the present and their fights against the enemy.The animation is the same as in the first season , in other way , average. The music themes are almost the same , so U might get a bit bored from  hearing the same melodies over and over again.Finally,  this anime deserves 7/10 . The main reason for that is that it was very predictable and from the beginning you knew what would happen . The other reason was the naivety of Jil , which really annoyed me . He got betrayed several times, but still he never learned anything from it , and got betrayed again and again. And what\'s worse , he easily forgave the people that betrayed him. Also , the fight\'s weren\'t so interesting as the ones in the first season .  Although it has many flaws and it\'s predictable  , you won\'t get bored by watching it .

Why couldn\'t they have sided with the brother? At least, they killed off some people that should\'ve been killed instead of letting their poor excuse for a main character be friends with them. People try to kill the mc and then change their minds, and then he\'s like ""let\'s be friends."" These types of main characters are very poor and stupid.

Are these characters even developing?"" and ""What\'s keeping me here?""This is because what\'s special about Tower of Druaga is that there really is no main character. And this makes it brilliant.Jil is a kind of focus, for sure, but he really doesn\'t have all that much screentime and we get Neeba, Gilgamesh,...and Ethana side stories all the time. Tower of Druaga doesn\'t really spend that much time developing the backstories of all these characters and instead presents them to you as human beings that you have to learn about from their actions. Because of the limited points of view and lack of introspection, the main judgements of these characters comes from their actions and not their intentions.Tower of Druaga is a grown up world in which all actions have consequences that aren\'t hand waved away. People\'s fights and attachments to characters are never forgotten and continually shape their relationships. Furthermore the show doesn\'t give you any Deus ex machinas and all the characters are reasonably powered. This is really a show about watching a group of characters interacting with each other than it is about that group against the world. What\'s special about Tower of Druaga as opposed to something like Grimgar is that the viewer is NOT a part of that group. Druaga is like reading history or watching documentary footage. You get the feeling that these characters have a full background of experience and reasons for everything that\'s made them the way they are today. And these reasons cannot be explained or shown in one or two or even 24 episodes. Druaga makes me wonder about why a person did X instead of telling me why or me simply not believing it. All of the characters have their own valid reasons for everything they do and aren\'t just sucked into a protagonist\'s story.Besides the characters, that I could on forever about, what makes this anime great is that it EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITIES. So often, I watch a show and just wish that a character would do something, anything, that would lead to more complicated relationships and greater depth. Like, imagine if Kirito had to kill Asuna halfway through the series. Or if Inuyasha left Kagome for 6 months and went travelling with Kikyo instead. These kinds of developments would add so much depth. When I watch Tower of Druaga I can\'t resign myself to thinking that everyone\'s safe or that X person will do probable actions. There are SPOILER multiple betrayals but these also don\'t result in just anger. Characters betray and re-betray each other all the time, because EVERYONE IS ACTING IN THEIR OWN INTEREST just like regular humans do. Tower of Druaga takes the leaps that everyone else either doesn\'t consider or is too afraid to do.Sure the art\'s blah, there\'s cgi, the script is whatevs.Sorry, one second. RELATIONSHIP SPOILER!They take the leap to have MC have complicated relationships with more than one female. Not \'tsundere instant fall in love\' or \'they obviously like each other, come on\', but complicated relationships of mutual trust and affection and I love it.This anime may not be the most fun to watch, but it certainly is very interesting. Its characters are so interesting (at least to me) and their interactions with each other are stronger and more developed than any other show I\'ve watched (besides Bebop). Druaga tells its best stories but not telling you its story. What\'s unsaid between the characters is where the gold comes from, (like Cowboy Bebop).You may not fall off your chair every episode, and you may not cry at every death (did I mention that there\'s meaningful perma-deaths that aren\'t ridiculously built up to?), but what I hope viewers will come away with is a valuable understanding of inter-relationship dynamics between rational, well developed characters. and Ethana side stories all the time. Tower of Druaga doesn\'t really spend that much time developing the backstories of all these characters and instead presents them to you as human beings that you have to learn about from their actions. Because of the limited points of view and lack of introspection, the main judgements of these characters comes from their actions and not their intentions.Tower of Druaga is a grown up world in which all actions have consequences that aren\'t hand waved away. People\'s fights and attachments to characters are never forgotten and continually shape their relationships.

It has its moments, but it's not the greatest.  My honest opinion is that the story is rather simplistic and it doesn't really hold up with its happy go lucky ending.  The characters feel really weak at times, and they don't exactly flesh them out to an extent where we want to care for them.  The music is decent if you mean the opening.  Only decent part of the anime was the opening.  The rest...of the time, it felt like hell watching the anime. It was rather boring outside of the occasional joke and the main antagonist was just boring.  The main heroine? She needed to be slapped because she was the reason why this stuff happened.  The main character needed to learn more about self preservation and to stop dragging people to their death.  The side characters were interesting to a degree, but nothing too ground breaking. of the time, it felt like hell watching the anime.

After that however the series just went downhill. In a hard to explain way it was just bad.The story seems rushed, they switch from scene to scene ungracefully and it feels like there are parts missing in between it all.The fight scenes are uninspired and...just no fun to watch.There are about 3 worthwhile episodes worth watching in the first season and thats just sad.The only thing that barely redeemed the Aegis or Uruk (and I mean barely) were the comedy segments, occasionally they'll get more then a slight chuckle out you.The cliffhanger in the end however did draw me in mostly because I just wanted to see what would happen. But surprisingly the second season didn't disappoint.The Sword of Uruk started off much better, but at this point the whole thing became really serious and it felt like a letdown compared to the first season.Most of the issues present in Aegis or Uruk are here but are far less in number.The fight scenes were a little better and continued to get better toward the end.They filled in all the plot holes (at least as far as I can tell) but it dragged a bit towards the middle kinda making you want to just skip to the end, but dont worry it picks up.Overall it was much better then the first Season and the end leaves you with a nice feeling inside. Id tell you just watch the second season but then you'd be missing out on a lot of story. Its a nice series overall but Id only recommend the whole thing if you are willing to put up with the failure that is the first 12 episodes.(excluding the first episode, My favorite ^.^) just no fun to watch.There are about 3 worthwhile episodes worth watching in the first season and thats just sad.The only thing that barely redeemed the Aegis or Uruk (and I mean barely) were the comedy segments, occasionally they'll get more then a slight chuckle out you.The cliffhanger in the end however did draw me in mostly because I just wanted to see what would happen.

It\'s about the MC satisfying his dreams of heroism, without any responsibility for others. Now in the second season they accept and love it.The first season at least treats you with some comedy and false hope during the first two episodes.There are hundreads if not thousands of similar fantasies out there, I recommend to choose one of those instead, because this is uspeakably dreadful. even worse in one aspect: in the first season they were all somewhat sceptical regarding the MC-s unreasonable ""ganbare"" mentality, because it can get everyone killed, and it\'s not about others.

Dimension W,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31163/Dimension_W,"['*Spoilers will exist to explain why this show is great*Story: 8Now some of you have heard that time is considered part of the fourth dimension, but what if you were told that there is a dimension that contains all of the possibilities in the world? This is basically what the story is based on.The anime does not explain the mechanics of Dimension W too deeply, but it explores it enough to give us an understanding of what it\'s trying to convey, such as when coils go haywire and Dimension W manifests in the real world, or when the characters are able to enter Dimension W...and see all the possibilities. However, the actual use of Dimension W is a bit superficial outside of that. Everything just mainly revolves around coils and the \'possibilities\' get shoved back as more of a nominal thing. So in the end the actual usage and exploration of \'possibilities\' was a bit minimal, and may have become more of just a theme to a battle story with some cute moments.And as good as the combat was, it seemed a little odd at times. Mabuchi seems to just freely throw out however many dart things as he likes, while being able to wire them so he can perform spiderman or AOT style swings and climbs as he wishes, along with the fact that they can also act as some sort of snare. There wasn\'t any moment where he ran out of darts or was in any particular danger due to his choice of weaponry which kind of made him a bit of an immortal god of sorts.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Art: 9In regards to the art, it was very well done, especially the characters. They stood out well and were designed quite differently. Mira was consistently cute, Mabuchi maintained his gruffness, Loser maintained his enigma while Lasithi was designed quite sexily. The use of colour was appropriate to the moment, though backgrounds would occasionally look quite bland.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Character: 9As for the characters, I did want to give it a 10, but the only thing that ruined it was the main antagonist, Haruka Seameyer. He was just a little too cliched with his insanity and cruelty. He just didn\'t feel unique enough as an antagonist for me to really be drawn to him and to actually hate him for his existence (like Joffrey in Game of Thrones).However, setting aside the antagonist, Mabuchi Kyoma is quite the likeable character. He\'s strong and independent (not clinging to friendship nonsense), and has a cool attitude but with a sad history.Whilst Mira is the lovable female MC who\'s a robot with a full human personality. She cries, blushes, and even expresses pain. She\'s funny, cute and most of all, has a consistent character.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sound: 9The voice acting in this was also great. Mabuchi has a cool, deep and slightly apathetic voice that suits the character and helps set him apart from everyone else, while Mira has an appropriately feminine and cutesy voice which greatly complements the character.-------------------------------------------------------------------------------Enjoyment: 10Overall: 9Overall, I really liked this show. Maybe I\'m biased towards shows that can have a consistently cute girl and who isn\'t annoying or out of place. Mira is not your damsel in distress, but an actual partner to Mabuchi, which I feel really helped with me giving this show such a high score. And I definitely hope to hear more of her voice in future titles.*Some further spoilers and personal inputs on what could have made this show even greater*There was a line in the last few episodes that really helped bring the logic of the world and the coils together, which was: ""Possibilities can be predicted and explained but not observed, that is because once it is observed, it is no longer the possibility but the result. I.e. Schrodinger\'s cat."" or something to that effect.This line alone is what could have made this show all the more interesting.

I’d watch some random anime on TV with my friends on Toonami and we’d make jokes about the story, characters, artwork, and every other funny thing going on. Dimension W isn’t a funny story but it does have the feel of a show that’s aimed at the Western audience. And furthermore, it takes place in a fictional world in the future so there’s tons of potential. Dimension W capitalizes on those potentials and makes this show not just fun but an insightful experience.Calling Dimension W another stereotypical sci-fi action flick would be injustice...as the series explores quite a bit based on its premise. The show is directed by Kanta Kamei with Aketagawa Jin as the sound producer and produced by Studio 3Hz and Orange. It’s noticeable that Funimation is the co-committee of this series as well to bring their talent into the mix. For those who have seen Darker than Black, you may find the show has a familiar vibe in terms of character design. The interesting part is how Dimension W focuses on its own story and despite not being too refreshing for its ideas, it’s very a high dose of popcorn entertainment.The story takes place in a fictional world in the future. By 2071, humanity began using a source of energy that can last forever for their planet. Through influence of the fourth dimension, they are able to harness energy in the form of objects known as “coils”.  Coils are manufactured by New Tesla, an energy company that uses them for profit. However, they also private firms and groups that uses illegal coils for their own purposes. The show introduces Kyouma, a collector who has a hatred for coils. His adventures takes him to all sort of places including his meeting with a peculiar robot girl, Mira. Get the picture here? Any fan of sci-fi should feel intrigued because of the amount of world building with the show. Indeed, Dimension W does a good job by building up its fictional world and constructing it concepts with interesting details. The imaginary setting of Dimension W introduces many concepts including its rich history, society, and technological advancements. As such, getting into this show allows the viewers to appreciate the ideas of the creator.In general, the plot is about Kyouma, a collector who despises coils. There’s actually a credible reason for this as explored in later episodes through background storytelling. His encounter with Mira is a bit odd however. Essentially and for most of the series, he is indifferent about her presence and often calls her names like “junk” and “useless robot”. Despite that, there’s a growing chemistry between the two. Mira is also a character that will spark interest because of her very human behavior. She is a robot but displays a lot of personality as if she is an ordinary girl. Throughout the show, we can see that she wants to help people and her partnership with Kyouma leads her to do selfless deeds. Kyouma is portrayed more as the guy who wants to get the job done and lives life like a simple man with a love for vintage cars but hate for coils. His fighting skills is fairly impressive and is able to fight on par with cyborgs, coil enhanced mechanisms, and even multiple enemies at once. Add a bit of his driving skills and it’s easy to see that Kyouma is the badass everyman.When watching the show, I noticed some trends about the plot structure. It focuses on society and explores Kyouma’s daily adventures. At first, some of his cases really shows more than what he does in everyday life. However, subsequent episodes introduces other ways at how Dimension W’s world works. There’s also murder mystery, cyber-punk themes, and how events from the past connects with the story in the present. The show also introduce Numbers and their presence really exposes the dangers of coils. Background storytelling is also incorporated into the show that explores Kyouma and other characters’ pasts. Unfortunately, the series is only one cour of 12 episodes while the manga has at least 9 volumes. Get the idea? Expect a lot of cuts with certain side characters and certain rush of the story to get to specific arcs. Characters like Elizabeth, Albert, and other many of the minor villains get some spotlights but not much characterization. As one of the downsides, Dimension W’s adaptation content may be a disappointment for manga fans.Despite that, I think the show is still very entertaining for its characters. Then, there’s a lot about the Dimension W universe that is intriguing. We get to see how androids interact, the world fiction of Dimension W’s technological aspects (coils, numbers, machinery, etc), and the show even has some pretty solid action. Kyouma’s a legitimate badass and he has little patience for evildoers. Similarly, the show has both a comedic and serious feel. The comedic moments are timed right especially through the interactions between Kyouma and Mira. In addition, the series rarely tries to exploit its shock values to entertain the fans but rather with its own merits.The art style of Dimension W tends to have a very scientific feel. Character designs are also neat and will remind anyone of Darker than Black. Kyouma reminds me of a lone wolf detective and bounty hunter that came out of a classic movie. Meanwhile, Mira has the appearance of a young girl with robotic characteristics. (see that cute little mechanical tail?) The sci-fi backgrounds and technology also looks credible and advanced enough to be set in its timeline. The gadgets of the show and other robotic designs have a fair amount of details to further make its world building look believable. There’s even a bit of artistic enhancement with creative shade coloring at many noticeable scenes. Fan service is fairly minimal although there are a few times when the camera likes to shine on Mira. The real fan service is the action delivered right to your face.Soundtrack is solid especially when Kyouma is on a mission involving him collecting illegal coils. It’s eerie, energetic, and portrays science fiction with theatrics. In addition, I appreciate how Kyouma’s voice sounds as a mature adult rather than some kid out of high school. On the other hand, Mira’s voice can sound a bit bratty so fans will have to get used to that. Luckily, you will be rewarded with the very creative OP song. Performed by STEREO DIVE FOUNDATION, it’s very colorful with the dancing, full throttle action, and creative coloring. OST and music is just as impressive and shows that the creators cares a lot about their work.Dimension W is a show that I think anyone can watch with something to talk about towards the end. Whether it’s the world building, storytelling, characterization, or technical art/music/soundtrack style, the show is a lot of fun. It lives up to what it tries to do despite cutting content from the original manga. As most series in modern years, it’s not very original and still borrows a lot of ideas from other sci-fi works. However, Dimension W still embraces the sci-fi genre and shows that it can be unique in its own way. as the series explores quite a bit based on its premise. The show is directed by Kanta Kamei with Aketagawa Jin as the sound producer and produced by Studio 3Hz and Orange. It’s noticeable that Funimation is the co-committee of this series as well to bring their talent into the mix. For those who have seen Darker than Black, you may find the show has a familiar vibe in terms of character design. The interesting part is how Dimension W focuses on its own story and despite not being too refreshing for its ideas, it’s very a high dose of popcorn entertainment.The story takes place in a fictional world in the future. By 2071, humanity began using a source of energy that can last forever for their planet. Through influence of the fourth dimension, they are able to harness energy in the form of objects known as “coils”.  Coils are manufactured by New Tesla, an energy company that uses them for profit. However, they also private firms and groups that uses illegal coils for their own purposes. The show introduces Kyouma, a collector who has a hatred for coils. His adventures takes him to all sort of places including his meeting with a peculiar robot girl, Mira. Get the picture here? Any fan of sci-fi should feel intrigued because of the amount of world building with the show. Indeed, Dimension W does a good job by building up its fictional world and constructing it concepts with interesting details. The imaginary setting of Dimension W introduces many concepts including its rich history, society, and technological advancements. As such, getting into this show allows the viewers to appreciate the ideas of the creator.In general, the plot is about Kyouma, a collector who despises coils. There’s actually a credible reason for this as explored in later episodes through background storytelling. His encounter with Mira is a bit odd however. Essentially and for most of the series, he is indifferent about her presence and often calls her names like “junk” and “useless robot”. Despite that, there’s a growing chemistry between the two. Mira is also a character that will spark interest because of her very human behavior. She is a robot but displays a lot of personality as if she is an ordinary girl. Throughout the show, we can see that she wants to help people and her partnership with Kyouma leads her to do selfless deeds. Kyouma is portrayed more as the guy who wants to get the job done and lives life like a simple man with a love for vintage cars but hate for coils. His fighting skills is fairly impressive and is able to fight on par with cyborgs, coil enhanced mechanisms, and even multiple enemies at once. Add a bit of his driving skills and it’s easy to see that Kyouma is the badass everyman.When watching the show, I noticed some trends about the plot structure. It focuses on society and explores Kyouma’s daily adventures. At first, some of his cases really shows more than what he does in everyday life. However, subsequent episodes introduces other ways at how Dimension W’s world works. There’s also murder mystery, cyber-punk themes, and how events from the past connects with the story in the present. The show also introduce Numbers and their presence really exposes the dangers of coils. Background storytelling is also incorporated into the show that explores Kyouma and other characters’ pasts. Unfortunately, the series is only one cour of 12 episodes while the manga has at least 9 volumes. Get the idea? Expect a lot of cuts with certain side characters and certain rush of the story to get to specific arcs.

While not the flashiest, and certainly not the most outstanding anime- DimW has one thing going for it: it\'s original. Sidestepping the trappings and tropes that seem to permeate modern anime, and instead embracing a groovy sci-fi near future with androids, flying cars, giant robots, and more- this one was a definite breath of fresh air.Produced by Studio 3Hz, apparently a very new studio, with literally one credit to their name, the animation and art aren\'t anything special, but neither are they completely uninspired. It\'s a...bit on the low budget side compared to some modern shows, but fluid and frenetic action coupled with some stylized CG made it very watchable. Similarly, voice acting is handled competently, and the music fits well, adding accents or enhancement to the mood when necessary.The nearly infinite, but unstable energy source that the show is named for takes a front and center position in the plot- weaving a narrative around the creation of ""coils"", which as essentially batteries that can access the 4th dimension, a plane of existence where possibility is endless, and is tapped into as a source of energy. Everything takes coils: the robots, cars, computers, and nearly the entire world run on this limitless supply of energy.Kyouma Mabuchi, our main character, is essentially a luddite in this techno world of Dimension W. He works essentially as a mercenary, collecting special types of highly unstable coils which can create massive rifts in space/time, and generally screw up everything, including sucking people into the energy black hole it forms. In return, he gets paid in things like gasoline (a scarce commodity in this future-world) and parts for his ""antique"" cars.Kyouma\'s dislike for coils, robots, and essentially anything technological puts him at odds with the technologically obsessed world he lives in- in a sort of ""born in the wrong generation"" way. His rugged, tough guy, and often rude demeanor are offputting to most people he meets, but he\'s dependable to get stuff done when it needs doing.The premise of the show is a fairly basic revenge tale, but this isn\'t immediately apparent, even through the first half of the show. The first section with Kyouma taking various jobs from his boss serves mostly as a semi-episodic adventure, introducing all the myriad characters, and then neatly segues into a long term plot. Without saying too much- there\'s a very collectible coil situated in a very dangerous area out in the Pacific ocean- one that is worth a lot of money, and none of the ""collectors"" (people like Kyouma who hunt coils for a living) can pass up. In a sort of ""Mewtwo Strikes Back"" kind of way- this alluring prize on an island in an old lab turns out to be more dangerous than any of the collectors can handle. They gather, each with their own goals and reasons for doing so- whether to use the money to help a decimated country, for personal greed, revenge, or just to satisfy bloodthirst, and this sets the stage for a battle royale of wits and wills. At times though, the show seems to lose sight of what it was going for- getting sidetracked on what are seemingly one off adventures that mostly end in Kyouma questioning something about himself, but not actually creating any new development.The show has quite a large cast to be as short as it is, but this isn\'t all great, as many characters are relegated to first string bench warmer status, and play little to no role, especially later on. It does, however, do a fair job of returning to important moments from previous scenes, and wrapping things that seemed like dead ends up.Kyouma\'s motivation for his job and raison d\'etre are both explored at length. Finally, a show with a non-insert main character who actually has both tangible goals and reasons for why they do what they do. In his own angry-at-the-world way, Kyouma struggles against his inner demons, for love lost, his survivor\'s guilt, and the purpose of his continued existence in a world he no longer cares about. Cynical, hardened, and rather rage-filled, he makes for an interesting character who doesn\'t need anyone but himself, and honestly doesn\'t really care if people around him get hurt or killed. While not entirely heartless, he\'s a pretty cold and stoic character focused almost solely on his revenge. This isn\'t revealed immediately, but as we learn more about the character, we slowly begin to understand the obsession that eats at him.In finishing, Dimension W was a nice change of pace this season- with a very action oriented show that wasn\'t preachy or pretentious in presentation, satisfying, and most importantly: unique. It\'s not a mystery, and it\'s not a pure shonen battle- it\'s got just the right amount of spice to keep things interesting, moving, and fresh. I don\'t think there are too many anime that couldn\'t benefit from longer to flesh out their ideas and really explore characters and plots, but Dimension W is just about right at 12 episodes. Any less would have felt extremely rushed, and any more would have unnecessarily dragged it out. A shallow anime that\'s enjoyable enough? Sleeper anime of the season? That\'s for you to decide.As always, come rage at me, or say something nice.

I don\'t care.', ""Dimension W, definitely the best thing Studio 3Hz has made so far.Dimension W is a very episodic road trip-ish anime about a dude who is essentially abounty hunter and a robot girl who gets stuck with him.Pretty standard setup for an action show with some fancy visuals.It's not without its flaws but if that sounded interesting to you it might be worth a watch.--Full review: minor spoilers ahead-Presentation(visuals & sound)Dimension W has some well used CGI, though sometimes it can still stand out a bit too much....The backgrounds are well made, the CGI never felt choppy, and I like the character designs.I've heard from some people that this is their favorite OP of the season, but it just sounded like pretty generic electro to me.Same thing with the ED, not saying they're bad but I've heard better.Overall the animation is just very fluid, colorful and nice to look at.-StoryDimension W is very arch based and starts with what I would call a very bad first episode, it's essentially just a setup for the next episode.If you plan on giving Dimension W a go, then make sure you watch two episodes before deciding if you're going to complete it.The second episode is much stronger, and introduces one of the recurring characters, Loser (yes they actually call him that).There's one more episode that just felt like mostly boring info dumping, but that doesn't come until later on.And even with the info dumping by the characters this is how I understand the coils: wibbly wobbly timey wimey, realities inside of coils.Based on the premise I thought this show would comment on fossil fuel usage, but I didn't really hear much of that at all, for the better or worse.For the sake of explanation I'm going to mention that the coils can essentially provide infinite energy, meaning they can do pretty much anything.The author clearly had fun with this, maybe a bit too much since sometimes it feels like whatever happens the author basically pulled out of his ass.Not that it matters too much since it's excused and explained and the story isn't super important here.One more gripe I have with the story is how the characters backstories are explained almost entirely in flashbacks, come on can't you figure out something more creative?Otherwise the story is interesting enough.The ending is conclusive enough, definitely not just a read the manga ending.-CharactersProbably the best or the second best thing about the show, depending on how much you appreciate the animation.For once we don't have a completely bland main character, Mabuchi Kyouma is a person who dresses in traditional clothes and hates coils.Minor note that I don't particularly like the fact that Kyoma does his fighting with throwing knives, it tends to make for poor battle choreography.Though the choreography is still better than average.He has a fairly extensive backstory that I won't spoil.Yurizaki Mira is Kyoma's robot partner who is extremely strong and can detect coils.Their dynamic was quite fun to watch, and mira is also given an okay backstory.Other than that due to the Nature of the show there aren't that many interesting recurring characters aside from LoserBut what is there is pretty good.-OverallIt might sound a bit harsh to only give Dimension W a 6/10 but there are many shows just like it, and outside of the premisedimension W doesn't have much to distinguish itself with.And on top of that it wasn't really my type of a show to begin with.The narrative can feel a bit choppy at times.Characters didn't get much development because the show was busy just establishing them in 12 episodes.The visuals aren't without a few hiccups and the music used wasn't really my thing either.I could still recommend Dimension W to someone who likes futuristic action shows.

On the surface it does share some of the elements that tend to get a bit more attention from action-starved overseas fans. A cyberpunk setting, a sci-fi thriller plotline, and a no-nonsense masculine lead in Mabuchi Kyouma. The latter is a near-future Luddite. Dimension W is set in a world where everything is powered by devices called 'coils' which tap into a hypothetical fourth dimension for unlimited energy. Kyouma despises the contraptions, symbolically driving a gasoline-fuelled car when the rest of the population has switched...to electric vehicles. The coils are administered by an uber-powerful corporation called New Tesla, and yes, the very predictable routes of corporate corruption will be explored, beating that horse just a few more times as it barely wheezes a neigh.So the punchline is that Dimension W isn't that good, but how could an anime with such a cool setting be so mediocre? Well, let's start with the setting. It actually sucks. A few episodes start with a synopsis that pisses in the face of Albert Einstein, where dimension w is shown on a cartesian x-y-z graph as a line parallel and opposite to the x-axis. A keen observer might notice this is actually the negative-x axis, but the laziness doesn't end there (by the way, E=mc^2 is only the non-relativistic component). Apparently the energy from dimension negative-x is distributed amongst the populace via a network of 60 control towers, and that's not the only big number used to give an illusion of complexity where there is none. Also, apparently New Tesla just straight up murdered the wife and child of their most important inventor, and if there was an actually legitimate reason for this to be at all plausible, I've completely forgot it.That important inventor, Professor Yurizaki, has developed a robot called Mira that mimics human emotions, who due to a series of goofy hijinks, teams up with Kyouma in his job to hunt illegal coils, which aren't regulated by Megagoogle. Her name is Mira and sure enough she's the best character is the series. Cute, while also having genuine agency in the story. The dynamic between her and Kyouma is great fun, so of course the more screen-time she gets, preferably along with Kyouma, the better this show turns out. Well, more than half of the series is taken up by Kyouma's character arc, where she spends a lot of time as a supporting role. Whoopsie!It's a shame in fact, because Dimension W starts off okay. As overwrought and uninspired as the setting is, it can at least serve as a template for some interesting episodic stories. That describes the first five episodes. The latter seven episodes comprise the aforementioned character arc, and boy if the series doesn't squander its potential in them. One thing I've noticed with one-cour series is that they usually tend to do best when they focus on a cast of four or five key characters, while not getting too distracted by side characters that can be interesting but should nonetheless remain on the shelf most of the time. The alternative is having a good story, which at the moment is an ambitious expectation.The last half of this series does neither. Many different parties participate in a search for a macguffin, and so the focus of the plot is immediately split between the motivations and backstories of these parties. This is such a waste of time, when time is of the essence in the one-cour format. Do you care about the stereotypical African prince, or the mysterious phantom thief Loser, or the downtrodden villain who's shoehorned into the plot out of nowhere? Of course not, but Dimension W shoves every hackneyed detail of these characters down your gullet.Granted, if the series kept up the episodic structure, it still wouldn't be good. The underlying flaws in the setting preclude any attempt to really take itself seriously. But it would have at least had variety going for it. Alas, this show is simply following the broad structure of the manga.At least it looks good. The character designs are on point and blend in well with the style of the backgrounds. Both use a fairly wide color palette that is tamed by avoiding over-saturation. The quality of the drawings doesn't deteriorate much, and the animation quality is above average, although the CG robots are as unwelcome as ever.

Its source material is crap and it doesn't make any effort to spice it up."", ""The story of Dimension W takes place in a world where humanity has attained unlimited energy, reshaping the foundation of our daily lives, raising the bar for what is possible for us to achieve. With an interesting premise and the promise of sci-fi action the anime catches your eye easily.The artwork of the series remains flashy and slightly stylized through the whole experience, even when it obviously cuts a few corners. Sometimes the backgrounds will vanish for example, but rather than hide it, Dimension W makes it their greeting card, turning a weakness into a recognizable trait.Sadly enough, when I reached the end of the...series, I couldn't help but feel it ended up a mess. At some point, the series simply lost focus and fell under the pressure of its own potential. What I mean by that is that the setting, story, and characters, are being pulled in so many directions that you can't get a sense of what it wants to be. It lays out its premise very clearly - 'What if humanity had unlimited energy?' - yet it never focuses on exploring this concept. Instead it brings in tropes from countless other animes and classic stories, and then tries to push it all into a blender.

Neither of those examples seem to fit into a sci-fi setting.I was very happy to see some actual variety in the cast, showing a wide array of personalities, backgrounds, and nationalities. It's not every day that you see African characters portrayed in anime, and on top of it, playing roles that are important to the story.

At some point, the series simply lost focus and fell under the pressure of its own potential. What I mean by that is that the setting, story, and characters, are being pulled in so many directions that you can't get a sense of what it wants to be. It lays out its premise very clearly - 'What if humanity had unlimited energy?' - yet it never focuses on exploring this concept. Instead it brings in tropes from countless other animes and classic stories, and then tries to push it all into a blender.

Underrated and often overlooked, it offers a refreshing blend of science fiction, action, and mystery that captivates viewers from the very beginning. With its intriguing concept and well-executed storyline, it deserves recognition for its unique take on the futuristic world it presents.Set in a not-too-distant future, Dimension W revolves around the existence of ""coils,"" devices capable of harnessing unlimited energy from a parallel dimension called ""Dimension W."" However, as humanity grows dependent on these coils, a darker side of this newfound power emerges. The story follows...Kyoma Mabuchi, a skilled bounty hunter with a deep mistrust for coils, as he gets entangled in a conspiracy that threatens the delicate balance between dimensions.One of the anime\'s greatest strengths lies in its world-building. It presents a visually stunning and meticulously crafted universe that effortlessly blends the familiar with the extraordinary. The animation is consistently polished, showcasing vibrant landscapes, detailed character designs, and fluid action sequences. The artistic direction is complemented by a fitting soundtrack that enhances the atmosphere and adds depth to the overall viewing experience.The characters are well-rounded and memorable. Kyoma Mabuchi, the stoic and determined protagonist, undergoes substantial growth throughout the series as he confronts his own past and unravels the mysteries surrounding the coils. The introduction of Mira Yurizaki, an android with human-like emotions, brings a layer of complexity to the narrative, as she becomes an unexpected ally to Kyoma. The interactions and dynamics between the characters are engaging and contribute to the overall sense of intrigue.While the plot may seem complex at times, it maintains a steady pace and keeps viewers on their toes with its intriguing plot twists and revelations. The anime skillfully balances action-packed sequences with quieter, more contemplative moments, allowing for character development and exploration of deeper themes.Furthermore, it delves into thought-provoking ideas such as the ethical implications of technological advancements, the consequences of unchecked human ambition, and the nature of humanity itself. These themes are subtly woven into the narrative, making viewers reflect on their own relationship with technology and the potential ramifications of its misuse.However, Dimension W is not without its flaws. Some viewers may find certain plot points or character arcs to be underdeveloped or rushed, leaving room for additional exploration. Additionally, the series concludes with a sense of open-endedness, leaving several questions unanswered. While this may be frustrating for some, it also invites speculation and allows for personal interpretation.

The nemesis was presented and written poorly.The best I can say for this series, it started off with lots of potential and I was hyped and excited to see the next episodes, a few weeks ago.

For a sci-fi series to stand its ground, its need to at least  have a solid fleshed out world or rules that are consistent to that world, or else, everything else will fall flat and lose its impact. Dimension W follows the typical sci-fi formula while still being able to differentiate itself from others in the genre. In a world where unlimited energy is no longer an issue, Dimension W explores the possibilities and situations various people can still go through. Devices called Coils...were created to harness an unlimited source of energy. At first might be seen as a MacGuffin Device, Coils, which are pretty important in the world building, are a means to deliver elements of the narrative.One of the many notable aspects of Dimension W is its ability to stay consistent to its own rules. I always admired how Dimension W was able to use its ""4-th dimension"" premise"" to craft intriguing yet enjoyable stories and plot points, plot points that actually become relevant as the series progresses. The show was able to build an interesting world with creative rules and still able make new ones while not breaking the show. Dimension W doesn\'t don\'t do anything groundbreaking, but the story for the most part is consistent and its all I ever want from sci-fi animated series. Another brilliant element of the show is its cast of characters. Kyouma is your typical badass main character who lives in the future, but due to unforeseen circumstances in the past, hates the world he lives in. Mira, his cute robot sidekick, provides a light cheerful mood in the relationship in contrast to Kyouma\'s serious and brooding demeanor. The chemistry and history between the two is enjoyable to watch, as well as give some levity to the dangerous situations they are put in. Another character, who is my personal favorite, is the supposed ""villain"" of the series, Loser. A masked vigilante with cybernetic enhancements with the power to manipulate energy, with an added bonus of having an awesome costume design and mysterious past. From the get-go, I was in love with his character and I loved what the show did to explore his character even more, giving him a meaningful yet compelling motivation.The animation for the most part is pretty solid, it isn\'t as shiny or as polished as a high budget anime, but it could have been a lot worse also. It gets the job done. When it came to action scenes, they were pretty enjoyable, though was a bit disappointed with the lack of choreography seeing as how Kyouma is basically a ninja... Well he is, isn\'t he?  The art and aesthetics of the show also work in its favor. The character designs are all unique and makes it easier to distinguish the characters. The choice of colors was also quite pleasing to see as it helps portray the beautiful world of Dimension W and its sci-fi landscape. The use of green was also quite clever as it is used to portray how energy flows in that world as well as give the various locations in the show charm. The music for the most part is pretty good. The Opening song, as well as the animation in conjunction with it, will be stuck in your mind for awhile. Seriously, it is that catchy. The OST is also pretty solid, however, they isn\'t many outstanding tracks. The ending song of each episode was also nice to listen to.There aren\'t many complaints I have with the series. Dimension W followed the typical sci-fi formula of having a futuristic setting for ""such and such"" reason and certain situations because of some science related disaster. The show sort of played it safe by following the usual tropes seen in sci-fi series, while still being able to bring something new to the table. The premise of unlimited energy, the existence of a 4-th dimension, and presence of impending doom all makes the show really enjoyable and entertaining to watch, which is all I want from a sci-fi  series. Not every sci-fi show needs to be an overly dramatic, dark, and serious thriller. I enjoyed every aspect of the show, and this is without a doubt one of the most enjoyable series of 2016 so far, as well as my favorite of the Winter 2016 season.I highly recommend the show to those looking for a good action and sci-fi series, Dimension W will fill your needs. I can guarantee you will not get bored with the series. However, those looking for a serious and compelling story or a show with amazing visuals, you may want to approach this show with caution.

Overall Dimension W is a pretty solid sci-fi series that entertained me throughout its entire run.', ""I binged watched Dimension W for 2 days while waiting for episode 12 to air. I have to say that I thoroughly enjoyed Dimension W. Here are some of the reasons.Story (8): What I loved about Dimension W is that it is engaging and leaves you wanting more and more. You want to know what happens in every twist and turn and in a way, you wish that it could go on and on. I did not like however that it felt entirely inconclusive and that the ending seemed lacking, at least for me.Art (9): Bandai Visual is one of the best production houses, in...my opinion and the art for Dimension W was colorful, despite the darkness of its theme. The animation was also really stunning and the fight scenes are engaging. It's not overwhelming to look at and the characters, both protagonists, supporting characters and villains, seem distinct.Sound (9): I really give much credit for the opening and ending themes for the score I'm giving this category because they are amazing. I loved the opening theme and of course animation. It definitely brought me back to my love of Gangsta. The ending was just adorable. The sound in the show itself wasn't necessarily up there but it blended in nicely with the plot.Character (8): What's so great about the characters of Dimension W is that they don't beg to be liked, well maybe except for Mira, who you need to like because cmon that face. Anyway, the characters are not waiting for you to love them because they are stereotypically lovable. They aren't. You wouldn't love Kyouma if you're looking for a bishounen or someone who is nice and sweet. He isn't. He's a cold,  badass and detached person yet why do I love him so much? It's because he is himself. This goes for the other characters like Loser, Mary and even Salva. They aren't the type of people you'd actually like but you like them anyway.Although one thing I have to say is that some characters felt like fillers. Even Al felt like a filler character. A lot of them are and some of them seem senseless. All in all, character-wise, Dimension W was pretty solid.Enjoyment (8): I left watching Dimension W thoroughly enjoyed. Although I didn't necessarily have those shouty feeling-feelings I usually have for an anime, I have to say that because of the action and the story, I definitely got hooked. There were more hits than misses but I think those holes could've been filled if it were a few more episodes longer.Overall (8): If you're looking for an anime that can fill your action and angst needs, Dimension W is a pretty decent anime to go and watch. my opinion and the art for Dimension W was colorful, despite the darkness of its theme.

Spoilers ahead!)When I was a kid, I would play video games so much that I had to constantly beg my parents to keep a reserve of batteries in the house. We actually stashed them in the refrigerator, believing that having them at a colder temperature would somehow make them last longer.Whether or not that’s true, though, I cannot say. What I can say is that Dimension W needed to replace its own batteries at some point but never got the memo.STORYDimension W follows Kyouma, a man with a deep resentment for Coils. Coils are a newfound...technology that tap into the ominous fourth-dimension – named Dimension W – allowing for, as its founder would describe, “unlimited energy.”While not technically true, Dimension W has two halves: the first five episodes and the last seven episodes.The first five episodes do a nice job of presenting necessary information. The concept of Coils, the society built around the devices, and the futuristic setting are laid out. Mira, a unique cyborg, makes for a cute yet purposeful companion. And the importance of the so-called Numbers is made known. All within just the first two episodes.Episode three is more character oriented, but episodes four and five are more relevant narratively. Episode four includes an interesting setting relative to the one given prior, and episode five introduces the idea that Numbers allow for a myriad of possibilities – an important detail for later.Then the rest of the anime happens.Where the first five episodes were spread out in terms of focus, the last half of the anime hones in on one specific plotline: Easter Island. With the change in focus comes a drastic change in scale. Before, breaking into a museum, playing with a bunch of kids, and investigating a spooky mansion were as grandiose as the anime got. Afterwards, threats of global destruction, the end goal of the different cast members, and the political and violent direction each inflate the scale beyond what feels reasonable.Simultaneously, the anime tries and fails to introduce new narrative elements. Different villains that are either too silly or improperly explored join the fray. Random ideas, like a floating ball of energy or Mira moving through Kyouma’s subconscious, are difficult to accept even with all of the concurrent pseudoscience. Even certain plotlines, such as the bureaucracy finding out about Mira’s true origins, are discarded, making the anime come off as forgetful.In order to present a lot of this information, the anime relies on heavy exposition. Characters spill their thoughts through long-winded monologues. And thematic subtlety is traded for heavy-handed explanations, telling rather than showing its messages.Nevertheless, these themes are surprisingly complex: immutable history, acceptance of reality, and indeterminism.In Dimension W, many of the episodes focus on the past. Kyouma’s life and wife are presented entirely through flashback. The same happens for many of the events in the last half of the anime – how Kyouma came to acquire Genesis, what drove Seameyer to go insane, and so on. In a way, the anime demonstrates that the past cannot be changed. I.e., history is immutable.Along the same lines, the show pushes the idea that people have to accept this given reality. Both Kyouma and Salva refuse to acknowledge their pasts. For them (and anyone), it’s something that sticks no matter how much they may forget or not want to remember.Yet that does not mean what is to come is predetermined. For while the past cannot be changed, and the present must be accepted, the future has no such rules. The possibilities are endless. Mira does not have to sacrifice herself. Kyouma can turn a new leaf. Loser has every right to fight to save his beloved.Altogether, these themes have close ties to Dimension W (the concept, not the title). Dimension W’s voids symbolize history’s immutability through their stillness. The widespread use of Dimension W, despite it challenging established norms, represents society’s acceptance. And Dimension W creating multiple possibilities help to highlight that indeterminism still stands.The themes are both layered and connected, and the first half of the narrative is at least competent. But the numerous amount of issues in the second half are still enough to make the narrative an overall weak package.ANIMATIONDimension W’s artistic direction does have a few positives. It uses a visual trick to, at times, profile the characters. One-colored backgrounds and off-colored shadows give Kyouma, Mira, and others a poster-art look. The technique does not serve a purpose, but it does add flair.The outcome of interacting with Dimension W (the concept) is also an interesting choice. Grotesque mutations and otherworldly obstructions turn what should be a lauded discovery into a hideous amalgamation – a dichotomy reminiscent of the show’s own love-and-hate technology motif.The rest of the art tends to be hit or miss. On the hit side, the sprawling city – with its alleys, skyscrapers, and underground shops – adds variety as well as a futuristic yet realistic setting. On the miss side, the monotonous mountains, snow, and derelict corridors that make up the vast majority of the second half of the anime replace the variety and futuristic details with repetitive, boring backgrounds.Actual animation remains roughly around average. Once again, a first-half-second-half distinction can be made. In the first half, Kyouma’s escapades and Mira’s silly reactions keep the anime from feeling static. In the second half, while the action involves robots of different types, the animation is not as fluid as it once was. Certain scenes can bring back that spark, like when Kyouma takes down a robot, but those moments are few and far between.(Even so, Kyouma’s dance moves from the OP deserve a special shout-out.)If nothing else, the character designs manage to be both interesting, cool, and different compared to one another. Kyouma’s lion-esque hair and laidback attire paint him as both fierce and nonchalant. Mira’s green hair, catlike features, and various outfits (especially her bulbous hat) turn her into the cute and likable character that she is. And both Salva’s and Lwai’s appearances are exotic, fitting their royalty and foreign statuses.CHARACTERSThe cast of Dimension W is weirdly handled.Take Salva and Lwai. Salva’s backstory is shown, but the extent of his relationship to his brother (and his secretary that he constantly slaps) does not receive much attention. Lwai is similar. It is revealed later on that Lwai is actually in a comatose state, controlling, at the same time, robots that look like him. But beyond his devotion to his brother, he does not have much to his character.To be fair, his main purpose is to become friends with Kyouma before his revelation. By doing so, it demonstrates that Kyouma can, in fact, befriend a cyborg that uses the very Coils that he despises.But a weird problem arises: The anime spends almost too much time on the Egyptian brothers. Instead of focusing on other established characters, like Loser and Dr. Shidou (Mira’s father), the anime instead chooses to focus on these latecomers despite their relative unimportance to the plot. Worse still, the focus needed is stolen from others. Namely, Kyouma and Mira.Kyouma and Mira share a tenuous relationship. Kyouma despises Coils and, consequently, Mira. Mira does not hold any feelings of ill-will towards Kyouma, but she does wish he would treat her more like a friend (at least an acquaintance) and less like a piece of junk he picked up from the side of the road.So when Kyouma gets all buddy-buddy with Lwai, it almost feels like a betrayal. Granted, Kyouma does not know of Lwai’s personal background, but as he grows his relationship with the young boy, Kyouma (and therefore the anime) must subsequently disregard the relationship between him and Mira. Given that Kyouma and Mira’s relationship is easily more important to Dimension W when compared to Kyouma and Lwai’s relationship, it becomes hard to justify the anime practically forgetting about its main duo.Their relationship is weird, too. Mostly because the transition from Kyouma ragging on the young girl to tolerating her presence has little to do with each other. Yes, Kyouma saves Mira from certain death (twice), but his behavior towards her does not change as a result of their interactions together. Rather, the change occurs because of Kyouma learning more about himself.What he learns is memories he had essentially repressed. The girl he met, fell in love with, and married. The horrors he and his crew faced while scouring the island. The location of Genesis.A lot of these details helped to explain his current character. His wife imparted on him a love of old objects (which partly explains the muscle cars), and her death instilled in him a deep hatred for anything related to Coils (which also partly explains the muscle cars). His membership with the so-called Beasts of Grendel provided a foundation for his uncanny physical abilities. And learning the truth behind why his memories were disjointed in the first place allows him to understand his own origins.He believed that he failed his comrades and, more importantly, his wife. But who he truly failed was himself. He blamed the Coils for his losses rather than the choices he (and his wife) made, turning him into the angered man afterwards.In the end, Kyouma foregoes entirely hating Coils. His use of his signature Coil-based weaponry is evidence enough. But this change is only nice for him. He now views Mira more positively, sure, but, to reiterate, their change does not derive from mutual understanding. It’s a one-sided shift that the anime attempts to make balanced – but it fails.Mira’s character unfortunately gets sidelined by the aforementioned weirdness. The inordinate amount of time spent on less important characters, as well as her relationship with Kyouma going largely unexplored, leaves her in a difficult spot character-wise.At the minimum, she has a bit of uniqueness in the Dimension W world. While she is yet another cyborg, her make and conception are shrouded in mystery. Indeed, she is much more reactive and lifelike when compared to other similar cyborgs. Her affable personality, general cuteness, and overall calm demeanor make her an easily likable person.“Person,” not cyborg. For her major conflict involves a sense of self. She does not fully comprehend her origins – a parallel to Kyouma, one that gets surprisingly tied back with the revelation that her own body is in fact Kyouma’s wife’s body. She does not ever want to be reset, losing the relationships and experiences she has made thus far. And the idea of death scares her, for she knows that that means the end.Again, though, this conflict is not fleshed out. It comes together through small, singular scenes rather than through a layered approach. Yes, Kyouma stops Mira from sacrificing herself, proving to her and the audience that she is more than just a cyborg. But Mira does not experience so much development as she does a reaffirmation of what her character has symbolized from the beginning.After Kyouma and Mira, the rest of the cast is riddled with issues. Seameyer, the main antagonist, is awful. He appears out of nowhere, his motivations are laughable, and his overt craziness cannot be taken seriously.Loser (as was briefly mentioned) hardly receives any attention despite how much he is invested in the proceedings, and his own backstory is sloppily put together. Plus, his relationship to his daughter, in contrast to Salva and Lwai’s relationship, does not receive any attention, losing out on an important emotional connection.And many of the cast members are forgotten about once the second half rolls around – such as the kids, the big boss lady, and Albert, Kyouma’s closest friend and fellow Beast of Grendel.The cast is, simply put, weirdly handled.SOUNDArguably, the strongest part of Dimension W is its OP. The techno beat and feel easily fits alongside the technology, electric, and futuristic motifs. And the different tonal sections add variety without coming off as out of place. Admittedly, the English lyrics can be silly to hear (“Low resistance of high zest inner cells”), but the song is still a welcome addition to the anime.The ED does not reach the same heights. While the start of it is cool with its guitar work, and the ending is nice with its vocal work, the middle stretch of the piece leaves much to be desired as it somewhat strolls along despite the band’s loud interjection.As for the rest of the original soundtrack, it has a surprising number of interesting tracks. “Osoikuru-Mizukaranoteki” intertwines orchestra with acoustic guitar and castanets. “Yappariwakaranai” slows everything down with slick harmonica playing. “Kanashiki-Kioku,” with its choir and organ, invites a sense of foreboding. “Isshokusokuhatsu” builds suspense through clanging and light violins. And “Kesshi-no-Tatakai” goes grandiose to coincide with the later, larger scale.These tracks from the OST are not stellar, and, indeed, many of the pieces are rather average. But the they do at least have some care put into them.Finally, only a couple of shout-outs are deserved in terms of voice acting performances. Reina Ueda as Mira adds cuteness, personality, and life to the robotic girl, and Daisuke Ono as Kyouma proves his veteran status with a manly and peeved voice for the disgruntled main protagonist.ENJOYMENTWithout a doubt, Mira was a lot of fun. In this world filled with angry dudes and potential death, I could count on Mira to make me smile. Her pouting when Kyouma was being mean, her kindness in dealing with others, and her happy face while holding hard-earned money had me grinning and laughing. Usually both.Mira’s antics with Kyouma were fun, too. Kyouma closing the bathroom door on Mira and Mira freaking out when Kyouma approached her from behind after she read all of those scary books were silly moments. I especially liked the rock-moving bit. Kyouma was having extreme difficulty moving even one rock, but Mira was tossing them aside like pebbles. I just wish there had been more of these moments.I also liked Albert. More specifically, I liked the relationship he shared with Kyouma. Albert was technically Kyouma’s enemy, but they were friends. It gave their dynamic a sense of camaraderie. That they understood each other’s positions and treated each other with respect. Similar to Kyouma and Mira, however, I wish that Albert had more scenes with his friend.Everything else, however, was not the most engaging for me. A lot of the action was either too over the top or lacking in coolness. The various dramatic bits, like Kyouma’s wife’s death or Loser’s death, didn’t get to me emotionally. And the other characters and plotlines were simply uninteresting. I was simply not entertained.Dimension W gets lost amidst space and time. The story’s construction introduces a lot of problems, the characters are given odd levels of importance, and the art does not usually impress. Basically, the show’s batteries didn’t last.SUMMARYStory: Bad, the first half sets the stage only for the second half to trip all over itAnimation: Fine, okay artistic direction, about average actual animation, and nice character designsCharacters: Terrible, from Kyouma to Mira, the cast have a hard time remaining relevant let alone being worthwhileSound: Fine, good OP, bad ED, okay OST, and okay VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, Mira and Albert were fun, but the majority of the show was notFinal Score: 3/10 technology that tap into the ominous fourth-dimension – named Dimension W – allowing for, as its founder would describe, “unlimited energy.”While not technically true, Dimension W has two halves: the first five episodes and the last seven episodes.The first five episodes do a nice job of presenting necessary information. The concept of Coils, the society built around the devices, and the futuristic setting are laid out. Mira, a unique cyborg, makes for a cute yet purposeful companion. And the importance of the so-called Numbers is made known. All within just the first two episodes.Episode three is more character oriented, but episodes four and five are more relevant narratively. Episode four includes an interesting setting relative to the one given prior, and episode five introduces the idea that Numbers allow for a myriad of possibilities – an important detail for later.Then the rest of the anime happens.Where the first five episodes were spread out in terms of focus, the last half of the anime hones in on one specific plotline: Easter Island. With the change in focus comes a drastic change in scale. Before, breaking into a museum, playing with a bunch of kids, and investigating a spooky mansion were as grandiose as the anime got. Afterwards, threats of global destruction, the end goal of the different cast members, and the political and violent direction each inflate the scale beyond what feels reasonable.Simultaneously, the anime tries and fails to introduce new narrative elements. Different villains that are either too silly or improperly explored join the fray. Random ideas, like a floating ball of energy or Mira moving through Kyouma’s subconscious, are difficult to accept even with all of the concurrent pseudoscience. Even certain plotlines, such as the bureaucracy finding out about Mira’s true origins, are discarded, making the anime come off as forgetful.In order to present a lot of this information, the anime relies on heavy exposition. Characters spill their thoughts through long-winded monologues. And thematic subtlety is traded for heavy-handed explanations, telling rather than showing its messages.Nevertheless, these themes are surprisingly complex: immutable history, acceptance of reality, and indeterminism.In Dimension W, many of the episodes focus on the past. Kyouma’s life and wife are presented entirely through flashback. The same happens for many of the events in the last half of the anime – how Kyouma came to acquire Genesis, what drove Seameyer to go insane, and so on. In a way, the anime demonstrates that the past cannot be changed. I.e., history is immutable.Along the same lines, the show pushes the idea that people have to accept this given reality. Both Kyouma and Salva refuse to acknowledge their pasts. For them (and anyone), it’s something that sticks no matter how much they may forget or not want to remember.Yet that does not mean what is to come is predetermined. For while the past cannot be changed, and the present must be accepted, the future has no such rules. The possibilities are endless. Mira does not have to sacrifice herself. Kyouma can turn a new leaf. Loser has every right to fight to save his beloved.Altogether, these themes have close ties to Dimension W (the concept, not the title). Dimension W’s voids symbolize history’s immutability through their stillness. The widespread use of Dimension W, despite it challenging established norms, represents society’s acceptance. And Dimension W creating multiple possibilities help to highlight that indeterminism still stands.The themes are both layered and connected, and the first half of the narrative is at least competent. But the numerous amount of issues in the second half are still enough to make the narrative an overall weak package.ANIMATIONDimension W’s artistic direction does have a few positives. It uses a visual trick to, at times, profile the characters. One-colored backgrounds and off-colored shadows give Kyouma, Mira, and others a poster-art look. The technique does not serve a purpose, but it does add flair.The outcome of interacting with Dimension W (the concept) is also an interesting choice. Grotesque mutations and otherworldly obstructions turn what should be a lauded discovery into a hideous amalgamation – a dichotomy reminiscent of the show’s own love-and-hate technology motif.The rest of the art tends to be hit or miss. On the hit side, the sprawling city – with its alleys, skyscrapers, and underground shops – adds variety as well as a futuristic yet realistic setting. On the miss side, the monotonous mountains, snow, and derelict corridors that make up the vast majority of the second half of the anime replace the variety and futuristic details with repetitive, boring backgrounds.Actual animation remains roughly around average. Once again, a first-half-second-half distinction can be made. In the first half, Kyouma’s escapades and Mira’s silly reactions keep the anime from feeling static. In the second half, while the action involves robots of different types, the animation is not as fluid as it once was. Certain scenes can bring back that spark, like when Kyouma takes down a robot, but those moments are few and far between.(Even so, Kyouma’s dance moves from the OP deserve a special shout-out.)If nothing else, the character designs manage to be both interesting, cool, and different compared to one another. Kyouma’s lion-esque hair and laidback attire paint him as both fierce and nonchalant. Mira’s green hair, catlike features, and various outfits (especially her bulbous hat) turn her into the cute and likable character that she is. And both Salva’s and Lwai’s appearances are exotic, fitting their royalty and foreign statuses.CHARACTERSThe cast of Dimension W is weirdly handled.Take Salva and Lwai. Salva’s backstory is shown, but the extent of his relationship to his brother (and his secretary that he constantly slaps) does not receive much attention. Lwai is similar. It is revealed later on that Lwai is actually in a comatose state, controlling, at the same time, robots that look like him. But beyond his devotion to his brother, he does not have much to his character.To be fair, his main purpose is to become friends with Kyouma before his revelation. By doing so, it demonstrates that Kyouma can, in fact, befriend a cyborg that uses the very Coils that he despises.But a weird problem arises: The anime spends almost too much time on the Egyptian brothers. Instead of focusing on other established characters, like Loser and Dr. Shidou (Mira’s father), the anime instead chooses to focus on these latecomers despite their relative unimportance to the plot. Worse still, the focus needed is stolen from others. Namely, Kyouma and Mira.Kyouma and Mira share a tenuous relationship. Kyouma despises Coils and, consequently, Mira. Mira does not hold any feelings of ill-will towards Kyouma, but she does wish he would treat her more like a friend (at least an acquaintance) and less like a piece of junk he picked up from the side of the road.So when Kyouma gets all buddy-buddy with Lwai, it almost feels like a betrayal. Granted, Kyouma does not know of Lwai’s personal background, but as he grows his relationship with the young boy, Kyouma (and therefore the anime) must subsequently disregard the relationship between him and Mira. Given that Kyouma and Mira’s relationship is easily more important to Dimension W when compared to Kyouma and Lwai’s relationship, it becomes hard to justify the anime practically forgetting about its main duo.Their relationship is weird, too. Mostly because the transition from Kyouma ragging on the young girl to tolerating her presence has little to do with each other. Yes, Kyouma saves Mira from certain death (twice), but his behavior towards her does not change as a result of their interactions together. Rather, the change occurs because of Kyouma learning more about himself.What he learns is memories he had essentially repressed. The girl he met, fell in love with, and married. The horrors he and his crew faced while scouring the island. The location of Genesis.A lot of these details helped to explain his current character. His wife imparted on him a love of old objects (which partly explains the muscle cars), and her death instilled in him a deep hatred for anything related to Coils (which also partly explains the muscle cars). His membership with the so-called Beasts of Grendel provided a foundation for his uncanny physical abilities. And learning the truth behind why his memories were disjointed in the first place allows him to understand his own origins.He believed that he failed his comrades and, more importantly, his wife. But who he truly failed was himself. He blamed the Coils for his losses rather than the choices he (and his wife) made, turning him into the angered man afterwards.In the end, Kyouma foregoes entirely hating Coils. His use of his signature Coil-based weaponry is evidence enough. But this change is only nice for him. He now views Mira more positively, sure, but, to reiterate, their change does not derive from mutual understanding. It’s a one-sided shift that the anime attempts to make balanced – but it fails.Mira’s character unfortunately gets sidelined by the aforementioned weirdness. The inordinate amount of time spent on less important characters, as well as her relationship with Kyouma going largely unexplored, leaves her in a difficult spot character-wise.At the minimum, she has a bit of uniqueness in the Dimension W world. While she is yet another cyborg, her make and conception are shrouded in mystery. Indeed, she is much more reactive and lifelike when compared to other similar cyborgs. Her affable personality, general cuteness, and overall calm demeanor make her an easily likable person.“Person,” not cyborg. For her major conflict involves a sense of self. She does not fully comprehend her origins – a parallel to Kyouma, one that gets surprisingly tied back with the revelation that her own body is in fact Kyouma’s wife’s body. She does not ever want to be reset, losing the relationships and experiences she has made thus far. And the idea of death scares her, for she knows that that means the end.Again, though, this conflict is not fleshed out. It comes together through small, singular scenes rather than through a layered approach. Yes, Kyouma stops Mira from sacrificing herself, proving to her and the audience that she is more than just a cyborg. But Mira does not experience so much development as she does a reaffirmation of what her character has symbolized from the beginning.After Kyouma and Mira, the rest of the cast is riddled with issues. Seameyer, the main antagonist, is awful. He appears out of nowhere, his motivations are laughable, and his overt craziness cannot be taken seriously.Loser (as was briefly mentioned) hardly receives any attention despite how much he is invested in the proceedings, and his own backstory is sloppily put together. Plus, his relationship to his daughter, in contrast to Salva and Lwai’s relationship, does not receive any attention, losing out on an important emotional connection.And many of the cast members are forgotten about once the second half rolls around – such as the kids, the big boss lady, and Albert, Kyouma’s closest friend and fellow Beast of Grendel.The cast is, simply put, weirdly handled.SOUNDArguably, the strongest part of Dimension W is its OP. The techno beat and feel easily fits alongside the technology, electric, and futuristic motifs. And the different tonal sections add variety without coming off as out of place. Admittedly, the English lyrics can be silly to hear (“Low resistance of high zest inner cells”), but the song is still a welcome addition to the anime.The ED does not reach the same heights.

Despite his personality and attitude towards other people when you find out what he was like in the past and what happened to him you do feel truly sorry for him and understand why he is like this.Mira was a brilliant, sweet and fun character who is also a robot, but compared to other robots I've seen the way her body works is much like a humans just mechanical which made her very interesting and the fact that she has antennas that look like ears and a amplifier cord that looks like a tail then you have a robotic neko which is cute as hell, but don't be fooled because she is very intelligent and strong thanks to her robotic abilities, she is treated poorly by Kyouma because of this who keeps calling her junk which annoys Mira which when she reacts can be pretty cute and understandable, she is a very likeable character and has a big role in the events of the show since she was created for a specific reason that'll unlock the mystery of the coils.The other supporting characters were interesting too like the mysterious masked thief called Loser who is looking for special coils because they unlock something and the fact he used to be a scientist, he is a pretty cool character and his daughter Elizabeth wasn't too bad either since she was actually very useful helping out her father.There was two other guys like Albert who was a former soldier with Kyouma who has some banter with him from time to time and there was Lwai a prince of Isla who is actually a Robot being controlled by his mind from his real body (I know it's confusing).Not only that there was a bunch of other Collectors who were introduced later on in the show that also provided some good entertainment since they had some pretty interesting abilities.Now I did like the Artstyle it had a Cowboy Bebop feel to it mainly because it is set in funny enough the same year and it has that gloomy, dirty tone that Cowboy bebop had too, but the difference here is that Dimension W felt more advanced compared to Cowboy Bebop, I liked the design of some of the characters especially Mira who looked very strange, but cool and sweet as well plus some of the locations that Kyouma and Mira went too looked very interesting too like Lake Yasogami looked like it was out of a horror film and Easter island looked terrifying to be on.The action was actually pretty good it was fun seeing Kyouma and Mira kick some ass against badguy's , but some of the other characters also proved their worth too like Loser and even the other Collectors who has some pretty impressive abilities and these abilities were very handy when they were fighting against the Security Robots on Easter Island or against each other.Overall I think this was a fun and entertaining show that gave off a familiar vibe that I had with Cowboy Bebop so if you're someone who enjoys Sci-Fi or enjoyed Cowboy Bebop then this is definitely something you might want to check out. few people know it was very interesting watching the events unfold itself as the two MC's tried to figure out what was going on and why they were connected to the coils.I loved the relationship that developed between Kyouma and Mira who started off on the wrong foot and over time slowly started to become more of a team and respect one another, plus the show has a dark tone to it since Kyouma has a dark backstory which is really the answer to everything that happens, but there were a few other moments that were dark like the episode at Lake Yasogami which is when the anime suddenly turned supernatural, there was also quite a few plot twists throughout the show which did surprise me.The characters were actually really good even though Kyouma and Mira, especially Mira stole the show the other supporting characters weren't too bad either.Kyouma is an Ex-Soldier who became a Collector after an incident that happened, he hates coils and uses devices that we use today like a couple of Gasoline fuelled cars which included a Toyota 2000 GT which was pretty cool and he doesn't use guns instead he uses knifes attached to wires which at some point he kinda used like 3D Maneuver Gear from AOT when was jumping around and stuff, his personality is stubborn, short tempered and anti-social, but he is a definite badass because he knows how to kick ass mainly because of his experience as a soldier and because of his hatred for coils or anything technical he treats Mira poorly at first, but when he was finding out more about his past and the coils he slowly starts to loosen up to her and starts treating her like a teammate.

The original post is linked here.https://www.reddit.com/r/Toonami/comments/4jersz/dimension_w_final_thoughts_thread/Well this was a quite a letdown.I mean I liked the first 4 episodes of the series, the inital premise was promising, and I find Kyouma, Mira, and Loser to be fun characters. But I found things went downhill with that 5th episode being so convoluted that I'm still not sure what the fuck happened even with one guy giving me a wall of text explaining to me what happened.And sadly, I felt as if it never really recovered from that episode. It wasn't bad...enough that I would drop it and/or skip it all the time after that on the block like I did AGK, SAO2, or an average filler episode, but it was still a rather mediocre experience that made me care less and less with each episode that aired and it sometimes went back to making me question what in the flying fuck am I watching. It's ending did little to help me care either and its after credits scene just left me wishing that the series was more like that. At least I liked the OP(What little they played on the block) even if between this and Gangsta, Stereo Drive Foundation does seem to be stuck doing underwhelming shows.On the plus side, at least the series is short so it doesn't overstay its welcome and it does somewhat prove that some 12 episode shows can work on Toonami in the future like say My Hero Academia, One Punch Man, Madoka Magica, or maybe even No Game No Life. Sadly, I don't think Dimension W is on the level with those shows.So in conclusion, I didn't think it was terrible but I definitely feel like it wasted its potential in what could've been a cool sci-fi anime like Psycho Pass or possibly Darker Than Black. But Oh Well, I still liked it better than Akame Ga Kill(the show Dimension W replaced) though, Just hope the show that replaces Dimension W is better. enough that I would drop it and/or skip it all the time after that on the block like I did AGK, SAO2, or an average filler episode, but it was still a rather mediocre experience that made me care less and less with each episode that aired and it sometimes went back to making me question what in the flying fuck am I watching.

Well not a lie, just more like I am half way through the last episode since I tried to watch it this morning but I had to go to school halfway through it. But none the less I am doing a reviewFor those who don't know I'm Josh and today I'm reviewing the anime known as Dimension W. Let's do thisStory- The setting is interesting. Personally I have never been an end all be all sci-Fi fan but I like the setting. The story on the other hand was...meh. I...mean it was original I give it credit there and not he worst story I have ever seen but it just felt...meh to me for some reason. Through the first 5 episodes I liked it but by the second half that is when I found it to be meh. It isn't really a bad story though. I don't know what happens in the end so I couldn't really say anything about that till I fully see it. Overall though I will give it a 6/10Art- I actually liked the art in this. Pretty good for what it is and I like the character designs to a certain extent. Plus the fight scenes were pretty cool Overall I give this a 7/10Sound- I love the opening to this to death. I will play it over and over again. That is how much I like it. The ending is average for me and the sound track is decent. Overall it gets a 7/10Characters- Like the story I did find he characters to be meh. Now granted I do like a couple of them but in the end the character just felt meh to me. Not hat they weren't interesting or anything, I just found them not to be that exciting really. Overall 6/10Enjoyment- I really enjoyed. It's one of those anime I just can't do anything but find myself enjoying it. Overall 8/10Overall- Dimension W isn't the greatest, but it is a pretty good anime to watch.

They have shown the ability to be one of the greats in their sport. But, due to lack of effort, injuries, or bad circumstances, they don't pan out. That's what I liken this show to.This show had to much potential to be great. Interesting characters, Good art. Good music. Had the framework of a great show, but it didn't execute the way it should've to reach its potential.Story:The setting was super interesting. I thought they had a nice set up for a sci-fi show. But the story always...felt rushed. It was like watching an abridged version of a 24 episode anime. A lotta details were left out. Character dynamics weren't touched on enough. This show was was like a car careening through traffic just a save a little time, but not accomplishing much while doing it.Art:I liked the character designs. The main characters looked cool. The neon lights used throughout the series gave it that futuristic feel. The backgrounds looked good too.Sound:BGM didn't stand out much, but the OP sure did. It's called Genesis by Stereo Dive Foundation, and it's a great song. Does a great job of setting the tone of the show. But like the song, the show is super fast paced.Character:This is where the show missed out so much on its potential. It had interesting characters. But did not take enough time to develop them enough. The main characters had an interesting relationship, with the main hero hating technology while the main heroine is an android. Things were contentious, but eventually things got better between them. The issue is that not enough time was taken to build that relationship up. Other characters weren't developed enough as well, which is a pretty consistent problem with the show.Enjoyment:Some episodes were great and really interesting. Especially when they were doing world-building or character development. But there are episodes that feel more like filler than something made to drive the story forward. This kind of hurt the show for me, even if I thought the show was an overall positive.Overall:Dimension W would've been better had it been a 24-episode anime. There would have been more space to develop the world and character relationships. But because it was only 12, it felt like a rushed production. It's why I'm usually not a fan of movies, because there's only so much world-building and character development you can do in 2 hrs.

The premise is interesting, the key visual seemed nice and the main character was a badass. What did I get? An interesting premise, nice visuals and a main character who is an ultimate badass. Some things felt lacking such as a convoluted story and rushed pacing. Also some characters end up lacking depth, but some characters do have depth, primarily the lead character. However, Dimension W ended up being a satisfying anime, even though I was hoping a little more from it.~{Story}~The story...of Dimension W takes place in futuristic setting where people have created an unlimited source of energy, called coils, by discovering fourth dimension, Dimension W (which pretty much is the negative plane of X, according to their graphs). Kyouma, our protagonist, is someone who would die but never use coils for a certain reason and he is forced to work with a coiled-powered robot girl (who can use human emotions) to find illegal coils. The premise is indeed interesting. The whole concept around this coils is pretty good. Some of the backstories given, primarily the one for Kyouma, is fantastic. Though there are some problems with this. The execution isn’t as good as I was hoping for. The story is good but it didn’t feel properly presented. At times the narrative felt too messy and too unorganized. It would have been bet to focus on the major characters, rather than introduce too many character and not properly focus on any of them. At times it felt like the anime was losing my attention, even though the story isn’t bad, just unorganized.Story: 4/10~{Presentation}~First off, the atmosphere is outstanding in Dimension W. The futuristic setting looks and feels really cool. The style used in the anime is also nice. However there are some inconsistencies in its presentation. At times there will be moments where there’s too much exposition given (such as the concept of Dimension W), while at times, there’s too little exposition given (such as the main villains’ goals). At first, Dimension W stars off episodic (or more preferably arc based) but it slowly transitions to one major story. The transition works really well and feels proper. However, the pacing is an issue in Dimension W. At times, it feels like the anime is moving too fast for its own good. I never get enough time to breathe with these characters, especially in the second half. Everything moves so fast that I have little time to comprehend everything going on, so I end up rewatching those episodes.Presentation: 4/10~{Character}~One of the best thing about Dimension W is its characters, yet one of its worst points is its characters. Let me explain why. Kyouma, our protagonist, is a badass. He’s super skilled and super likeable. His attitude might be a little too rude, especially to his partner Mira, but it just makes him look even cooler (besides, he’s got his reasons why he acts like that). And his flashback makes him such well-developed character. Then you have Mira, who, for the most time, just feels like she’s there just for the sake of being there. At first I thought there were going to go somewhere with her story with her creator, but it just fell flat and they continued on without her playing a huge role. She seemed like wasted potential. Loser, who is one of the supporting characters in this anime, is very well done. His backstory adds enough depth and easily one of the better characters of the series. The rest of the supporting cast is pretty weak though. There’s a lot of characters in Dimension W and not a lot of them get enough depth. I couldn’t care less about those African characters they introduced in the second half. Also the antagonists are pretty lame too.Character: 5/10~{Art}~,One of the high points of Dimension W is its art style. The futuristic world really looks good. The use of color is also very nice. Something about the art also feels very diverse. You’ll see metropolitan settings, to foggy forests, to futuristic buildings. Dimension W is really good to look at. The art may not be the most detailed art out there, as some objects do have plain textures, the art design totally makes up for it. Also the character designs are top-notch. Something about Kyouma makes him look like a futuristic samurai (I don’t blame that African kid misunderstanding him). His design makes him look like a badass. Also Mira’s design is great too. Loser’s design is also fantastic (and he kind of looks like Zero from Code Geass).Art: 7/10~{Animation}~The animations are also fantastic in Dimension W. It consistently smooth and fantastic. During the action sequences, smooth animation is present with minimal CGI used. Look at the OP for example, the animations when both Kyouma’s doing action and when he’s dancing (which is fun to look at) is very, very smooth, and similar animation quality can be found in the entire series. The CGI, when present, is sone really well. It never felt too distracting and it merges easily with its hand-drawn compartments. At times, I don’t even notice the CGI when it is used because it’s that good. The action choreography is also excellent. The camera angles used during these scene really makes the scene a lot more enjoyable.Animation: 7/10~{Voice Acting}~First of all, Dimension W has a great cast. You’ve got Ono Daisuke playing as Kyouma and he does a fine job with his role. It may not be the best he’s done, but even if he doesn’t try, he’s talented enough to sound like he’s doing well. Ueda Reina does Mira, and she also does a fine job. Ueda might have given her best here as her voice acting is the one that stands out the most. And then you’ve got Nakamura Yuuichi doing Loser. Again, just like with OnoD, He doesn’t have to do much to sound good as he’s already very talented. Then you’ve got other well-known and talented seiyuu in Dimension W doing supporting roles, such as Ohara Sayaka, Sakaguchi Daisuke, Matsuoka Yoshitsugu, and Ishida Akira, and they all do a fine role. Even though the list of seiyuu is great, it felt like they all could have done something more with their characters since their all very talented. Nevertheless, they all still do a fine job.Voice Acting: 6/10~{Music}~The music is also pretty good in Dimension W. The OP, “Genesis”, is pretty catchy and nice to listen (although the visuals that go with the OP make the OP much better). The OP does really feel cool. The ED, “Contrast”. The background music used in the anime is also pretty good. It has this funky techno-beat to it and it makes the scenes more enjoyable. The background music adds to the action scenes. Although I was hoping for a little more from the background music, but it’s fine the way it is.Music: 5.5/10~{Enjoyment}~Dimension W is an enjoyable anime to a certain degree. The main character, Kyouma, is enough for me to enjoy this anime really. The atmosphere and setting is also great and the story is also very interesting. The premise is top-notch too. However, due to inconsistent narrative and the plot being unorganized. At times, Dimension W loses my attentions and I feel like I couldn’t care less about what was going, which is a shame because it’s got a good story to tell. Also most of the characters end up lacking character development so it’s hard for me to feel about them. At least Kyouma and Loser get sufficient character development, so I ended up liking those two characters.Enjoyment: 5/10In the end, Dimension W was a fun ride. It’s got a nice premise with a very interesting setting, the main character is very likeable and well developed, the art style is very attractive and the action is really fun due to its great animation. The plot can feel a little messy as times and it can lose your attention, but it has a good story to tell. I was hoping that some of the other characters get just as much development as Kyouma and Loser gets. Still, Dimension W manages to be a fun time, even if it leaves me wanting more.+ Fantastic futuristic setting with a great premise+ Kyouma and Loser are very well developed characters+ Action choreography is great due to great animations+ Art style is unique and stylish and adds to the atmosphere- Some characters lack character development and depth- Plot felt unorganized and messy at times, even if the story is actually goodOverall: 5.4/10 of Dimension W takes place in futuristic setting where people have created an unlimited source of energy, called coils, by discovering fourth dimension, Dimension W (which pretty much is the negative plane of X, according to their graphs).

Fossil fuels and and renewable energy both come with their pros and cons and really only serve to create conflict on determining what is the 'best method' for satisfying the world's needs.  Dimension W gives us a little spin on that idea with an anime dedicated to energy, the future, and one kick-ass opening.Story:  Mabuchi Kyoma is a man that is known as a collector.  In the world he lives in now,...all other sources of energy have been exempt from society where they now solely only rely on one new source of energy, Dimension W.  (Roll Credits) Utilizing a technology known as 'coils' these little plugs harvest the energy from Dimension W and use them as clean, efficient energy without all of those nasty emissions and whatnot.  It is here where we have Kyoma working as a mercenary of sorts, beating down anyone who even thinks about using illegally manufactured or black market coils in a world that he despises.On the surface, Dimension W seemed like a show that would get into the nitty gritty of the energy that they make and the current state of the company that manages these godforsaken things.  We follow Kyoma's story as he makes his living as a collector, stating quite often that he 'hates' coils and that he refuses to use any sort of coil technology.  In the beginning, the anime showed promise as it provided us with some rather interesting events of coil collecting due to the fact that the coils themselves are hardwired into the Dimension W, which does some pretty fucked up shit if left to go wild.  But only then did the show shift its focus around.The primary focus of Dimension W is to focus on the aftereffects of coils and coil usage.  These stories are more or less based around the 'paved with good intentions' motif, as each event had positive effect before going horribly, horribly wrong.  As a result, the series felt rather plotless and was just more or less random events that spanned 1-2 episodes before going to the next one.  And then they decided to do some overarching plot stuff for its conclusion, and that just threw the series down a well.  Now why exactly is that?  Well, for starters, the show inputed a 'main antagonist' to the series, something that it had previously never done before.  Plus, with Kyoma's backstory being rather cliched in its content and presentation, coupled with an end that really felt like there was really no real conflict at the end due to how relatively easy everything was without any repercussions...yeah, this ending wasn't particularly the most well written, especially since the characters only gained shit at the end instead of losing anything.  (I'm all for happy endings, but this show did not seem to be happy for most of its run.)One other thing that bothers me is the fact that the show seems to be missing a lot of detail and/or lacking potential.  There were things like the actual 'New Tesla' company that controls the whole coil business that seemed to be interesting, reasons as to why Mira, our main female protagonist, was created, and a whole slew of other potential storylines that just never saw the light of day.  Overall, Dimension W had potential, but just never really utilized it and instead, went a direction that went far beyond what was pre established in the beginning.Overview:+  Interesting story concept+  Storyline tapped into effects of its main story concept-   Many looses ends left untied-   Wasted potential on many aspects of the story-   Main character backstory rather clichedCharacters:  For the most part, characters in Dimension W are more or less plot related.  Aside from our main two characters, everyone else is more or less shoved into the side cast.First we have Mabuchi Kyoma, the main protagonist of the series.  As a collector, Kyoma makes his living by hunting down illegal coil users in exchange for money, gas, all sorts of things.  As a person who hates coils (and I mean HATES coils), Kyoma's lifestyle is more or less equivalent to the life we live currently, meaning gas cars, battery powered phones, etc.  Kyoma is a character who only sees benefit for himself, and will only get the job done to help himself.  As the series goes along, you get to see his growth as he turns from this stone cold person into this slightly warmer being that isn't always so grumpy all the time.  My biggest issue with Kyoma is how forced his development is.  He changed only due to the plot, and it doesn't seem like the show would've done it any way.  His backstory is more or less an 'amnesia turned back into memory' deal involving romance in the past which doesn't really feel all that unique or interesting.  As a result, we have a character who was only changed due to the plot and really doesn't have any development that he personally does himself.Then we have Mira, the main female protagonist of the series.  As a robot who uses coils as her power source, Mira is equivalent to that of a human in many aspects, as she is more or less this spunky, childish character who is mostly referred to as 'piece of junk' by Kyoma.  Mira is sort of the mascot character of the series and doesn't really do much aside from aid Kyoma in his progression through the story.  She is his partner out on the field for coil collecting, and only serves to aid in the story's progression and his forced development.  Personally, while I find her to be adorable due to how upbeat she is to counteract Kyoma's constant moping, there really isn't much to her beyond that.  Plus, there's this whole underlying question as to why she was created, but do we get an explanation?  No.As mentioned before, everyone else is more or less plot related more than anything.  All of the other characters participate to the plot in some way, either being part of an arc to bring about the major conflict for the episode, or aid Kyoma in giving him and Mira information and/or aid when it comes to dealing with the conflict.  Then there's Seameyer who is that shoehorned villain that comes in the end of the series who...I'll be honest, didn't really have a point to the series aside from being the convenient reason to have Loser and Kyoma hate life.  (Oh yeah, and there's a guy named Loser.  I laughed in spades when I found that out.)Overview:+ Somewhat interesting main cast+ Mira is relatively adorable.  (This is just my personal opinion.  There are those that find her annoying.)- The cast is more or less dragged along with the plot more than anythingArt:  Produced by Studio 3Hz, Dimension W boasts a rather average style of animation.  To be honest, aside from the good CGI that they use to animate the coils and some other aspects of the show like the robots, cars, and monstrous hellspawns that come from the Dimension W, there really isn't anything remarkable about the artstyle.But you know what?

If anything, it's not really particularly worth its time to listen to, especially when compared to the opening song.Overview:+  Good and memorable OP-   Average EDPersonal Enjoyment:  When Winter 2016 rolled around, I was told that Dimension W was a series that had a lot of potential.  I was skeptical, but thought to myself that it was interesting enough and different from my usual kind of anime that I would dedicate time to watching it and may even like it in the end.  Well...right now, I'm a bit on the fence in that regard.Did I like this anime?If I had to pick anything I liked, it would have to be just the innate world that we're in when it comes to Dimension W.  A society built around a new form of energy is bound to have a few kinks in the system, and I really wanted to see that.  Plus, I thought that Kyoma was badass initially, and I really wanted to pull off some epic stuff.What didn't I like about this anime?Well, to be frank, the anime itself.  To get into specifics, its progression.  The series got progressively worse and worse with every episode till is more or less crawled its way to the end.  Anything that it had set up beforehand in the first couple episodes were more or less forgotten, and I didn't really find myself enjoying this series all that muchWould I recommend this anime?Frankly, this anime is one that I would say it's up to you.  The kind of story it tell is more of a niche sci-fi kind of story more than anything, and it doesn't stick with what it cements down as plot.  As such, I don't personally recommend this show, but honestly, it's up to you in regards to whether or not you want to watch it. all other sources of energy have been exempt from society where they now solely only rely on one new source of energy, Dimension W.  (Roll Credits) Utilizing a technology known as 'coils' these little plugs harvest the energy from Dimension W and use them as clean, efficient energy without all of those nasty emissions and whatnot.  It is here where we have Kyoma working as a mercenary of sorts, beating down anyone who even thinks about using illegally manufactured or black market coils in a world that he despises.On the surface, Dimension W seemed like a show that would get into the nitty gritty of the energy that they make and the current state of the company that manages these godforsaken things.  We follow Kyoma's story as he makes his living as a collector, stating quite often that he 'hates' coils and that he refuses to use any sort of coil technology.  In the beginning, the anime showed promise as it provided us with some rather interesting events of coil collecting due to the fact that the coils themselves are hardwired into the Dimension W, which does some pretty fucked up shit if left to go wild.  But only then did the show shift its focus around.The primary focus of Dimension W is to focus on the aftereffects of coils and coil usage.  These stories are more or less based around the 'paved with good intentions' motif, as each event had positive effect before going horribly, horribly wrong.  As a result, the series felt rather plotless and was just more or less random events that spanned 1-2 episodes before going to the next one.  And then they decided to do some overarching plot stuff for its conclusion, and that just threw the series down a well.  Now why exactly is that?  Well, for starters, the show inputed a 'main antagonist' to the series, something that it had previously never done before.  Plus, with Kyoma's backstory being rather cliched in its content and presentation, coupled with an end that really felt like there was really no real conflict at the end due to how relatively easy everything was without any repercussions...yeah, this ending wasn't particularly the most well written, especially since the characters only gained shit at the end instead of losing anything.  (I'm all for happy endings, but this show did not seem to be happy for most of its run.)One other thing that bothers me is the fact that the show seems to be missing a lot of detail and/or lacking potential.  There were things like the actual 'New Tesla' company that controls the whole coil business that seemed to be interesting, reasons as to why Mira, our main female protagonist, was created, and a whole slew of other potential storylines that just never saw the light of day.  Overall, Dimension W had potential, but just never really utilized it and instead, went a direction that went far beyond what was pre established in the beginning.Overview:+  Interesting story concept+  Storyline tapped into effects of its main story concept-   Many looses ends left untied-   Wasted potential on many aspects of the story-   Main character backstory rather clichedCharacters:  For the most part, characters in Dimension W are more or less plot related.  Aside from our main two characters, everyone else is more or less shoved into the side cast.First we have Mabuchi Kyoma, the main protagonist of the series.  As a collector, Kyoma makes his living by hunting down illegal coil users in exchange for money, gas, all sorts of things.  As a person who hates coils (and I mean HATES coils), Kyoma's lifestyle is more or less equivalent to the life we live currently, meaning gas cars, battery powered phones, etc.  Kyoma is a character who only sees benefit for himself, and will only get the job done to help himself.  As the series goes along, you get to see his growth as he turns from this stone cold person into this slightly warmer being that isn't always so grumpy all the time.  My biggest issue with Kyoma is how forced his development is.  He changed only due to the plot, and it doesn't seem like the show would've done it any way.  His backstory is more or less an 'amnesia turned back into memory' deal involving romance in the past which doesn't really feel all that unique or interesting.  As a result, we have a character who was only changed due to the plot and really doesn't have any development that he personally does himself.Then we have Mira, the main female protagonist of the series.  As a robot who uses coils as her power source, Mira is equivalent to that of a human in many aspects, as she is more or less this spunky, childish character who is mostly referred to as 'piece of junk' by Kyoma.  Mira is sort of the mascot character of the series and doesn't really do much aside from aid Kyoma in his progression through the story.  She is his partner out on the field for coil collecting, and only serves to aid in the story's progression and his forced development.  Personally, while I find her to be adorable due to how upbeat she is to counteract Kyoma's constant moping, there really isn't much to her beyond that.  Plus, there's this whole underlying question as to why she was created, but do we get an explanation?  No.As mentioned before, everyone else is more or less plot related more than anything.  All of the other characters participate to the plot in some way, either being part of an arc to bring about the major conflict for the episode, or aid Kyoma in giving him and Mira information and/or aid when it comes to dealing with the conflict.  Then there's Seameyer who is that shoehorned villain that comes in the end of the series who...I'll be honest, didn't really have a point to the series aside from being the convenient reason to have Loser and Kyoma hate life.  (Oh yeah, and there's a guy named Loser.  I laughed in spades when I found that out.)Overview:+ Somewhat interesting main cast+ Mira is relatively adorable.  (This is just my personal opinion.  There are those that find her annoying.)- The cast is more or less dragged along with the plot more than anythingArt:  Produced by Studio 3Hz, Dimension W boasts a rather average style of animation.  To be honest, aside from the good CGI that they use to animate the coils and some other aspects of the show like the robots, cars, and monstrous hellspawns that come from the Dimension W, there really isn't anything remarkable about the artstyle.But you know what?  I have to mention the stupid dancing that happens in the OP by Kyoma.  God that is spectacular.  It's so stupid, and unneeded, but my god that was a good choice by 3Hz.

I will admit, at the beginning, it showed a lot of promise, but I think it made the same mistake a lot of anime make, where they try to make too much happen too fast. A bad enough ending can ruin anything (Madoka Magica Movie 3, Jormungand Perfect Order), but a confusing ending can make a compelling anime seem underwhelming. At the end, too much happened too fast for anything to really sink in. It sucks, because in pretty much all other respects, Dimension W was excellent. It was smart, had good style, and...good action. The ending just didn't work. Compare this to something like Blood Blockade Battlefront. It had a complex ending, sure, but it was told in a much better way, and had good characters to keep the audience invested. That's not really the case with Dimension W. I'm sure that things will become easier to follow in the English Dub, but for now at least it is something good that could have been great. good action. The ending just didn't work.

Why?, because it was sooo hard keeping track of which voice actor voiced who (more specifically with...Dimension W\'s large ensemble cast). As for LA\'s viewing experience, it was a nice way of seeing if the dubbed or subbed vers. was in tune with each other and gave LA a psuedo-unbiased look at the dub (due it being odd episodes so LA technically watched it in dubbed first) but about the dub and sub will be later.For now let\'s get to what LA meant by LA\'s first statement to this anime.Dimension W has many strengths when it comes down to it, from it\'s initially interesting characters as well as it\'s world-building it did in establishing the coils and their true intent with the coils. Character development or to be more precise backstory was heavily used especially to our resident main protagonist Kyoma Mabuchi and that helped flesh out his dilemma about his for robotics and him even being a collector of coils. The animation done by Studio 3Hz and Orange is also stunning to look at from the bolded detailed to it\'s character designs and extremely fluid battle scenes, the psuedo-cyber and variety of gorgeous backgrounds (from supernatural craziness, cyber-like wastelands to the typical futuristic yet urbanized buildings) and the animation is one of major highlights of Dimension W without a doubt. The last strength LA will say is that although the finale gets really nutty and crazy with it\'s reality warping (it\'s called ""DIMENSION W""...LA doubt this is a spoiler people), the finale did wrap up this well and did give something of a good sendoff to the anime.However with strengths comes weaknesses and although these weaknesses don\'t outright make the anime horrible per say, it still has an effect on the anime. Dimension W as much as they put emphasis to Kyoma\'s mysterious backstory, one of the biggest problems is that not only Kyoma but also Mira is affected with having no character development until the final 5 episodes of the anime, there is a bit of leeway to this as the first 7 episodes focuses on the introduction of Dimension W and it\'s characters and the world of coils then starts to see separate coil cases with plotlines that don\'t have a major effect to the main plot but it does gives us context as to the coil\'s true defect and that adds up into world building sure...but other than that, the coils in general are nothing but a plot device and all the plotlines including the main one focuses more on characters backstories than developing the characters as the plot progresses.While LA says this LA\'s opinions of the characters is that LA does sees Kyoma as a badass.....yet LA HATED it when he kept treating Mira poorly (mind you LA didn\'t outright hated Kyoma for this but still annoyed LA from time to time especially when he constantly calls Mira a ""piece of junk""), as for Mira..well she was LA\'s favourite character as she was the Hope Spot and a constant source of help to the plot at hand and Mira\'s voice actor helped with this. The minor characters that had no connection to Kyoma and his backstory however got it MUCH worse being nothing but having importance only inside of their own arcs. The final arc is pretty long too but even then only a few minor characters that were introduced had little effect to the major plotline besides being support or annoying red herrings or spanner in the work distractions for Kyoma and Mira to the anime.So where is the lost potential LA was talking about?, the coils and it\'s defects and the fact there are hundreds of them could have made this anime sooo much better shifting focus from characters to world building and what or HOW the coils functioned or go into more cases about coil malfunction to the most extreme degree and develop it\'s characters along the way. The last bit of potential wasted was Loser in his entirety, a sort of rival to Kyoma\'s coil hunting, never really had his exploits fully shown to us and the mere fact that he was an interesting character only for him to be relegated to ONLY when Loser was needed to further Kyoma\'s backstory dampened the experience and wasted potential on him. Now mind you LA still enjoyed Kyoma\'s backstory and how the anime still used his mysterious backstory to tie up loose ends to past events that links to the major plotline but looking deeper to the coils and it\'s lore would had been nice instead of being handwaved away as ""it\'s the future!"".Alright time to talk dubbing. LA actually enjoyed both vers. of Dimension W and NONE of either sides of the voice actors weren\'t bad or horrible. On the FUNimation dubbed side, LA would say that Jad Saxton as Mira was extremely good choice as Jad fit into Mira\'s shy yet extremely helpful and caring nature, Christopher Sabat as Kyoma was also the same and LA very much approved of both roles. The minor voice cast did well too with NO annoyance from any of the minor dubbed voice cast. This dub is actually one of the consistently good dubs LA has seen from FUNimation and pretty much gives praise to Colleen Clinkenbeard and Zach Bolton the ADR Director for the great picks in choosing their voice actors and their dubbed script. LA\'s favourite dub voice actor would go to Jad Saxton because does LA need to say it. On the flipside, the Japanese was pretty good and LA just have to say the same as LA said nearly verbatim as the FUNimation dub for this, the minor voice cast was great, Daisuke Ono was great as Kyoma and Reina Ueda as Mira was LA\'s favoruite voice actor just LA\'s reasoning for Reina is pretty much that Reina Ueda\'s adorable vocals as Mira was just great and again brought out the ""Hope Spot"" for the series.

However, I must say the story that we follow goes in-and-out in a sense. The first couple of episodes establishes the story and then throws us into the fray to learn the ropes. Then, the next couple episodes (a two-part story) feel like a story that we'd see sometime later. Then the rest is basically setting up for the big final arc. I think the...problem is there wasn't enough time to get to know the feel of everything before having to up the ante. Since I haven't delved into the manga, I can't say how much of a difference there is between that and the anime (though, I'm certain there's bound to be some changes).The main characters are what you would call the odd couple. You have one character that hates modern technology, and the other who is modern technology. These sort of pairing always work because they're polar opposites. Like what I said before about early establishing, although we focus on our two main characters, there's just not a whole lot of chemistry with them. We do, however, get individual developments was the story progresses. Some of the supporting cast appear to be important to the story, but most of them barely show up (a couple, we see in the beginning, but not later on). Again, this could have to do with adapting from the manga.The animation is quite impressive on this, especially with the action sequences. I've seen the other works from Studio 3Hz, and the fluid movement of the characters is something they've done before. There's lots of detail with the setting, either showing what's brand new and what's old and rusty (which is one of the themes in the show).I may be a bit too critical trying to compare the series with the original source material (that I haven't even read yet), and I don't want to say that every adaptation, for the most part, has to stick with what it's based on. Of course, we're talking about a 12 episode adaptation of a story that I'm sure is further explained in the manga. I just felt like there not should've but could've been a better told story. All criticism aside, I still found Dimension W to be a delight. problem is there wasn't enough time to get to know the feel of everything before having to up the ante.

Like what I said before about early establishing, although we focus on our two main characters, there's just not a whole lot of chemistry with them. We do, however, get individual developments was the story progresses. Some of the supporting cast appear to be important to the story, but most of them barely show up (a couple, we see in the beginning, but not later on). Again, this could have to do with adapting from the manga.The animation is quite impressive on this, especially with the action sequences. I've seen the other works from Studio 3Hz, and the fluid movement of the characters is something they've done before. There's lots of detail with the setting, either showing what's brand new and what's old and rusty (which is one of the themes in the show).I may be a bit too critical trying to compare the series with the original source material (that I haven't even read yet), and I don't want to say that every adaptation, for the most part, has to stick with what it's based on. Of course, we're talking about a 12 episode adaptation of a story that I'm sure is further explained in the manga. I just felt like there not should've but could've been a better told story. All criticism aside, I still found Dimension W to be a delight."", 'What started off as promising poorly delivers near the end.Imagine a world where mankind, through use of cutting edge technology, has access to unlimited electrical energy.

Frankly I don't blame them because it was doomed from the start. What was we expecting from a 12-episode season? That is way too short for such a complex concept. This is a shame because the studio actually did a good job with the task given to them. It felt rushed at times but it was still coherent although the concept of Dimension W was glazed over too much making it difficult to follow. I would actually say they left too much explaining until the end. I would have...preferred the info dump at the start so I could keep in the loop throughout the series. Now for the other elements of the show..Character development - 3/5It wasn't bad, the relationship dynamic started off sterile between the main characters then built up nicely towards the end of the season.Animation - 3/5Decent but nothing to write home about. The fight scenes were not thrilling for what they could have been. In the penultimate episode they actually skipped to the end of a key battle which disappointed me a lot.Story - 3/5I considered a higher rating purely for originality and potential because everything was set up to be an interesting story but the final reveals were underwhelming.

Great premise, creative and original story with amazing characters. Regardless if you\'re an anime fan or not, you WILL enjoy this.Now, let\'s get started:STORY:THIS is how you write a good sci-fi mystery story. There\'s not really much else to say, it\'s creative, it\'s original, it builds up its world REALLY well and excells at visual storytelling giving you just enough hints to figure out stuff...for yourself without being too confusing or pretentious. And thank god it doesn\'t do exposition dumps, I hate those xD8/10CHARACTERS:BY FAR, the strongest point of this one.I want more main characters like Kyouma, he\'s awesome. Though I might be a bit biased here cuz I have an affinity for characters who act as father- or older brother figures for children. Willem from the WorldEnd light novels is another good example of that.Mira is a top tier waifu candidate too. She\'s subject to a lot of ""fanservice"" but I don\'t think it takes away anything from the story because the actual characterization and plot simply overshadow it by far, unlike some other shows I\'ve seen with tons of unneccessary fanservice that I don\'t wanna name here (*cough* Code Geass *cough, what?).Joking aside she is exactly the support Kyouma needs for his current situation and is just a delight to watchAnd for having a guy called and calling himself ""Loser"" in their story, they sure as hell made him an amazing af character.9/10ART/ANIMATION:A few problems here and there, sometimes almost feeling like a little slideshow, mostly noticeable around episodes 7-8 but overall pretty good, and it\'s not like having ""only"" decent animation will hinder me in any way from enjoying the amazingness of the story. Character design is great because you have all kinds of different ones in their build, size, age or even nationality. It\'s a breath of fresh air to your typical fantasy or high school anime. for sure.7/10SOUND:Nothing too spectacular but I find myself vibing to the opening and ending quite a lot every episode. I NEVER skipped those, and I usually skip every OP or ED no matter how good xDSo, expect to see the dance from the OP in one of the lists on my profile soon.8/10EMOTIONAL IMPACT:Kyouma\'s backstory hurt me on a fundamental level. His forming connectiions with MIra and the others is heartwarming to see.And here again another shoutout to my boy Loser, no sorry, Julian Tyler, for letting me whitness that incredible journey of yours.9/10CONCLUSION:To quote our protagonist for this one: ""Nothing  that happened was pointless. Not a thing.""They did a great job of connecting everything together and wrapping everything up from beginning to end. Every scene had a purpose and there wasn\'t a single thing that felt out of place or like it could\'ve been cut. Though if I do say so, I want more of this story. Considering the premise there\'s SO much you can still do with it. which brings me to my next point:OVERALL:Starting off very strong with one of my favorite pilot episodes I\'ve seen recently, this is another underrated hidden gem for my list, amazing from beginning to end, and also another entry on the list for the question: ""Where is season 2?"".Currently though, I am OVERJOYED because I just found out through this site that this is a manga adaptation and not, as I first thought, an anime original, and after some research I came to know all the volumes are translated and available (unlike the light novels for ""Humanity has declined"" that I reviewed last) so I definitely will read it, probably even really soon.If you\'re looking for a sci-fi entry you don\'t have to look much further because you can stop right here and get carried into the world of possibilites in Dimension W. One of the strong points for this show is that I can safely recommend this to non-anime fans too, so if you\'re looking for something different from the usual anime, or are a non-anime fan who is looking for a good sci-fi show, I can HIGHLY recommend checking this out. It is not without its flaws and probably won\'t manage to get a very high place in my favorites, but it still was a great experience! for yourself without being too confusing or pretentious.

The world feels cyberpunkish or at least high tech, the protagonist is an adult and not a teen, and characters are fairly well done. The story follows mostly episodic format with over arching plot that ties inidividual episodes together.Story: 6/10:The world is very interesting, appears to be fairly well thought out, and I don\'t recall anything similar to it in another title. It has cyberpunk-ish feeling to it, as I said, or at least gives impression of technologically advanced futuristic society....The world appear to be fairly well thought out, however, the anime doesn\'t really go out of its way to explain every single detail about it, and leaves many things open to interpretation, most likely on purpose. Final episode contained a small detail that left me scratching my head and wondering what really happened here.The story format is less serious than, say, Ghost in the Shell or Patlabor, and is more similar to ""adventure"" kind of anime with more action in it, and even some mystery segments.Art: 7/10Art is very well done, highly detailed and fluid. It didn\'t leave me speechless, but it is definitely above average visual quality - with well drawn and detailed characters and background, which are also fluidly animated. There are fight scenes, they\'re done very well. On occasion I spotted some CG being used, but they\'re incredibly well done, and noticing them is quite difficult.Sound: 6/10:Sound does its job, and is pleasant, but that\'s about it. Solid voice work from all actors.Characters: 7/10:Most of them aren\'t deeply explained, and while they\'re have personality, they ostly exist for story purposes. Male lead is a bit cold/distant and possibly could be portrayed better. However, female lead is amazing/adorable, and watching her is incredibly enjoyable. Likewise her reactions feel more believable than other character\'s, and she stands out compared to the rest of them. Basically, very well done female lead, and everybody else is okay-ish.Enjoyment: 7/10:I liked it but wasn\'t smitten by it. This anime was a bit of a surprise, because of unusual theme, unusual world, and unusual turn of the story. There were some oddities in last episodes that make them feel like story quality dropped a bit compared to the rest of anime, but maybe it is just me.Overall: 7/10:IT is a quality anime that is definitely worth checking out.

There are times I feel like the creators make events happen just to move the story forward without bothering to explain how they are possible in the world they created. Furthermore, some of the supporting character's backstories aren't developed at all leaving the viewer wondering about them, while other supporting character's personalities feel inconsistent and contradictory.

I really REALLY wanna give this show a 9/10 as it has a great introduction, a strong setting, and good vibrant characters to fill it with. Unfortunately it's abundantly clear that the anime burned through it's source material WAY to quickly, and slammed into that notorious anime pacing wall that can sometimes happen when you have to write content past the manga and don't know how to make it.Story 8/10: I won't get to into the nitty gritty of it, but essentially we follow a bounty hunter, Kyouma,...that refuses to get with the times and lives with technology of the past as we learn more and more about the world around him and his backstory. It was great, I honestly think we had to much exposition and a much larger world then could be handled or done justice to in 12 episodes though. Very well done and extremely satisfying aside from the tail ending, where things sort of fall apart as does everything in this show.Art 9/10: The art was fine, but really amazing when you take into account that this was this studio's first anime they produced. The CGI and 2D animation blended together marvelously, the character designs where inventive, and the fight scenes or just regular unbroken shots where fluid albeit sometimes a little unusual choreography was coupled with silky smooth animation. Other than that, it was about what you'd expect from a cyberpunk anime in terms of art.Sound 8/10: Intro was great, outro was good, but everything in between aside from a few standout track weren't all to memorable but certainly not bad. Sound design was good other than that, not much else to say.Character 7/10: The main duo and the rest of the supporting cast surrounding them where very solid and maybe a 9 all put together, although Kyouma and Mira both seem to be enslaved by their archtypes a little more often then I would like for them to be, the only reason this category is lowered down is cause they bring in a variety pack of bounty hunters that feel like they where pulled down from the same disposable character shelf that shonen's use to populate their filler archs. in near the end of the show for reasons I won't get into, but they put WAY to many characters in the last 4 episodes and try really hard to force them into the show far to late into the narrative and they come across as lazy and invasive.Enjoyment 8/10: It was a very fun ride, nothing feels drawn out and everything moves quickly, but the last 2 episodes kind of went off the hyperspeed rails the rest of the show was riding on and the ending felt messy, even if you turn your brain off and try to have fun.Overall 7/10: Solid show with a good setting, it's a shame the writers couldn't find something less not-good to bank the ending off of with a lack of source material, that's the make or break for most shows that run into the problem and Dimension W definitely falls more on the break side of the spectrum. However, everything else is done well, fairly polished, and well above average for the relatively low budget sci fi action adventure that went into this new studio's risky plunge into anime.

Don\'t come here for a story that makes sense. If you understand basic maths, then the premise won\'t excite you. The show never goes into too much depth on anything that happens, it just happens. To enjoy this show you\'re going to have to get over that. If you take everything as it comes at you, this show will be mildly enjoyable. Don\'t come here for a fascinating Sci-Fi series, it\'s a dumb action show.Characters: 6As stated previously, this show is enjoyable at times. The action scenes, while not ever being very tense,...are nice to look at. There\'s no tension due to our super badass protaagonist, Kyouma. I like Kyouma a lot. He\'s not a teenage hero like a lot of anime and he looks like god damn Wolverine fused with a samurai. His character design is well chosen and he is funny to watch. Kyouma is an asshole and he ain\'t afraid to hide it. His reactions to a lot of things are amusing, especially one particular scene. The lead female does a whole outfit change and asks if she looks cute. While watcing this scene I rolled my eyes and sighed. Kyouma felt the same way; he just walked off. It was hilarious. Point being, Kyouma is a fun character and he never annoyed me. The lead female, Mira, is kinda just there. She only helps out or serves a purpose on rare occasions. Most of the time, she\'s just there. I never found her to be very attractive, which the show was insistent on changing. The creator obviously thought she was sexy as hell, because she is shoved down your throat. The show is like:""Hey look! She has an ass! She has tits too! She can be moe if you want!!"". Mira feels kind of useless and I never really cared for her or felt worried when she was in danger. As for all the other characters, there\'s not much to talk about. No characters stand out and the villain is kind of shoehorned in at the last second. The character of Loser is mildly interesting, but nothing more. Kyouma was my saving grace in terms of characters.Sound: 5Nothing about the show\'s soundtrack ever stood out, it\'s just techno music and some other forgettable tracks for the most part. The opening is the only piece of music of note. The opening was a blast and I looked forward to it every time I started out a new episode. Much like the show itself, it\'s dumb but looks nice. The animation is flashy and shows Kyouma doing what he does best, being a badass. He dances as well in it for some reason. It\'s hilarious. The song is catchy too. The opening is definitely worth a listen if only for a laugh.Art: 4The animation is very flashy at points during the fight scenes. But like I stated before, there\'s no sense of tension. Kyouma is never really under any threat due to him being so strong. This kills any tension the show might have built up. A close shave where Kyouma could\'ve died when fighting Loser would have helped a lot. Apart from those moments of flashy animation, the show isn\'t up to much in regards to its visuals. The character designs are bland except for Kyouma and the backgrounds look very dodgy at times. The show isn\'t afraid to use CGI either, so if you hate CG stay away.Enjoyment: 7So with all these criticisms, you must be wondering why I gave enjoyment a 7. At first, I was pissed off at the show. I thought it was dumb. I wasn\'t wrong, but I just decided to sit back and take all the dumb shit. To be honest, I had fun. The opening was great, Kyouma was awesome and the fights were cool to look at. If you come here expecting any more, you\'ll be sorely disappointed. Despite my enjoyment, I can\'t hide its flaws. It\'s a flawed show. But at least the opening is hilarious.Overall: 6 are nice to look at. There\'s no tension due to our super badass protaagonist, Kyouma. I like Kyouma a lot. He\'s not a teenage hero like a lot of anime and he looks like god damn Wolverine fused with a samurai. His character design is well chosen and he is funny to watch.

The lead female does a whole outfit change and asks if she looks cute. While watcing this scene I rolled my eyes and sighed. Kyouma felt the same way; he just walked off. It was hilarious. Point being, Kyouma is a fun character and he never annoyed me. The lead female, Mira, is kinda just there. She only helps out or serves a purpose on rare occasions. Most of the time, she\'s just there. I never found her to be very attractive, which the show was insistent on changing. The creator obviously thought she was sexy as hell, because she is shoved down your throat. The show is like:""Hey look! She has an ass! She has tits too! She can be moe if you want!!"". Mira feels kind of useless and I never really cared for her or felt worried when she was in danger. As for all the other characters, there\'s not much to talk about. No characters stand out and the villain is kind of shoehorned in at the last second. The character of Loser is mildly interesting, but nothing more. Kyouma was my saving grace in terms of characters.Sound: 5Nothing about the show\'s soundtrack ever stood out, it\'s just techno music and some other forgettable tracks for the most part. The opening is the only piece of music of note. The opening was a blast and I looked forward to it every time I started out a new episode. Much like the show itself, it\'s dumb but looks nice. The animation is flashy and shows Kyouma doing what he does best, being a badass. He dances as well in it for some reason. It\'s hilarious. The song is catchy too. The opening is definitely worth a listen if only for a laugh.Art: 4The animation is very flashy at points during the fight scenes. But like I stated before, there\'s no sense of tension. Kyouma is never really under any threat due to him being so strong. This kills any tension the show might have built up. A close shave where Kyouma could\'ve died when fighting Loser would have helped a lot. Apart from those moments of flashy animation, the show isn\'t up to much in regards to its visuals. The character designs are bland except for Kyouma and the backgrounds look very dodgy at times. The show isn\'t afraid to use CGI either, so if you hate CG stay away.Enjoyment: 7So with all these criticisms, you must be wondering why I gave enjoyment a 7. At first, I was pissed off at the show. I thought it was dumb. I wasn\'t wrong, but I just decided to sit back and take all the dumb shit. To be honest, I had fun. The opening was great, Kyouma was awesome and the fights were cool to look at. If you come here expecting any more, you\'ll be sorely disappointed. Despite my enjoyment, I can\'t hide its flaws. It\'s a flawed show. But at least the opening is hilarious.Overall: 6', ""Dimension W is definitely one of the most original sci-fi animes I've seen in a while. The core concept of the fourth dimension, named W, as well as the resulted technology is all cohesive, well developed and just simply cool. I personally really like the character design and the action sequences. My one criticism is that it's only 12 episodes long. I think the show would benefit more if given more screen time to introduce all characters and build them properly.Story: 8/10The ideas were all there, and they were great. We follow Kyoma, our coil-hating protagonist living in a coil powered world. Through the show's...episodic format, we learn more about how dimension W works as well as the coils' mechanism. We follow the newly formed duo, Kyoma and Mira, on their action-packed adventures, and eventually uncover burdens of their past.Art: 9/10Well animated and edited.Sound: 7/10I love Mira's voice actress.Character: 8/10All very likeable. But they kinda brushed through the villains.Enjoyment: 9/10I was honestly looking forward to every episode.Overall: 8/10Would have given it a 9 if they had like 3 more episodes. episodic format, we learn more about how dimension W works as well as the coils' mechanism.

As in, too sleek, or too 'cool.' To a point, this is true, but once you decide to really give it a shot, it doesn't let down. It's not as uber-unique as some people have said, but not as horrid as said by others. A solid story, competent characterization, and good work in the art + sound departments makes it worth the ride.[Story - 7]Our story follows Kyouma Mabuchi, a soldier turned repo-man in a sci-fi world revolving around a fourth dimension and its energies fueling new advancements on earth. This setting might not be...uber original, but it certainly is a memorable one. It was interesting to see even GLIMPSES of the mere politics (New/Neo Tesla’s interal squabbles + beefs with the government), ‘science’/fantasy elements (dimension-hopping, memory exploration), and so on/so forth. You can tell that the writer(s) did try to do as much world-building as they felt they could, and it works. I hope to see more of this expanded upon in a future season.Moving on from that, however; Pacing’s alright. Nothing too shabby, but the beginning drags a bit until episode 4, which may be a bit too long to really set up the world and dynamics. By then, though, the story picks up a lot and really gets down to the real grit of the show (a hunt for a macguffin that holds a lot of importance for Mabuchi’s background). The finale is perhaps a bit too neat with how it resolves everything + comes about (sudden antagonist reveal), but it’s serviceable and allows for more to be explored potentially.Thematically, this show isn’t too special. It covers typical sci-fi stuff like Are Robots Human? and the ethics of meddling with unknown technologies/energies/whatever. Even with a setting and story as engaging as this show has, it’s still…...meh. I guess it’s fine, but I’m getting tired of these types of things not being extensively explored.[Art - 6]The artwork is pretty solid. Action can be followed pretty easily, and is fairly fluid. Character design is competent in that it’s all individualized, and can convey core traits with ease (i.e. Mabuchi’s gruffness with his happi coat + absence of any tech). The setting artwork is alright; It’s not a Shinkai movie, but it looks nice and is engaging enough.However, this is not a ‘7’ because of one word: fanservice. It…..lurks underneath the show as it goes on, and pops up when you most expect it (but least want it). Truly a devilish fiend, that fanservice.[Sound - 7]Soundwork is thankfully devoid of said fanservice, and thus deserves its 7. The music is nothing to really rave about, but it works in being suitable to what’s going on + the general setting and its atmosphere. The OP is a bit too ‘EDM’ for me, but it’s cool; The ED, however, is fairly memorable with how angsty it sounds and reads.The SFX + voice-acting are good. Nothing to really say since there’s no stand-out performances save for Yuki Kaji as Sudden Antagonist (god, he has such range……….one minute he’s screaming his head off, the next he’s whimpering) and Daisuke Ono as Mabuchi (this totally didn’t influence me being reminded of Jotaro).[Character - 6]Characterization in this show is interesting, to say the least. Maybe it’s because it’s only one cour, but there’s a lot of build-up that doesn’t quite come to fruition here. Certainly frustrating, but this is ultimately mitigated by how well said build-up was done.Mabuchi’s a rather tragic man, honestly. Between what happened on Easter Island (watch the show, even if it’s kind of obvious) and losing such a close loved one (even if she looks 14), no wonder he’s so stereotypically stoic. It may certainly grate upon some people, especially in those first few episodes where everything is being established, but it does grow on you over time after you start to learn about why he’s like this. Naturally, he goes under the process of recovering from all of this (or at least the beginnings), and he comes out of it fairly okay.However, his sidekick/partner/robot/surrogate daughter/etc. Mira is a big part of the reason as to why, which means I have to talk about her. I’m gonna be frank: I don’t know how to feel about her. She can be really cute or funny sometimes, but really annoying with how naive she is at other times. Her arc mainly revolves around Pinocchio-style desires, but it never really gets dug into; This results in…...me not really caring about her.Then we have the foil to Mabuchi: Loser. I can’t talk a lot about this character, since their very identity is core to the mystery of Mabuchi’s past, but all I gotta say is that it’s worth the wait, and is PAINFULLY tragic.Last, but not least, is our surprise antagonist: Haruka Seameyer. While I enjoy how the character himself is written (genius driven to madness due to failure and all that), I HATE how suddenly he was introduced. No build-up at all in this case, so we’re just kind of…….accepting him at like episode 10. Ridiculous, in my opinion.There are a bunch of other characters, but they’re either forgettable or Cool but not cool enough to really warrant a full sentence about them.[Enjoyment/Overall - 6]Dimension W’s nothing radical, but it manages to escape the scorn of not being radical by just being light fun.

I was bouncing between a rating of 5 and 6, but near the end they really shit the bed making it an easy 5. Where it started going down hill was when they introduced Lwai. Didn\'t like his character, his flamboyant personality was annoying. Then for some reason, the dialogue started getting really cringy. Specific instances are the part where K.

Unlimited energy can be obtained from Dimension W with electromagnetic induction devices, which are produced and called coils. Collaborating with governments, New Tesla Energy company builds a total of sixty gigantic tower-shaped structures around the world, taking the energy current from Dimension W and transmitting it to the coils. Thanks to the coils that can fit in the palm of your hand, all kinds of electronic devices can work and there is no need for electricity or oil. In 2072, when the anime took place, the new technology was well established...in human life, and there was no area where it was not used. One feature of the coils is that they give feedbacks to New Tesla Energy. In other words, they are under constant supervision to prevent abuse. When this is the case, bad people have started to produce and use illegal coils in order not to be followed. And bounty hunters called ""Collectors"" are assigned to seize these illegal coils. Our main character is one such collector, Mabuchi Kyouma. He is an incredible fighter and knife thrower and he hates coils because of a past experience. He does not use any device that works with a coil on it, even his car runs on gasoline. In such a world, while Mabuchi is doing his job, one day he meets Mira. Mira is an android that was created directly by the founder of New Tesla Energy. After that point, Mabuchi\'s bounty hunting business takes a different direction and his past is revealed.As I said, Dimension W is about Mabuchi\'s adventure.

Also the white shading effects used in the characters are very successful and they add a pleasant uniqueness. Dimension W\'s soundtracks are as strong as its visuals. The opening is very good and the soundtracks played during the episodes complement the atmosphere well.I have one more thing to say about this anime and about cyberpunk genre in general. In terms of sci-fi and cyberpunk, Dimension W is quite underrated in my opinion especially when I think about all the garbage tier products that try to hide behind the ""cyberpunk"" mask, despite the fact that it can be difficult to understand at times.

Futari wa Precure: Splash☆Star,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1534/Futari_wa_Precure__Splash☆Star,"['""The shining golden flower, Cure Bloom!""""The sparkling silver wing, Cure Egret!""""We are Pretty Cure!""Pretty Cure has become a monster of a franchise with multiple different seasons and continuities, and that\'s not even counting the movies. Splash Star is the first of those alternate continuities, and in my opinion the best. I will try to make this review as spoiler free as possible, but still be wary. This is an updated version of the review.Right from the beginning the first thing that anyone would notice about Splash Star is that it looks similar to it\'s predecessor. The general plot outline and even the main characters look...similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively. And this is possibly a big flaw of Splash Star\'s, that it is too similar to the original at first. However it does indeed come into its own and really ends up distinguishing itself from the original, and similar doesn\'t mean the same, even with just a few episodes it\'s easy to see that while Saki and Mai have similar physical designs their personalities aren\'t really that similar to Nagisa and Honoka. And the plot has enough twists and differences from the original to really be its own. Due to spoilers I won\'t go into what makes it better and the key differences, you\'ll have to watch the show.The story is simple but because of that the series is very consistent in episode quality, and while it never tries to be a really intelligent, thought provoking anime it still has serious and important topics and themes to it that are all able to be conveyed nicely because the characters put so much emotion into them. The show is great at being serious when it wants to be, and Pretty Cure show a sense of maturity and realism when faced with their greatest foes and they need to ask themselves why they even fight in the first place, what\'s their resolve for continuing their struggles and not giving up? There are some really great lines and conversations in this series, most episodes also have sweet and well done subplots to them as well. And add to that there are some really beautiful and touching scenes in the series, I found myself on the verge of tears several times throughout the show.Splash Star features a lot more thought and effort put into it\'s writing than the original, this becomes apparent with what the monster of the weeks are created from, the elemental themes of the minions, the powers of Pretty Cure, and just the whole world of Splash Star in general. The theming of the villains and theme-naming of the Cures actually mean something and tie into the world and greater themes of Splash Star. Several of the biggest twists in the story are foreshadowed far in advance, even episode one hints at possibly the biggest twist in the series.The characters themselves are of course rather simple, Michiru and Kaoru are probably the most complex the series has to offer, but the leads are just so fun and likable and entertaining that it isn\'t as big a problem as one might suspect. The series is always more about emotion and heart, and it really gets you to care about Saki and Mai by having you be there with them throughout all their ordeals.The villains however are in all likelihood much more entertaining and funny than our heroes. Special mention goes to Kintoleski who is without a doubt one of the best things about this show.Of course though not all the villains are hilarious, both Akudaikaan and Gohyaan have moments that would make them genuinely frightening to the younger audience this series is aimed at. And Michiru and Kaoru\'s character arc and plight is anything but funny.Of course you cant talk about Pretty Cure without talking about the fights, and it\'s here where the first big difference between Splash Star and the original takes place, as Cure Bloom and Cure Egret they fight often using forcefields and blasts of energy, it gives a nice edge to the fights coming right after the original.As for actual quality of the fights while Splash Star has some of the best fights in Pretty Cure, including possibly the downright best, many fights are rather anti-climactic and can loook rather stiff and have choppy animation. This is more prevalent in the earlier arcs. Aside from the few really good fights the fighting in Splash Star seems to emphasize awesome moments over actual good fighting, for example in the second episode when the girls are learning how to control their powers they throw the monster of the week across the city and into the ocean.The actual animation quality on the whole is surprisingly pretty good for a year-round show made by Toei. The quality is consistent throughout and occasionally looks great, usually during the better and more intense fights.As for sound the music is good and very fitting, plenty of happy, relaxing, and melancholic themes when they\'re appropriate. There aren\'t too many standout singular tracks though. The opening and endings however are great. Happy and energetic, the kind that get you shaking in your seat. They\'re the perfect songs for a series like this.The voice acting is excellent, especially on the villains side. For example veteran seiyu Jurota Kosugi voices Kintoleski and it\'s no surprise that his performance is the best in the whole show.Still after all the good things about Splash Star it has some rather noticeable flaws, becuase of it\'s similarity to the original the earlier arcs are rather dull compared to later on and it really does take longer than it should for the series to set itself apart from the original. And despite the series having much tighter writing and a better thought out plot there is one plot hole that can only be filled by your imagination.But Splash Star is able to still be a super fun and enjoyable show throughout its run, even with the repetitiveness I found every episode fun and entertaining. And it has possibly the most epic and heart-pounding finale of all Pretty Cure seasons, with the villain throwing Earth-shattering attacks and Pretty Cure never backing down, it\'s on a level far above anything else in the series. And what happens after is one of the most beautiful and touching epilogues in the franchise.It\'s a kids show, Pretty Cure always will be a kids show, but it\'s also able to have serious and mature moments and topics and pull them off nicely. In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun. similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively. And this is possibly a big flaw of Splash Star\'s, that it is too similar to the original at first. However it does indeed come into its own and really ends up distinguishing itself from the original, and similar doesn\'t mean the same, even with just a few episodes it\'s easy to see that while Saki and Mai have similar physical designs their personalities aren\'t really that similar to Nagisa and Honoka. And the plot has enough twists and differences from the original to really be its own. Due to spoilers I won\'t go into what makes it better and the key differences, you\'ll have to watch the show.The story is simple but because of that the series is very consistent in episode quality, and while it never tries to be a really intelligent, thought provoking anime it still has serious and important topics and themes to it that are all able to be conveyed nicely because the characters put so much emotion into them. The show is great at being serious when it wants to be, and Pretty Cure show a sense of maturity and realism when faced with their greatest foes and they need to ask themselves why they even fight in the first place, what\'s their resolve for continuing their struggles and not giving up? There are some really great lines and conversations in this series, most episodes also have sweet and well done subplots to them as well. And add to that there are some really beautiful and touching scenes in the series, I found myself on the verge of tears several times throughout the show.Splash Star features a lot more thought and effort put into it\'s writing than the original, this becomes apparent with what the monster of the weeks are created from, the elemental themes of the minions, the powers of Pretty Cure, and just the whole world of Splash Star in general. The theming of the villains and theme-naming of the Cures actually mean something and tie into the world and greater themes of Splash Star. Several of the biggest twists in the story are foreshadowed far in advance, even episode one hints at possibly the biggest twist in the series.The characters themselves are of course rather simple, Michiru and Kaoru are probably the most complex the series has to offer, but the leads are just so fun and likable and entertaining that it isn\'t as big a problem as one might suspect. The series is always more about emotion and heart, and it really gets you to care about Saki and Mai by having you be there with them throughout all their ordeals.The villains however are in all likelihood much more entertaining and funny than our heroes. Special mention goes to Kintoleski who is without a doubt one of the best things about this show.Of course though not all the villains are hilarious, both Akudaikaan and Gohyaan have moments that would make them genuinely frightening to the younger audience this series is aimed at. And Michiru and Kaoru\'s character arc and plight is anything but funny.Of course you cant talk about Pretty Cure without talking about the fights, and it\'s here where the first big difference between Splash Star and the original takes place, as Cure Bloom and Cure Egret they fight often using forcefields and blasts of energy, it gives a nice edge to the fights coming right after the original.As for actual quality of the fights while Splash Star has some of the best fights in Pretty Cure, including possibly the downright best, many fights are rather anti-climactic and can loook rather stiff and have choppy animation. This is more prevalent in the earlier arcs. Aside from the few really good fights the fighting in Splash Star seems to emphasize awesome moments over actual good fighting, for example in the second episode when the girls are learning how to control their powers they throw the monster of the week across the city and into the ocean.The actual animation quality on the whole is surprisingly pretty good for a year-round show made by Toei. The quality is consistent throughout and occasionally looks great, usually during the better and more intense fights.As for sound the music is good and very fitting, plenty of happy, relaxing, and melancholic themes when they\'re appropriate. There aren\'t too many standout singular tracks though. The opening and endings however are great. Happy and energetic, the kind that get you shaking in your seat. They\'re the perfect songs for a series like this.The voice acting is excellent, especially on the villains side.

In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun.', ""Let's take another look at Toei's PreCure franchise. So far, I've looked at Futari wa, Max Heart & Doki Doki. This time around, let's talk about Splash Star. The third instalment of the franchise that ran from '06 to '07. How well does it hold up compared to the other instalments we've looked at? Let's take a look.Story:Young Mai is moving back to a city she used to live in. While exploring, she encounters a familiar looking girl, Saki, underneath the sky tree. The two encounter a pair of faeries, Flappy & Choppy, who remind them that they briefly encountered each other beneath that...same tree five years ago. A  brief instant that was so formative for the pair that it apparently caused their fates to intertwine because PreCure has never been subtle with its massive amounts of subtext. The two are confronted by a leafy looking menace who demands that the faeries disclose the location of the fountain of the Sun. Saki and Mai go to their defence, transforming into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret. Together, they set off on a mission to revive the holy fountains.Honestly, there aren't any major problems with the series. About the worst you can say about it is that it's very much a magical girl series with all the optimism, enemies of the week, transformation sequences and such that are prevalent in the genre. And there's nothing inherently wrong with a work in a genre being very much grounded in that genre. Especially when it's something like this with a young target audience.Splash Star has a lot of aspects that are kind of similar to Futari wa but that are also distinct. Both series feature an athletic girl and one who is into more intellectual pursuits. The characters even look a bit similar. But they're involved in different things and have different issues related to those interests. Both series have a generic male love interest who's barely acknowledged because every time he shows up for a moment with the girl who has a crush on him it's used to transition into a bigger moment for her with the other PreCure but Splash Star makes use of that a lot less and has different kinds of moments betwixt the girls as a result. In both of them, the athletic girl has a younger sibling. But the relationship dynamic that Nagisa had with her brother was a lot different from the one Saki has with her sister.I do like the pacing in Splash Star. It does a really good job of introducing a variety of major villains, giving them some time to be menaces and then bringing the next one in before you can get tired of the current one. Splash Star also features a superb redemption story with some surprisingly tragic moments within it. Darn it, PreCure writers, stop making me feel things. I'm supposed to be a cynical git. A cynical git who hates everything. Or so I've been told. There are some strong moments of tension in the series as well. They really make you curious about how Saki & Mai are going to resolve things. Although you know they will because it's PreCure. The climax is really well done too. The series is just generally fun, cute and endearing.Characters:There are some strong characters in Splash Star. Saki and Mai are great.  Their families are a lot of fun. Michiru and Kaoru are great. The supporting cast has a lot of fun, colourful characters within it. In terms of antagonists, most of them are pretty standard. The big exception is Alex Louis Kintoleski. There  is something utterly delightful about him and his techniques that have been passed down the Kintoleski line for generations. Shitataare  and DoroDoron are kind of fun at times. The worst character, by far, is Moerumaba. He comes across as a strange blend of gay and Latin stereotypes. The faeries aren't particularly compelling, but they're decent enough.Art:There's a lot of praiseworthy aspects to the artwork. The backgrounds are nicely detailed with some very nicely done scenery. The action sequences can be absolutely amazing. I do love the way this franchise incorporates really physical brawling into its action sequences along with the special magic attacks and Splash Star is no exception to that. It does suffer from the same issue with the stock footage attacks that Futari wa did. Namely, that there are very few and they start to get dull after a while. This was before they'd learned to vary them a bit more, clearly. There are some really interesting villain designs. I can't stand Moerumba's and Alex Louis Kintoleski may be the best villain, but his design is kind of boring. He's just a golden muscle man. Those two aside, great villain designs. I do like the PreCure designs too. I like that Saki & Mai have multiple Cure forms and I like their outfits. The monster designs continue to be very creative and interesting. Which is another thing the franchise has been consistently good at.Sound:The best performances come from Kimoto Orie, Enomoto Atsuko, Fuchizaki Yuriko & Imai Yuka. There are plenty of other good performances as well. Sato Naoki is back for the soundtrack work and he does a really nice job.Ho-yay:Saki and Mai may be marginally more homo-erotic than Nagisa and Honoka were. They're heavily inspired by one another. They gain strength when their hearts come together as one. They talk about their fated meeting. They have a date where they actually feed one another home made bento. They talk about how energised they feel when they hold hands. I can only imagine how much that's going to increase when they get older and start snogging. In any case, their dynamic is adorable.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Splash Star. If you're a fan of the whole magical girl aesthetic, it's for you. You will almost certainly garner enjoyment from watching it. If you aren't a fan of the genre, it's not going to change your mind. For myself, I pretty thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the characters. I give it a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Wolf Guy. same tree five years ago.

I did see the first episode of the first series, Futari wa Pretty Cure way long ago, but I never went beyond it, partly because of other things, and partly because one mascot\'s voice was so grating and annoying I just couldn\'t stand it. But after I finished Heartcatch Precure thanks to a fellow blogger\'s praising it up the wazoo, I later watched the first 5 episodes of Smile, but I had to put it on hold due to other real life obligations. Then I found Splash Star on TVTropes and apparently people used to outright hate...it back when it aired but now its held with higher regard. Out of curiosity and boredom after watching too much Pokemon and Sword Art Online, I decided to check it out. As of now, it is the second Pretty Cure series I have ever watched all the way through, and my second favorite, for very good reasons. This is a very good series, and it really needs to be seen by American little girls.Like the first series, it starts off with two girls who are very different from each other: the cheerful and sporty Saki Hyuuga, and the soft-spoken and artistic Mai Mishou. They actually met once when they were younger, but they separated since then, only reuniting once they enter middle school. But their reunion is quite a strange one: two fairies appear from a big tree in the neighborhood, Flappi and Choppi, claiming to be from a place called The Land of Fountains, which had been taken over by the evil organization called Dark Fall. The fairies give Saki and Mai giant cell phones which transform them into the warriors named Pretty Cure, Saki as Cure Bloom, and Mai as Cure Egret (for those wondering, the word egret is a medieval term used to describe white birds, usually herons, with long, graceful plumes during breeding season. Mai\'s powers are based on the wind and the sky, so it makes sense). Together, they have to defeat Dark Fall and restore the Land of Fountains back to its original state. But they also have to protect their own world, as Dark Fall won\'t spare it either, especially since they\'re also trying to find the elusive Fountain of the Sun, the only fountain they haven\'t destroyed or claimed yet.The animation...isn\'t really much to write home about. There is a lot of movement during the fight scenes, which is good considering the hard hitting attacks Pretty Cure is known for requires a lot of movement, but at times the characters look a bit off model, especially during later episodes. But they\'re minor, so they don\'t hurt the show entirely. One reason for this may be that Splash Star made a lot less money on its debut than the original series, probably because people were turned off by the character designs and premise looking way too similar to the original Pretty Cure series before it. No one really knows why Toei made Saki and Mai look so similar to Nagisa and Honoka of the original series, and the most common theory is that they were afraid of potential backlash from the audience that liked Nagisa and Honoka, fearing cries of ""Replacement Scrappy!"" But whatever the reason, that\'s still no reason to put off this show or dismiss it as a rip-off of the original series. Again, I haven\'t seen the first series and its sequel, Max Heart, so I can\'t properly judge it.The music, while admittedly not as good or dynamic as later seasons, still manages to be really solid. The music manages to capture the mood, atmosphere, and intents of all of its scenes really well, and nothing feels out of place, unlike some anime (Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, anyone?). I particularly liked the music that played when the Pretty Cures, in their new forms, unleash their final attacks on the monsters of the week, and I consider those pieces to be the high point of the entire OST. Also, the opening is extremely dynamic and catchy. It\'ll never leave your brain! I certainly liked it, and I don\'t see why American audiences wouldn\'t like it either.The Pretty Cure series is very reliant on character development. Some series do it well, and some...don\'t. Splash Star does it well. While Saki and Mai may look like rip-offs of Nagisa and Honoka, they\'re actually very different characters. Saki is cheerful, energetic, and friendly, but can be a little reckless and stubborn at times, Mai is sweet, soft spoken, slightly indecisive, and a little shy, but is very insightful. I personally liked seeing them interact and get along and influence each other throughout the series. Most anime tend to just give a character one trait and that\'s it. You don\'t see that in Splash Star. The main characters actually have hobbies and interests. Saki likes sports, but she also likes working in her parents\' bakery, and she even tries her hand at drawing, even though she isn\'t very good. Mai likes drawing, but is also interested in astronomy. They have interesting lives! The other characters, like their family members and classmates, also have a strong presence, and don\'t just show up for one episode and then be gone forever. They all influence the main characters\' growth in some way. I will admit though, I didn\'t like Michiru and Kaoru much. I always thought they were creepy until the very end of the series.Unfortunately, however, while the main characters are very well developed, I\'m sad to say this isn\'t the case for the villains. While I appreciate them being intimidating and having some personality, in the end they\'re still typical, cliche, generic, power hungry villains who want to destroy the world for dumb reasons. Plus I felt there were a bit too many of them. I would have liked to see them be fleshed out some more. Yes, I know, it\'s a kids show, but that\'s still no excuse to not develop your villains. Sometimes kids like interesting villains who don\'t want to destroy the world. But one thing that really makes me respect this series is how realistically it handles its character conflicts. In one episode, Kenta spills a drink on Mai\'s brother\'s book, and Saki is extremely angry at him. But both of them know it\'s an accident, actually apologize to each other right after, and try to find a way to fix it. There\'s no overblown misunderstanding, no melodrama, no shouting ""this has nothing to do with you!"", etc. God, I\'ve waited so long for a series to actually make characters understand each other\'s intentions, actually talk to each other, and be proactive in trying to solve them in the most down to earth way possible! I\'m so sick and tired of anime making characters act really stupid and refusing to talk to each other for the sake of drama and padding things out for a really long time just for the sake of spicing things up when all it does is drag it down! Thank you, Splash Star!Splash Star may not be the best series in the franchise (for me, that honor goes to Heartcatch), but it definitely has a special place in my heart. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m gonna go watch Suite, because I\'m enjoying it immensely! And seriously, why can\'t shows like this be faithfully dubbed in English for American TV?

Little girls would love this kind of stuff!', ""Now I’d read lots of praise about this Precure series, but for me it really didn't live up to it.tl;dr: Episodes without Kaoru and Michiru = average. Episodes with Kaoru and Michiru = good.I found the story was too slow paced with little happening and not interesting enough. Apart from Kaoru and Michiru of course, their part of the story was the best. Unfortunately it doesn't focus on them all of the time. Precure stories aren't the fastest pasted in anime, but this series seemed especially slow and dull compared to others. The main story itself is generic - a big bad guy with various...minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end. I feel other Precure series handled this better, especially Fresh.I also felt like there was too much filler which wasn't the most entertaining. I think how there are only two main girls lets the filler down as there is only so much you can do with 49 episodes of the same two characters all the time. The filler wasn't up to the standard of other series.The animation was pretty bad. Lots of derpy faces and poor drawings, but what can you expect.The designs themselves are awful. Again, apart from Michiru and Kaoru. I really liked Michiru's as she reminds me of Will from W.I.T.C.H.Saki and Mai character wise are a bit different from Nagisa and Honoka, but that doesn't stop them from looking like poorly done rip off fan designs. The first outfits you can put up with, Saki's second outfit however is terrible! The colour is greeny-yellow! Who thought that looked good!?Another thing I disliked was that Saki and Mai just got beat up most of the time instead of getting stronger until the last few episodes. In other series the Cures actually get evidently stronger and beat enimies faster as time goes on. Saki and Mai just get punched down until the last moment of a fight when they fire their main big finishing attack. The fight scenes lacked compared to other series, but they seemed to be stronger cures in terms of their magical powers, they just didn’t use their fists enough.The writing is very good. No main character gets more unnecessary screen time than another.The characters themselves are good. I liked all of the fairies, Saki and Mai are likable (far from my favourite Cures though). The first villan is kind of dull and I hated Moerumba he was so annoying. I liked the rest of the villains. Ms. Shitataare is the best, she was really entertaining and added in good comedy. The series itself did make me laugh quite a few times.Kaoru and Michiru however are by far the best characters, their development is wonderful and they are really interesting. I like them a lot more than Saki and Mai.I know this review seems pretty negative, but this isn't a bad show itself. I just found the other Precure series I have watched to be better. (and no I haven't seen Doki Doki!) minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end. I feel other Precure series handled this better, especially Fresh.I also felt like there was too much filler which wasn't the most entertaining.

I really liked Michiru's as she reminds me of Will from W.I.T.C.H.Saki and Mai character wise are a bit different from Nagisa and Honoka, but that doesn't stop them from looking like poorly done rip off fan designs. The first outfits you can put up with, Saki's second outfit however is terrible! The colour is greeny-yellow! Who thought that looked good!?Another thing I disliked was that Saki and Mai just got beat up most of the time instead of getting stronger until the last few episodes. In other series the Cures actually get evidently stronger and beat enimies faster as time goes on. Saki and Mai just get punched down until the last moment of a fight when they fire their main big finishing attack. The fight scenes lacked compared to other series, but they seemed to be stronger cures in terms of their magical powers, they just didn’t use their fists enough.The writing is very good. No main character gets more unnecessary screen time than another.The characters themselves are good. I liked all of the fairies, Saki and Mai are likable (far from my favourite Cures though). The first villan is kind of dull and I hated Moerumba he was so annoying. I liked the rest of the villains. Ms. Shitataare is the best, she was really entertaining and added in good comedy. The series itself did make me laugh quite a few times.Kaoru and Michiru however are by far the best characters, their development is wonderful and they are really interesting. I like them a lot more than Saki and Mai.I know this review seems pretty negative, but this isn't a bad show itself. I just found the other Precure series I have watched to be better. (and no I haven't seen Doki Doki!)"", ""Futari Wa Precure Splash Star is a season that Precure fans can enjoy, even if you haven't seen Precure before, as it doesn't have a sequel season or is a sequel season. This season's plot is unique in it's own way,the art style fits the season for 2006, and Bloom and Egret (Saki and Mai) are characters that I really enjoyed getting to know! Now, I do need to say that there are a few stale episodes at the beginning, so be advised of that. I recommend this show to any Precure fan! I really enjoyed this season, though it's not perfect, it's still fantastic!

Thus, Splash Star is my second dive (third, if you count Max Heart separately) in this huge sea that I still have left to explore.First of all, I’ve read some people pointing out the similarities between the OG Futari wa and Splash Star. At first sight, it may seem impossible not to look at the two Splash Star protagonists and see our old friends Nagisa and Honoka, but as the episodes progressed different dynamics can...be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor. With that said, I’ll try not to remark on any parallelism between both of them (even though I couldn’t stop doing comparisons between the two shows during my viewing lol).StoryI think the story is the most remarkable thing about Splash Star and it’s all thanks to two characters. No, not Saki and Mai, but Kaoru and Michiru. These two managed to sustain and raise what at first seemed like the typical story about legendary warriors who need to save the Earth from dark villains. I got really invested in the bonds both Kaoru and Michiru created with the protagonists, as well as their whole character arc. The pacing is great, all the villains come and go at the right moment, and maybe when it can start to get a little tiresome, Kaoru and Michiru step in and refresh the story. Lastly, I’d like to point out how the anime conveys emotions in different situations very well through drawings, making Saki and Mai characters evolve.CharactersSaki and Mai, both with their different personalities, balance each other nicely, giving some powerful and emotional moments. Regarding the side characters, I think Splash Star is capable of the best and worst. Ok, maybe not the worst, but there are a bunch of forgettable characters, like their girl friends and overall their families. Aside from Kaoru and Michiru, Kenta and Minori are the other two that I liked the most, bringing the first one a lot of funny moments and the last one extremely cute ones. The spirits or mascots were meh, I didn't particularly like or hate them. The villains were great though. I couldn’t stop laughing everytime Moerumba danced or teased Gooyaan, same with Mizu Shitatare getting mad at Saki for always saying her name wrong, and I liked how Kintoleski always made sure his opponents were fighting full strength.ArtNot gonna talk much about the art, mainly cause I don’t really know what to say. Being a coastal city, there are some nice sea visuals, plus the giant tree of life that’s inside the town. The characters designs are good, it’s nice to see the protagonists have more than one battle outfit. Also, some fights are very well done, combining action with super powers, but overall I think they all looked pretty much the same.SoundThe OP and the two EDs were energetic and catchy. The soundtrack was good as well, but, even though I said I wouldn't compare the two anime, I gotta say that there aren’t any cool insert songs like “Shining Star” or “Heart to Heart” in the OG Futari wa. Same as in Max Heart, where they repeat the instrumental version of the OP/EDs quite a lot.In conclusion, Splash Star is an enjoyable anime that’s worth recommending to anyone that loves mahou shoujo and has liked any other Precure entries. Don't be reluctant to watch this anime only because it may seem the same as the previous Futari wa, since Saki and Mai (and Kaoru and Michiru) will make sure to prove you wrong. be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor.

I strongly disagree. This cast is one of the best. Mai and Saki, at first glance, seem like Nagisa and Honoka but there are key differences. The tone of this installment is much lighter with villains more often used for comedic relief. Mai and Saki are also more optimistic and much faster friends compared to their predecessors.The side cast were also more memorable. Kenta with his comedy and his family. Hitomi and Yuuko who were similarly high energy like Saki.I also found Minori...much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun. The twist with Akudaikan and Gohyaan was out of nowhere and very interesting.Finally, Michiru and Kaoru. Their gradual redemption and their relationship with Dark Fall was so awesome to see. Their characters had so much depth. much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun.

Their characters had so much depth.', '""The shining golden flower, Cure Bloom!""""The sparkling silver wing, Cure Egret!""""We are Pretty Cure!""Pretty Cure has become a monster of a franchise with multiple different seasons and continuities, and that\'s not even counting the movies. Splash Star is the first of those alternate continuities, and in my opinion the best. I will try to make this review as spoiler free as possible, but still be wary. This is an updated version of the review.Right from the beginning the first thing that anyone would notice about Splash Star is that it looks similar to it\'s predecessor. The general plot outline and even the main characters look...similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively. And this is possibly a big flaw of Splash Star\'s, that it is too similar to the original at first. However it does indeed come into its own and really ends up distinguishing itself from the original, and similar doesn\'t mean the same, even with just a few episodes it\'s easy to see that while Saki and Mai have similar physical designs their personalities aren\'t really that similar to Nagisa and Honoka. And the plot has enough twists and differences from the original to really be its own. Due to spoilers I won\'t go into what makes it better and the key differences, you\'ll have to watch the show.The story is simple but because of that the series is very consistent in episode quality, and while it never tries to be a really intelligent, thought provoking anime it still has serious and important topics and themes to it that are all able to be conveyed nicely because the characters put so much emotion into them. The show is great at being serious when it wants to be, and Pretty Cure show a sense of maturity and realism when faced with their greatest foes and they need to ask themselves why they even fight in the first place, what\'s their resolve for continuing their struggles and not giving up? There are some really great lines and conversations in this series, most episodes also have sweet and well done subplots to them as well. And add to that there are some really beautiful and touching scenes in the series, I found myself on the verge of tears several times throughout the show.Splash Star features a lot more thought and effort put into it\'s writing than the original, this becomes apparent with what the monster of the weeks are created from, the elemental themes of the minions, the powers of Pretty Cure, and just the whole world of Splash Star in general. The theming of the villains and theme-naming of the Cures actually mean something and tie into the world and greater themes of Splash Star. Several of the biggest twists in the story are foreshadowed far in advance, even episode one hints at possibly the biggest twist in the series.The characters themselves are of course rather simple, Michiru and Kaoru are probably the most complex the series has to offer, but the leads are just so fun and likable and entertaining that it isn\'t as big a problem as one might suspect. The series is always more about emotion and heart, and it really gets you to care about Saki and Mai by having you be there with them throughout all their ordeals.The villains however are in all likelihood much more entertaining and funny than our heroes. Special mention goes to Kintoleski who is without a doubt one of the best things about this show.Of course though not all the villains are hilarious, both Akudaikaan and Gohyaan have moments that would make them genuinely frightening to the younger audience this series is aimed at. And Michiru and Kaoru\'s character arc and plight is anything but funny.Of course you cant talk about Pretty Cure without talking about the fights, and it\'s here where the first big difference between Splash Star and the original takes place, as Cure Bloom and Cure Egret they fight often using forcefields and blasts of energy, it gives a nice edge to the fights coming right after the original.As for actual quality of the fights while Splash Star has some of the best fights in Pretty Cure, including possibly the downright best, many fights are rather anti-climactic and can loook rather stiff and have choppy animation. This is more prevalent in the earlier arcs. Aside from the few really good fights the fighting in Splash Star seems to emphasize awesome moments over actual good fighting, for example in the second episode when the girls are learning how to control their powers they throw the monster of the week across the city and into the ocean.The actual animation quality on the whole is surprisingly pretty good for a year-round show made by Toei. The quality is consistent throughout and occasionally looks great, usually during the better and more intense fights.As for sound the music is good and very fitting, plenty of happy, relaxing, and melancholic themes when they\'re appropriate. There aren\'t too many standout singular tracks though. The opening and endings however are great. Happy and energetic, the kind that get you shaking in your seat. They\'re the perfect songs for a series like this.The voice acting is excellent, especially on the villains side. For example veteran seiyu Jurota Kosugi voices Kintoleski and it\'s no surprise that his performance is the best in the whole show.Still after all the good things about Splash Star it has some rather noticeable flaws, becuase of it\'s similarity to the original the earlier arcs are rather dull compared to later on and it really does take longer than it should for the series to set itself apart from the original. And despite the series having much tighter writing and a better thought out plot there is one plot hole that can only be filled by your imagination.But Splash Star is able to still be a super fun and enjoyable show throughout its run, even with the repetitiveness I found every episode fun and entertaining. And it has possibly the most epic and heart-pounding finale of all Pretty Cure seasons, with the villain throwing Earth-shattering attacks and Pretty Cure never backing down, it\'s on a level far above anything else in the series. And what happens after is one of the most beautiful and touching epilogues in the franchise.It\'s a kids show, Pretty Cure always will be a kids show, but it\'s also able to have serious and mature moments and topics and pull them off nicely. In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun. similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively.

In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun.', ""Let's take another look at Toei's PreCure franchise. So far, I've looked at Futari wa, Max Heart & Doki Doki. This time around, let's talk about Splash Star. The third instalment of the franchise that ran from '06 to '07. How well does it hold up compared to the other instalments we've looked at? Let's take a look.Story:Young Mai is moving back to a city she used to live in. While exploring, she encounters a familiar looking girl, Saki, underneath the sky tree. The two encounter a pair of faeries, Flappy & Choppy, who remind them that they briefly encountered each other beneath that...same tree five years ago. A  brief instant that was so formative for the pair that it apparently caused their fates to intertwine because PreCure has never been subtle with its massive amounts of subtext. The two are confronted by a leafy looking menace who demands that the faeries disclose the location of the fountain of the Sun. Saki and Mai go to their defence, transforming into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret. Together, they set off on a mission to revive the holy fountains.Honestly, there aren't any major problems with the series. About the worst you can say about it is that it's very much a magical girl series with all the optimism, enemies of the week, transformation sequences and such that are prevalent in the genre. And there's nothing inherently wrong with a work in a genre being very much grounded in that genre. Especially when it's something like this with a young target audience.Splash Star has a lot of aspects that are kind of similar to Futari wa but that are also distinct. Both series feature an athletic girl and one who is into more intellectual pursuits. The characters even look a bit similar. But they're involved in different things and have different issues related to those interests. Both series have a generic male love interest who's barely acknowledged because every time he shows up for a moment with the girl who has a crush on him it's used to transition into a bigger moment for her with the other PreCure but Splash Star makes use of that a lot less and has different kinds of moments betwixt the girls as a result. In both of them, the athletic girl has a younger sibling. But the relationship dynamic that Nagisa had with her brother was a lot different from the one Saki has with her sister.I do like the pacing in Splash Star. It does a really good job of introducing a variety of major villains, giving them some time to be menaces and then bringing the next one in before you can get tired of the current one. Splash Star also features a superb redemption story with some surprisingly tragic moments within it. Darn it, PreCure writers, stop making me feel things. I'm supposed to be a cynical git. A cynical git who hates everything. Or so I've been told. There are some strong moments of tension in the series as well. They really make you curious about how Saki & Mai are going to resolve things. Although you know they will because it's PreCure. The climax is really well done too. The series is just generally fun, cute and endearing.Characters:There are some strong characters in Splash Star. Saki and Mai are great.  Their families are a lot of fun. Michiru and Kaoru are great. The supporting cast has a lot of fun, colourful characters within it. In terms of antagonists, most of them are pretty standard. The big exception is Alex Louis Kintoleski. There  is something utterly delightful about him and his techniques that have been passed down the Kintoleski line for generations. Shitataare  and DoroDoron are kind of fun at times. The worst character, by far, is Moerumaba. He comes across as a strange blend of gay and Latin stereotypes. The faeries aren't particularly compelling, but they're decent enough.Art:There's a lot of praiseworthy aspects to the artwork. The backgrounds are nicely detailed with some very nicely done scenery. The action sequences can be absolutely amazing. I do love the way this franchise incorporates really physical brawling into its action sequences along with the special magic attacks and Splash Star is no exception to that. It does suffer from the same issue with the stock footage attacks that Futari wa did. Namely, that there are very few and they start to get dull after a while. This was before they'd learned to vary them a bit more, clearly. There are some really interesting villain designs. I can't stand Moerumba's and Alex Louis Kintoleski may be the best villain, but his design is kind of boring. He's just a golden muscle man. Those two aside, great villain designs. I do like the PreCure designs too. I like that Saki & Mai have multiple Cure forms and I like their outfits. The monster designs continue to be very creative and interesting. Which is another thing the franchise has been consistently good at.Sound:The best performances come from Kimoto Orie, Enomoto Atsuko, Fuchizaki Yuriko & Imai Yuka. There are plenty of other good performances as well. Sato Naoki is back for the soundtrack work and he does a really nice job.Ho-yay:Saki and Mai may be marginally more homo-erotic than Nagisa and Honoka were. They're heavily inspired by one another. They gain strength when their hearts come together as one. They talk about their fated meeting. They have a date where they actually feed one another home made bento. They talk about how energised they feel when they hold hands. I can only imagine how much that's going to increase when they get older and start snogging. In any case, their dynamic is adorable.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Splash Star. If you're a fan of the whole magical girl aesthetic, it's for you. You will almost certainly garner enjoyment from watching it. If you aren't a fan of the genre, it's not going to change your mind. For myself, I pretty thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the characters. I give it a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Wolf Guy. same tree five years ago.

The faeries aren't particularly compelling, but they're decent enough.Art:There's a lot of praiseworthy aspects to the artwork. The backgrounds are nicely detailed with some very nicely done scenery. The action sequences can be absolutely amazing. I do love the way this franchise incorporates really physical brawling into its action sequences along with the special magic attacks and Splash Star is no exception to that. It does suffer from the same issue with the stock footage attacks that Futari wa did. Namely, that there are very few and they start to get dull after a while. This was before they'd learned to vary them a bit more, clearly. There are some really interesting villain designs. I can't stand Moerumba's and Alex Louis Kintoleski may be the best villain, but his design is kind of boring. He's just a golden muscle man. Those two aside, great villain designs. I do like the PreCure designs too. I like that Saki & Mai have multiple Cure forms and I like their outfits. The monster designs continue to be very creative and interesting. Which is another thing the franchise has been consistently good at.Sound:The best performances come from Kimoto Orie, Enomoto Atsuko, Fuchizaki Yuriko & Imai Yuka. There are plenty of other good performances as well. Sato Naoki is back for the soundtrack work and he does a really nice job.Ho-yay:Saki and Mai may be marginally more homo-erotic than Nagisa and Honoka were. They're heavily inspired by one another. They gain strength when their hearts come together as one. They talk about their fated meeting. They have a date where they actually feed one another home made bento. They talk about how energised they feel when they hold hands. I can only imagine how much that's going to increase when they get older and start snogging. In any case, their dynamic is adorable.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Splash Star. If you're a fan of the whole magical girl aesthetic, it's for you. You will almost certainly garner enjoyment from watching it. If you aren't a fan of the genre, it's not going to change your mind. For myself, I pretty thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the characters. I give it a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Wolf Guy."", 'My first Pretty Cure series was Heartcatch Precure. I did see the first episode of the first series, Futari wa Pretty Cure way long ago, but I never went beyond it, partly because of other things, and partly because one mascot\'s voice was so grating and annoying I just couldn\'t stand it. But after I finished Heartcatch Precure thanks to a fellow blogger\'s praising it up the wazoo, I later watched the first 5 episodes of Smile, but I had to put it on hold due to other real life obligations. Then I found Splash Star on TVTropes and apparently people used to outright hate...it back when it aired but now its held with higher regard. Out of curiosity and boredom after watching too much Pokemon and Sword Art Online, I decided to check it out. As of now, it is the second Pretty Cure series I have ever watched all the way through, and my second favorite, for very good reasons. This is a very good series, and it really needs to be seen by American little girls.Like the first series, it starts off with two girls who are very different from each other: the cheerful and sporty Saki Hyuuga, and the soft-spoken and artistic Mai Mishou. They actually met once when they were younger, but they separated since then, only reuniting once they enter middle school. But their reunion is quite a strange one: two fairies appear from a big tree in the neighborhood, Flappi and Choppi, claiming to be from a place called The Land of Fountains, which had been taken over by the evil organization called Dark Fall. The fairies give Saki and Mai giant cell phones which transform them into the warriors named Pretty Cure, Saki as Cure Bloom, and Mai as Cure Egret (for those wondering, the word egret is a medieval term used to describe white birds, usually herons, with long, graceful plumes during breeding season. Mai\'s powers are based on the wind and the sky, so it makes sense). Together, they have to defeat Dark Fall and restore the Land of Fountains back to its original state. But they also have to protect their own world, as Dark Fall won\'t spare it either, especially since they\'re also trying to find the elusive Fountain of the Sun, the only fountain they haven\'t destroyed or claimed yet.The animation...isn\'t really much to write home about. There is a lot of movement during the fight scenes, which is good considering the hard hitting attacks Pretty Cure is known for requires a lot of movement, but at times the characters look a bit off model, especially during later episodes. But they\'re minor, so they don\'t hurt the show entirely. One reason for this may be that Splash Star made a lot less money on its debut than the original series, probably because people were turned off by the character designs and premise looking way too similar to the original Pretty Cure series before it. No one really knows why Toei made Saki and Mai look so similar to Nagisa and Honoka of the original series, and the most common theory is that they were afraid of potential backlash from the audience that liked Nagisa and Honoka, fearing cries of ""Replacement Scrappy!"" But whatever the reason, that\'s still no reason to put off this show or dismiss it as a rip-off of the original series. Again, I haven\'t seen the first series and its sequel, Max Heart, so I can\'t properly judge it.The music, while admittedly not as good or dynamic as later seasons, still manages to be really solid. The music manages to capture the mood, atmosphere, and intents of all of its scenes really well, and nothing feels out of place, unlike some anime (Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, anyone?). I particularly liked the music that played when the Pretty Cures, in their new forms, unleash their final attacks on the monsters of the week, and I consider those pieces to be the high point of the entire OST. Also, the opening is extremely dynamic and catchy. It\'ll never leave your brain! I certainly liked it, and I don\'t see why American audiences wouldn\'t like it either.The Pretty Cure series is very reliant on character development. Some series do it well, and some...don\'t. Splash Star does it well. While Saki and Mai may look like rip-offs of Nagisa and Honoka, they\'re actually very different characters. Saki is cheerful, energetic, and friendly, but can be a little reckless and stubborn at times, Mai is sweet, soft spoken, slightly indecisive, and a little shy, but is very insightful. I personally liked seeing them interact and get along and influence each other throughout the series. Most anime tend to just give a character one trait and that\'s it. You don\'t see that in Splash Star. The main characters actually have hobbies and interests. Saki likes sports, but she also likes working in her parents\' bakery, and she even tries her hand at drawing, even though she isn\'t very good. Mai likes drawing, but is also interested in astronomy. They have interesting lives! The other characters, like their family members and classmates, also have a strong presence, and don\'t just show up for one episode and then be gone forever. They all influence the main characters\' growth in some way. I will admit though, I didn\'t like Michiru and Kaoru much. I always thought they were creepy until the very end of the series.Unfortunately, however, while the main characters are very well developed, I\'m sad to say this isn\'t the case for the villains. While I appreciate them being intimidating and having some personality, in the end they\'re still typical, cliche, generic, power hungry villains who want to destroy the world for dumb reasons. Plus I felt there were a bit too many of them. I would have liked to see them be fleshed out some more. Yes, I know, it\'s a kids show, but that\'s still no excuse to not develop your villains. Sometimes kids like interesting villains who don\'t want to destroy the world. But one thing that really makes me respect this series is how realistically it handles its character conflicts. In one episode, Kenta spills a drink on Mai\'s brother\'s book, and Saki is extremely angry at him. But both of them know it\'s an accident, actually apologize to each other right after, and try to find a way to fix it. There\'s no overblown misunderstanding, no melodrama, no shouting ""this has nothing to do with you!"", etc. God, I\'ve waited so long for a series to actually make characters understand each other\'s intentions, actually talk to each other, and be proactive in trying to solve them in the most down to earth way possible! I\'m so sick and tired of anime making characters act really stupid and refusing to talk to each other for the sake of drama and padding things out for a really long time just for the sake of spicing things up when all it does is drag it down! Thank you, Splash Star!Splash Star may not be the best series in the franchise (for me, that honor goes to Heartcatch), but it definitely has a special place in my heart. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m gonna go watch Suite, because I\'m enjoying it immensely! And seriously, why can\'t shows like this be faithfully dubbed in English for American TV?

Little girls would love this kind of stuff!', ""Now I’d read lots of praise about this Precure series, but for me it really didn't live up to it.tl;dr: Episodes without Kaoru and Michiru = average. Episodes with Kaoru and Michiru = good.I found the story was too slow paced with little happening and not interesting enough. Apart from Kaoru and Michiru of course, their part of the story was the best. Unfortunately it doesn't focus on them all of the time. Precure stories aren't the fastest pasted in anime, but this series seemed especially slow and dull compared to others. The main story itself is generic - a big bad guy with various...minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end. I feel other Precure series handled this better, especially Fresh.I also felt like there was too much filler which wasn't the most entertaining. I think how there are only two main girls lets the filler down as there is only so much you can do with 49 episodes of the same two characters all the time. The filler wasn't up to the standard of other series.The animation was pretty bad. Lots of derpy faces and poor drawings, but what can you expect.The designs themselves are awful. Again, apart from Michiru and Kaoru. I really liked Michiru's as she reminds me of Will from W.I.T.C.H.Saki and Mai character wise are a bit different from Nagisa and Honoka, but that doesn't stop them from looking like poorly done rip off fan designs. The first outfits you can put up with, Saki's second outfit however is terrible! The colour is greeny-yellow! Who thought that looked good!?Another thing I disliked was that Saki and Mai just got beat up most of the time instead of getting stronger until the last few episodes. In other series the Cures actually get evidently stronger and beat enimies faster as time goes on. Saki and Mai just get punched down until the last moment of a fight when they fire their main big finishing attack. The fight scenes lacked compared to other series, but they seemed to be stronger cures in terms of their magical powers, they just didn’t use their fists enough.The writing is very good. No main character gets more unnecessary screen time than another.The characters themselves are good. I liked all of the fairies, Saki and Mai are likable (far from my favourite Cures though). The first villan is kind of dull and I hated Moerumba he was so annoying. I liked the rest of the villains. Ms. Shitataare is the best, she was really entertaining and added in good comedy. The series itself did make me laugh quite a few times.Kaoru and Michiru however are by far the best characters, their development is wonderful and they are really interesting. I like them a lot more than Saki and Mai.I know this review seems pretty negative, but this isn't a bad show itself. I just found the other Precure series I have watched to be better. (and no I haven't seen Doki Doki!) minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end.

This season's plot is unique in it's own way,the art style fits the season for 2006, and Bloom and Egret (Saki and Mai) are characters that I really enjoyed getting to know!

Thus, Splash Star is my second dive (third, if you count Max Heart separately) in this huge sea that I still have left to explore.First of all, I’ve read some people pointing out the similarities between the OG Futari wa and Splash Star. At first sight, it may seem impossible not to look at the two Splash Star protagonists and see our old friends Nagisa and Honoka, but as the episodes progressed different dynamics can...be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor. With that said, I’ll try not to remark on any parallelism between both of them (even though I couldn’t stop doing comparisons between the two shows during my viewing lol).StoryI think the story is the most remarkable thing about Splash Star and it’s all thanks to two characters. No, not Saki and Mai, but Kaoru and Michiru. These two managed to sustain and raise what at first seemed like the typical story about legendary warriors who need to save the Earth from dark villains. I got really invested in the bonds both Kaoru and Michiru created with the protagonists, as well as their whole character arc. The pacing is great, all the villains come and go at the right moment, and maybe when it can start to get a little tiresome, Kaoru and Michiru step in and refresh the story. Lastly, I’d like to point out how the anime conveys emotions in different situations very well through drawings, making Saki and Mai characters evolve.CharactersSaki and Mai, both with their different personalities, balance each other nicely, giving some powerful and emotional moments. Regarding the side characters, I think Splash Star is capable of the best and worst. Ok, maybe not the worst, but there are a bunch of forgettable characters, like their girl friends and overall their families. Aside from Kaoru and Michiru, Kenta and Minori are the other two that I liked the most, bringing the first one a lot of funny moments and the last one extremely cute ones. The spirits or mascots were meh, I didn't particularly like or hate them. The villains were great though. I couldn’t stop laughing everytime Moerumba danced or teased Gooyaan, same with Mizu Shitatare getting mad at Saki for always saying her name wrong, and I liked how Kintoleski always made sure his opponents were fighting full strength.ArtNot gonna talk much about the art, mainly cause I don’t really know what to say. Being a coastal city, there are some nice sea visuals, plus the giant tree of life that’s inside the town. The characters designs are good, it’s nice to see the protagonists have more than one battle outfit. Also, some fights are very well done, combining action with super powers, but overall I think they all looked pretty much the same.SoundThe OP and the two EDs were energetic and catchy. The soundtrack was good as well, but, even though I said I wouldn't compare the two anime, I gotta say that there aren’t any cool insert songs like “Shining Star” or “Heart to Heart” in the OG Futari wa. Same as in Max Heart, where they repeat the instrumental version of the OP/EDs quite a lot.In conclusion, Splash Star is an enjoyable anime that’s worth recommending to anyone that loves mahou shoujo and has liked any other Precure entries. Don't be reluctant to watch this anime only because it may seem the same as the previous Futari wa, since Saki and Mai (and Kaoru and Michiru) will make sure to prove you wrong. be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor.

I strongly disagree. This cast is one of the best. Mai and Saki, at first glance, seem like Nagisa and Honoka but there are key differences. The tone of this installment is much lighter with villains more often used for comedic relief. Mai and Saki are also more optimistic and much faster friends compared to their predecessors.The side cast were also more memorable. Kenta with his comedy and his family. Hitomi and Yuuko who were similarly high energy like Saki.I also found Minori...much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun. The twist with Akudaikan and Gohyaan was out of nowhere and very interesting.Finally, Michiru and Kaoru. Their gradual redemption and their relationship with Dark Fall was so awesome to see.

Splash Star is the first of those alternate continuities, and in my opinion the best. I will try to make this review as spoiler free as possible, but still be wary. This is an updated version of the review.Right from the beginning the first thing that anyone would notice about Splash Star is that it looks similar to it\'s predecessor. The general plot outline and even the main characters look...similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively. And this is possibly a big flaw of Splash Star\'s, that it is too similar to the original at first. However it does indeed come into its own and really ends up distinguishing itself from the original, and similar doesn\'t mean the same, even with just a few episodes it\'s easy to see that while Saki and Mai have similar physical designs their personalities aren\'t really that similar to Nagisa and Honoka. And the plot has enough twists and differences from the original to really be its own. Due to spoilers I won\'t go into what makes it better and the key differences, you\'ll have to watch the show.The story is simple but because of that the series is very consistent in episode quality, and while it never tries to be a really intelligent, thought provoking anime it still has serious and important topics and themes to it that are all able to be conveyed nicely because the characters put so much emotion into them. The show is great at being serious when it wants to be, and Pretty Cure show a sense of maturity and realism when faced with their greatest foes and they need to ask themselves why they even fight in the first place, what\'s their resolve for continuing their struggles and not giving up? There are some really great lines and conversations in this series, most episodes also have sweet and well done subplots to them as well. And add to that there are some really beautiful and touching scenes in the series, I found myself on the verge of tears several times throughout the show.Splash Star features a lot more thought and effort put into it\'s writing than the original, this becomes apparent with what the monster of the weeks are created from, the elemental themes of the minions, the powers of Pretty Cure, and just the whole world of Splash Star in general. The theming of the villains and theme-naming of the Cures actually mean something and tie into the world and greater themes of Splash Star. Several of the biggest twists in the story are foreshadowed far in advance, even episode one hints at possibly the biggest twist in the series.The characters themselves are of course rather simple, Michiru and Kaoru are probably the most complex the series has to offer, but the leads are just so fun and likable and entertaining that it isn\'t as big a problem as one might suspect. The series is always more about emotion and heart, and it really gets you to care about Saki and Mai by having you be there with them throughout all their ordeals.The villains however are in all likelihood much more entertaining and funny than our heroes. Special mention goes to Kintoleski who is without a doubt one of the best things about this show.Of course though not all the villains are hilarious, both Akudaikaan and Gohyaan have moments that would make them genuinely frightening to the younger audience this series is aimed at. And Michiru and Kaoru\'s character arc and plight is anything but funny.Of course you cant talk about Pretty Cure without talking about the fights, and it\'s here where the first big difference between Splash Star and the original takes place, as Cure Bloom and Cure Egret they fight often using forcefields and blasts of energy, it gives a nice edge to the fights coming right after the original.As for actual quality of the fights while Splash Star has some of the best fights in Pretty Cure, including possibly the downright best, many fights are rather anti-climactic and can loook rather stiff and have choppy animation. This is more prevalent in the earlier arcs. Aside from the few really good fights the fighting in Splash Star seems to emphasize awesome moments over actual good fighting, for example in the second episode when the girls are learning how to control their powers they throw the monster of the week across the city and into the ocean.The actual animation quality on the whole is surprisingly pretty good for a year-round show made by Toei. The quality is consistent throughout and occasionally looks great, usually during the better and more intense fights.As for sound the music is good and very fitting, plenty of happy, relaxing, and melancholic themes when they\'re appropriate. There aren\'t too many standout singular tracks though. The opening and endings however are great. Happy and energetic, the kind that get you shaking in your seat. They\'re the perfect songs for a series like this.The voice acting is excellent, especially on the villains side. For example veteran seiyu Jurota Kosugi voices Kintoleski and it\'s no surprise that his performance is the best in the whole show.Still after all the good things about Splash Star it has some rather noticeable flaws, becuase of it\'s similarity to the original the earlier arcs are rather dull compared to later on and it really does take longer than it should for the series to set itself apart from the original. And despite the series having much tighter writing and a better thought out plot there is one plot hole that can only be filled by your imagination.But Splash Star is able to still be a super fun and enjoyable show throughout its run, even with the repetitiveness I found every episode fun and entertaining. And it has possibly the most epic and heart-pounding finale of all Pretty Cure seasons, with the villain throwing Earth-shattering attacks and Pretty Cure never backing down, it\'s on a level far above anything else in the series. And what happens after is one of the most beautiful and touching epilogues in the franchise.It\'s a kids show, Pretty Cure always will be a kids show, but it\'s also able to have serious and mature moments and topics and pull them off nicely. In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun. similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively.

This time around, let's talk about Splash Star. The third instalment of the franchise that ran from '06 to '07. How well does it hold up compared to the other instalments we've looked at? Let's take a look.Story:Young Mai is moving back to a city she used to live in. While exploring, she encounters a familiar looking girl, Saki, underneath the sky tree. The two encounter a pair of faeries, Flappy & Choppy, who remind them that they briefly encountered each other beneath that...same tree five years ago. A  brief instant that was so formative for the pair that it apparently caused their fates to intertwine because PreCure has never been subtle with its massive amounts of subtext. The two are confronted by a leafy looking menace who demands that the faeries disclose the location of the fountain of the Sun. Saki and Mai go to their defence, transforming into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret. Together, they set off on a mission to revive the holy fountains.Honestly, there aren't any major problems with the series. About the worst you can say about it is that it's very much a magical girl series with all the optimism, enemies of the week, transformation sequences and such that are prevalent in the genre. And there's nothing inherently wrong with a work in a genre being very much grounded in that genre. Especially when it's something like this with a young target audience.Splash Star has a lot of aspects that are kind of similar to Futari wa but that are also distinct. Both series feature an athletic girl and one who is into more intellectual pursuits. The characters even look a bit similar. But they're involved in different things and have different issues related to those interests. Both series have a generic male love interest who's barely acknowledged because every time he shows up for a moment with the girl who has a crush on him it's used to transition into a bigger moment for her with the other PreCure but Splash Star makes use of that a lot less and has different kinds of moments betwixt the girls as a result. In both of them, the athletic girl has a younger sibling. But the relationship dynamic that Nagisa had with her brother was a lot different from the one Saki has with her sister.I do like the pacing in Splash Star. It does a really good job of introducing a variety of major villains, giving them some time to be menaces and then bringing the next one in before you can get tired of the current one. Splash Star also features a superb redemption story with some surprisingly tragic moments within it. Darn it, PreCure writers, stop making me feel things. I'm supposed to be a cynical git. A cynical git who hates everything. Or so I've been told. There are some strong moments of tension in the series as well. They really make you curious about how Saki & Mai are going to resolve things. Although you know they will because it's PreCure. The climax is really well done too. The series is just generally fun, cute and endearing.Characters:There are some strong characters in Splash Star. Saki and Mai are great.  Their families are a lot of fun. Michiru and Kaoru are great. The supporting cast has a lot of fun, colourful characters within it. In terms of antagonists, most of them are pretty standard. The big exception is Alex Louis Kintoleski. There  is something utterly delightful about him and his techniques that have been passed down the Kintoleski line for generations. Shitataare  and DoroDoron are kind of fun at times. The worst character, by far, is Moerumaba. He comes across as a strange blend of gay and Latin stereotypes. The faeries aren't particularly compelling, but they're decent enough.Art:There's a lot of praiseworthy aspects to the artwork. The backgrounds are nicely detailed with some very nicely done scenery. The action sequences can be absolutely amazing. I do love the way this franchise incorporates really physical brawling into its action sequences along with the special magic attacks and Splash Star is no exception to that. It does suffer from the same issue with the stock footage attacks that Futari wa did. Namely, that there are very few and they start to get dull after a while. This was before they'd learned to vary them a bit more, clearly. There are some really interesting villain designs. I can't stand Moerumba's and Alex Louis Kintoleski may be the best villain, but his design is kind of boring. He's just a golden muscle man. Those two aside, great villain designs. I do like the PreCure designs too. I like that Saki & Mai have multiple Cure forms and I like their outfits. The monster designs continue to be very creative and interesting. Which is another thing the franchise has been consistently good at.Sound:The best performances come from Kimoto Orie, Enomoto Atsuko, Fuchizaki Yuriko & Imai Yuka. There are plenty of other good performances as well. Sato Naoki is back for the soundtrack work and he does a really nice job.Ho-yay:Saki and Mai may be marginally more homo-erotic than Nagisa and Honoka were. They're heavily inspired by one another. They gain strength when their hearts come together as one. They talk about their fated meeting. They have a date where they actually feed one another home made bento. They talk about how energised they feel when they hold hands. I can only imagine how much that's going to increase when they get older and start snogging. In any case, their dynamic is adorable.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Splash Star. If you're a fan of the whole magical girl aesthetic, it's for you. You will almost certainly garner enjoyment from watching it. If you aren't a fan of the genre, it's not going to change your mind. For myself, I pretty thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the characters. I give it a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Wolf Guy. same tree five years ago.

I did see the first episode of the first series, Futari wa Pretty Cure way long ago, but I never went beyond it, partly because of other things, and partly because one mascot\'s voice was so grating and annoying I just couldn\'t stand it. But after I finished Heartcatch Precure thanks to a fellow blogger\'s praising it up the wazoo, I later watched the first 5 episodes of Smile, but I had to put it on hold due to other real life obligations. Then I found Splash Star on TVTropes and apparently people used to outright hate...it back when it aired but now its held with higher regard. Out of curiosity and boredom after watching too much Pokemon and Sword Art Online, I decided to check it out. As of now, it is the second Pretty Cure series I have ever watched all the way through, and my second favorite, for very good reasons. This is a very good series, and it really needs to be seen by American little girls.Like the first series, it starts off with two girls who are very different from each other: the cheerful and sporty Saki Hyuuga, and the soft-spoken and artistic Mai Mishou. They actually met once when they were younger, but they separated since then, only reuniting once they enter middle school. But their reunion is quite a strange one: two fairies appear from a big tree in the neighborhood, Flappi and Choppi, claiming to be from a place called The Land of Fountains, which had been taken over by the evil organization called Dark Fall. The fairies give Saki and Mai giant cell phones which transform them into the warriors named Pretty Cure, Saki as Cure Bloom, and Mai as Cure Egret (for those wondering, the word egret is a medieval term used to describe white birds, usually herons, with long, graceful plumes during breeding season. Mai\'s powers are based on the wind and the sky, so it makes sense). Together, they have to defeat Dark Fall and restore the Land of Fountains back to its original state. But they also have to protect their own world, as Dark Fall won\'t spare it either, especially since they\'re also trying to find the elusive Fountain of the Sun, the only fountain they haven\'t destroyed or claimed yet.The animation...isn\'t really much to write home about. There is a lot of movement during the fight scenes, which is good considering the hard hitting attacks Pretty Cure is known for requires a lot of movement, but at times the characters look a bit off model, especially during later episodes. But they\'re minor, so they don\'t hurt the show entirely. One reason for this may be that Splash Star made a lot less money on its debut than the original series, probably because people were turned off by the character designs and premise looking way too similar to the original Pretty Cure series before it. No one really knows why Toei made Saki and Mai look so similar to Nagisa and Honoka of the original series, and the most common theory is that they were afraid of potential backlash from the audience that liked Nagisa and Honoka, fearing cries of ""Replacement Scrappy!"" But whatever the reason, that\'s still no reason to put off this show or dismiss it as a rip-off of the original series. Again, I haven\'t seen the first series and its sequel, Max Heart, so I can\'t properly judge it.The music, while admittedly not as good or dynamic as later seasons, still manages to be really solid. The music manages to capture the mood, atmosphere, and intents of all of its scenes really well, and nothing feels out of place, unlike some anime (Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, anyone?). I particularly liked the music that played when the Pretty Cures, in their new forms, unleash their final attacks on the monsters of the week, and I consider those pieces to be the high point of the entire OST. Also, the opening is extremely dynamic and catchy. It\'ll never leave your brain! I certainly liked it, and I don\'t see why American audiences wouldn\'t like it either.The Pretty Cure series is very reliant on character development. Some series do it well, and some...don\'t. Splash Star does it well. While Saki and Mai may look like rip-offs of Nagisa and Honoka, they\'re actually very different characters. Saki is cheerful, energetic, and friendly, but can be a little reckless and stubborn at times, Mai is sweet, soft spoken, slightly indecisive, and a little shy, but is very insightful. I personally liked seeing them interact and get along and influence each other throughout the series. Most anime tend to just give a character one trait and that\'s it. You don\'t see that in Splash Star. The main characters actually have hobbies and interests. Saki likes sports, but she also likes working in her parents\' bakery, and she even tries her hand at drawing, even though she isn\'t very good. Mai likes drawing, but is also interested in astronomy. They have interesting lives! The other characters, like their family members and classmates, also have a strong presence, and don\'t just show up for one episode and then be gone forever. They all influence the main characters\' growth in some way. I will admit though, I didn\'t like Michiru and Kaoru much. I always thought they were creepy until the very end of the series.Unfortunately, however, while the main characters are very well developed, I\'m sad to say this isn\'t the case for the villains. While I appreciate them being intimidating and having some personality, in the end they\'re still typical, cliche, generic, power hungry villains who want to destroy the world for dumb reasons. Plus I felt there were a bit too many of them. I would have liked to see them be fleshed out some more. Yes, I know, it\'s a kids show, but that\'s still no excuse to not develop your villains. Sometimes kids like interesting villains who don\'t want to destroy the world. But one thing that really makes me respect this series is how realistically it handles its character conflicts. In one episode, Kenta spills a drink on Mai\'s brother\'s book, and Saki is extremely angry at him. But both of them know it\'s an accident, actually apologize to each other right after, and try to find a way to fix it. There\'s no overblown misunderstanding, no melodrama, no shouting ""this has nothing to do with you!"", etc. God, I\'ve waited so long for a series to actually make characters understand each other\'s intentions, actually talk to each other, and be proactive in trying to solve them in the most down to earth way possible! I\'m so sick and tired of anime making characters act really stupid and refusing to talk to each other for the sake of drama and padding things out for a really long time just for the sake of spicing things up when all it does is drag it down! Thank you, Splash Star!Splash Star may not be the best series in the franchise (for me, that honor goes to Heartcatch), but it definitely has a special place in my heart. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m gonna go watch Suite, because I\'m enjoying it immensely! And seriously, why can\'t shows like this be faithfully dubbed in English for American TV? Little girls would love this kind of stuff! it back when it aired but now its held with higher regard.

I\'m so sick and tired of anime making characters act really stupid and refusing to talk to each other for the sake of drama and padding things out for a really long time just for the sake of spicing things up when all it does is drag it down! Thank you, Splash Star!Splash Star may not be the best series in the franchise (for me, that honor goes to Heartcatch), but it definitely has a special place in my heart. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m gonna go watch Suite, because I\'m enjoying it immensely! And seriously, why can\'t shows like this be faithfully dubbed in English for American TV? Little girls would love this kind of stuff!', ""Now I’d read lots of praise about this Precure series, but for me it really didn't live up to it.tl;dr: Episodes without Kaoru and Michiru = average. Episodes with Kaoru and Michiru = good.I found the story was too slow paced with little happening and not interesting enough. Apart from Kaoru and Michiru of course, their part of the story was the best. Unfortunately it doesn't focus on them all of the time. Precure stories aren't the fastest pasted in anime, but this series seemed especially slow and dull compared to others. The main story itself is generic - a big bad guy with various...minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end. I feel other Precure series handled this better, especially Fresh.I also felt like there was too much filler which wasn't the most entertaining. I think how there are only two main girls lets the filler down as there is only so much you can do with 49 episodes of the same two characters all the time. The filler wasn't up to the standard of other series.The animation was pretty bad. Lots of derpy faces and poor drawings, but what can you expect.The designs themselves are awful. Again, apart from Michiru and Kaoru. I really liked Michiru's as she reminds me of Will from W.I.T.C.H.Saki and Mai character wise are a bit different from Nagisa and Honoka, but that doesn't stop them from looking like poorly done rip off fan designs. The first outfits you can put up with, Saki's second outfit however is terrible! The colour is greeny-yellow! Who thought that looked good!?Another thing I disliked was that Saki and Mai just got beat up most of the time instead of getting stronger until the last few episodes. In other series the Cures actually get evidently stronger and beat enimies faster as time goes on. Saki and Mai just get punched down until the last moment of a fight when they fire their main big finishing attack. The fight scenes lacked compared to other series, but they seemed to be stronger cures in terms of their magical powers, they just didn’t use their fists enough.The writing is very good. No main character gets more unnecessary screen time than another.The characters themselves are good. I liked all of the fairies, Saki and Mai are likable (far from my favourite Cures though). The first villan is kind of dull and I hated Moerumba he was so annoying. I liked the rest of the villains. Ms. Shitataare is the best, she was really entertaining and added in good comedy. The series itself did make me laugh quite a few times.Kaoru and Michiru however are by far the best characters, their development is wonderful and they are really interesting. I like them a lot more than Saki and Mai.I know this review seems pretty negative, but this isn't a bad show itself. I just found the other Precure series I have watched to be better.

This season's plot is unique in it's own way,the art style fits the season for 2006, and Bloom and Egret (Saki and Mai) are characters that I really enjoyed getting to know! Now, I do need to say that there are a few stale episodes at the beginning, so be advised of that. I recommend this show to any Precure fan!

Thus, Splash Star is my second dive (third, if you count Max Heart separately) in this huge sea that I still have left to explore.First of all, I’ve read some people pointing out the similarities between the OG Futari wa and Splash Star. At first sight, it may seem impossible not to look at the two Splash Star protagonists and see our old friends Nagisa and Honoka, but as the episodes progressed different dynamics can...be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor. With that said, I’ll try not to remark on any parallelism between both of them (even though I couldn’t stop doing comparisons between the two shows during my viewing lol).StoryI think the story is the most remarkable thing about Splash Star and it’s all thanks to two characters. No, not Saki and Mai, but Kaoru and Michiru. These two managed to sustain and raise what at first seemed like the typical story about legendary warriors who need to save the Earth from dark villains. I got really invested in the bonds both Kaoru and Michiru created with the protagonists, as well as their whole character arc. The pacing is great, all the villains come and go at the right moment, and maybe when it can start to get a little tiresome, Kaoru and Michiru step in and refresh the story. Lastly, I’d like to point out how the anime conveys emotions in different situations very well through drawings, making Saki and Mai characters evolve.CharactersSaki and Mai, both with their different personalities, balance each other nicely, giving some powerful and emotional moments. Regarding the side characters, I think Splash Star is capable of the best and worst. Ok, maybe not the worst, but there are a bunch of forgettable characters, like their girl friends and overall their families. Aside from Kaoru and Michiru, Kenta and Minori are the other two that I liked the most, bringing the first one a lot of funny moments and the last one extremely cute ones. The spirits or mascots were meh, I didn't particularly like or hate them. The villains were great though. I couldn’t stop laughing everytime Moerumba danced or teased Gooyaan, same with Mizu Shitatare getting mad at Saki for always saying her name wrong, and I liked how Kintoleski always made sure his opponents were fighting full strength.ArtNot gonna talk much about the art, mainly cause I don’t really know what to say. Being a coastal city, there are some nice sea visuals, plus the giant tree of life that’s inside the town. The characters designs are good, it’s nice to see the protagonists have more than one battle outfit. Also, some fights are very well done, combining action with super powers, but overall I think they all looked pretty much the same.SoundThe OP and the two EDs were energetic and catchy. The soundtrack was good as well, but, even though I said I wouldn't compare the two anime, I gotta say that there aren’t any cool insert songs like “Shining Star” or “Heart to Heart” in the OG Futari wa. Same as in Max Heart, where they repeat the instrumental version of the OP/EDs quite a lot.In conclusion, Splash Star is an enjoyable anime that’s worth recommending to anyone that loves mahou shoujo and has liked any other Precure entries. Don't be reluctant to watch this anime only because it may seem the same as the previous Futari wa, since Saki and Mai (and Kaoru and Michiru) will make sure to prove you wrong. be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor.

I strongly disagree. This cast is one of the best. Mai and Saki, at first glance, seem like Nagisa and Honoka but there are key differences. The tone of this installment is much lighter with villains more often used for comedic relief. Mai and Saki are also more optimistic and much faster friends compared to their predecessors.The side cast were also more memorable. Kenta with his comedy and his family. Hitomi and Yuuko who were similarly high energy like Saki.I also found Minori...much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun. The twist with Akudaikan and Gohyaan was out of nowhere and very interesting.Finally, Michiru and Kaoru. Their gradual redemption and their relationship with Dark Fall was so awesome to see. Their characters had so much depth. much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun.

Their characters had so much depth.', '""The shining golden flower, Cure Bloom!""""The sparkling silver wing, Cure Egret!""""We are Pretty Cure!""Pretty Cure has become a monster of a franchise with multiple different seasons and continuities, and that\'s not even counting the movies. Splash Star is the first of those alternate continuities, and in my opinion the best. I will try to make this review as spoiler free as possible, but still be wary. This is an updated version of the review.Right from the beginning the first thing that anyone would notice about Splash Star is that it looks similar to it\'s predecessor. The general plot outline and even the main characters look...similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively. And this is possibly a big flaw of Splash Star\'s, that it is too similar to the original at first. However it does indeed come into its own and really ends up distinguishing itself from the original, and similar doesn\'t mean the same, even with just a few episodes it\'s easy to see that while Saki and Mai have similar physical designs their personalities aren\'t really that similar to Nagisa and Honoka. And the plot has enough twists and differences from the original to really be its own. Due to spoilers I won\'t go into what makes it better and the key differences, you\'ll have to watch the show.The story is simple but because of that the series is very consistent in episode quality, and while it never tries to be a really intelligent, thought provoking anime it still has serious and important topics and themes to it that are all able to be conveyed nicely because the characters put so much emotion into them. The show is great at being serious when it wants to be, and Pretty Cure show a sense of maturity and realism when faced with their greatest foes and they need to ask themselves why they even fight in the first place, what\'s their resolve for continuing their struggles and not giving up? There are some really great lines and conversations in this series, most episodes also have sweet and well done subplots to them as well. And add to that there are some really beautiful and touching scenes in the series, I found myself on the verge of tears several times throughout the show.Splash Star features a lot more thought and effort put into it\'s writing than the original, this becomes apparent with what the monster of the weeks are created from, the elemental themes of the minions, the powers of Pretty Cure, and just the whole world of Splash Star in general. The theming of the villains and theme-naming of the Cures actually mean something and tie into the world and greater themes of Splash Star. Several of the biggest twists in the story are foreshadowed far in advance, even episode one hints at possibly the biggest twist in the series.The characters themselves are of course rather simple, Michiru and Kaoru are probably the most complex the series has to offer, but the leads are just so fun and likable and entertaining that it isn\'t as big a problem as one might suspect. The series is always more about emotion and heart, and it really gets you to care about Saki and Mai by having you be there with them throughout all their ordeals.The villains however are in all likelihood much more entertaining and funny than our heroes. Special mention goes to Kintoleski who is without a doubt one of the best things about this show.Of course though not all the villains are hilarious, both Akudaikaan and Gohyaan have moments that would make them genuinely frightening to the younger audience this series is aimed at. And Michiru and Kaoru\'s character arc and plight is anything but funny.Of course you cant talk about Pretty Cure without talking about the fights, and it\'s here where the first big difference between Splash Star and the original takes place, as Cure Bloom and Cure Egret they fight often using forcefields and blasts of energy, it gives a nice edge to the fights coming right after the original.As for actual quality of the fights while Splash Star has some of the best fights in Pretty Cure, including possibly the downright best, many fights are rather anti-climactic and can loook rather stiff and have choppy animation. This is more prevalent in the earlier arcs. Aside from the few really good fights the fighting in Splash Star seems to emphasize awesome moments over actual good fighting, for example in the second episode when the girls are learning how to control their powers they throw the monster of the week across the city and into the ocean.The actual animation quality on the whole is surprisingly pretty good for a year-round show made by Toei. The quality is consistent throughout and occasionally looks great, usually during the better and more intense fights.As for sound the music is good and very fitting, plenty of happy, relaxing, and melancholic themes when they\'re appropriate. There aren\'t too many standout singular tracks though. The opening and endings however are great. Happy and energetic, the kind that get you shaking in your seat. They\'re the perfect songs for a series like this.The voice acting is excellent, especially on the villains side. For example veteran seiyu Jurota Kosugi voices Kintoleski and it\'s no surprise that his performance is the best in the whole show.Still after all the good things about Splash Star it has some rather noticeable flaws, becuase of it\'s similarity to the original the earlier arcs are rather dull compared to later on and it really does take longer than it should for the series to set itself apart from the original. And despite the series having much tighter writing and a better thought out plot there is one plot hole that can only be filled by your imagination.But Splash Star is able to still be a super fun and enjoyable show throughout its run, even with the repetitiveness I found every episode fun and entertaining. And it has possibly the most epic and heart-pounding finale of all Pretty Cure seasons, with the villain throwing Earth-shattering attacks and Pretty Cure never backing down, it\'s on a level far above anything else in the series. And what happens after is one of the most beautiful and touching epilogues in the franchise.It\'s a kids show, Pretty Cure always will be a kids show, but it\'s also able to have serious and mature moments and topics and pull them off nicely. In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun. similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively.

In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun.', ""Let's take another look at Toei's PreCure franchise. So far, I've looked at Futari wa, Max Heart & Doki Doki. This time around, let's talk about Splash Star. The third instalment of the franchise that ran from '06 to '07. How well does it hold up compared to the other instalments we've looked at? Let's take a look.Story:Young Mai is moving back to a city she used to live in. While exploring, she encounters a familiar looking girl, Saki, underneath the sky tree. The two encounter a pair of faeries, Flappy & Choppy, who remind them that they briefly encountered each other beneath that...same tree five years ago. A  brief instant that was so formative for the pair that it apparently caused their fates to intertwine because PreCure has never been subtle with its massive amounts of subtext. The two are confronted by a leafy looking menace who demands that the faeries disclose the location of the fountain of the Sun. Saki and Mai go to their defence, transforming into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret. Together, they set off on a mission to revive the holy fountains.Honestly, there aren't any major problems with the series. About the worst you can say about it is that it's very much a magical girl series with all the optimism, enemies of the week, transformation sequences and such that are prevalent in the genre. And there's nothing inherently wrong with a work in a genre being very much grounded in that genre. Especially when it's something like this with a young target audience.Splash Star has a lot of aspects that are kind of similar to Futari wa but that are also distinct. Both series feature an athletic girl and one who is into more intellectual pursuits. The characters even look a bit similar. But they're involved in different things and have different issues related to those interests. Both series have a generic male love interest who's barely acknowledged because every time he shows up for a moment with the girl who has a crush on him it's used to transition into a bigger moment for her with the other PreCure but Splash Star makes use of that a lot less and has different kinds of moments betwixt the girls as a result. In both of them, the athletic girl has a younger sibling. But the relationship dynamic that Nagisa had with her brother was a lot different from the one Saki has with her sister.I do like the pacing in Splash Star. It does a really good job of introducing a variety of major villains, giving them some time to be menaces and then bringing the next one in before you can get tired of the current one. Splash Star also features a superb redemption story with some surprisingly tragic moments within it. Darn it, PreCure writers, stop making me feel things. I'm supposed to be a cynical git. A cynical git who hates everything. Or so I've been told. There are some strong moments of tension in the series as well. They really make you curious about how Saki & Mai are going to resolve things. Although you know they will because it's PreCure. The climax is really well done too. The series is just generally fun, cute and endearing.Characters:There are some strong characters in Splash Star. Saki and Mai are great.  Their families are a lot of fun. Michiru and Kaoru are great. The supporting cast has a lot of fun, colourful characters within it. In terms of antagonists, most of them are pretty standard. The big exception is Alex Louis Kintoleski. There  is something utterly delightful about him and his techniques that have been passed down the Kintoleski line for generations. Shitataare  and DoroDoron are kind of fun at times. The worst character, by far, is Moerumaba. He comes across as a strange blend of gay and Latin stereotypes. The faeries aren't particularly compelling, but they're decent enough.Art:There's a lot of praiseworthy aspects to the artwork. The backgrounds are nicely detailed with some very nicely done scenery. The action sequences can be absolutely amazing. I do love the way this franchise incorporates really physical brawling into its action sequences along with the special magic attacks and Splash Star is no exception to that. It does suffer from the same issue with the stock footage attacks that Futari wa did. Namely, that there are very few and they start to get dull after a while. This was before they'd learned to vary them a bit more, clearly. There are some really interesting villain designs. I can't stand Moerumba's and Alex Louis Kintoleski may be the best villain, but his design is kind of boring. He's just a golden muscle man. Those two aside, great villain designs. I do like the PreCure designs too. I like that Saki & Mai have multiple Cure forms and I like their outfits. The monster designs continue to be very creative and interesting. Which is another thing the franchise has been consistently good at.Sound:The best performances come from Kimoto Orie, Enomoto Atsuko, Fuchizaki Yuriko & Imai Yuka. There are plenty of other good performances as well. Sato Naoki is back for the soundtrack work and he does a really nice job.Ho-yay:Saki and Mai may be marginally more homo-erotic than Nagisa and Honoka were. They're heavily inspired by one another. They gain strength when their hearts come together as one. They talk about their fated meeting. They have a date where they actually feed one another home made bento. They talk about how energised they feel when they hold hands. I can only imagine how much that's going to increase when they get older and start snogging. In any case, their dynamic is adorable.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Splash Star. If you're a fan of the whole magical girl aesthetic, it's for you. You will almost certainly garner enjoyment from watching it. If you aren't a fan of the genre, it's not going to change your mind. For myself, I pretty thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the characters. I give it a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Wolf Guy. same tree five years ago. A  brief instant that was so formative for the pair that it apparently caused their fates to intertwine because PreCure has never been subtle with its massive amounts of subtext. The two are confronted by a leafy looking menace who demands that the faeries disclose the location of the fountain of the Sun. Saki and Mai go to their defence, transforming into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret. Together, they set off on a mission to revive the holy fountains.Honestly, there aren't any major problems with the series. About the worst you can say about it is that it's very much a magical girl series with all the optimism, enemies of the week, transformation sequences and such that are prevalent in the genre. And there's nothing inherently wrong with a work in a genre being very much grounded in that genre. Especially when it's something like this with a young target audience.Splash Star has a lot of aspects that are kind of similar to Futari wa but that are also distinct. Both series feature an athletic girl and one who is into more intellectual pursuits. The characters even look a bit similar. But they're involved in different things and have different issues related to those interests. Both series have a generic male love interest who's barely acknowledged because every time he shows up for a moment with the girl who has a crush on him it's used to transition into a bigger moment for her with the other PreCure but Splash Star makes use of that a lot less and has different kinds of moments betwixt the girls as a result. In both of them, the athletic girl has a younger sibling. But the relationship dynamic that Nagisa had with her brother was a lot different from the one Saki has with her sister.I do like the pacing in Splash Star. It does a really good job of introducing a variety of major villains, giving them some time to be menaces and then bringing the next one in before you can get tired of the current one. Splash Star also features a superb redemption story with some surprisingly tragic moments within it. Darn it, PreCure writers, stop making me feel things. I'm supposed to be a cynical git. A cynical git who hates everything. Or so I've been told. There are some strong moments of tension in the series as well. They really make you curious about how Saki & Mai are going to resolve things. Although you know they will because it's PreCure. The climax is really well done too. The series is just generally fun, cute and endearing.Characters:There are some strong characters in Splash Star. Saki and Mai are great.  Their families are a lot of fun. Michiru and Kaoru are great. The supporting cast has a lot of fun, colourful characters within it. In terms of antagonists, most of them are pretty standard. The big exception is Alex Louis Kintoleski. There  is something utterly delightful about him and his techniques that have been passed down the Kintoleski line for generations. Shitataare  and DoroDoron are kind of fun at times. The worst character, by far, is Moerumaba. He comes across as a strange blend of gay and Latin stereotypes. The faeries aren't particularly compelling, but they're decent enough.Art:There's a lot of praiseworthy aspects to the artwork. The backgrounds are nicely detailed with some very nicely done scenery. The action sequences can be absolutely amazing. I do love the way this franchise incorporates really physical brawling into its action sequences along with the special magic attacks and Splash Star is no exception to that. It does suffer from the same issue with the stock footage attacks that Futari wa did. Namely, that there are very few and they start to get dull after a while. This was before they'd learned to vary them a bit more, clearly. There are some really interesting villain designs.

I did see the first episode of the first series, Futari wa Pretty Cure way long ago, but I never went beyond it, partly because of other things, and partly because one mascot\'s voice was so grating and annoying I just couldn\'t stand it. But after I finished Heartcatch Precure thanks to a fellow blogger\'s praising it up the wazoo, I later watched the first 5 episodes of Smile, but I had to put it on hold due to other real life obligations. Then I found Splash Star on TVTropes and apparently people used to outright hate...it back when it aired but now its held with higher regard. Out of curiosity and boredom after watching too much Pokemon and Sword Art Online, I decided to check it out. As of now, it is the second Pretty Cure series I have ever watched all the way through, and my second favorite, for very good reasons. This is a very good series, and it really needs to be seen by American little girls.Like the first series, it starts off with two girls who are very different from each other: the cheerful and sporty Saki Hyuuga, and the soft-spoken and artistic Mai Mishou. They actually met once when they were younger, but they separated since then, only reuniting once they enter middle school. But their reunion is quite a strange one: two fairies appear from a big tree in the neighborhood, Flappi and Choppi, claiming to be from a place called The Land of Fountains, which had been taken over by the evil organization called Dark Fall. The fairies give Saki and Mai giant cell phones which transform them into the warriors named Pretty Cure, Saki as Cure Bloom, and Mai as Cure Egret (for those wondering, the word egret is a medieval term used to describe white birds, usually herons, with long, graceful plumes during breeding season. Mai\'s powers are based on the wind and the sky, so it makes sense). Together, they have to defeat Dark Fall and restore the Land of Fountains back to its original state. But they also have to protect their own world, as Dark Fall won\'t spare it either, especially since they\'re also trying to find the elusive Fountain of the Sun, the only fountain they haven\'t destroyed or claimed yet.The animation...isn\'t really much to write home about. There is a lot of movement during the fight scenes, which is good considering the hard hitting attacks Pretty Cure is known for requires a lot of movement, but at times the characters look a bit off model, especially during later episodes. But they\'re minor, so they don\'t hurt the show entirely. One reason for this may be that Splash Star made a lot less money on its debut than the original series, probably because people were turned off by the character designs and premise looking way too similar to the original Pretty Cure series before it. No one really knows why Toei made Saki and Mai look so similar to Nagisa and Honoka of the original series, and the most common theory is that they were afraid of potential backlash from the audience that liked Nagisa and Honoka, fearing cries of ""Replacement Scrappy!"" But whatever the reason, that\'s still no reason to put off this show or dismiss it as a rip-off of the original series. Again, I haven\'t seen the first series and its sequel, Max Heart, so I can\'t properly judge it.The music, while admittedly not as good or dynamic as later seasons, still manages to be really solid. The music manages to capture the mood, atmosphere, and intents of all of its scenes really well, and nothing feels out of place, unlike some anime (Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, anyone?). I particularly liked the music that played when the Pretty Cures, in their new forms, unleash their final attacks on the monsters of the week, and I consider those pieces to be the high point of the entire OST. Also, the opening is extremely dynamic and catchy. It\'ll never leave your brain! I certainly liked it, and I don\'t see why American audiences wouldn\'t like it either.The Pretty Cure series is very reliant on character development. Some series do it well, and some...don\'t. Splash Star does it well. While Saki and Mai may look like rip-offs of Nagisa and Honoka, they\'re actually very different characters. Saki is cheerful, energetic, and friendly, but can be a little reckless and stubborn at times, Mai is sweet, soft spoken, slightly indecisive, and a little shy, but is very insightful. I personally liked seeing them interact and get along and influence each other throughout the series. Most anime tend to just give a character one trait and that\'s it. You don\'t see that in Splash Star. The main characters actually have hobbies and interests. Saki likes sports, but she also likes working in her parents\' bakery, and she even tries her hand at drawing, even though she isn\'t very good. Mai likes drawing, but is also interested in astronomy. They have interesting lives! The other characters, like their family members and classmates, also have a strong presence, and don\'t just show up for one episode and then be gone forever. They all influence the main characters\' growth in some way. I will admit though, I didn\'t like Michiru and Kaoru much. I always thought they were creepy until the very end of the series.Unfortunately, however, while the main characters are very well developed, I\'m sad to say this isn\'t the case for the villains. While I appreciate them being intimidating and having some personality, in the end they\'re still typical, cliche, generic, power hungry villains who want to destroy the world for dumb reasons. Plus I felt there were a bit too many of them. I would have liked to see them be fleshed out some more. Yes, I know, it\'s a kids show, but that\'s still no excuse to not develop your villains. Sometimes kids like interesting villains who don\'t want to destroy the world. But one thing that really makes me respect this series is how realistically it handles its character conflicts. In one episode, Kenta spills a drink on Mai\'s brother\'s book, and Saki is extremely angry at him. But both of them know it\'s an accident, actually apologize to each other right after, and try to find a way to fix it. There\'s no overblown misunderstanding, no melodrama, no shouting ""this has nothing to do with you!"", etc. God, I\'ve waited so long for a series to actually make characters understand each other\'s intentions, actually talk to each other, and be proactive in trying to solve them in the most down to earth way possible! I\'m so sick and tired of anime making characters act really stupid and refusing to talk to each other for the sake of drama and padding things out for a really long time just for the sake of spicing things up when all it does is drag it down! Thank you, Splash Star!Splash Star may not be the best series in the franchise (for me, that honor goes to Heartcatch), but it definitely has a special place in my heart. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m gonna go watch Suite, because I\'m enjoying it immensely! And seriously, why can\'t shows like this be faithfully dubbed in English for American TV?

Little girls would love this kind of stuff!', ""Now I’d read lots of praise about this Precure series, but for me it really didn't live up to it.tl;dr: Episodes without Kaoru and Michiru = average. Episodes with Kaoru and Michiru = good.I found the story was too slow paced with little happening and not interesting enough. Apart from Kaoru and Michiru of course, their part of the story was the best. Unfortunately it doesn't focus on them all of the time. Precure stories aren't the fastest pasted in anime, but this series seemed especially slow and dull compared to others. The main story itself is generic - a big bad guy with various...minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end. I feel other Precure series handled this better, especially Fresh.I also felt like there was too much filler which wasn't the most entertaining. I think how there are only two main girls lets the filler down as there is only so much you can do with 49 episodes of the same two characters all the time. The filler wasn't up to the standard of other series.The animation was pretty bad. Lots of derpy faces and poor drawings, but what can you expect.The designs themselves are awful. Again, apart from Michiru and Kaoru. I really liked Michiru's as she reminds me of Will from W.I.T.C.H.Saki and Mai character wise are a bit different from Nagisa and Honoka, but that doesn't stop them from looking like poorly done rip off fan designs. The first outfits you can put up with, Saki's second outfit however is terrible! The colour is greeny-yellow! Who thought that looked good!?Another thing I disliked was that Saki and Mai just got beat up most of the time instead of getting stronger until the last few episodes. In other series the Cures actually get evidently stronger and beat enimies faster as time goes on. Saki and Mai just get punched down until the last moment of a fight when they fire their main big finishing attack. The fight scenes lacked compared to other series, but they seemed to be stronger cures in terms of their magical powers, they just didn’t use their fists enough.The writing is very good. No main character gets more unnecessary screen time than another.The characters themselves are good. I liked all of the fairies, Saki and Mai are likable (far from my favourite Cures though). The first villan is kind of dull and I hated Moerumba he was so annoying. I liked the rest of the villains. Ms. Shitataare is the best, she was really entertaining and added in good comedy. The series itself did make me laugh quite a few times.Kaoru and Michiru however are by far the best characters, their development is wonderful and they are really interesting. I like them a lot more than Saki and Mai.I know this review seems pretty negative, but this isn't a bad show itself. I just found the other Precure series I have watched to be better. (and no I haven't seen Doki Doki!) minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end.

Thus, Splash Star is my second dive (third, if you count Max Heart separately) in this huge sea that I still have left to explore.First of all, I’ve read some people pointing out the similarities between the OG Futari wa and Splash Star. At first sight, it may seem impossible not to look at the two Splash Star protagonists and see our old friends Nagisa and Honoka, but as the episodes progressed different dynamics can...be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor. With that said, I’ll try not to remark on any parallelism between both of them (even though I couldn’t stop doing comparisons between the two shows during my viewing lol).StoryI think the story is the most remarkable thing about Splash Star and it’s all thanks to two characters. No, not Saki and Mai, but Kaoru and Michiru. These two managed to sustain and raise what at first seemed like the typical story about legendary warriors who need to save the Earth from dark villains. I got really invested in the bonds both Kaoru and Michiru created with the protagonists, as well as their whole character arc. The pacing is great, all the villains come and go at the right moment, and maybe when it can start to get a little tiresome, Kaoru and Michiru step in and refresh the story. Lastly, I’d like to point out how the anime conveys emotions in different situations very well through drawings, making Saki and Mai characters evolve.CharactersSaki and Mai, both with their different personalities, balance each other nicely, giving some powerful and emotional moments. Regarding the side characters, I think Splash Star is capable of the best and worst. Ok, maybe not the worst, but there are a bunch of forgettable characters, like their girl friends and overall their families. Aside from Kaoru and Michiru, Kenta and Minori are the other two that I liked the most, bringing the first one a lot of funny moments and the last one extremely cute ones. The spirits or mascots were meh, I didn't particularly like or hate them. The villains were great though. I couldn’t stop laughing everytime Moerumba danced or teased Gooyaan, same with Mizu Shitatare getting mad at Saki for always saying her name wrong, and I liked how Kintoleski always made sure his opponents were fighting full strength.ArtNot gonna talk much about the art, mainly cause I don’t really know what to say. Being a coastal city, there are some nice sea visuals, plus the giant tree of life that’s inside the town. The characters designs are good, it’s nice to see the protagonists have more than one battle outfit. Also, some fights are very well done, combining action with super powers, but overall I think they all looked pretty much the same.SoundThe OP and the two EDs were energetic and catchy. The soundtrack was good as well, but, even though I said I wouldn't compare the two anime, I gotta say that there aren’t any cool insert songs like “Shining Star” or “Heart to Heart” in the OG Futari wa. Same as in Max Heart, where they repeat the instrumental version of the OP/EDs quite a lot.In conclusion, Splash Star is an enjoyable anime that’s worth recommending to anyone that loves mahou shoujo and has liked any other Precure entries. Don't be reluctant to watch this anime only because it may seem the same as the previous Futari wa, since Saki and Mai (and Kaoru and Michiru) will make sure to prove you wrong. be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor.

No, not Saki and Mai, but Kaoru and Michiru. These two managed to sustain and raise what at first seemed like the typical story about legendary warriors who need to save the Earth from dark villains. I got really invested in the bonds both Kaoru and Michiru created with the protagonists, as well as their whole character arc. The pacing is great, all the villains come and go at the right moment, and maybe when it can start to get a little tiresome, Kaoru and Michiru step in and refresh the story. Lastly, I’d like to point out how the anime conveys emotions in different situations very well through drawings, making Saki and Mai characters evolve.CharactersSaki and Mai, both with their different personalities, balance each other nicely, giving some powerful and emotional moments. Regarding the side characters, I think Splash Star is capable of the best and worst. Ok, maybe not the worst, but there are a bunch of forgettable characters, like their girl friends and overall their families. Aside from Kaoru and Michiru, Kenta and Minori are the other two that I liked the most, bringing the first one a lot of funny moments and the last one extremely cute ones. The spirits or mascots were meh, I didn't particularly like or hate them. The villains were great though. I couldn’t stop laughing everytime Moerumba danced or teased Gooyaan, same with Mizu Shitatare getting mad at Saki for always saying her name wrong, and I liked how Kintoleski always made sure his opponents were fighting full strength.ArtNot gonna talk much about the art, mainly cause I don’t really know what to say. Being a coastal city, there are some nice sea visuals, plus the giant tree of life that’s inside the town. The characters designs are good, it’s nice to see the protagonists have more than one battle outfit. Also, some fights are very well done, combining action with super powers, but overall I think they all looked pretty much the same.SoundThe OP and the two EDs were energetic and catchy. The soundtrack was good as well, but, even though I said I wouldn't compare the two anime, I gotta say that there aren’t any cool insert songs like “Shining Star” or “Heart to Heart” in the OG Futari wa. Same as in Max Heart, where they repeat the instrumental version of the OP/EDs quite a lot.In conclusion, Splash Star is an enjoyable anime that’s worth recommending to anyone that loves mahou shoujo and has liked any other Precure entries. Don't be reluctant to watch this anime only because it may seem the same as the previous Futari wa, since Saki and Mai (and Kaoru and Michiru) will make sure to prove you wrong."", 'People often judge this series without watching it and believe that it was just a copy and pasted Futari Wa. I strongly disagree. This cast is one of the best. Mai and Saki, at first glance, seem like Nagisa and Honoka but there are key differences. The tone of this installment is much lighter with villains more often used for comedic relief. Mai and Saki are also more optimistic and much faster friends compared to their predecessors.The side cast were also more memorable. Kenta with his comedy and his family. Hitomi and Yuuko who were similarly high energy like Saki.I also found Minori...much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun. The twist with Akudaikan and Gohyaan was out of nowhere and very interesting.Finally, Michiru and Kaoru. Their gradual redemption and their relationship with Dark Fall was so awesome to see. Their characters had so much depth. much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun.

Splash Star is the first of those alternate continuities, and in my opinion the best. I will try to make this review as spoiler free as possible, but still be wary. This is an updated version of the review.Right from the beginning the first thing that anyone would notice about Splash Star is that it looks similar to it\'s predecessor. The general plot outline and even the main characters look...similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively. And this is possibly a big flaw of Splash Star\'s, that it is too similar to the original at first. However it does indeed come into its own and really ends up distinguishing itself from the original, and similar doesn\'t mean the same, even with just a few episodes it\'s easy to see that while Saki and Mai have similar physical designs their personalities aren\'t really that similar to Nagisa and Honoka. And the plot has enough twists and differences from the original to really be its own. Due to spoilers I won\'t go into what makes it better and the key differences, you\'ll have to watch the show.The story is simple but because of that the series is very consistent in episode quality, and while it never tries to be a really intelligent, thought provoking anime it still has serious and important topics and themes to it that are all able to be conveyed nicely because the characters put so much emotion into them. The show is great at being serious when it wants to be, and Pretty Cure show a sense of maturity and realism when faced with their greatest foes and they need to ask themselves why they even fight in the first place, what\'s their resolve for continuing their struggles and not giving up? There are some really great lines and conversations in this series, most episodes also have sweet and well done subplots to them as well. And add to that there are some really beautiful and touching scenes in the series, I found myself on the verge of tears several times throughout the show.Splash Star features a lot more thought and effort put into it\'s writing than the original, this becomes apparent with what the monster of the weeks are created from, the elemental themes of the minions, the powers of Pretty Cure, and just the whole world of Splash Star in general. The theming of the villains and theme-naming of the Cures actually mean something and tie into the world and greater themes of Splash Star. Several of the biggest twists in the story are foreshadowed far in advance, even episode one hints at possibly the biggest twist in the series.The characters themselves are of course rather simple, Michiru and Kaoru are probably the most complex the series has to offer, but the leads are just so fun and likable and entertaining that it isn\'t as big a problem as one might suspect. The series is always more about emotion and heart, and it really gets you to care about Saki and Mai by having you be there with them throughout all their ordeals.The villains however are in all likelihood much more entertaining and funny than our heroes. Special mention goes to Kintoleski who is without a doubt one of the best things about this show.Of course though not all the villains are hilarious, both Akudaikaan and Gohyaan have moments that would make them genuinely frightening to the younger audience this series is aimed at. And Michiru and Kaoru\'s character arc and plight is anything but funny.Of course you cant talk about Pretty Cure without talking about the fights, and it\'s here where the first big difference between Splash Star and the original takes place, as Cure Bloom and Cure Egret they fight often using forcefields and blasts of energy, it gives a nice edge to the fights coming right after the original.As for actual quality of the fights while Splash Star has some of the best fights in Pretty Cure, including possibly the downright best, many fights are rather anti-climactic and can loook rather stiff and have choppy animation. This is more prevalent in the earlier arcs. Aside from the few really good fights the fighting in Splash Star seems to emphasize awesome moments over actual good fighting, for example in the second episode when the girls are learning how to control their powers they throw the monster of the week across the city and into the ocean.The actual animation quality on the whole is surprisingly pretty good for a year-round show made by Toei. The quality is consistent throughout and occasionally looks great, usually during the better and more intense fights.As for sound the music is good and very fitting, plenty of happy, relaxing, and melancholic themes when they\'re appropriate. There aren\'t too many standout singular tracks though. The opening and endings however are great. Happy and energetic, the kind that get you shaking in your seat. They\'re the perfect songs for a series like this.The voice acting is excellent, especially on the villains side. For example veteran seiyu Jurota Kosugi voices Kintoleski and it\'s no surprise that his performance is the best in the whole show.Still after all the good things about Splash Star it has some rather noticeable flaws, becuase of it\'s similarity to the original the earlier arcs are rather dull compared to later on and it really does take longer than it should for the series to set itself apart from the original. And despite the series having much tighter writing and a better thought out plot there is one plot hole that can only be filled by your imagination.But Splash Star is able to still be a super fun and enjoyable show throughout its run, even with the repetitiveness I found every episode fun and entertaining. And it has possibly the most epic and heart-pounding finale of all Pretty Cure seasons, with the villain throwing Earth-shattering attacks and Pretty Cure never backing down, it\'s on a level far above anything else in the series. And what happens after is one of the most beautiful and touching epilogues in the franchise.It\'s a kids show, Pretty Cure always will be a kids show, but it\'s also able to have serious and mature moments and topics and pull them off nicely.

In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun.', ""Let's take another look at Toei's PreCure franchise. So far, I've looked at Futari wa, Max Heart & Doki Doki. This time around, let's talk about Splash Star. The third instalment of the franchise that ran from '06 to '07. How well does it hold up compared to the other instalments we've looked at? Let's take a look.Story:Young Mai is moving back to a city she used to live in. While exploring, she encounters a familiar looking girl, Saki, underneath the sky tree. The two encounter a pair of faeries, Flappy & Choppy, who remind them that they briefly encountered each other beneath that...same tree five years ago. A  brief instant that was so formative for the pair that it apparently caused their fates to intertwine because PreCure has never been subtle with its massive amounts of subtext. The two are confronted by a leafy looking menace who demands that the faeries disclose the location of the fountain of the Sun. Saki and Mai go to their defence, transforming into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret. Together, they set off on a mission to revive the holy fountains.Honestly, there aren't any major problems with the series. About the worst you can say about it is that it's very much a magical girl series with all the optimism, enemies of the week, transformation sequences and such that are prevalent in the genre. And there's nothing inherently wrong with a work in a genre being very much grounded in that genre. Especially when it's something like this with a young target audience.Splash Star has a lot of aspects that are kind of similar to Futari wa but that are also distinct. Both series feature an athletic girl and one who is into more intellectual pursuits. The characters even look a bit similar. But they're involved in different things and have different issues related to those interests. Both series have a generic male love interest who's barely acknowledged because every time he shows up for a moment with the girl who has a crush on him it's used to transition into a bigger moment for her with the other PreCure but Splash Star makes use of that a lot less and has different kinds of moments betwixt the girls as a result. In both of them, the athletic girl has a younger sibling. But the relationship dynamic that Nagisa had with her brother was a lot different from the one Saki has with her sister.I do like the pacing in Splash Star. It does a really good job of introducing a variety of major villains, giving them some time to be menaces and then bringing the next one in before you can get tired of the current one. Splash Star also features a superb redemption story with some surprisingly tragic moments within it. Darn it, PreCure writers, stop making me feel things. I'm supposed to be a cynical git. A cynical git who hates everything. Or so I've been told. There are some strong moments of tension in the series as well. They really make you curious about how Saki & Mai are going to resolve things. Although you know they will because it's PreCure. The climax is really well done too. The series is just generally fun, cute and endearing.Characters:There are some strong characters in Splash Star. Saki and Mai are great.  Their families are a lot of fun. Michiru and Kaoru are great. The supporting cast has a lot of fun, colourful characters within it. In terms of antagonists, most of them are pretty standard. The big exception is Alex Louis Kintoleski. There  is something utterly delightful about him and his techniques that have been passed down the Kintoleski line for generations. Shitataare  and DoroDoron are kind of fun at times. The worst character, by far, is Moerumaba. He comes across as a strange blend of gay and Latin stereotypes. The faeries aren't particularly compelling, but they're decent enough.Art:There's a lot of praiseworthy aspects to the artwork. The backgrounds are nicely detailed with some very nicely done scenery. The action sequences can be absolutely amazing. I do love the way this franchise incorporates really physical brawling into its action sequences along with the special magic attacks and Splash Star is no exception to that. It does suffer from the same issue with the stock footage attacks that Futari wa did. Namely, that there are very few and they start to get dull after a while. This was before they'd learned to vary them a bit more, clearly. There are some really interesting villain designs. I can't stand Moerumba's and Alex Louis Kintoleski may be the best villain, but his design is kind of boring. He's just a golden muscle man. Those two aside, great villain designs. I do like the PreCure designs too. I like that Saki & Mai have multiple Cure forms and I like their outfits. The monster designs continue to be very creative and interesting. Which is another thing the franchise has been consistently good at.Sound:The best performances come from Kimoto Orie, Enomoto Atsuko, Fuchizaki Yuriko & Imai Yuka. There are plenty of other good performances as well. Sato Naoki is back for the soundtrack work and he does a really nice job.Ho-yay:Saki and Mai may be marginally more homo-erotic than Nagisa and Honoka were. They're heavily inspired by one another. They gain strength when their hearts come together as one. They talk about their fated meeting. They have a date where they actually feed one another home made bento. They talk about how energised they feel when they hold hands. I can only imagine how much that's going to increase when they get older and start snogging. In any case, their dynamic is adorable.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Splash Star. If you're a fan of the whole magical girl aesthetic, it's for you. You will almost certainly garner enjoyment from watching it. If you aren't a fan of the genre, it's not going to change your mind. For myself, I pretty thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the characters. I give it a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Wolf Guy. same tree five years ago.

I did see the first episode of the first series, Futari wa Pretty Cure way long ago, but I never went beyond it, partly because of other things, and partly because one mascot\'s voice was so grating and annoying I just couldn\'t stand it. But after I finished Heartcatch Precure thanks to a fellow blogger\'s praising it up the wazoo, I later watched the first 5 episodes of Smile, but I had to put it on hold due to other real life obligations. Then I found Splash Star on TVTropes and apparently people used to outright hate...it back when it aired but now its held with higher regard. Out of curiosity and boredom after watching too much Pokemon and Sword Art Online, I decided to check it out. As of now, it is the second Pretty Cure series I have ever watched all the way through, and my second favorite, for very good reasons. This is a very good series, and it really needs to be seen by American little girls.Like the first series, it starts off with two girls who are very different from each other: the cheerful and sporty Saki Hyuuga, and the soft-spoken and artistic Mai Mishou. They actually met once when they were younger, but they separated since then, only reuniting once they enter middle school. But their reunion is quite a strange one: two fairies appear from a big tree in the neighborhood, Flappi and Choppi, claiming to be from a place called The Land of Fountains, which had been taken over by the evil organization called Dark Fall. The fairies give Saki and Mai giant cell phones which transform them into the warriors named Pretty Cure, Saki as Cure Bloom, and Mai as Cure Egret (for those wondering, the word egret is a medieval term used to describe white birds, usually herons, with long, graceful plumes during breeding season. Mai\'s powers are based on the wind and the sky, so it makes sense). Together, they have to defeat Dark Fall and restore the Land of Fountains back to its original state. But they also have to protect their own world, as Dark Fall won\'t spare it either, especially since they\'re also trying to find the elusive Fountain of the Sun, the only fountain they haven\'t destroyed or claimed yet.The animation...isn\'t really much to write home about. There is a lot of movement during the fight scenes, which is good considering the hard hitting attacks Pretty Cure is known for requires a lot of movement, but at times the characters look a bit off model, especially during later episodes. But they\'re minor, so they don\'t hurt the show entirely. One reason for this may be that Splash Star made a lot less money on its debut than the original series, probably because people were turned off by the character designs and premise looking way too similar to the original Pretty Cure series before it. No one really knows why Toei made Saki and Mai look so similar to Nagisa and Honoka of the original series, and the most common theory is that they were afraid of potential backlash from the audience that liked Nagisa and Honoka, fearing cries of ""Replacement Scrappy!"" But whatever the reason, that\'s still no reason to put off this show or dismiss it as a rip-off of the original series. Again, I haven\'t seen the first series and its sequel, Max Heart, so I can\'t properly judge it.The music, while admittedly not as good or dynamic as later seasons, still manages to be really solid. The music manages to capture the mood, atmosphere, and intents of all of its scenes really well, and nothing feels out of place, unlike some anime (Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, anyone?). I particularly liked the music that played when the Pretty Cures, in their new forms, unleash their final attacks on the monsters of the week, and I consider those pieces to be the high point of the entire OST. Also, the opening is extremely dynamic and catchy. It\'ll never leave your brain! I certainly liked it, and I don\'t see why American audiences wouldn\'t like it either.The Pretty Cure series is very reliant on character development. Some series do it well, and some...don\'t. Splash Star does it well. While Saki and Mai may look like rip-offs of Nagisa and Honoka, they\'re actually very different characters. Saki is cheerful, energetic, and friendly, but can be a little reckless and stubborn at times, Mai is sweet, soft spoken, slightly indecisive, and a little shy, but is very insightful. I personally liked seeing them interact and get along and influence each other throughout the series. Most anime tend to just give a character one trait and that\'s it. You don\'t see that in Splash Star. The main characters actually have hobbies and interests. Saki likes sports, but she also likes working in her parents\' bakery, and she even tries her hand at drawing, even though she isn\'t very good. Mai likes drawing, but is also interested in astronomy. They have interesting lives! The other characters, like their family members and classmates, also have a strong presence, and don\'t just show up for one episode and then be gone forever. They all influence the main characters\' growth in some way. I will admit though, I didn\'t like Michiru and Kaoru much. I always thought they were creepy until the very end of the series.Unfortunately, however, while the main characters are very well developed, I\'m sad to say this isn\'t the case for the villains. While I appreciate them being intimidating and having some personality, in the end they\'re still typical, cliche, generic, power hungry villains who want to destroy the world for dumb reasons. Plus I felt there were a bit too many of them. I would have liked to see them be fleshed out some more. Yes, I know, it\'s a kids show, but that\'s still no excuse to not develop your villains. Sometimes kids like interesting villains who don\'t want to destroy the world. But one thing that really makes me respect this series is how realistically it handles its character conflicts. In one episode, Kenta spills a drink on Mai\'s brother\'s book, and Saki is extremely angry at him. But both of them know it\'s an accident, actually apologize to each other right after, and try to find a way to fix it. There\'s no overblown misunderstanding, no melodrama, no shouting ""this has nothing to do with you!"", etc. God, I\'ve waited so long for a series to actually make characters understand each other\'s intentions, actually talk to each other, and be proactive in trying to solve them in the most down to earth way possible! I\'m so sick and tired of anime making characters act really stupid and refusing to talk to each other for the sake of drama and padding things out for a really long time just for the sake of spicing things up when all it does is drag it down! Thank you, Splash Star!Splash Star may not be the best series in the franchise (for me, that honor goes to Heartcatch), but it definitely has a special place in my heart. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m gonna go watch Suite, because I\'m enjoying it immensely! And seriously, why can\'t shows like this be faithfully dubbed in English for American TV? Little girls would love this kind of stuff! it back when it aired but now its held with higher regard.

But they also have to protect their own world, as Dark Fall won\'t spare it either, especially since they\'re also trying to find the elusive Fountain of the Sun, the only fountain they haven\'t destroyed or claimed yet.The animation...isn\'t really much to write home about. There is a lot of movement during the fight scenes, which is good considering the hard hitting attacks Pretty Cure is known for requires a lot of movement, but at times the characters look a bit off model, especially during later episodes. But they\'re minor, so they don\'t hurt the show entirely. One reason for this may be that Splash Star made a lot less money on its debut than the original series, probably because people were turned off by the character designs and premise looking way too similar to the original Pretty Cure series before it. No one really knows why Toei made Saki and Mai look so similar to Nagisa and Honoka of the original series, and the most common theory is that they were afraid of potential backlash from the audience that liked Nagisa and Honoka, fearing cries of ""Replacement Scrappy!"" But whatever the reason, that\'s still no reason to put off this show or dismiss it as a rip-off of the original series. Again, I haven\'t seen the first series and its sequel, Max Heart, so I can\'t properly judge it.The music, while admittedly not as good or dynamic as later seasons, still manages to be really solid. The music manages to capture the mood, atmosphere, and intents of all of its scenes really well, and nothing feels out of place, unlike some anime (Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, anyone?). I particularly liked the music that played when the Pretty Cures, in their new forms, unleash their final attacks on the monsters of the week, and I consider those pieces to be the high point of the entire OST. Also, the opening is extremely dynamic and catchy. It\'ll never leave your brain! I certainly liked it, and I don\'t see why American audiences wouldn\'t like it either.The Pretty Cure series is very reliant on character development. Some series do it well, and some...don\'t. Splash Star does it well. While Saki and Mai may look like rip-offs of Nagisa and Honoka, they\'re actually very different characters. Saki is cheerful, energetic, and friendly, but can be a little reckless and stubborn at times, Mai is sweet, soft spoken, slightly indecisive, and a little shy, but is very insightful. I personally liked seeing them interact and get along and influence each other throughout the series. Most anime tend to just give a character one trait and that\'s it. You don\'t see that in Splash Star. The main characters actually have hobbies and interests. Saki likes sports, but she also likes working in her parents\' bakery, and she even tries her hand at drawing, even though she isn\'t very good. Mai likes drawing, but is also interested in astronomy. They have interesting lives! The other characters, like their family members and classmates, also have a strong presence, and don\'t just show up for one episode and then be gone forever. They all influence the main characters\' growth in some way. I will admit though, I didn\'t like Michiru and Kaoru much. I always thought they were creepy until the very end of the series.Unfortunately, however, while the main characters are very well developed, I\'m sad to say this isn\'t the case for the villains. While I appreciate them being intimidating and having some personality, in the end they\'re still typical, cliche, generic, power hungry villains who want to destroy the world for dumb reasons. Plus I felt there were a bit too many of them. I would have liked to see them be fleshed out some more. Yes, I know, it\'s a kids show, but that\'s still no excuse to not develop your villains. Sometimes kids like interesting villains who don\'t want to destroy the world. But one thing that really makes me respect this series is how realistically it handles its character conflicts. In one episode, Kenta spills a drink on Mai\'s brother\'s book, and Saki is extremely angry at him. But both of them know it\'s an accident, actually apologize to each other right after, and try to find a way to fix it. There\'s no overblown misunderstanding, no melodrama, no shouting ""this has nothing to do with you!"", etc. God, I\'ve waited so long for a series to actually make characters understand each other\'s intentions, actually talk to each other, and be proactive in trying to solve them in the most down to earth way possible! I\'m so sick and tired of anime making characters act really stupid and refusing to talk to each other for the sake of drama and padding things out for a really long time just for the sake of spicing things up when all it does is drag it down! Thank you, Splash Star!Splash Star may not be the best series in the franchise (for me, that honor goes to Heartcatch), but it definitely has a special place in my heart. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m gonna go watch Suite, because I\'m enjoying it immensely! And seriously, why can\'t shows like this be faithfully dubbed in English for American TV? Little girls would love this kind of stuff!', ""Now I’d read lots of praise about this Precure series, but for me it really didn't live up to it.tl;dr: Episodes without Kaoru and Michiru = average. Episodes with Kaoru and Michiru = good.I found the story was too slow paced with little happening and not interesting enough. Apart from Kaoru and Michiru of course, their part of the story was the best. Unfortunately it doesn't focus on them all of the time. Precure stories aren't the fastest pasted in anime, but this series seemed especially slow and dull compared to others. The main story itself is generic - a big bad guy with various...minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end. I feel other Precure series handled this better, especially Fresh.I also felt like there was too much filler which wasn't the most entertaining. I think how there are only two main girls lets the filler down as there is only so much you can do with 49 episodes of the same two characters all the time. The filler wasn't up to the standard of other series.The animation was pretty bad. Lots of derpy faces and poor drawings, but what can you expect.The designs themselves are awful. Again, apart from Michiru and Kaoru. I really liked Michiru's as she reminds me of Will from W.I.T.C.H.Saki and Mai character wise are a bit different from Nagisa and Honoka, but that doesn't stop them from looking like poorly done rip off fan designs. The first outfits you can put up with, Saki's second outfit however is terrible! The colour is greeny-yellow! Who thought that looked good!?Another thing I disliked was that Saki and Mai just got beat up most of the time instead of getting stronger until the last few episodes. In other series the Cures actually get evidently stronger and beat enimies faster as time goes on. Saki and Mai just get punched down until the last moment of a fight when they fire their main big finishing attack. The fight scenes lacked compared to other series, but they seemed to be stronger cures in terms of their magical powers, they just didn’t use their fists enough.The writing is very good. No main character gets more unnecessary screen time than another.The characters themselves are good. I liked all of the fairies, Saki and Mai are likable (far from my favourite Cures though). The first villan is kind of dull and I hated Moerumba he was so annoying. I liked the rest of the villains. Ms. Shitataare is the best, she was really entertaining and added in good comedy. The series itself did make me laugh quite a few times.Kaoru and Michiru however are by far the best characters, their development is wonderful and they are really interesting. I like them a lot more than Saki and Mai.I know this review seems pretty negative, but this isn't a bad show itself. I just found the other Precure series I have watched to be better.

Thus, Splash Star is my second dive (third, if you count Max Heart separately) in this huge sea that I still have left to explore.First of all, I’ve read some people pointing out the similarities between the OG Futari wa and Splash Star. At first sight, it may seem impossible not to look at the two Splash Star protagonists and see our old friends Nagisa and Honoka, but as the episodes progressed different dynamics can...be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor. With that said, I’ll try not to remark on any parallelism between both of them (even though I couldn’t stop doing comparisons between the two shows during my viewing lol).StoryI think the story is the most remarkable thing about Splash Star and it’s all thanks to two characters. No, not Saki and Mai, but Kaoru and Michiru. These two managed to sustain and raise what at first seemed like the typical story about legendary warriors who need to save the Earth from dark villains. I got really invested in the bonds both Kaoru and Michiru created with the protagonists, as well as their whole character arc. The pacing is great, all the villains come and go at the right moment, and maybe when it can start to get a little tiresome, Kaoru and Michiru step in and refresh the story. Lastly, I’d like to point out how the anime conveys emotions in different situations very well through drawings, making Saki and Mai characters evolve.CharactersSaki and Mai, both with their different personalities, balance each other nicely, giving some powerful and emotional moments. Regarding the side characters, I think Splash Star is capable of the best and worst. Ok, maybe not the worst, but there are a bunch of forgettable characters, like their girl friends and overall their families. Aside from Kaoru and Michiru, Kenta and Minori are the other two that I liked the most, bringing the first one a lot of funny moments and the last one extremely cute ones. The spirits or mascots were meh, I didn't particularly like or hate them. The villains were great though. I couldn’t stop laughing everytime Moerumba danced or teased Gooyaan, same with Mizu Shitatare getting mad at Saki for always saying her name wrong, and I liked how Kintoleski always made sure his opponents were fighting full strength.ArtNot gonna talk much about the art, mainly cause I don’t really know what to say. Being a coastal city, there are some nice sea visuals, plus the giant tree of life that’s inside the town. The characters designs are good, it’s nice to see the protagonists have more than one battle outfit. Also, some fights are very well done, combining action with super powers, but overall I think they all looked pretty much the same.SoundThe OP and the two EDs were energetic and catchy. The soundtrack was good as well, but, even though I said I wouldn't compare the two anime, I gotta say that there aren’t any cool insert songs like “Shining Star” or “Heart to Heart” in the OG Futari wa. Same as in Max Heart, where they repeat the instrumental version of the OP/EDs quite a lot.In conclusion, Splash Star is an enjoyable anime that’s worth recommending to anyone that loves mahou shoujo and has liked any other Precure entries. Don't be reluctant to watch this anime only because it may seem the same as the previous Futari wa, since Saki and Mai (and Kaoru and Michiru) will make sure to prove you wrong. be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor.

I strongly disagree. This cast is one of the best. Mai and Saki, at first glance, seem like Nagisa and Honoka but there are key differences. The tone of this installment is much lighter with villains more often used for comedic relief. Mai and Saki are also more optimistic and much faster friends compared to their predecessors.The side cast were also more memorable. Kenta with his comedy and his family. Hitomi and Yuuko who were similarly high energy like Saki.I also found Minori...much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun. The twist with Akudaikan and Gohyaan was out of nowhere and very interesting.Finally, Michiru and Kaoru. Their gradual redemption and their relationship with Dark Fall was so awesome to see. Their characters had so much depth. much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun.

Splash Star is the first of those alternate continuities, and in my opinion the best. I will try to make this review as spoiler free as possible, but still be wary. This is an updated version of the review.Right from the beginning the first thing that anyone would notice about Splash Star is that it looks similar to it\'s predecessor. The general plot outline and even the main characters look...similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively. And this is possibly a big flaw of Splash Star\'s, that it is too similar to the original at first. However it does indeed come into its own and really ends up distinguishing itself from the original, and similar doesn\'t mean the same, even with just a few episodes it\'s easy to see that while Saki and Mai have similar physical designs their personalities aren\'t really that similar to Nagisa and Honoka. And the plot has enough twists and differences from the original to really be its own. Due to spoilers I won\'t go into what makes it better and the key differences, you\'ll have to watch the show.The story is simple but because of that the series is very consistent in episode quality, and while it never tries to be a really intelligent, thought provoking anime it still has serious and important topics and themes to it that are all able to be conveyed nicely because the characters put so much emotion into them. The show is great at being serious when it wants to be, and Pretty Cure show a sense of maturity and realism when faced with their greatest foes and they need to ask themselves why they even fight in the first place, what\'s their resolve for continuing their struggles and not giving up? There are some really great lines and conversations in this series, most episodes also have sweet and well done subplots to them as well. And add to that there are some really beautiful and touching scenes in the series, I found myself on the verge of tears several times throughout the show.Splash Star features a lot more thought and effort put into it\'s writing than the original, this becomes apparent with what the monster of the weeks are created from, the elemental themes of the minions, the powers of Pretty Cure, and just the whole world of Splash Star in general. The theming of the villains and theme-naming of the Cures actually mean something and tie into the world and greater themes of Splash Star. Several of the biggest twists in the story are foreshadowed far in advance, even episode one hints at possibly the biggest twist in the series.The characters themselves are of course rather simple, Michiru and Kaoru are probably the most complex the series has to offer, but the leads are just so fun and likable and entertaining that it isn\'t as big a problem as one might suspect. The series is always more about emotion and heart, and it really gets you to care about Saki and Mai by having you be there with them throughout all their ordeals.The villains however are in all likelihood much more entertaining and funny than our heroes. Special mention goes to Kintoleski who is without a doubt one of the best things about this show.Of course though not all the villains are hilarious, both Akudaikaan and Gohyaan have moments that would make them genuinely frightening to the younger audience this series is aimed at. And Michiru and Kaoru\'s character arc and plight is anything but funny.Of course you cant talk about Pretty Cure without talking about the fights, and it\'s here where the first big difference between Splash Star and the original takes place, as Cure Bloom and Cure Egret they fight often using forcefields and blasts of energy, it gives a nice edge to the fights coming right after the original.As for actual quality of the fights while Splash Star has some of the best fights in Pretty Cure, including possibly the downright best, many fights are rather anti-climactic and can loook rather stiff and have choppy animation. This is more prevalent in the earlier arcs. Aside from the few really good fights the fighting in Splash Star seems to emphasize awesome moments over actual good fighting, for example in the second episode when the girls are learning how to control their powers they throw the monster of the week across the city and into the ocean.The actual animation quality on the whole is surprisingly pretty good for a year-round show made by Toei. The quality is consistent throughout and occasionally looks great, usually during the better and more intense fights.As for sound the music is good and very fitting, plenty of happy, relaxing, and melancholic themes when they\'re appropriate. There aren\'t too many standout singular tracks though. The opening and endings however are great. Happy and energetic, the kind that get you shaking in your seat. They\'re the perfect songs for a series like this.The voice acting is excellent, especially on the villains side. For example veteran seiyu Jurota Kosugi voices Kintoleski and it\'s no surprise that his performance is the best in the whole show.Still after all the good things about Splash Star it has some rather noticeable flaws, becuase of it\'s similarity to the original the earlier arcs are rather dull compared to later on and it really does take longer than it should for the series to set itself apart from the original. And despite the series having much tighter writing and a better thought out plot there is one plot hole that can only be filled by your imagination.But Splash Star is able to still be a super fun and enjoyable show throughout its run, even with the repetitiveness I found every episode fun and entertaining. And it has possibly the most epic and heart-pounding finale of all Pretty Cure seasons, with the villain throwing Earth-shattering attacks and Pretty Cure never backing down, it\'s on a level far above anything else in the series. And what happens after is one of the most beautiful and touching epilogues in the franchise.It\'s a kids show, Pretty Cure always will be a kids show, but it\'s also able to have serious and mature moments and topics and pull them off nicely. In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun. similar, Saki and Mai even fill out the same archetypes of their older sisters Nagisa and Honoka respectively.

In the end, Splash Star is great clean fun.', ""Let's take another look at Toei's PreCure franchise. So far, I've looked at Futari wa, Max Heart & Doki Doki. This time around, let's talk about Splash Star. The third instalment of the franchise that ran from '06 to '07. How well does it hold up compared to the other instalments we've looked at? Let's take a look.Story:Young Mai is moving back to a city she used to live in. While exploring, she encounters a familiar looking girl, Saki, underneath the sky tree. The two encounter a pair of faeries, Flappy & Choppy, who remind them that they briefly encountered each other beneath that...same tree five years ago. A  brief instant that was so formative for the pair that it apparently caused their fates to intertwine because PreCure has never been subtle with its massive amounts of subtext. The two are confronted by a leafy looking menace who demands that the faeries disclose the location of the fountain of the Sun. Saki and Mai go to their defence, transforming into Cure Bloom and Cure Egret. Together, they set off on a mission to revive the holy fountains.Honestly, there aren't any major problems with the series. About the worst you can say about it is that it's very much a magical girl series with all the optimism, enemies of the week, transformation sequences and such that are prevalent in the genre. And there's nothing inherently wrong with a work in a genre being very much grounded in that genre. Especially when it's something like this with a young target audience.Splash Star has a lot of aspects that are kind of similar to Futari wa but that are also distinct. Both series feature an athletic girl and one who is into more intellectual pursuits. The characters even look a bit similar. But they're involved in different things and have different issues related to those interests. Both series have a generic male love interest who's barely acknowledged because every time he shows up for a moment with the girl who has a crush on him it's used to transition into a bigger moment for her with the other PreCure but Splash Star makes use of that a lot less and has different kinds of moments betwixt the girls as a result. In both of them, the athletic girl has a younger sibling. But the relationship dynamic that Nagisa had with her brother was a lot different from the one Saki has with her sister.I do like the pacing in Splash Star. It does a really good job of introducing a variety of major villains, giving them some time to be menaces and then bringing the next one in before you can get tired of the current one. Splash Star also features a superb redemption story with some surprisingly tragic moments within it. Darn it, PreCure writers, stop making me feel things. I'm supposed to be a cynical git. A cynical git who hates everything. Or so I've been told. There are some strong moments of tension in the series as well. They really make you curious about how Saki & Mai are going to resolve things. Although you know they will because it's PreCure. The climax is really well done too. The series is just generally fun, cute and endearing.Characters:There are some strong characters in Splash Star. Saki and Mai are great.  Their families are a lot of fun. Michiru and Kaoru are great. The supporting cast has a lot of fun, colourful characters within it. In terms of antagonists, most of them are pretty standard. The big exception is Alex Louis Kintoleski. There  is something utterly delightful about him and his techniques that have been passed down the Kintoleski line for generations. Shitataare  and DoroDoron are kind of fun at times. The worst character, by far, is Moerumaba. He comes across as a strange blend of gay and Latin stereotypes. The faeries aren't particularly compelling, but they're decent enough.Art:There's a lot of praiseworthy aspects to the artwork. The backgrounds are nicely detailed with some very nicely done scenery. The action sequences can be absolutely amazing. I do love the way this franchise incorporates really physical brawling into its action sequences along with the special magic attacks and Splash Star is no exception to that. It does suffer from the same issue with the stock footage attacks that Futari wa did. Namely, that there are very few and they start to get dull after a while. This was before they'd learned to vary them a bit more, clearly. There are some really interesting villain designs. I can't stand Moerumba's and Alex Louis Kintoleski may be the best villain, but his design is kind of boring. He's just a golden muscle man. Those two aside, great villain designs. I do like the PreCure designs too. I like that Saki & Mai have multiple Cure forms and I like their outfits. The monster designs continue to be very creative and interesting. Which is another thing the franchise has been consistently good at.Sound:The best performances come from Kimoto Orie, Enomoto Atsuko, Fuchizaki Yuriko & Imai Yuka. There are plenty of other good performances as well. Sato Naoki is back for the soundtrack work and he does a really nice job.Ho-yay:Saki and Mai may be marginally more homo-erotic than Nagisa and Honoka were. They're heavily inspired by one another. They gain strength when their hearts come together as one. They talk about their fated meeting. They have a date where they actually feed one another home made bento. They talk about how energised they feel when they hold hands. I can only imagine how much that's going to increase when they get older and start snogging. In any case, their dynamic is adorable.Final Thoughts:So, that's Futari wa PreCure Splash Star. If you're a fan of the whole magical girl aesthetic, it's for you. You will almost certainly garner enjoyment from watching it. If you aren't a fan of the genre, it's not going to change your mind. For myself, I pretty thoroughly enjoyed it. Loved the characters. I give it a solid 8/10. Next week I'll look at Wolf Guy. same tree five years ago.

I did see the first episode of the first series, Futari wa Pretty Cure way long ago, but I never went beyond it, partly because of other things, and partly because one mascot\'s voice was so grating and annoying I just couldn\'t stand it. But after I finished Heartcatch Precure thanks to a fellow blogger\'s praising it up the wazoo, I later watched the first 5 episodes of Smile, but I had to put it on hold due to other real life obligations. Then I found Splash Star on TVTropes and apparently people used to outright hate...it back when it aired but now its held with higher regard. Out of curiosity and boredom after watching too much Pokemon and Sword Art Online, I decided to check it out. As of now, it is the second Pretty Cure series I have ever watched all the way through, and my second favorite, for very good reasons. This is a very good series, and it really needs to be seen by American little girls.Like the first series, it starts off with two girls who are very different from each other: the cheerful and sporty Saki Hyuuga, and the soft-spoken and artistic Mai Mishou. They actually met once when they were younger, but they separated since then, only reuniting once they enter middle school. But their reunion is quite a strange one: two fairies appear from a big tree in the neighborhood, Flappi and Choppi, claiming to be from a place called The Land of Fountains, which had been taken over by the evil organization called Dark Fall. The fairies give Saki and Mai giant cell phones which transform them into the warriors named Pretty Cure, Saki as Cure Bloom, and Mai as Cure Egret (for those wondering, the word egret is a medieval term used to describe white birds, usually herons, with long, graceful plumes during breeding season. Mai\'s powers are based on the wind and the sky, so it makes sense). Together, they have to defeat Dark Fall and restore the Land of Fountains back to its original state. But they also have to protect their own world, as Dark Fall won\'t spare it either, especially since they\'re also trying to find the elusive Fountain of the Sun, the only fountain they haven\'t destroyed or claimed yet.The animation...isn\'t really much to write home about. There is a lot of movement during the fight scenes, which is good considering the hard hitting attacks Pretty Cure is known for requires a lot of movement, but at times the characters look a bit off model, especially during later episodes. But they\'re minor, so they don\'t hurt the show entirely. One reason for this may be that Splash Star made a lot less money on its debut than the original series, probably because people were turned off by the character designs and premise looking way too similar to the original Pretty Cure series before it. No one really knows why Toei made Saki and Mai look so similar to Nagisa and Honoka of the original series, and the most common theory is that they were afraid of potential backlash from the audience that liked Nagisa and Honoka, fearing cries of ""Replacement Scrappy!"" But whatever the reason, that\'s still no reason to put off this show or dismiss it as a rip-off of the original series. Again, I haven\'t seen the first series and its sequel, Max Heart, so I can\'t properly judge it.The music, while admittedly not as good or dynamic as later seasons, still manages to be really solid. The music manages to capture the mood, atmosphere, and intents of all of its scenes really well, and nothing feels out of place, unlike some anime (Nurse Angel Ririka SOS, anyone?). I particularly liked the music that played when the Pretty Cures, in their new forms, unleash their final attacks on the monsters of the week, and I consider those pieces to be the high point of the entire OST. Also, the opening is extremely dynamic and catchy. It\'ll never leave your brain! I certainly liked it, and I don\'t see why American audiences wouldn\'t like it either.The Pretty Cure series is very reliant on character development. Some series do it well, and some...don\'t. Splash Star does it well. While Saki and Mai may look like rip-offs of Nagisa and Honoka, they\'re actually very different characters. Saki is cheerful, energetic, and friendly, but can be a little reckless and stubborn at times, Mai is sweet, soft spoken, slightly indecisive, and a little shy, but is very insightful. I personally liked seeing them interact and get along and influence each other throughout the series. Most anime tend to just give a character one trait and that\'s it. You don\'t see that in Splash Star. The main characters actually have hobbies and interests. Saki likes sports, but she also likes working in her parents\' bakery, and she even tries her hand at drawing, even though she isn\'t very good. Mai likes drawing, but is also interested in astronomy. They have interesting lives! The other characters, like their family members and classmates, also have a strong presence, and don\'t just show up for one episode and then be gone forever. They all influence the main characters\' growth in some way. I will admit though, I didn\'t like Michiru and Kaoru much. I always thought they were creepy until the very end of the series.Unfortunately, however, while the main characters are very well developed, I\'m sad to say this isn\'t the case for the villains. While I appreciate them being intimidating and having some personality, in the end they\'re still typical, cliche, generic, power hungry villains who want to destroy the world for dumb reasons. Plus I felt there were a bit too many of them. I would have liked to see them be fleshed out some more. Yes, I know, it\'s a kids show, but that\'s still no excuse to not develop your villains. Sometimes kids like interesting villains who don\'t want to destroy the world. But one thing that really makes me respect this series is how realistically it handles its character conflicts. In one episode, Kenta spills a drink on Mai\'s brother\'s book, and Saki is extremely angry at him. But both of them know it\'s an accident, actually apologize to each other right after, and try to find a way to fix it. There\'s no overblown misunderstanding, no melodrama, no shouting ""this has nothing to do with you!"", etc. God, I\'ve waited so long for a series to actually make characters understand each other\'s intentions, actually talk to each other, and be proactive in trying to solve them in the most down to earth way possible! I\'m so sick and tired of anime making characters act really stupid and refusing to talk to each other for the sake of drama and padding things out for a really long time just for the sake of spicing things up when all it does is drag it down! Thank you, Splash Star!Splash Star may not be the best series in the franchise (for me, that honor goes to Heartcatch), but it definitely has a special place in my heart. Now if you\'ll excuse me, I\'m gonna go watch Suite, because I\'m enjoying it immensely! And seriously, why can\'t shows like this be faithfully dubbed in English for American TV?

Little girls would love this kind of stuff!', ""Now I’d read lots of praise about this Precure series, but for me it really didn't live up to it.tl;dr: Episodes without Kaoru and Michiru = average. Episodes with Kaoru and Michiru = good.I found the story was too slow paced with little happening and not interesting enough. Apart from Kaoru and Michiru of course, their part of the story was the best. Unfortunately it doesn't focus on them all of the time. Precure stories aren't the fastest pasted in anime, but this series seemed especially slow and dull compared to others. The main story itself is generic - a big bad guy with various...minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end. I feel other Precure series handled this better, especially Fresh.I also felt like there was too much filler which wasn't the most entertaining. I think how there are only two main girls lets the filler down as there is only so much you can do with 49 episodes of the same two characters all the time. The filler wasn't up to the standard of other series.The animation was pretty bad. Lots of derpy faces and poor drawings, but what can you expect.The designs themselves are awful. Again, apart from Michiru and Kaoru. I really liked Michiru's as she reminds me of Will from W.I.T.C.H.Saki and Mai character wise are a bit different from Nagisa and Honoka, but that doesn't stop them from looking like poorly done rip off fan designs. The first outfits you can put up with, Saki's second outfit however is terrible! The colour is greeny-yellow! Who thought that looked good!?Another thing I disliked was that Saki and Mai just got beat up most of the time instead of getting stronger until the last few episodes. In other series the Cures actually get evidently stronger and beat enimies faster as time goes on. Saki and Mai just get punched down until the last moment of a fight when they fire their main big finishing attack. The fight scenes lacked compared to other series, but they seemed to be stronger cures in terms of their magical powers, they just didn’t use their fists enough.The writing is very good. No main character gets more unnecessary screen time than another.The characters themselves are good. I liked all of the fairies, Saki and Mai are likable (far from my favourite Cures though). The first villan is kind of dull and I hated Moerumba he was so annoying. I liked the rest of the villains. Ms. Shitataare is the best, she was really entertaining and added in good comedy. The series itself did make me laugh quite a few times.Kaoru and Michiru however are by far the best characters, their development is wonderful and they are really interesting. I like them a lot more than Saki and Mai.I know this review seems pretty negative, but this isn't a bad show itself. I just found the other Precure series I have watched to be better. (and no I haven't seen Doki Doki!) minions trying to destroy the universe/worlds. There's only one plot twist right at the end.

This season's plot is unique in it's own way,the art style fits the season for 2006, and Bloom and Egret (Saki and Mai) are characters that I really enjoyed getting to know! Now, I do need to say that there are a few stale episodes at the beginning, so be advised of that. I recommend this show to any Precure fan!

He sometimes shows up casually at\xa0PANPAKA Pan Bakery\xa0to buy bread without causing any trouble. He likes to train like a boxer for his fights, often jogging and lifting weights , and he even give tips to Cure Bloom on how to draw in one episodeSo yeah the villains are better this time aroundThere was also a plot twist at the end of the show , that was also foreshadow with a scene of GoyanThinking to himself getting big muscles after Kintoleski told him to workout\xa0 , only to have Goyan be the real final villain of the show , and showing off his big muscles form at the very end , Akudaikan was just a puppet at the endSo yeah not as good as the first two seasons , and shows in how the toy sales were low this time around,\xa0 so the plan sequel season for Splash Star was canceled,\xa0 at least the two girls are\xa0 in Precure 23\xa0 ,\xa0 so I recommend this show for the villains only', ""I started watching Precure in its release order, avoiding the trouble of looking in thousands of threads to see which entry is the best one to start the series with. Thus, Splash Star is my second dive (third, if you count Max Heart separately) in this huge sea that I still have left to explore.First of all, I’ve read some people pointing out the similarities between the OG Futari wa and Splash Star. At first sight, it may seem impossible not to look at the two Splash Star protagonists and see our old friends Nagisa and Honoka, but as the episodes progressed different dynamics can...be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor. With that said, I’ll try not to remark on any parallelism between both of them (even though I couldn’t stop doing comparisons between the two shows during my viewing lol).StoryI think the story is the most remarkable thing about Splash Star and it’s all thanks to two characters. No, not Saki and Mai, but Kaoru and Michiru. These two managed to sustain and raise what at first seemed like the typical story about legendary warriors who need to save the Earth from dark villains. I got really invested in the bonds both Kaoru and Michiru created with the protagonists, as well as their whole character arc. The pacing is great, all the villains come and go at the right moment, and maybe when it can start to get a little tiresome, Kaoru and Michiru step in and refresh the story. Lastly, I’d like to point out how the anime conveys emotions in different situations very well through drawings, making Saki and Mai characters evolve.CharactersSaki and Mai, both with their different personalities, balance each other nicely, giving some powerful and emotional moments. Regarding the side characters, I think Splash Star is capable of the best and worst. Ok, maybe not the worst, but there are a bunch of forgettable characters, like their girl friends and overall their families. Aside from Kaoru and Michiru, Kenta and Minori are the other two that I liked the most, bringing the first one a lot of funny moments and the last one extremely cute ones. The spirits or mascots were meh, I didn't particularly like or hate them. The villains were great though. I couldn’t stop laughing everytime Moerumba danced or teased Gooyaan, same with Mizu Shitatare getting mad at Saki for always saying her name wrong, and I liked how Kintoleski always made sure his opponents were fighting full strength.ArtNot gonna talk much about the art, mainly cause I don’t really know what to say. Being a coastal city, there are some nice sea visuals, plus the giant tree of life that’s inside the town. The characters designs are good, it’s nice to see the protagonists have more than one battle outfit. Also, some fights are very well done, combining action with super powers, but overall I think they all looked pretty much the same.SoundThe OP and the two EDs were energetic and catchy. The soundtrack was good as well, but, even though I said I wouldn't compare the two anime, I gotta say that there aren’t any cool insert songs like “Shining Star” or “Heart to Heart” in the OG Futari wa. Same as in Max Heart, where they repeat the instrumental version of the OP/EDs quite a lot.In conclusion, Splash Star is an enjoyable anime that’s worth recommending to anyone that loves mahou shoujo and has liked any other Precure entries. Don't be reluctant to watch this anime only because it may seem the same as the previous Futari wa, since Saki and Mai (and Kaoru and Michiru) will make sure to prove you wrong. be seen between them that distinguish this instalment from its predecessor.

I strongly disagree. This cast is one of the best. Mai and Saki, at first glance, seem like Nagisa and Honoka but there are key differences. The tone of this installment is much lighter with villains more often used for comedic relief. Mai and Saki are also more optimistic and much faster friends compared to their predecessors.The side cast were also more memorable. Kenta with his comedy and his family. Hitomi and Yuuko who were similarly high energy like Saki.I also found Minori...much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun. The twist with Akudaikan and Gohyaan was out of nowhere and very interesting.Finally, Michiru and Kaoru. Their gradual redemption and their relationship with Dark Fall was so awesome to see. Their characters had so much depth. much more tolerable compared to RyoutaThe villains were funny and their designs were so unique and fun.
