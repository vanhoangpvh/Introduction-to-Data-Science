Kikou Ryohei Mellowlink,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2048/Kikou_Ryohei_Mellowlink,"[""For any fan of Ryosuke Takahashi's Armored Trooper Votoms franchise, you'll feel right at home with this series. It's set in the same world, and Chirico even makes a short cameo as well, though their paths never really intertwine.As a revenge tale, you shouldn't expect anything profound from the plot. Simplicity is the name of the game here, so the setup is fairly obvious...you get pieces of info along Mellowlink's journey that unveil why he's hunting down these high-ranked officers.The main draw of the show, IMO, is the clever, tactical ways in which Mellow dispatches his enemies. Whether it's using misdirection ploys or baiting pursuers...into a trap of mines, he's always got some scheme going on to get the upper-hand. And seeing how he's just a lone man against giant mechas most of the time, it's absolutely essential he turns the battle into a match of wits rather than outright strength. Some of its episodes are better than others at depicting this, but overall, the action here engrosses with its gritty guerrilla warfare...a stark contrast to other mecha anime like Gurren Lagann and recent Gundam shows.Concerning the animation, I think it's important to point out it was made back in the late '80s. As a bit of an old-school fan myself, I don't mind it at all, but younger anime fans accustomed to shiny CGI and sparkly colors may be put off by the gritty, earthy look of the show. into a trap of mines, he's always got some scheme going on to get the upper-hand.

The premise is a quite straightforward (basic, if you\'re being harsh) revenge story about an ill done by ex-soldier hunting his former commanders to avenge his dead comrades. It functions as an episodic series for the most part, with the last few episodes following a short ""finale arc"".All these episodes are...titled based on the environment they take place in - quite appropriately, as the environments are the stars of the episode in lieu of a really charismatic or interesting cast. Mellowlink, the protagonist, is pretty much just a bland soldier man without so much of a hint of an arc, his \'love interest\' is equally one dimensional and their relationship is just as pointless and unnatural feeling. The antagonists are all just cackling shonen style villains with no depth either - not inappropriate for a story of this style, and to be fair they have their individual gimmicks for each episode, but still, all this means something has to fill the gap this cast leaves. And it\'s the environment: while the animation is nothing to write home about, there are some quite excellent looking background paintings of mysterious and exciting sci fi vistas.As for ""mech and tech"" stuff, I wouldn\'t consider myself any kind of mech expert, so take my assessment with a spoonful of salt but I would describe the stuff on display in Mellowlink as interesting but homogenous. The Mechs on display, AT\'s as they are called, have a cool design similar to Gundam\'s Zakus but a bit more ""real"" feeling (they remind me of some designs from the Mechwarrior Games). This shouldn\'t be a surprise, as they were designed by the same person who designed the Zaku, Kunio Okawara. While it\'s a cool design, I don\'t love it - it does seem a bit devoid of personality, although perhaps that is the intention in taking the ""real robots"" concept to its conclusion. But from what I can tell, this one triclops design is the only one on display which makes things get a bit stale, when you are watching Mellowlink blow up the same mech for the 5th time in that episode. (Note that as I said I am unfamiliar with this setting - perhaps there was some subtle differences between the mechs, but by and large they all looked the same, and perhaps there was some lore reason for them all to be so...I can\'t say).But it is perhaps unfair to focus on the mechs in a show which is about a mech hunter. Which is as I said in my intro, quite an interesting take I haven\'t seen in other anime. The concept seems to be inspired by WW1 and early WW2 anti tank rifles, which reflects a broader trend in this anime - everyone seems to be using some early 20th century inspired technology, with Browning MG\'s and German style armoured cars. It\'s a neat aesthetic and it works well, giving the show a grimy, gritty feel that it\'d otherwise lack - there\'s rarely any sense that the protagonist is in danger, and opponents are disposable cannon fodder to him.While I may seem disproportionately harsh in criticising this anime, I did enjoy it more than my scores would suggest. It\'s a low tech sci fi anime with solid mech designs and a pace fast enough to stop you getting bored - which ticks a lot of boxes for me. If you\'re similarly into that scene, or the idea of a guy with a giant AT rifle fighting chunky, realistic mechs just sounds fun to you, I think this anime is worth your time. titled based on the environment they take place in - quite appropriately, as the environments are the stars of the episode in lieu of a really charismatic or interesting cast.

Armour Hunter Mellowlink marks a change in that trajectory, as it doesn’t take the easy route and retread familiar territory, instead opting to take a new approach to the series, which while just as focused on action as its previous entries, manages to markedly improve the action through a much greater production value, providing it with a more potent emphasis on detail and immersion than its predecessors.In a similar...vein to Robocop, Mellowlink manages to seamlessly merge motifs, iconographies, and ideas from a multitude of genres, creating a genre hyperspecifity that it utilises to great effect, and allows it to carve out a unique position to occupy itself in. From the onset, it has plenty in common with a classic western with its wandering outlaw protagonist (cape included), barren desert landscapes, and its concept of an honourable duel between two professionals. However, the characterisation within the series and the manner in which it unveils plot details is much more in line with a noir, which is a particular form of stylisation that anime generally does not make use of. Through this noir-like approach to character, it manages to make its mostly basic plot far more engaging, by connecting the rising tension with an increased feeling of desperation within its protagonist. Elsewhere, it manages to apply similar noir principles of establishing fear and uncertainty, through both its lighting and use of music, which is demonstrative of a level of directorial talent that can’t always be guaranteed. The music itself is also remarkably different to that of the preceding series, it is far from being an extension of the musical motifs that have appeared previously, which also speaks to Mellowlink’s change in tone.The change in direction and tone is made evident in multiple areas – alongside the new music, which carries with it a more sombre and sinister atmosphere during its quieter moments, this more Brian De Palma-esque sense of paranoia is also conveyed through the framing and editing. On its own, a single shot of an empty room means very little, but when put up against the wider context of the series and the viewer’s expectations, being exposed to silence can end up feeling unsettling rather than calming, especially when this change is marked by an extended continuous take, a technique lifted directly from De Palma. Further, the usage of cinematography is also far more ambitious than most its contemporaries, which can be illustrated by one particular example. During one episode, there is a scene in which the titular Private Mellowlink is hiding behind cover, and he shoots some explosive barrels, killing the soldiers who were pursuing him, after which point several ATs move in to finish the job. Even to a casual viewer of action anime, it is very easy to picture this scene in the form of a static medium shot of the protagonist, followed by a static long shot of the explosion, two specific shot compositions that are often used alongside each other within this specific scenario, which constitutes a cinematographic cliché that can make a work feel as generic and predictable as clichés in writing can. Instead, Mellowlink revokes this cliché via its much greater focus on detail, as in the span of a few seconds, there is a remarkable amount that it manages to portray. Once the context has been established, the barrels are shot, leading to a tracking shot as they tumble backwards (rather than being engulfed in flames instantly), which explode once they hit the wall, leading to an intricate collapse of the building, as the roof falls to the floor, which the ATs forcefully push aside as they move through. Although a short scene, no more than 15 seconds in total, within the context of the wider action sequence, and certainly when the entire show is looked at comprehensively, this example is a microcosm for the kind of detail that is present throughout the entirety of Mellowlink, with a significant amount of effort being directed towards both having well-choreographed action sequences, as well as always making sure that the camerawork never falls into generic patterns.One particular area in which Mellowlink is able to stand out is through its depiction of blood and gore, which is something most mecha anime seem hesitant to portray – for all the war and murder that goes on within the genre, Mellowlink stands out as an entry that acknowledges the rather simple fact that people bleed when they are shot. In particular, this has the effect of being able to exemplify its unflinching tone, and this level of immersive detail is also utilised elsewhere, as while buildings might not bleed, they do suffer damage and decay, which is another aspect that is typically conveniently forgotten. When committed to paper, it sounds like a small and fairly insignificant detail, but when it appears with this level of consistency, it is something that really manages to accentuate the immersion and strength of the production. Mellowlink takes another cost-cutting cliché (the impervious chest-high wall) and proves it can do better, with walls suffering chipping damage, with small parts of the foundation fall apart as they do, and having physical bullet holes actually entering surfaces, providing both visual spectacle and a reminder of the actual danger that the protagonist is in, which in turn creates a greater deal of tension for the audience.Although Mellowlink may have rejected a few specific cliches, it is far from avant-garde in its design. For that matter, even when accounting for its noir sensibilities, it is an undeniably conventional action series, with lots of car chases and firefights, establishing shots that generate atmosphere and draw the viewer in to the sci-fi setting and its inner workings, and a main character who, when not an audience surrogate and vehicle for exposition, portrays the fairly limited range of emotions that comes with the genre. Most critically, although the series is subject to exposition, it is never dry nor overbearing, which is representative of its directorial strength – it knows when to restrain itself and keep things short, but it is never unfocused, as it always has the background context of its protagonist’s personal journey to provide purpose for his endeavours. In all regards, it is a finely directed series, which is perhaps best demonstrated by its action sequences. Being its clear focal point, they are expertly paced, embedded in the fact that they can be as short or long as best befit the rest of the episode, but no matter the scale, they are always orchestrated with absolute finesse, just like every other aspect of the series. The animation is of a stellar quality, carrying with it details that generate greater immersion and visual power with every single point of minutiae, with an atmosphere that is captured and emphasised by the soundtrack, and the whole series is an absolute powerhouse. Mellowlink has a solidly pronounced level of craftsmanship that remains unparalleled. Catching lightning in a bottle is something most can only hope to do once in their careers, but Mellowlink managed to do it for twelve consecutive episodes without faltering. vein to Robocop, Mellowlink manages to seamlessly merge motifs, iconographies, and ideas from a multitude of genres, creating a genre hyperspecifity that it utilises to great effect, and allows it to carve out a unique position to occupy itself in.

While that show focused on a really gifted mecha pilot, Armor Hunter Mellowlink is the polar opposite, following a really talented anti-mecha soldier, think of the anti-material rifles used in both World Wars and you have a decent analogue as to what’s going on here… except a lot more badass with one dude fighting giant robots on foot.While the story is a lot simpler compared to Armored Trooper Votoms, I think it ultimately still ended up being the better show in my opinion....It's often more productive to do one thing really well rather than trying to juggle too many complex things at once, never reaching their true potential, which happened all too often in the parent story.Armor Hunter Mellowlink has a very basic revenge story that anyone can easily guess where it’ll end up or what its twist, if you can even really call it that, will entail. There are some threads which definitely could’ve been followed up further upon, for instance, in the first episode Mellowlink specifically avoids killing other soldiers, saying he’s only there for the captain, but as the episodes progress, collateral damage starts getting bigger and bigger without a whole lot of acknowledgement.This could pose an interesting dilemma on the whole revenge ordeal, as he would technically be killing a bunch of grunt soldiers along the way who probably were just like him and his squad in the past, simply following orders from their superiors, being unfortunate cogs on a larger war structure. Maybe even some form of acceptance that he’s breaking a few eggs to make an omelette as it were, and whether that’s truly worth it or meaningful.With regard to this idea, there’s a brief exchange during an action scene near the end that reaches oh so close to addressing these themes, but then it’s quickly tossed aside to make room for a final confrontation, demonstrating a bit of a missed opportunity.That being said, it does everything else extremely well, which turns out to be a very enjoyable, action packed anime with phenomenal art, animation and audio filled with great set pieces, some confrontations are a bit more direct, while in a large portion of them the main character uses his smarts with guerilla tactics to take down his much stronger opposition.The most enjoyable part to me is how all the mecha are brought to life in stunning detail, they all feel like very tangible machines, with each scene they’re in revealing yet another little piece of information as to how they operate, like their use of ammunition to propel punching, later we even see our main character empty out a fallen Votom’s arm in one scene to salvage some shells. Additionally, skilled pilots use their functions in inventive ways, which makes for some very dynamic fights depending on the set piece.Ironically this series about hunting down and destroying mecha is generally more intricate about them compared to the parent story about piloting and fighting in them, however that could largely be attributed to a higher overall production value. In conclusion, both series have their pros and cons but as a whole I think this is a lot more accessible and easier to recommend.

He dodges, snipes, and somersaults across the battlefield, and enables this OVA to be a fine, action-filled adventure. It's a boilerplate revenge story in high form, with an art style that faithfully follows the original Votoms - along with carrying the same level of quality. Most episodes are individual scenarios in different locales: jungles, deserts, etc. And all are opportunities for revenge for Mellowlink.The story is mostly episodic, though the plots of earlier episodes contribute to the multi-episode finale. Unfortunately not a lot of these episodes are memorable, though there are some diamonds in the rough. A big problem with...Mellowlink is that the characters are paper-thin: while Votoms has eccentric and comedic characters to contrast with its stone-cold protagonist, Mellowlink's cast is much smaller and everyone seems to carry the same flavor of bland, minus the love interest. While that may seem like a saving grace by mention, it's really not. She's a pretty face with more mercy than the rest of the cast, but disempowered by the plot and kind of boring anyways.There's still a lot of good here. The character designs are faithful to Votoms, the armored troopers look great, and as a visual package the OVA really pops. I really like the choreography of the action, even if it gets a bit repetitive by episode 8 or so. Seeing Mellowlink outsmart pilots with his AT rifle is great, and as other reviews have pointed out it's solid David vs. Goliath fare.I'd recommend it, honestly. It's a short action OVA with good action in a gritty world, and it's altogether reliable: when you start an episode of Mellowlink, you won't get any crazy curveballs. It's 24 minutes of solid battles in a gritty world. Although I wouldn't be in a rush to watch it: check out the original Votoms first.

How episodic and formulaic it was killed all tension since everything would always be neatly resolved by the episode's conclusion. And it had too many lame gimmicks the creators must've thought 12 year olds would find badass like how Mellow would smear his face with blood right before killing someone and find some way to leave behind a pair of his comrades' dogtags also before each kill.The ending though was really good and had a mature twist I wasn't expecting at all. And the animation really stepped up for the...final episode.The original was much better but for a hardcore fan this isn't bad. The music was also terrible; I never want to watch this again just so I can avoid hearing that lame cowboy whistle. final episode.The original was much better but for a hardcore fan this isn't bad.

Koukyoushihen Eureka Seven: Pocket ga Niji de Ippai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4246/Koukyoushihen_Eureka_Seven__Pocket_ga_Niji_de_Ippai,"[""Despite what everyone is saying that this is another universe, a revamped story and whatever it needs to be said in order to separate the original story with this movie... well, I got news for you, it's not.It still involves the universe of Eureka Seven, however, it seems that not many people are paying attention to the date of the events.This movie tells the story of how everything came to be before the events of the anime series. This movie is set in the 21st century while the anime series takes place many, many years later.Instead of introducing new characters just for just one...movie, BONES used the original cast to tell the story before Psalms of the Planets. That's why we see old characters filling weird roles like Renton's sensei Dominic.The story itself its very interesting because not only shows how the coralians came in contact with humanity but also alters the personalities of some of the characters, like Eureka for example, where she is not as shy and soul-less as she was portrayed at the beginning of the anime series.

Eureka Seven is one of the greatest series to ever be created. It's animation and soundtrack is unusually top notch as well as it's character development and well balanced plot. This sorry excuse for a movie under the same name of that epic animation should be beat down with a stick like a bad cosplayer.True fans of the Eureka Seven series, spare yourself the two hour torture. If you want cute...fan pictures or stories of Eureka and Renton, just browse the internet. I'm sure you'd find more things that would probably even satisfy you better.Moving on, let's get down to each of the categories.The storyline: 5. Why? I'm sorry but taking the plot of the actual anime, condensing it into two hours and renaming every major plot point is NOT creative. It's not even original. It's silly. Okay, sure, you made some of the characters evil and it was a little different. Hell, Eureka knowing Renton since they were little could even be called adorable! Not to mention Dominic the vampire teacher, let's not forget him in all his awesome Adrock-like glory! However, the small plot that was thought out seemed like an interesting backstory to the 'Desperation Disease' at first and then moved onto being something akin to some kind of backwards fountain of youth that related to the Image (*coughCoraliancough*). If it had been explained a little more, I could have given it more respect, but as it was, it was difficult to follow, not properly thought out and pretty much just vomited into animated form. Nice try guys!The art: 2. Taking scenes from the completed anime and editing them to be put into a movie is not artistic. I was so distracted by the blatant use of actual anime images that I could not properly concentrate on the movie (I actually would stop and try and think which episode it was from and I got them all nearly correct with a three episode margin of error, whoo!). Unlike Mamma Mia... taking already made things and trying to mesh them into a movie does not work here! Just because it can work with ABBA songs does not mean it should be tried with a perfectly awesome mecha anime. For goodness sakes, make something original!Sound: 7. I liked the sound. I liked the ending song. I really didn't pay attention to much else. I can be satisfied by the fact that, although strange, mini-fairy!Nirvash was cute and made nice noises. (Yes that really was one of my favorite things.)Character: 7. Thinking of this as a separate entity from the actual ES series and using this thought to understand the characters better, I was at first intrigued by how everyone had changed. The Sages became very important military figures. Holland and the Gekko State became evil misguided souls. Dominic and Anemone were main people and highly important to the overall status of the movie. To be honest, I could really appreciate this change. Though I disliked some of it, there was development here I could respect. Still, what happened with some of the Gekko State members annoyed me. Evil and misguided is okay. But vicious paranoid rapists? Sorry. I don't approve.Enjoyment is self explanatory. It's obvious I didn't like it nor did I amuse myself by watching it. However, I gave that category a four. There were parts with Eureka and Renton that sometimes made it worth sitting through every painful scene edit.

But if you liked the series, you probably aren\'t going to enjoy this beyond the animation.The producers\' changes, I believe are an effort to ""condense"" the symbolism and themes of the series for a new audience.

Innocence lost seems to be the condensation of the series thematic core. This becomes clearer as Eureka\'s character comes into view, the Gekkostate\'s backstory is revealed, and Eureka and Renton\'s relationship culminates to fatalistic dry-humping instead of self-sacrificing romance.If anything, in redefining the Sub-coral as the image, fans can learn more of what these creatures were all about...assuming you didn\'t draw enough conclusion from the series.

I marathoned the TV series and finished in 2 and a 1/2 days. Absolutely loved it.I watched this movie right after I finished the series so I was able to make a direct comparison easily.If you loved the TV series, do not watch the movie. It will only ruin the characters you grew to love and leave you with a horrible impression of Eureka 7.90% of the scenes in this movie are re-used from the original series. That includes almost every battle scene and scenes that occur...on the Gekko ship. I have no clue why people are saying things like ""the animation got a lot better"" cause its exactly the same as the series. I\'m guessing it\'s because the series aired in 2005 and movie showed in 2009. People can forget a lot in 4 years worth.This movie is nothing more than a compilation of scenes from the anime with a new voice track. The story told in this movie is nothing but garbage compared to the series. It was as if the company was trying to find a cheap way to make more money off the series by tricking the fans into thinking this was something new.I would only recommend this movie to people who miss the Renton x Eureka couple and would like a to see more cute scenes or people who want to see Anemone sane.For people looking for a quick way to know the story of Eureka 7 without watching all 50 episodes, please do not use this movie as a resort.

Produced by BONES (incredible artwork).  The aliens are called ""image"" and look like giant space fish that are able to literally cut away space.Story:Basically, Renton is a special child able to speak with faries (what Nirvash is in this film) and grows up with Eureka, but she is taken captive...by the military so Renton goes on a mission to save her with Nirvash.  Meanwhile humankind is debating the use of the ""hammer of god"" (an ultimate weapon) which can exterminate the ""image"" existance entirely but is also likely to make Earth uninhabitable.The story is completely different from the TV series and basically like a parallel universe.  I personally didnt like the new story as much as the old story mainly because it didnt have the heavy contrasts of brutality (ESPECIALLY on Eureka\'s part).  It was still enjoyable but it was nothing extraordinary.Art:Phenomenal.  Expect nothing less from BONES.  The fight scenes are incredibly fluid and are absolutely stunning to watch.  Even outside the fights, everything is extremely well drawn.Sound:No big complaints and the ED is a great track as a bonus.  I think a karaoke in the middle during the climax fight scene would have been appropriate is all... which is why i didnt give it a 10; but it still works great without it.Characters:As ive already alluded to in the story section... theres not much character growth, but somewhat understandable given the length a film has to work with vs a 50 episode TV series.  I REALLY was dissapointed with the lack of Eureka and Anemone\'s darker sides.  If you saw the TV series... mostly all of the characters have the same attitude/demeanor in the film as they do at the end of the TV series and dont really deviate much from that ~ IE renton being very protective, eureka being very calm, holland showing off his soft side... etc.Also, i felt that at times, kameo appearances from characters that appeared in the TV series were very unnecessary and wasted time as they really didnt do anything except say ""oh thats beautiful"" or something stupid.Overall:This is still a very enjoyable watch if not just for the amazing artwork BONES has put together.  I wish the characters would have shown more growth, but i cant complain too much since the available time in a movie is much shorter than the 50 episode TV series im comparing it to.I recommend watching the TV series if you liked this movie ~ you will probably enjoy the TV series even more as it shows off a lot of different moods and sides for the characters. by the military so Renton goes on a mission to save her with Nirvash.

I was expecting to be wowed.  I was expecting to be astounded.  I was ready and willing to be blown away!  ...What did I get?  A load of garbage.To begin I am a huge fan of Eureka Seven TV.  But be aware...that even if I wasn't and had never seen the original series, this series would POSSIBLY only get one more point.The movie opens to Renton and Eureka as children, making a point of how they were raised together.  This opening is extremely cute and enjoyable.  With a little plushy version of the Nirvash, and Dominic taking on the role of their teacher.  Unfortunately after this short introduction everything changes.  Several years later, Renton joined the military in order to find Eureka...How that makes any sense when he should hate the military for splitting them up and there being other ways (a.k.a. the way they did in the ORIGINAL SERIES of going AGAINST the government) to go about things.  But anyways, there he is, and all of a sudden she's there in the middle of a battlefield (another thing that makes no sense when the military SHOULD have her kept safely hidden away..)  Either way, we find out that Eureka suffers from Green I Am Legend disease, and we move on from there to a whole compelling (sarcasm) storyline.Ok let me do this review correctly.  I'll try to keep my ranting to a bare minimum.Art 4:  The art was VERY good for the most part, the character designs being the same as the original series.  Unfortunately, they try to recreate things from the original series and epically fail at the same time.  The nirvash's appearance for example is completely (very similar but definitely not the Nirvash I know and love) different, and not in a good way.  Not only that but when it transforms (ONCE) it looks even worse.  The art is good, but fails in areas I cannot forgive it for.  So I give it a 4.Sound:  The ONLY reason this section got a 3 is for one reason and one reason only.  Nirvash....SHOULD NOT HAVE A CHIBI'S VOICE!!!  It's so stupid its painful.  The most epic parts of this movie are completely ruined by this little voice screaming needles into my ears right at the most dramatic part of a battle.  Other than that the sound was ok but not worht mentioning bringing nothing really new to the table and leaving out the best music it could have brought back, in much the same way the Death Note live action movies failed.Character 5: I like how they change the characters around giving them different roles in this story, but that is the ONLY good thing I can say about the characters.  They are all dolts and idiots.  Eureka, unlike the series is a whiny little girl who always is relying on people and has no ability to do anything on her own.  Renton becomes an angsty little pansy emo.  The entire Gecko becomes cultist rediculously pregidoused pricks.  Honestly making Anemone and Dominic the ONLY good characters in this movie and they make little to no appearance in the movie (Dominic only geting the beggining scene and then being bashed by Renton later on)  The character portayals are disgusting.Story 1:  It is pathetic when you can't create anything origianl and rely on not only stealing great things from an amazing show and ruining them but also trying and failing to incorperate a childrens story.  So apparently Renton and Eureka were RAISED in the Warsaw area??  It's like every cliche they COULD take from the original series they did.  Then trying to make it out to be a Peter Pan in Neverland overall theme...it disgusts me.  Creating nothing original is NOT what people want from a sequel to an amazing series and anyone who TRIES to say this is a standalone work after watching it I say you are a complete imbecile!!  There is a whole major plot scene where they show an alternate world DIRECTLY connecting it to the original story!!I give this a pass and I pray that anyone who watches this movie please remember that I did warn against it. that even if I wasn't and had never seen the original series, this series would POSSIBLY only get one more point.The movie opens to Renton and Eureka as children, making a point of how they were raised together.

"", 'Title(s):Eureka seveN: Pocket Full of RainbowsEureka Seven: Good Night Sleep Tight Young LoversRating: 9/10Review:Some of you may be reading this review because you\'d like to hear an opinion on the recent Eureka seveN film which will thus aid you in your decision of whether or not to see this movie. Some of you may be fans of the TV series, whereas some of you may have neglected to check out the TV series but are interested in this movie anyways. Well, the good thing is that you most certainly do not have to see the original TV series first before watching this, because this...movie is set in an alternate universe. That being said, most fans weren\'t so happy when they heard this: even more so when recycled/re-used footage was to be involved. Apparently only over 40% of new footage was to be used, according to various online sources and interviews with the animators. That being said, there wasn\'t much hope for this movie with its leaked situation.That is, until the actual movie RELEASED online (and later on in U.S theaters) and stunned fans and newbs alike! I, myself, am a really, REALLY huge Eureka seveN fan. To me, the TV series was one of the greatest and most original anime ever created, and I still stand by that statement. So, as for the movie? Let\'s just put it this way: Tears of joy were streaming down my eyes within the first 5 minutes, JUST because of the shiny new animation which so many fans had longed for. Ok, so the movie\'s plot is something along the lines of this: It is a time of war, pitting man against an alien race known as Image/EIZO. Eureka and Renton are small childhood friends and are living carefree lives with their Professor, Dominic. Eureka is a humanoid Image/EIZO, created to covet memories of living with the humans and eventually hand those memories over to Image/EIZO and be discarded. She gets taken away from Renton at a young age by the military for testing, and Renton vows to save her no matter the cost. 8 years later, he is a lieutenant in the 303rd Division of the military, known as The Gekkostate. One of his missions is to retrieve the secret military object which is, of course, Eureka. He rescues her, and the whole plot behind the Gekkostate Crew\'s true intentions unfold as well as the end of Image/EIZO\'s reign as the movie progresses.SO! The plotline for the movie is actually pretty decent. If you\'re a fan of the TV series, than the Gekkostate\'s ""true intentions"" seem a bit hard to swallow at first. It might take another viewing to understand what they are, exactly. Also, the recycled footage is nothing to be scared about. The re-used footage was actually edited a bit (eg. Holland yelling in the pilot seat of the Devilfish at night is turned into Holland yelling in the pilot seat of the Devilfish in broad daylight) so it\'s not like you see a recycled scene and got bored because you\'d seen it already. The NEW animation was absolutely beautiful. I believe Kinema Citrus aided Studio BONES in animating it, so that\'s probably why it was so shiny and such. xDThe film itself does not seem too short, nor too long (which is great) because it\'s around 2 hours in total, give or take 3 - 5 minutes. The soundtrack is once again phenomenal (nothing less to be expected from the great Naoki Sato) and I would suggest buying/downloading it when you get the chance.The ending was... confusing. It actually took me 3 times watching it and a discussion or two about said ending to come up with my own theory, but trust me, once you come up with that theory, EVERYTHING makes sense. When you are watching the movie, I\'d advise for you to bring your knowledge of various religions to the table. The TV series had religious subtleties, and thus the movie does as well. If you\'re absolutely stumped on one part during the ending, go to Wikipedia; there\'s a giant trivia section which should help loads.Overall, it was a fantastic movie. Great music, great new animation, a nice plot, and overall a fresh new look at Eureka seveN. The only thing it lacked (that I found) was depth in Anemone and Dominic\'s roles/storyline. If you watch the movie, you know what I mean.Thank you for reading this review, and I hope you enjoy the movie! movie is set in an alternate universe. That being said, most fans weren\'t so happy when they heard this: even more so when recycled/re-used footage was to be involved. Apparently only over 40% of new footage was to be used, according to various online sources and interviews with the animators. That being said, there wasn\'t much hope for this movie with its leaked situation.That is, until the actual movie RELEASED online (and later on in U.S theaters) and stunned fans and newbs alike! I, myself, am a really, REALLY huge Eureka seveN fan. To me, the TV series was one of the greatest and most original anime ever created, and I still stand by that statement. So, as for the movie? Let\'s just put it this way: Tears of joy were streaming down my eyes within the first 5 minutes, JUST because of the shiny new animation which so many fans had longed for.

When he rubbed the urn to clear the dust from it, he was enveloped by a blinding white light and found himself floating naked in the middle of nowhere.Suddenly he head the sound of a deep voice, that felt like it was talking directly to his brain: ""Human, you have found my urn and for that i shall grant you one wish. Ask anything you want"", said the voice.Tomoki thought for a few seconds, and...then the answer became clear. ""I want to make the most fucking epic animated movie of all times!"", he  shouted to the nothingness with great determination.""So be it"", said the voice. And after a deafening sound he woke up in his hotel room covered in sweat. Doubting if what he had seen was just a dream, he started his new proyect ""Eureka Seven: Pocket Full of Rainbows"".When he released the movie in 2009, Tomoki rejoiced, not only by the spectacular success of his movie, but also because he knew that his wish had been granted...Certainly for some people, implying that this movie was in part created by a divine superior being may sound a little too crazy. But after seeing countless shows, OVAs, and movies that reek of mediocrity and weak plots. This movie feels like it\'s been made by something or someone out of this world.But enough of my insane rambling, let\'s start with this review.Story / Plot development - 10Impressive story, incredibly well executed. This story has everything, char development, (lots of) action, drama and love, but above everything it has a perfect balance between those four. For example:A fight breaks out, after the fight the plot advances, after going a little forward you see a flashback explaining some of the current loose ends, then another fight, an investigation sub-plot appears, the plot advances, another fight, a plot twist, the characters relatioships shift, a flashback, and so on.The focus of the movie is always changing, and that dynamism make it seem always fresh, makes it seem like everything happens for a reason, that there are no random bullshit events here.You will see that the story advances to a certain destination, but instead of plainly going in a straight line, it travels along different and intresting paths. This must be thanks to the vast amount of supporting characters this movie has, and that almost each and everyone of those supp chars get the chance to tell their story. And you will get to see how all those stories end too.Also the story has nothing to do with the story of the TV show, but the movie is self conclusive. The new plot is presented and concluded in the duration of the movie. So there is no need to have previously watched the tv show in order to understand the movie.Art / Animation - 10The characters look beautiful, the robots look impressive, the aliens look scary and the backgrounds are simply breathtaking. I can\'t think of a single bad thing to say about the art in this movie.The animation gets a 10 too. The fights are spectacular and the robots movements look really natural, but the most epic display of animation in this movie is seen in the explosions.I don\'t really know much about animation or coloring techniques, so i can\'t get ""technical"" in this section. But even without knowing anything, i can assure you that the art and animation are very enjoyable.Sound - 10The sound in Eureka Seven: Pocket Full of Rainbows is in another level from the rest of the movies i\'ve seen. I strongly recommend watching this movie with a 5.1 surround system or a powerful headset, at maximum volume.Character / Character development - 10First of all, the reason why this section gets a 10 is because this movie contains no archetypes. Archetypes are the generic overused characters you find in 9 out of 10 shows in each genre. For example, the tsundere childhood friend, the naughty lolita, the quiet girl with glasses, etc.Each character in this movie is unique and that\'s something really rare to find in current shows / movies. It takes a lot of courage to break away from the popular character formula that is known to work like a charm.Now for the character development. Character development is an important aspect of the plot in this movie. The story won\'t expect you to accept something like ""Oh ok, this guy wants to protect this girl just couse he keeps saying it"". No, you will see enough of everyone\'s past (and present as the plot develops) to understand why they act like they do, and why they make the choices that theymake.Enjoyment - 10Complex but thouroughly explained plot, unique characters, outwordly art, animation, and sound. There is no way someone won\'t enjoy this movie. In my humble opinion that is.Overall - 10This movie is a must watch, it gets a solid 10 (TEN). I recommend it for everyone. Even for those who doesn\'t like too much plot and would rather watch some ""moeblob"" full of fanservice. Just give it a try, you might get a nice surprise. then the answer became clear.

Just give it a try, you might get a nice surprise.', '\'Eureka Seven: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers\' is truly abominable.Mild spoilers ahead, although I recommend reading them even if (especially if) you haven\'t seen the movie yet.I was very surprised to hear that this movie was directed by Tomoki Kyouda, who also directed the original series. While I was watching, I felt pretty safe in assuming this movie was made by someone who hated Kyouda\'s guts. Maybe he does?The basic premise is that it\'s like an ""Alternate universe retelling"" of the story of Eureka Seven, which I presume is supposed to be Studio Bones\' excuse for reusing cuts of animation from important moments in...the original series. Not only were the creators of this movie content with attempting to ruin the legacy of indivudual cuts of animation, they also felt the need to screw with the characters, too.The writing in this movie feels like Kyouda was feeding the script of Eureka Seven into a machine learning algorithm along with some of the lowest rated fanfiction he could find, which is the only reasonable explanation I can think of as to why most of the cast has an impossibly contrived backstory involving time travel and accelerated aging, just to explain why they look the exact same as they did in the main series, despite allegedly being completely new characters. This is made even worse by the faux-philosophical bullshit they come up with to try and justify it.My initially high hopes for this movie were gradually worn down the longer I watched it, but the moment when two crew members of the Gekko (who, in the main series, were supportive figures for Renton and Eureka) pin Eureka down and attempt to remove her clothes to ""check if she\'s an alien"", any potential goodwill I might have had left towards this movie was gone. Not only is Eureka stripped of her identity and characterisation and reduced into a pale shadow of herself, she also is forced to feature in a thinly veiled ""rape"" scene. Fuck this movie.The only worthwhile thing about this movie is a small handful of original cuts of animation, which I would recommend looking up online rather than watching this pitiful excuse for a movie.Don\'t watch this, regardless of whether or not you\'ve seen any other parts of the series. the original series.

No logic in story, no logic in characters actions. First 30 mins ae unwatchable just there are no attempts to tell us what's going on! It looks like authors imagined severeal cool scenies and couldn't connect them and didn't even try to do this!They just showed us Eureka and that's enough...So overall - Dreadful! "", 'Eureka Seven: Pocket Full or Rainbows is the first and for the time being, the only movie based on Eureka Seven. Bones instead of doing a sequel or prequel decided to make an alternate universe using the characters of the original Eureka Seven and also many things that people that have seen the original series will remember. Ok, let\'s start with the review but be warned that having watched the original anime I have some mixed feelings about the movie.Story: It is good on its own right but it doesn\'t close to the original. In this movie Renton and Eureka are friends since they were...kids, suddenly one day the military comes to the place where Eureka is and they take her away from Renton. When he grows up he enters the army and then he is recruited for enter the Gekko Go. When they were defending a town, Renton manages to find Eureka and he takes her to the Gekko Go. This is just the beginning of the story of the movie but it is interesting and has alot of surprises waiting for you. For me the story gets a 8/10.Art: Well, comparing the original Eureka Seven there is an upgrade on the visuals, it looks better but there is also one bad point of the art and that is something I\'m quite annoyed, Bones recycled alot of places from the original Eureka Seven. Yeah, there are some places that are made for this movie like the beginning but after that almost everything is recycled. For this the movie gets a 7/10.Sound: Original seiyuus from the original and like the original, they did a good job voicing their characters. 8/10.Characters: Even if Bones used the same characters of the original series for make this movie, there are alot of changes for some characters. Renton is almost the same as the original but this time he is the one that understand the new Nirvash, characters like Eureka change alot, for example, Eureka in the original was a quiet girl that hardly talked at the beginning but here she is always calling Renton baka when he does something imprudent, Dominik instead of being the reckless guy of the original here is a serious guy and the sensei of Renton and Eureka, others change too like Hap, Anemone... The bad thing here is that it lacks the character development of the original but being a movie of almost two hours it is ok. 7/10.Overall: Eureka Seven: Pocket Full of Rainbows is a good movie. For people that haven\'t watched the anime will like it alot and even, for people that have watched the anime will like it even if you feel like me that there are alot of things that you have seen but there are some differences. Personally I didn\'t like so much the backstory of the crew of the Gekko Go or that Dominik and Anemone didn\'t have an active role like in the original or that they didn\'t explain alot. There is something that really turned me off, in this one the Nirvash and TheEnd weren\'t originally the robots we know, instead they are some ""cute"" small things called fairies and for some reason they can turn into the mechas, that is clearly the only thing that I hated of this movie and instead of explaining what they were and how they transformed into the mechas Bones didn\'t do that. Overall I give Eureka Seven: The Movie a 7/10. kids, suddenly one day the military comes to the place where Eureka is and they take her away from Renton.

Overall I give Eureka Seven: The Movie a 7/10.', 'I have read other reviews regarding this anime movie, and I sympathize with their criticisms as well as their overall rating. However, I would like to vindicate this movie by defending it from a different perspective.Granted, this movie does not provide a continual story from the original series, and many (including I) were much confused. I totally tried to wrap my head around to see if the movie plot was in a distant future, but as the minutes went by I realized that the movie has a plot of its own.With that said, you need to arm yourself with a different perspective to truly appreciate...the movie. The plot is independent, but the strength of this movie comes from the continuation of character in the Eureka Seven world. You will notice that the way Renton or Eureka acts is much more mature (or developed) than the earlier part of the original series. I think the movie directors painstakingly tried to (and successfully they did) continue and further develop the characters. This in effect allows us (Who watched the original series) to connect with our familiar characters without difficulty, although the unfamiliar plot does become a significant distraction. This will explain why certain other characters, such as Dominic, to hold a more mature position in the plot without feeling to awkward to the viewer.With the rich character development as well as an outstanding musical score, I believe the difficulty regarding the plot can easily be overlooked. Bringing in a new story to this type of movie does have one critical benefit: if the story did ""stink"", nevertheless the plot of the original series is untainted due to the distinct separation of the movie\'s and the series\' plot.This is my first review.

They kept throwing random crap which made absolutely no sense. there was no development between the character what so ever. WHY THE HELL DID THEY MADE THE GEKKO TEAM A BUNCH OF CRAZY TOSSERS. seriously wtf. But i must say that the fights were rly good. GOOD OLD SCHOOL MECH FIGHT YAY. But overall i was rly looking forward to a eureka seven...movie hoping it to be a continuation of the series for like 5 years only to have it throw back in my face...  Thanks Bones for throwing a piece of crap in my face.O yea if you guys wana to know another great anime watch Ergo Proxy. Probably one of the best ADULT animes i have seen. Recommend to all Eureka Seven Fans!!!! PEACE movie hoping it to be a continuation of the series for like 5 years only to have it throw back in my face...  Thanks Bones for throwing a piece of crap in my face.O yea if you guys wana to know another great anime watch Ergo Proxy. Probably one of the best ADULT animes i have seen. Recommend to all Eureka Seven Fans!!!! PEACE', ""Eureka Seven holds a dear place in my heart.  Its an excellent take on the giant robot genre that wonderfully fuses action, drama, romance and comedy.  As such, my expectations for the movie were high.  Quite high, in fact.  Bones could've been forgiven if they hadn't been fully able to condense the magic of the series into confines of a two-hour film.  No shame in making a movie not as good as the series, right?Well, that might be the case had Bones actually made a decent movie.  Alas, Good Night, Sleep Tight Young Lovers is by no...stretch of the imagination a decent movie.  Hell, its not even okay.  It's pointless nonsense and I mean that literally.  Pointless because it offers nothing compelling or interesting that merited the story being reworked while heavily recycling from the series, and nonsense because it is completely incomprehensible.  And I don't mean incomprehensible as in ambiguous; its not that the presentation is obscure or liable to differing interpretations.  Its that when characters are explaining important plot points, they speak in abstruse, philosophical babble that confuses the viewer.  I'm still not sure what I watched but I'm fairly confident I don't want to know.There are other problems with the film; pacing, exposition, and characters all pale in comparison to the original.  And as a personal taste, I found the larval forms of the KLFs highly annoying and completely out of place in the film, which was fairly serious, if not grim.  The visuals were mostly good and at times even beautiful.  As far as music, to be honest I hardly even paid attention to it so I guess it didn't leave much of an impression on me.Overall, this movie was a disaster and its very disappointing to see the franchise take such a misstep with this movie.  It's a shameless attempt by Bones to milk their creative property for all its worth.  Eureka Seven and anime fans alike, don't watch this movie. stretch of the imagination a decent movie.

The story flowed well, mostly revolving around Renten and Eureka , the movie showed the global events and battles of other sub characters to help build structural development and understanding of the story. Art was great,and the fact that there were a few redrawn action scenes doesn't leave a significant bad aftertaste. The movie can be somewhat mainstream at times, flashy power ups and common reunions, but something so...simple and overused can always be a great heartwarmer everytime. If one can overlook the small faults within the movie, this movie is truly worth watchingMusic fit well, suspense was great and not overexaggerated. I very well enjoyed the movie. Certainly not a waste of time, unless your a hardcore worshiper who obstinately refuses to expunge bias feelings, or if the theme is not ones preference.This movie is aimed that those who can earnestly watch an anime without bias comparison and have a interest with action and romance. simple and overused can always be a great heartwarmer everytime.

I really found it interesting and fresh to see the Eureka Seven anime and characters in a new light. Though some thing felt rushed and i didn't really like what they did with the Gekko crew. Even so, they movie was really good. Story wise, i am stuck between both the anime and movie. Both had their ups and downs, though in my mind, the movie had a much more...preferable ending. (simply because it was not so complex and hard to understand) Finally, to all the people that have or are going to compare this movie to the anime...don't. This is not the anime, the characters are not the same, the background is not the same. Just take my advise, when you are watching this film, don't even think about the anime, trust me, you will have a greater understanding and appreciation for the film.  give it a 10/10(sorry if that wasn't all that brief) preferable ending.

"", ""Before i start telling you details about the movie, I personally recommend that viewers watch the anime first before watching the movie itself.Though the movie is altered from the anime from every perspective - The viewer would most likely enjoy the movie's plot alot better than someone unfamiliar with the anime.The movie takes place in the 21st century unlike the original anime which is set later after many years into the future, but every major character in the Original Anime will be shown in Movie.The animation of the movie was quite thrilling. It was one of the best high definition anime movies out there and...the sound effects was put in quite well together with the animation to create a better aura.For anime lovers like myself, I suggest to watch this movie as it is one of those movies that you can only experience once in a lifetime. the sound effects was put in quite well together with the animation to create a better aura.For anime lovers like myself, I suggest to watch this movie as it is one of those movies that you can only experience once in a lifetime."", ""this has to be the worst OVA in anime history!

However, before giving my grade, I read the reviews and realized my mistake. Eureka Seven - good night, sleep tight, young lovers is an alternate retelling of history, something like ""what if?"" ""What if it had been that way?"" ""What if that was chosen instead?""... When I read the reviews, I immediately understood the idea of \u200b\u200bthe movie! Now the specifics:Story-7/10; I gave it a 7 because I understood that even after understanding what the movie was about, it didn\'t have a premise as good as the original anime, and it wouldn\'t be able to develop as well as the tv anime because it\'s a movie. The movie was in between a lot of boring, boring parts and really cool and different parts with intriguing and amazing moments. The ending was something really different from the original, the Coda as a writer of a new destiny, a new quest for paradise was very good, and the final part of Renton and Eureka was beautiful, but they only focused on Renton in the end, it would be nice to have finished with the image of the two, but that is my preference, irrelevant.Art-8/10; The film was really beautiful and optimized, I always thought the Eureka SeveN trait was something very beautiful and that matched the idea, the vibe of the story.Sound-7/10; I\'ll be honest... I only gave this note because I loved the closing song with passion, SPACE ROCK reminded me, left me with nostalgia, better saying, so good for the original anime soundtrack, I still listen to STORYWRITER and SAKURA, songs that are really part of the Eureka SeveN vibe... But I missed the electronic music that was so striking, because the background music... I didn\'t even notice.Characters-7/10; The reason for this note is that I missed the presence of some characters, I know they didn\'t appear because the story was totally different, but I could have at least mentioned them or shown them a little in situations that would make sense. I was very sad about Dominic and Anemone to some extent, but it made sense what happened to Dominic and Anemone in this movie. But the explanation of why the crew is different and why the main villain doesn\'t show up was pretty weird to me, but it was, in a way, satisfying for the sequel to the story, even though it was nothing to me.enjoyment-7/10; watch this as if it were an alternate story, without much connection to the original story.as I said before, I got the movie wrong and didn\'t enjoy it too much, but after realizing my mistake, I stopped to think and the movie makes sense for what it\'s proposed, after that I realized that I really enjoy certain parts of the movie. movie and some scenes that I didn\'t understand/had been furious for being rushed/different from the original, started to make sense, it was a good feeling to see this movie, but nothing much. final scenes by Eureka and Renton and the closing song, which really is Eureka SeveN level, superb.

This show is funny, likable, and overall you'll be very pleased with it.I feel a plot brewing, so don't worry- this anime has a direction!I can't give a completely accurate...review of this anime since only the first several episodes have been released, but I can tell that I'll enjoy this anime in the long run.The art is good, and all the characters look unique and none of them are an eyesore to look at. There isn't a huge character cast yet, but most of them are likable, so no worries there.I very much enjoy the characters voices, and those of you who are fans of Gintama, look out for two familiar voice actors!The OP and ED are both great, and this just seems like this show has a lot of potential if it gets far.I enjoy this anime and I am excited for the shows progression!

Regardless, I'd still give it an 8 just because the characters and the humor when it does work make it a silly, fun...ride.The characters here are quite likable. The main character is rather annoying at first, but he does seem to grow through it all and become increasingly likable. His traveling companions are more immediate. Princess Escarlate is wonderfully deadpan and amusing. Her knight Sanglain is serious and likable, while still crazy enough to provide good laughs. Mariandale is probably the best character the series has, having a great design, fun personality and being at times a surprisingly grounded and positive example of a transgendered character in a purposefully dumb shounen comedy anime. Rival Erecpyle and his subordinate team Incognito meanwhile offer big on comic mischief and are always fun to watch. All the while the party comes across minor characters who are sometimes equally crazy and fun. It's an appealing cast.The humor is focus here, and as humor is a subjective thing, it's what could potentially curtail enjoyment of the show. Ixion Saga's humor is very stupid, irreverent and often immature. As audacious as it sometimes gets, it can be worth quite a few good laughs if you're willing to laugh at that kind of humor.

MY. GOD. The character development that the team that worked on this show seriously put amazing effort in!!! The different types of personalities that each character\'s have is crazy! I could even say that this anime may possess one of the best character development I\'ve ever seen!

MY. GOD. The character development that the team that worked on this show seriously put amazing effort in!!! The different types of personalities that each character\'s have is crazy! I could even say that this anime may possess one of the best character development I\'ve ever seen! Not just the personalities are strongly different to each other, but the characteristics and actions each character has and presents in certain situations is great, I loved every single character, no matter how evil or heroic they were, or even idiotic! (trust me, there\'s a lot of idiots in this show, the main one being the male protagonist!)Enjoyment ?If only there was a better word to describe how enjoyable something was other than the word ""enjoyment"" itself!I\'ve been on a long spree of anime recently, I didn\'t think I could find much better anime than things I\'ve previously watched (which is a lot of anime!) but sweet mama.. Was I wrong.Overall ?I want to solely declare that this anime is perhaps one of the best anime ever created.. Seriously. More so, I want to thank the people who put their time and effort in creating this masterpiece, personally. The amount of LAUGHTER I had in every episode of this show was crazy! I had trouble breathing (for real, I have asthma!) -- So yes, thank you so much for this anime. This anime, personally I\'d say is the..FUNNIEST ANIME OF ALL TIME WINNER -- Awarded by iAkali.(I\'m doing ""Awards"" for anime that I find are worthy of such, also opening a YouTube channel for reviews so I can give a much better review with visual aspects. I will be talking to someone in hopes of YouTube Partnership and the such. I definitely recommend this anime to anyone who loves to laugh!)', 'Just finished watching Ixion Saga .Mixed Feelings about that one :Ixion Saga can me summarized as an attempt to replicate the relaxed/wtf/lol?/laid-back style Gintama made popular in Anime .In this style a lack of a greater overarching plot , comedy and dirty jokes , excellent sound-soundtrack choices and strange character are the standard .The style is great , Gintama that introduced it in the Anime industry a masterpiece .Let\'s see how Ixion Saga DT fared though :Story-3As i said before the specific sub-genre/style Ixion belongs to lacks plot lines as it\'s main points .Even though i take that as a given , still Ixion Saga...could have fared much better: it tries to use the story both as a background and as a hook/point of interest , with the result being a failure in both attempts .The story is not absent - it is there , but it is ignored , resulting in some disbelief and boredom that could have been (easily ?Dont know .) avoided .The lack of progress endangers the whole series as the viewer can become tired of what seems as meaningless events , spawning at each episode like NPCs in a RPG game that is just too full of grind .And i know that the fans might defend the series reminding me that Ixion , like Gintama dont require a master story - yet still having seen and loved Gintama and even Sket , i have to commend that Ixion Saga\'s story can be compared with boring Pokemon episodes but not with the tense and emotional charged story arcs the two aforementioned shows field .(Let it be known that the last episode has a much better written story than the rest of the show- a wonderful surprise rewarding us for making it to the end !)Art-6Nothing great , nothing good , nothing bad .Lately Art seems to have been standardized .I kind of miss the variety the 90s and the 2000s had : each show had it\'s own style for good or for bad .And there were always glitches to be found .The much cheaper/improved technology of today has eliminated visual errors and unusual/unique art styles from most series today.Sound-8Ixion Saga has great sounds and soundtracks :the level was on par with Gintama !Different music genres , familiar chords and styles , variation - the soundtracks were great and played a nice part in drawing you into the series . There was Rhythm and good taste in orchestration and song choices .And the most surprising fact is that i am not talking about the OP/ED - no , i actually didnt liked those two - i am talking about background themes .Very good on sound .Characters-6Ixion Saga\'s Chars are interesting and funny : each has his own fetish plus some perks - and each gets a decent amount of attention in the show .And here is where trouble ensues :the characters while are interesting seem to have been made with some kind of character generator you can find for RPGs .They are too much replicas from the Gintama series- something that becomes even more obvious when you actually hear half the cast of Gintama playing as the main chars in Ixion Saga .There was a lack of originality - i find myself imagining the people that designed the character watching Gintama and saying to each other ""Ok that was good , what can we use instead of that ?"" .In short if you ve seen Gintama you ll see no new character concepts in Ixion Saga .They have somewhat recycled the chars from it .Enjoyment 6 - Overall 5Ixion Saga is a fun Anime and it sure is enjoying watching one .With all the the lack of originality it still has some entertaining value .However -and with that i sum it up - this show has copied Gintama at so many major points , so obviously that one can clearly feel the lack of dedication and investment from the creators  .And since those two things are what make an Anime interesting and enjoying to watch i can say that this show is worth watching without lying .Ixion Saga is for Gintama what the many industrial Harem anime are for their originals . could have fared much better: it tries to use the story both as a background and as a hook/point of interest , with the result being a failure in both attempts .The story is not absent - it is there , but it is ignored , resulting in some disbelief and boredom that could have been (easily ?Dont know .) avoided .The lack of progress endangers the whole series as the viewer can become tired of what seems as meaningless events , spawning at each episode like NPCs in a RPG game that is just too full of grind .And i know that the fans might defend the series reminding me that Ixion , like Gintama dont require a master story - yet still having seen and loved Gintama and even Sket , i have to commend that Ixion Saga\'s story can be compared with boring Pokemon episodes but not with the tense and emotional charged story arcs the two aforementioned shows field .(Let it be known that the last episode has a much better written story than the rest of the show- a wonderful surprise rewarding us for making it to the end !)Art-6Nothing great , nothing good , nothing bad .Lately Art seems to have been standardized .I kind of miss the variety the 90s and the 2000s had : each show had it\'s own style for good or for bad .And there were always glitches to be found .The much cheaper/improved technology of today has eliminated visual errors and unusual/unique art styles from most series today.Sound-8Ixion Saga has great sounds and soundtracks :the level was on par with Gintama !Different music genres , familiar chords and styles , variation - the soundtracks were great and played a nice part in drawing you into the series .

Co'z this was not the kind of anime that one must categorize it as a whole but it was something that has to be categorize on a per episode basis, and frankly, that's what director Shinji Takamatsu was aiming, he probably wants us audience to forget...everything what was this anime about and just focus on each episode, in other words this anime as a whole was more of a gag type than anything else, since there was no plot to begin with just a scenario on a per episode basis.So, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category:POOR 3.Story- like I said, there is no plot just situation that on every episode and each episode has a plot on it's own.Character- regardless of the characters info.........something that one must just forget, co'z on every episode that characters take a new form, which one would be irritated with, at one point in any given episode and appreciated on the other.But I'm sure everybody will agree with me that Kon is one big loud mouth a***** that everyone wants to take a swing at, and Erec and his Incognitos are a bunch of retards, as for Mariandale, I'm also sure that everyone will agree with me that she should've have been cast as a girl and not some cross-dressing man.GOOD 7.Art- I like the design and the way the character's where illustrated and I'm referring to  Mariandale, Almaflora , Ecarlate and  Sainglain. I also like the way how them Incognitos were drawn.Sound- though, Kon maybe the kind of character whose butt  I wanna kick, I still like the guy who did his voice, the same with Erec and his Incognitos. I also like this anime's opening theme, but not the closing.FAIR 6.Enjoyment- I gave it a 6 because, there are episode that I find it funny and there are those episodes that where downright corny.Overall- this is something which it would depend on oneself if which episode that's worth watching and which are worth skipping. Frankly, studio Brain's Base should have just leave it as an on-line game than make an anime out of it. everything what was this anime about and just focus on each episode, in other words this anime as a whole was more of a gag type than anything else, since there was no plot to begin with just a scenario on a per episode basis.So, here are my ratings for each of this anime's category:POOR 3.Story- like I said, there is no plot just situation that on every episode and each episode has a plot on it's own.Character- regardless of the characters info.........something that one must just forget, co'z on every episode that characters take a new form, which one would be irritated with, at one point in any given episode and appreciated on the other.But I'm sure everybody will agree with me that Kon is one big loud mouth a***** that everyone wants to take a swing at, and Erec and his Incognitos are a bunch of retards, as for Mariandale, I'm also sure that everyone will agree with me that she should've have been cast as a girl and not some cross-dressing man.GOOD 7.Art- I like the design and the way the character's where illustrated and I'm referring to  Mariandale, Almaflora , Ecarlate and  Sainglain.

In other words: the protagonist is an MMO player (A somewhat good one or great one at that) and somehow gets intertwined within the game itself.The thing is, Ixion Saga DT doesn't really shine in any category. In terms of action, there isn't much incredible fighting nor abilities if that's what you're looking for. In terms of humor, it's generally lame slapstick and puns. Story-wise, there isn't much depth to it and the development is incredibly slow (4 episodes in and they spent an entire one on...slapstick humor with a flying squirrel-like creature) and rather mediocre.The characters aren't very interesting either. You have one gamer that's almost perfectly normal with no standout qualities, one tranny that drawn moe style (Which isn't really that funny), one blockhead fighter and a princess which is a child.In other words, you're in for a rather bland anime with some lame slapstick humor and a mediocre storyline.

Watch this and enjoy.', 'Japan seems to be pumping out some trashy anime lately (e.g. Blood-c & Blood-c the Last Dark) and Ixion Saga DT just happens to be one of them. So if you\'re done with intelligent anime productions and would like to feed your eyes and mind with complete garbage, then look no further cause surely you\'ve come to the right anime.ISDT follows Kon Hokaze\'s arrival in this new world he\'s arrived in. Through many odd circumstances he ends up being paired with a lolicon princess, a male turned female transvestite and a generic looking strong soldier. He also gets tagged by his new foes with...the nickname ""DT"" which is the shortened form for ""male virgin"" in Japan. I mean who laughs at virgin jokes anymore? Well even I would if it was sold properly but the joke fails every time its used here, why? Many reasons. For one the writers arent all that proficient in comedy writing and another reason could be the voice actor for Kon but I\'d still blame the character he\'s written as and the lines he\'s given. The horror of this becomes apparent when you realize this is going to be a recurring joke throughout the anime. ISDT does succeed in some funny jokes though, but they aren\'t nearly enough to have you put up with 25 episodes worth of garbage and its other bad/fail/force-fed jokes.The viewer is taken to generic locations prominent in anime like the beach/a hot springs bath (onsen) and shown all the stereotypical things you\'d expect if you\'ve seen enough anime. Whats worse is whole episodes are wasted in such places doing nothing, the story dosent progress and if you didnt know any better you\'d think they were filler episodes put right at the beginning of an anime. It wouldnt be so bad if these ""fillers"" were any good but sadly they arent.The art scores highest amongst everything else this anime offers but its not perfect either. You still got a couple of scenes switched with crappy animation. The sound is just sad. The show starts off with this intro where it feels like the words ""DT"" are being shoved down your throat. Then you get this voice acting that seems at odds with the characters they are cast as. Its almost like you can tell they are trying hard to make you laugh. Its not so bad when you actually laugh but you\'ll probably feel sorry for them when you dont since they seem to be trying so hard or you might just drop the show for realizing the crap that it is.Characters are rubbish. Kon the main character is filth of a character. If ever he had a strategy for his enemy and it failed, he\'d resort to any underhanded cheap shot available to him even if its something like kicking another dude in the nuts. The lolicon princess is smart and haughty while retaining some child like qualities. The strong/brute swordsman likes cute things but I guess that was tacked on to make him less one dimensional? He still is one dimensional imo. Then theres the beautiful trans girl who cooks, gives advice and sometimes talks with a deep manly voice while also supposedly perfect/role model like? Psh, rubbish. All the characters generally remain the same only tweaked sometimes to make another good/bad joke. The only character I liked was Erecpyle, a major foe who is honorable and fights clean but this is probably due his stark contrast with Kon who fights dirty if need be. I did sometimes find Kon interesting and entertaining but other than that he was just as annoying as every other character in the series.As you might be able to tell I didnt enjoy this show but I sat through it just so I could review it in its entirety. Cant really say it was worth it but at least I can let others know there\'s no light at the end of the tunnel here. To those thinking it might get better in later episodes or have some secret plot twist like Blood-c, well heres me telling you no, it doesnt. You do get some explanation of things somewhere around episode 21 but its not anything serious.In my opinion I think some people who are proficient in anime production sat down after seeing Gintama and thought they could do something along the same lines and make some bucks. This anime is the result of their failure. Despite how Gintama comes off as unserious an half-assed, alot of intelligence and work is put into it as well as comedic talent.

On the other hand a lot of great VA don`t sound great here, so if you watch this very average anime just for hearing favorite voices, you will get nothing but voice.

So far the series has been a bit disappointing except for the humor category.Story (5) - The story is about a kid who gets transferred into what seems like a game. I'm not really sure what the story is fully about yet and I've seen 15 episodes. Development is really lack and slow in this category but, you do find out some interesting facts about the main cast as well as the enemies. The enemies don't even feel like enemies at this point. So you...practically don't know who you are fighting until episode 15.Art (6) - the arts not bad at all. I'd say pretty fair, nothing extravagant or crazy. Not super appealing to my tastes.Sound (7) - I gave this a bit of a buff because I kind of liked the rock feel that was coming from the opening and ending. Definitely one of the better parts of the series.Character (7) - The development of the characters is actually decent. Some episodes are a little cheekish and stupid at best. Seems like a bit of a waste listening to a story about someones past for a WHOLE episode and finding out it's fake seconds later.Enjoyment (6) - The humor is the best part of the show. If you want to laugh at some points its worth it. There hasn't been much action or anything else at all.Overall (6) - If you want to sit down, enjoy a series, and get emotionally attached, I suggest something else. This series has been a total comedic relief so far. I hope some interesting factors start taking place eventually. practically don't know who you are fighting until episode 15.Art (6) - the arts not bad at all.

The graphics aren't beautiful, the characters don't have much depth, and the plot isn't praiseworthy.One of the specialities of this anime is the comedy, which I found okay, but not hilarious (unlike Gintama). Although I've seen other reviewers compare this to Gintama in terms of the episodic and comedic moments (the inapropro jokes about balls), the jokes are less natural and more forced and tend to be more repetitive.As I've only seen 3 episodes, it's not a bad series; however it's a worthwhile watch only if you're bored and want a few...quick laughs. And hopefully, the episodes will improve as the season continues. quick laughs. And hopefully, the episodes will improve as the season continues."", ""(Updated April 1, 2013 -- after seeing the final episode.)After watching “The Daily Lives of High School Boys” and almost dying from laughter, I made a little research and found this show. I have been meaning to find the funniest anime out there and this is perhaps the funniest one I have ever come across with.Despite this near death causing anime, this is not for everyone. If you are innocent or do not enjoy dark or perverted humor, which this anime has a lot of, then this is not the show for you.Story (8/10)The story is good but not mind-blowing. It has a...simple story – people going on a journey with a twist of typical war elements that you usually see in mecha anime, a few pinches of gaming fantasy elements and other illogical and unfitting genres. What makes the story kick, though, is the comedy that this show possesses. The ending, especially, would make you die of laughter. Despite that, unexpectedly, it would also make you sad at the same time once you finished this series.So why did I give it an 8, you may ask? I know the story is stupid but sadly it works. Its stupidity actually works. As a parody or a comedy series, it is good. As an original work of literature or as a masterpiece, forget about it.Art (7/10)The art is nicely laid out and fun to watch. The characters are drawn differently from one another and stand out on their own. The only thing is that the main characters roughly represent a lot of look-alikes in other popular shows such as how DT looks a lot like Mashiro from Bakuman, ED looks a lot like Kakashi from Naruto, Marian looks a lot like C.C. from Code Geass and so on. Though, still, this show is still a pure-bred comedy that contains a lot of parodies and these look-alikes may be taken negatively or positively depending how you look at it.Sound (9/10)What can I say? Even the music that they provide is funny as hell. The ending songs are funny and perhaps a bit perverted. Aside from being funny, it is also catchy. Since it was coming from the same director as Gintama and DLOHSB, expect a similar feel in their sounds. It was nicely done and did a great job bringing the funnies.Character (10/10)All of the main characters and even the supporting characters have strong and funny personalities and not to mention a lot of strange fetishes. They have also provided the audiences to soothe their own fetishes that range from a typical Lolita and otaku, cross-dressers and a bit of shonen ai, to sexy SM men.Overall, despite having a simple, and somewhat, even stupid mixed up story, for someone who enjoys this type of comedy and gamers, especially those who loves RPG, since they've thrown in a few dash of gaming otaku jokes which is also somewhat a reference to The World God Only Knows, would most definitely enjoy this show as well. simple story – people going on a journey with a twist of typical war elements that you usually see in mecha anime, a few pinches of gaming fantasy elements and other illogical and unfitting genres. What makes the story kick, though, is the comedy that this show possesses. The ending, especially, would make you die of laughter. Despite that, unexpectedly, it would also make you sad at the same time once you finished this series.So why did I give it an 8, you may ask? I know the story is stupid but sadly it works. Its stupidity actually works. As a parody or a comedy series, it is good. As an original work of literature or as a masterpiece, forget about it.Art (7/10)The art is nicely laid out and fun to watch. The characters are drawn differently from one another and stand out on their own. The only thing is that the main characters roughly represent a lot of look-alikes in other popular shows such as how DT looks a lot like Mashiro from Bakuman, ED looks a lot like Kakashi from Naruto, Marian looks a lot like C.C. from Code Geass and so on.

It is boring. This is really nothing more than ball joke after ball joke, not even well told.

In episode 4 we see just how this affects his personal life, him struggling with this issue and wondering how he can tell people, especially his fiancee.

Although, to be fair to the concept, I've looked at an anime based off of a Pachinko machine that was quite good. The anime was written by Yamatoya Akatsuki and developed by our old friends at Brain's Base. Which is a bit of a mixed sign since they've done some good stuff, some kind of mediocre stuff and some stuff that's utter shite. Let's see where this one falls.Story:Young Hokaze Kon is a gamer. While...playing Monster Hunter, or a game with very similar encounters with massive monsters, he meets a young lady player. They talk and she manages to get him to agree to help her. Which results in him being transferred to another world, chair and all. He accidentally falls on top of a man, saving a small group that was being cornered by him and his goons. Kon agrees to travel with the people he inadvertently rescued in order to find a way back to his own world. Together, they head on their journey to get an eight year old princess married for political reasons while also finding a way for Kon to return so he stops bothering everyone with his existence. Various shenanigans ensue.The most pervasive problem with this series is the humour. It's built around subverting tropes and doing the unexpected. However, half the time it just draws attention to the fact that what it's doing is clichéd and it's jokes that are actually subverting regular tropes are mostly really obvious, making the punch lines predictable before the set-ups are even done. The consequence, in either case, is that the comedy falls pathetically short. The story itself is very shallow, relying heavily on those comedic elements both to provide entertainment and to distract from the obvious element that's incredibly not okay. Another issue with the comedy is that the series likes to repeat itself. There are multiple cases where they'll have a jape and then quickly repeat the jape twice more in a very short amount of time. I guess they just really wanted to run those jokes into the ground or maybe they thought if it didn't make you laugh the first time, it would the third time.To its credit, there are a few funny scenes and the stuff that doesn't work is more stupid than it is annoying or painful. I also do appreciate the way they subvert the usual unfunny trans-gender jokes you get in anime.Characters:Most of the characters in this are just boring and pretty one-note. Then you have Kon himself. He's the worst part of this series. Definitely among the more annoying protagonists I've seen. Yeah, he's better than Shinji Ikari, but that's not saying much. On the plus side, the moments where he's in pain are cathartic.Art:The artwork is pretty good. The background details are nicely fleshed out. The biggest issue with it is just that the comedic exaggeration scenes can be excessive and, like the comedy in general, they don't really work well.Sound:As a whole, the acting is perfectly passable, but not anything great. Fukuyama Jun does really well making him one of the few male voice actors I've heard play a female character well. Eguchi Takuya, in contrast, is really bad in this. To be fair to him, he was good in OreGairu. In this case, he wasn't given much to work with. I don't think anyone could have made Kon's dialogue sound good.Ho-yay:There's a little. It's established early on that Mariandale attracts both men and other women.Final Thoughts:Ixion Saga DT is not a good series. The comedic elements largely fall flat. The main character is a constant annoyance and there's just not much to recommend it. That being said, I wouldn't call it terrible since most of its faults aren't particularly egregious. My final rating is a 3/10. Next week is the notorious Byston Well Monogatari: Garzey no Tsubasa. It's supposedly really atrocious. The week after that it'll be the 300th anime review.

The art is could be a lot better as I've seen better art even in hentai. The fight seems are short so there isn't much to it and the plot is a typical main character who magically winds up in a new world and has mysterious powers that are uncommon in the new world but he soon finds out others have the same power. Now after two minutes of bashing on this anime the only good thing that's worth mentioning is the humor of this anime. Yes this anime is good...on the spectrum of blowing air out of the nose instead if laughing. on the spectrum of blowing air out of the nose instead if laughing."", ""Reading the summary of this anime I thought to myself; This sounds like it might be something fun and funny. After watching the whole thing through I would like to adjust that conception.Funny yes, Fun not so much. The whole show is carried by its humor. I'm not saying that that is bad. The humor is very well placed and set throughout the episode, however It lacks pretty much everything else.The story is plainly just there to keep the jokes themselves coming, the characters themselves have no real depth, the plot is followed but again there it only seems to be existent to hold it...all together for the humor.  If you are all into watching something to just laugh hard then sure this is a good one for you.

An anime I'm afraid no one knows or talks about which is a shame since it's honestly one of the best isekais in my opinion, not because it's got godly fight scenes or a beautifully crafted story, but because it's just genuinely hilarious. It's up there with konosuba. Ixion saga DT is basically about this shut in who loves games gets transported into this games world. He then teleports in between a fight between princess ecarlate and her bodyguards and lands directly on the antagonist. Kon basically escapes with ecarlate And her guards and then the shows picks up from there. Now...I'm going to preface this by saying I watched the show a little while ago so I'm not fully sure that anything I say will he said with 100% veracity. With that said Let's get into this review!STORY: 7 Ixion saga doesn't have an overarching plot line that has every viewer in awe whilst watching. I would be lying if I said it wasn't rivetting. It's interesting to see where kon and his friends adventure to go back home takes him. And believe me it takes them to the most bizarre of places. I wouldn't say the story is Ixion saga's strongest point though all though it definitely is interesting, I feel some episodes are a little more predictable than others and that would just turn some people off.ART:6 If you're coming into this show hoping for brilliantly animated fight scenes and stellar character design I'm afraid you won't like this show at all. The art isnt at all bad. I think it's pretty good for an anime made this long ago. There's not much salient info I could give you on this shows animations and art, a you need to know is that it isnt bad by any means.SOUND: 8 DT DT DT DT DT DT DT SUTERU! I fucking loved this shows OSTs they were all so catchy even if you didn't like them at all at first, they grow on you. I mean the opening is literally about the mc wanting to lose his virginity, need I say more?CHARACTERS: 9. The characters are by far the best part about this show! They are all so lovable and endearing to the point where the antagonists dont feel like antagonists. I dont even blame Erecpyle (The antagonist) for wanting to vanquish kon. I mean because of Kon, the dude is literally missing both his ball sacks. Yeah I'm being dead serious. Erecpyle and his squad are such a fun bunch and the way they all interact is great! The main cast as well. Kon and his friends are absolutely hilarious characters! Kon is this belligerent edgy shut in teen that has absolutely no tact and his friends are giving him shit for this every step of the way. There is literally a character that pretends to be a girl and he has to be my favourite character in the show. He just loves trolling everyone that he meets and he is just such an intriguing character overall. Ecarlate is a character that I intially never thought I could like as I thought she was just a spoiled brat, being the daughters of an aristocrat. A brat that thinks that everyone else is below her and just a worm is comparison. I was being presumptuous. She is pretty much a tsundere and a fair sweet little girl trying to be a good leader.ENJOYMENT:9 This show was so fun to watch, it kept me entertained almost every episode because of how interesting the characters and their dynamics were. The slapstick comedy is sure to make you laugh at least 10 times watching this show. Ixion Saga is quiet the facetious anime meaning it doesn't take itself seriously! Not really story-oriented. It solely relies on its comedy which would make anyone a little apprehensive when getting into it, but trust me when i say it's worth it. This is one of the few animes I actually laughed out loud to.OVERALL: 7.6While I love this show a lot i do have to say it isnt for everyone as I mentioned in the art section and the intro. Id say give it about 4 episodes before deciding to drop it although I'll have you know you're missing out. This is a great comedy show overall and I would suggest it to all of you looking for one!That's it.

It has a great cast of characters, and plenty of mini story lines to please the casual anime viewer. It even has an appropriate ending for the series which seems to really be lacking these days.This satirical comedy is fantasy based. It's a simple plot, but it works well enough. Basically Kon gets transported from sitting at his computer playing video games to a different world. In this new world he's supposed to save it somehow by using his hyperion powers. He is in no way...a warrior, and the group he accompanies is filled with strong weirdos. This series is bizarre, yet I found it highly enjoyable.From the very beginning you are immersed in a ridiculous world that is different yet the same as ours. There's a princess, a muscle bound warrior, a dress wearing gunslinger, and then Kon. They are being chased by another group, and the larger story unfolds slowly throughout. Each week is a different themed episode, and it's all comedy. It has great cast, good animation, catchy theme music, and overall it's done well.

There are already reviews from it from previous years, but since the Isekai genre is a bit broad, this anime gets missed out on the lists of ""which isekai anime should you watch.""Besides the whole Isekai part, the show itself is a fun adventure to watch. It has a lot of humor which basically carries the show.What makes the humor great are the weird setups and scenarios that happen to the characters, but also how the characters change throughout the story. I do not want to...say that there is a lot of character progression in this anime, but at the end of the anime I certainly felt that the main hero and the other side characters (good guys or evil guys) do gain some experience or value at the end of the anime.While the show isn\'t low quality, I think you should enter the show with low expectations while kicking back and relaxing while experiencing the quirky fun this anime has to offer. say that there is a lot of character progression in this anime, but at the end of the anime I certainly felt that the main hero and the other side characters (good guys or evil guys) do gain some experience or value at the end of the anime.While the show isn\'t low quality, I think you should enter the show with low expectations while kicking back and relaxing while experiencing the quirky fun this anime has to offer.', ""i gotta say i would extremely love to see season 2 of this, i really enjoyed it, i will forever remember the moments of this anime and might re-watch it again sometime. i watched all update anime got boarded went on YouTube and searched this anime up, i would 100% recommend this anime if anyone was looking for something to watch,ill just pray that season 2 comes out and ye that's it, this anime was released in 2012 and now its 2020, the chances of season 2 is low but not impossible, their are other fans out their and i am 100% sure they want...to see season 2 as i do, so for them and for me make season 2 happen to see season 2 as i do, so for them and for me make season 2 happen"", 'Concept is actualy great and there are hilarius cense and episode for score of 10 but from 25 episodes sadly i need to say that instead  of deap story director chose shalow aproach so some episodes are pointles to watch.

Kurokami The Animation,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5079/Kurokami_The_Animation,"['I ""love"" it when an anime tries to ask deeply philosophical and ethical questions, only to answer them with fists, feet, and super powers. Personally I find it annoying when characters claim that they can overcome things like God, Fate, Destiny, Karma, etc, with nothing more than willpower and a kickass partner (since the main character so often is a complete novice in combat, or has no redeeming qualities whatsoever).Enter then Kurokami, as a shining example of these things at work.Now, when I started watching this I had no idea that Kurokami was originally a manga Sung-Woo Park (illustrator), and Dal-Young Im (story), and to...say that the anime and manga are like chalk and cheese would be an understatement.The story in the anime version centres around Ibuki Keita, a highschool student with a very similar isolationist attitude to Ikari Shinji from NGE. The reason for this is that, for no apparent reason, everyone around him seems to die. One evening he meets a young girl named Kuro, and it is from her that he learns the true nature of the world.I\'ll stop there as the story is quick to hit its stride, however I have some big issues with the plot on the whole, the first issue being why Keita, who in the manga is a 19 year old games programmer, is suddenly a high school student in the anime. Now, many of you may think this isn\'t a problem, but in actuality it causes a major incosistency in the flow of the story and the development of the characters.The plot for the manga has been written with Keita as a 19 year old who is working. This means that many of the thoughts, feelings and actions he takes in the story are based on the fact that he has already completed high school and is effectively an adult. The anime, on the other hand, portrays Keita as a teenager, a ""child"" so to speak. The reason for this change is purely a marketing issue. The producers wanted this series to appeal to a teenage fan base, in paritcular the fans of shows like Shakugan no Shana, Zero no Tsukaima, Fate/Stay Night, etc.Imagine for a second the difference in your own thought processes over over a two year period, in particular, the difference in how you perceived the world, and more importantly, how you reacted to it. Beginning to see what I mean? The plot for the anime stays true to the manga for the most part when, in truth, it should have been rewritten completely.Another big change is the fact that the manga involves transplanting an arm. The whole idea of transplanting hearts was, again, purely a marketing strategy. That change was made so that it would appeal to a more ""romantic"" audience, something which the anime could have done without.Both changes (and they\'re unfotunately not the only ones), have severely damaged the flow of the plot and the development of Keita and Kuro as characters. The original concept was very good, and if they\'d stuck to it instead of pandering to the audience in an effort to cash in on the Shana/Louise/Sabre franchise, then it would have been a much better show.Animation is another issue I have with this series. Overall its not too bad, but Sunrise and Bandai really didn\'t seem to put any effort into this show on the whole. The animation is often jerky and confusing, especially during the action sequences. The studio has tried to make the show look ""cool"", with the proviso that this be done at the lowest cost possible. There\'s naked character transformation scenes in the style of the mahou shoujo genre, overblown, overpowered special moves with silly names in the style of Bleach et al, strange character actions (like running, eating, etc), and an overall sense that the animators really couldn\'t be bothered to get their fingers out.The art for the backdrops is actually pretty decent on the whole, and is the main reason why I scored the art as mediocre instead of bad. Unfortunately, these backgrounds don\'t have the same kind of vitality to them that can be found in other shows, and are often there so that one of the characters can be sent crashing through it with a punch.The characters have been designed along the lines of the manga, so no real issues there. I just wish they\'d put more effort into the overall work though.As far as the sound goes, the only reason I didn\'t give this area a good rating is because of the cumulatively annoying OP and ED, and the change of OP midway through the series only compounded this.The rest of the music throughout the series can is generally okay, however there are points where the music and mood don\'t match. The voice actors are on the capable side, but once again there doesn\'t seem to be any real effort involved in their portrayals as the acting is sometimes very wooden.The characters are, again, pretty decent on the whole. There isn\'t any real development that goes on with any of them barring the two main characters, and any changes in the persona of the sub characters tends to happen off-screen. As for Keitaand Kuro, the fact that Sunrise and Bandai\'s marketing teams got involved with production means that there\'s some annoyingly inconsistent threads running through their development, Keita\'s relationship with Akane being an example of this.This is an odd anime. It\'s clearly influenced by the likes of Fate/Stay Night and Shakugan no Shana, as well as Bleach and DBZ (surprisingly). The confusing plot and the inconsistencies stand out so it makes suspension of disbelief more difficult. It\'s enjoyable in it\'s own way, but is still one of those ""watch once and forget"" titles that seem to be cropping up more frequently.On the whole, this is not a good series, but it isn\'t bad either. The fact that it tried to include a complex plot with some deep philophical and ethical issues is one of it\'s few saving graces. say that the anime and manga are like chalk and cheese would be an understatement.The story in the anime version centres around Ibuki Keita, a highschool student with a very similar isolationist attitude to Ikari Shinji from NGE.

What this means is there exists three versions of the same person (2 subs and 1 root). Should any one of these three come in plain sight of the other, they will perish, and only the root will live, and thus will consume the energy force of them known as tera. Our main heroes are Kuro (a Tera...Guardian trying to stop the Doppleliner system and defeat her brother) and Keita (an ordinary boy who unwillingly ends up becoming her partner). What interested me the most about the anime, is the way that the actual battles take place. It almost feels like you are watching a more mature version of Pokemon at times. Each Tera Guardian can form a pack with a human, and thus use their power in conjunction with their own. So fights take place with the two helping each other--ie: the Tera Guardian fights, and the humans remain on the sidelines channeling their powers to their partner. The fighting scenes are also quite good, because despite the characters featuring ""power/energy"" moves, the fighting scenes themselves feel very street brawling oriented, and stylized. It overall does a good job of mixing the super powers with more authentic looking moves. Now regarding the way the actual storyline progresses, here is where I feel Kurokami tends to miss the mark. There are enough plot threads going on, and many of them do evolve throughout the series. However, they end up happening few and far between. A lot of episodes play the role of fillers, and some fight scenes that take place seem unnecessary. This can make the plot a bit tedious to follow, as it can sometimes take many episodes for something simple to be made clear. Still, making your way through the anime just to see the last few episodes really makes things worth while, as the final episodes are exciting and fast paced, though I did find it a bit odd that episode 23 ends up being a re-cap of all the others, but through a slightly different perspective. Where this anime really shines through is with its actual ending. Everything concludes nicely, and feels very satisfying at the end. And some events even end up being a bit unexpected. As a whole the story is good, there is plenty of action and plot twists to keep things exciting. But due to the storyline tending to drag on, does hinder it as a whole, but nothing too drastic.As far as offensive material goes, Kurokami does have a few scenes which contain gory elements where blood spurts and/or is smeared on the ground. These scenes don\'t happen very frequently, in fact only the first few episodes really have them, with it only happening occasionally after that. Some battles even end with little to no blood spilled at all.Art: 8/10The arts style to this is dark and moody, but not really in a creepy kind of way. The backgrounds come off pretty well detailed, with nice looking city designs and foliage areas. Even so, the overall color schemes tend to make the series look a bit washed out. The character design is good, all of them are well proportioned and have a good sense of style to each one of the cast. The super moves (also known as ""Exceeds"") are flashy and colorful, with each character’s move set differing from one another. The fight scenes are by far the best part in the animation. Character moves are animated smoothly, with every punch and kick shown off with just the right amount of impact.Sound: 6/10For me this was the weakest point in the series. The voice acting in both the English and Japanese version is very well done, I still feel the Japanese audio is better by far in the long run. However, a majority of the soundtrack seems to favor one style of genre in music...rock! The opening and ending themes change twice through out the series. The opening animations both play rock style music tracks, while the ending theme (surprisingly) plays soft lite hearted melodies sung by Yousei Teikoku. The background music it plays also consists of rock music. I can see where they are going with this, and while I don’t care for heavy rock music, I can at least appreciate it for this anime. If you like this type of genre in music then you will love the soundtrack, but if you’re like me and don’t care for it, then you will most likely turn the volume down during some of the scenes.Characters: 7/10The characters are hit and miss. I will go on record of saying that Kuro is one of the coolest female heroines to come along in an anime as of late. She has a sweet and funny personality, yet holds back a lot of sorrow in here life--she is quite the layered individual. Of all the characters in the series, Keita is probably going to be the one that is hardest to tolerate...especially during the beginning. He tends to complain a lot, and is unwilling to help anyone towards the beginning, and will most likely annoy many viewers. To his credit though, he does end up changing as the story progresses, and at least becomes more tolerable in the end. The supporting cast is also the same, some characters such as Excel, Reishin and Daichi do a good job off adding to the storyline. However, there are a number of supporting characters that just don’t make the cut. Many of them don’t really seem to have much impact on what is going on, and thus make some feel unnecessary to the storyline. They’re not a bad cast by any means, some of them just don’t seem to have a staple purpose in the anime. As a whole though, the main characters themselves do end up doing their parts well for the stories’ purpose, and in that regards it is done right.Overall: 7/10Despite some of its flaws, Kurokami is a good anime. If you can make it through some of the fillers, and don’t mind the story dragging on somewhat, then I think you will find this a deep enough series to check out. There is enough action and plot in this to keep both the Seinen fans and casual viewers satisfied. And as it stands, it’s a series I think anime fans should give a try.

And as it stands, it’s a series I think anime fans should give a try.', '“Power to achieve something”The Story…It revolves on a system that we called “Doppeliner System”. The story tells about the involvement of the three main characters, which is Kuro, Keita, and Akane. They are somewhat confused on this system and willing to find out the real main reason why this system exists, making it as an obligation as they put their life in danger or helping others to find out the cure to its existence.The point of view here is not the twist of the story rather the main attraction here will be the action / super power scenes. It gives excitement and thrill but on...the other hand there are some minor / major problems that you may notice in it within the show. Though the twist of the story adds effects for the whole series, it’s quite ineffective in such a way that it consists of somewhat boring conversations, bad combination of action and romance, and bad flow of the events throughout the story.This might be the uniqueness of it from the other anime. It comes up with a different representation of martial arts with super power. It is also the main reason why it’s been quite exciting to watch the series, nothing less and nothing more.Art & Animation…Well it might be obvious what the series will give. It emphasizes fighting scenes, stunts, and signature blows and it also gives different camera angles to be shown on every move. The art is quite normal and they didn’t make it a grand, a simple and fitted for the series.Sound…The sound suited well to this action series. OP song that has fast beat music and gives a thrilling excitement. ED song that gives a soothing and melodic music that points a change of view to the series. BG music/sounds adds a great effect through the fighting, emotional and funny scenes.Characters…Irritating, balanced and appealing. This is what the characters do in the anime, they give such appealing formation or stance, but in the other part they also give an irritating and disappointing effects throughout the show. So in the end it gives just a balanced mood on the entire series that never changes up to the end. It’s quite disappointing in my part.Enjoyment…The enjoyment will define as “animation vs monologue”, “story vs characters”. In this cases you may find out in the series that either of the definition will have a contrast to each other, so when it happened it would turn out to be a problem as you continue on watching it. It has a high-low features that will sometimes give you annoyance or enjoyment.Overall…Even though it has an ups feature on the series, it also have a down feature that pulls the excitement out of it.

anime which i though deserved an honest review so lets get to itStory so in this we have 3 main protagonist 1st the high school student who thinks and is more or less cursed with a warped fate which he is trying to evade desperately while hurting others as he believes  that it will save their lives if they don't come into contact with him and i mean save them from  a gory death due to his past encounters. 2nd a working woman in...her early 20s who happens to care a great deal about the high school boy I mentioned earlier to the point of sacrificing herself if necessary so basically pure an simple love. last but not least we have our third main girl protagonist who happens to be the same age as the boy protagonist but isn't exactly human but instead is a being who's job is to serve as guardians.I think any anime fan who has viewed a decent amount of anime already knows what happens next the girl and the boy protagonist form a pact of sort to save the protagonist's life. been there seen that before but never the less from a slow start up point this anime really jumps to an all out action anime but not in the way most anime would do major spoiler the dont read aheadthe guys a wuss cry baby and he does nothing but just stadn there most of the time seeing his partner get beat up really wtf this is more like an anime where the protagonist roles are switched and even with the ending its not what you think my friend its the damned opposite of what should have happenedart its quite descent actually its awesome my reason for rating it 9 is solely based on the story and. the animation were fluid and had been used to perfection to bring out the best in the anime from the color to the fluidity it was very nice.why people have dissed this anime hell the roles of the protagonist were switched in both the action part of the story and the ending.i mean all the mainstream anime have one thing in common which is the roles are clearly decided if its an action anime guys got to do something considering he is the protagonist  instead of just waste the time standing there like a douche bag seriously man what a fail. i mean if this anime was remade and the guy was doing even half the fighting the gril did i would rate it 10/10 without a doubt i mean if want to watch anime like that i would go see queens blade or something. ok so i am going of topic here so to end ithere i would recommend this anime to all anime fans as its uniqueness will drive yo either  crazy or it might just change your point of view on how to rate anime not solely based on the characters. her early 20s who happens to care a great deal about the high school boy I mentioned earlier to the point of sacrificing herself if necessary so basically pure an simple love. last but not least we have our third main girl protagonist who happens to be the same age as the boy protagonist but isn't exactly human but instead is a being who's job is to serve as guardians.I think any anime fan who has viewed a decent amount of anime already knows what happens next the girl and the boy protagonist form a pact of sort to save the protagonist's life. been there seen that before but never the less from a slow start up point this anime really jumps to an all out action anime but not in the way most anime would do major spoiler the dont read aheadthe guys a wuss cry baby and he does nothing but just stadn there most of the time seeing his partner get beat up really wtf this is more like an anime where the protagonist roles are switched and even with the ending its not what you think my friend its the damned opposite of what should have happenedart its quite descent actually its awesome my reason for rating it 9 is solely based on the story and. the animation were fluid and had been used to perfection to bring out the best in the anime from the color to the fluidity it was very nice.why people have dissed this anime hell the roles of the protagonist were switched in both the action part of the story and the ending.i mean all the mainstream anime have one thing in common which is the roles are clearly decided if its an action anime guys got to do something considering he is the protagonist  instead of just waste the time standing there like a douche bag seriously man what a fail. i mean if this anime was remade and the guy was doing even half the fighting the gril

first thing I thought to myself when I finished the final episode. I’ll be completely honest, this anime is one of the most appalling animes I’ve ever watched to date. Despite the somewhat interesting story concept presented here, the execution for this anime was simply atrocious in almost every single aspect.In this anime, we have our protagonist, Ibuki Keita, who meets this girl, Kuro, and makes a contract with her due to sudden unforeseen circumstances. And throughout the anime, the ideas of “fate” is presented as a common motif as Keita and Kuro tries to find a...way to stop all the sudden deaths that’s happening around them. Although this isn’t the most original plot idea, it could’ve been at least an entertaining show but I believe this is the worst aspect of the entire anime. From the beginning to the end, the entire concept of “fate” and how it connects to all the random deaths that’s been happening in this world is just thrown out the window for some mediocre martial arts styled fight sequences with the concept of “fate” just lazily shoved in the fights in order to present some sort of “meaning” in said fights (they don’t). The story structure is not only just repetitively boring, it’s also just pretentious, shoving in “meaningful” conversations that your characters are having while fighting isn’t how you present your motif effectively, and the scenes where the characters aren’t fighting each other are just as stale as the fighting scenes since the conversations the characters have never adds any sort of real progression to the story and is instead just used to show their defining “characteristics” if the dialogues isn’t forced in to talk about the plot itself. Also, when you’re attempting to present some sort of theme in the story, just stick to the one theme and try not to present more than you actually can do as this anime also attempts to bring in the concept of doppelgängers in this story, which was ultimately just used as a mere plot device that somehow connects to the ideas of fate without properly expanding on it.Another dreadful aspect of this anime are the characters themselves. None of the characters are remotely interesting at all as all of them feels like cookie cutter characters you see in most animes, you have the action girl who loves to eat, the tough buff guy, the one minor antagonist character that has a very inconsistent goal, you get the idea. Now I do understand that creating interesting and meaningful characters that’s relevant to the story is a difficult task to do, but when all of the characters behave like ripoffs from other popular anime series, it’s just very hard for me to feel any sort of connection at all to any of the characters even if they have some sort of sob story that’s going to be revealed at some point. I understand that sometimes there are characters that aren’t meant to be likable but at least make them tolerable, and for this anime’s case, they aren’t. They’re either unlikable pieces of shit or just side character A.The art is probably the only redeeming aspect of this anime as there are some designs that I found appealing but it’s not enough to redeem all the other shitty aspects that’s presented in this anime. It’s your standard late 2000s anime art style, nothing more, nothing less.Although there isn’t much to say about the sound effects, I will admit that the music is very dull due to the lack of variety. Throughout this show, it seems like rock music is just everywhere in this show, and not in a creative way either, it’s just the most dull stock type rock tracks with almost no variety in the songs itself. I felt no sort of emotions at all whenever watching scenes with music, the music didn’t add anything to enhance the experience at all, it was just there to serve as background noise.Overall, I highly recommend you to not waste your time with this anime at all. Trust me there are so many other animes that are worth your time instead of this. This anime is so dull and I don’t want any anime watchers to make the same mistake as I did by watching this anime in hopes of “maybe it’s gonna get good at this point” which spoilers, it doesn’t. The ending of this series will definitely make you go “so what the hell was all of that for?” way to stop all the sudden deaths that’s happening around them.

The ending of this series will definitely make you go “so what the hell was all of that for?”', 'Kurokami is .... one of the most irritating and confusing animes I\'ve seen so far . The reason why is that, I\'ll tell later.Before continuing with the story , a few things need to be explained (that\'ll be important for the story). People and Mototsumitama coexist together. Mototsumitama are people with super natural powers, and to gain even more power they need to form a contract with humans. Also, there are 3 identical copies of every human being (one root and two subs). That\'s the so called ""Doppeliner System"". If a subs meet his root, his live energy (aka Terra) will be sucked by the...root, causing his inevitable death and the only way for the sub to survive is to kill his root before he dies. When a both of the subs are dead, the root becomes Master Root(and has big luck) or if the sub kill the root the he becomes Minus Root(similar to Master Root).And the story goes: A evil organization is trying to mass produce Master Roots (by killing their subs) in order to dominate Japan (and later, the world) by placing Master Roots in key positions in Japan. The mass production is causing unbalance in the world, which can lead to his destruction. And of course , our two main characters (Kuro and Ibuki) will be fighting against them. Just to show how evil the organization  is, their youngest Master Root, a 6-7 year old girl, can say only one fraking word: ""DELETE"". Cmon, they could at least send her to a school to lean some new words :D.Ibuki is a high school student, who\'s mother died in a car accident, after seen a person who looked just like her .After that he tried to avoid making new friends, scared that similar thing might also happen to them too.Kuro is a Mototsumitama who came from the Holy Lands (where her Mototsumitama clan live)  to get revenge against his brother for killing most of her clan and her mother.By some circumstances , Kuro and Ibuki meet, make a contract and start fighting against the evil.Most of the characters (especially the main one) are really annoying. Ibuki is the kind of person who can\'t stop talking nonsense, especially in the beginning, when he\'s always arguing and reconciling with Kuro. Also the enemies are pretty stupid. I mean, if you are fight against a stronger opponent, it\'s logical to attack the weaker one (the human) and not the stronger (mototsumitama), especially because if U defeat the human, the mototsumitama will lose most of his/her powers (since his/her contractee is beaten). But no, they always attack the mototsumitama, and usually lose.The animation is solid, nothing to complain about. Since there are many, many fights, you will see many special effects, which is the best part of this anime. The sound is pretty good, especially during the fights, except for one song that really annoyed me . The OP and ED were good too.So in the end.. the reason why this anime is confusing and annoying:- Confusing , because you never know who the main enemy is. Every time, after they defeat the main enemy , a new, even ""greater"", appears. And after that, another one. So till the end you don\'t know who the main opponent is. And not to say, that one of their greatest enemy becomes their ally....- Irritating, because of the main characters. I really hate when people talk too much during fights. Also, the battle system is weird. The Mototsumitama, is the only one fighting, while all the human can do is to support her. But the main thing that annoyed me, is that the ""Doppeliner System"" rules does not apply to the main characters. In one scene, Ibuki meets his root, so he had two options: To have his Terra sucked up by hist root and die, or to kill him and become Minus Root. But I guess I forgot the third option: The miracle. And of course, he didn\'t die (nor did the root), and everyone was saved by this ""miracle"".I gave this anime 6/10, because of the many annoying things I explained before. But if you are only interested in fights (which this anime has plenty) and you don\'t mind the annoying talks of Ibuki, you might even like this anime.

From awesome storyline to kick-ass characters ( Kuro ftw. xD ), you could never go wrong with watching Kurokami.The audio and art effects are PURE GENIUS. Voice acting was a complete WONDER (Japanese VA). The plot twists take your breath away as the characters go through every corner of the story.Is it just me or is the fact that how the main character always goes to eats noodles funny?Anyway, Kurokami was one of my favourites and I'm sure that you'll love it too.HAPPY WATCHING! "", 'Speaking from episode 16,  i felt that this anime needed another perspective.What I Like:I like the entire ""Partner"" ideal, and how the characters develop as the story goes along. It is similar to other anime such as  Shakugan no Shana, Fate Stay Night, and Pandora Hearts, but it has own originality,  suspense, fighting, and story.What i dislike:It has some overused anime cliche\'s when dealing with the romance, and the  ""Weak guy"" + ""Awesome girl"" setup similar to the anime i listed above.(I wouldn\'t mind the character setup  as much, as long as the weak guy learns to fight as...well).-----Review Ratings-----Story: 9It deserves a 9 because there are some points that entirely focus on fighting, instead of character development, and although the character development isn\'t effected in this manor, it still takes away from the story.Art:10The first episode i watched seemed a little fast paced, but the camera angles, and art styles were beautiful. On occasion, Kuro will make an unrealistic face, but its so rare, that its barely worth mentioning.Sound: 8The music is there. It picks up before a fight, and calms down before any sort of disagreement or slightly romantic scene, it is very well mixed into the anime where i don\'t suddenly jump out and notice that the music is distracting, or is ""off"" in any way, but its not an entirely epic soundtrack.Character:9I love some of the new anime stereotypes I\'ve been noticing, and the anime has a similar character development style to others I\'ve been watching recently but  the villains so far are awesome, Twists on the "" seemingly good guy slaughtering his clan"" and the ""Good guy turned bad""Enjoyment:10This show kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.

He dies then miraculously comes back to life multiple times.  the bad guy dies without a doube then somehow comes back to life.  this is stupid after a while.  this isn't even creative at this point.  It's a paycheck.  I'm only watching this one now because I've come so far in the story I want to see what the stupid ending is.  I've seen a lost of anime at this...point in my life, more than what I've posted here.  I can say that this is one of the biggest disappointments that I've come across.  It's too overwhelmingily cliche.  The back and forth is so predictable.  I could support the claim that many storylines in anime have been done therefore new ideas are few but this is so cookie-cuter that I can't seem to muster the energy to support it.  Hopefully true anime fans will feel the same way about this.  I can't believe that I'm all alone here. point in my life, more than what I've posted here.

For the depth of the story that is told, I would say about 75 episodes are needed. As it is, the series stands very well by itself.The show takes place in a world in which there are three of every person- a Root and two Subs. The Doppeliner System favors the Roots, in that they have the majority of the luck in life. If a Sub were ever to meet their corresponding Sub or Root, that person would die. People called Mototsumita are charged with...maintaining the balance of the system in the world and as the show begins, the system is being subverted by a famous corporation for its own ends.There are two protagonists- Keita (male) and Kuro (female). Kuro was born to be a princess of her land, but she begins the story by wandering the streets of Tokyo. The reasons for this are explained later in the story.The show mainly revolves around the two heroes' relationship together and their deepening connection through a series of conflicts. There are support characters in the story, but these aren't given enough time to realize their full potential. Because of this, the other Mototsumita showing up to support Kuro often seem like random people. This is literally a series that could have become a popular shounen work with 400+ episodes to its credit had the creators expanded on what was already there. 23 episodes isn't that bad, but the story's advancements often seem to come out of left field and the plot twists lose their meaning because enough time wasn't given to establish the meaning of the development to all the characters involved.Nevertheless, Kurokami remains a good show. It's a show about two people doing their best to fight against the destiny they were given and the ways in which they overcome the rules society put in place to restrict their lives. In many ways, it's a philosophical progression of Japanese morals which began by saying that people had to work inside the system they were given to now determining the ways in which they want to the system to affect them. If anything, Kurokami is a sure indication that Japanese thought is becoming steadily more individualistic. maintaining the balance of the system in the world and as the show begins, the system is being subverted by a famous corporation for its own ends.There are two protagonists- Keita (male) and Kuro (female).

The first 12 episodes were pretty decent, but as the anime dragged on it became harder and harder to watch.A lot of the fights don't make any real sense. The contractees are acting as a battery to the Mototsumitamas, but they are hardly ever attacked.The characters are probably what killed it the most for me. Kuro was awesome, and by far my favorite character of the show. Keita was a lot more interesting at the beginning, but somewhere along the line he becomes so bland that I wanted to shoot him. I think that a main character death,...namely Akane, would've made the show a lot more interesting.The last two episodes are what really made dislike the show. For all its faults, I enjoyed the show up until that point. Maybe its because I was waiting for a death that never came, but I hated the ending. namely Akane, would've made the show a lot more interesting.The last two episodes are what really made dislike the show.

The show introduces the Doppeliner System, the basis behind it is that there are three of 'you' out there in the world and if you happen to have eye contact with one of them you will die (unless your the root.) Its a different take on a Doppelgänger which has been popular in fiction.I found with this show there was barely...any breather episodes or fillers as you were in the last half of the show, it's very action packed including a lot of battles where we get to see a wide variety of super powers being used, i really liked how each person had there own ability.The art for this show is decent, the backgrounds were all well drawn and a lot of detail was put into them, the character designs were cool, and the lighting effects on Kuro's head was neat. As i said previously the different abilities were all great to see, they were well drawn and animated, the fight scenes were what stood out for me, they were highly detailed and extremly fun to watch.Voice acting was up to a decent standard, i watched the dub and only a few of the original Japanese, all the voices fit there respected characters and we got a few unknown or actors some or most may not of heard of, Wil Wheaton even has a semi big role. The openings were fun and were pretty good rock songs to kick off the show.Overall if you enjoy martial art based super power Anime then this is definitely worth checking out, fast pace to keep you wanting more, dark atmosphere to add to the grittyness of each battle and the struggles, characters that are cute and lovable to characters to want to see get there ass kicked. This show does have it's flaws, i haven't ripped about them here because i find it hard to talk about them, i know there there it just hard to put into words, i do say the good points do out way the bad points though. any breather episodes or fillers as you were in the last half of the show, it's very action packed including a lot of battles where we get to see a wide variety of super powers being used, i really liked how each person had there own ability.The art for this show is decent, the backgrounds were all well drawn and a lot of detail was put into them, the character designs were cool, and the lighting effects on Kuro's head was neat.

You really need to turn your brain off before watching this. The main character is unbearable since he is not acting like a normal human. As far as i can tell, the anime will continue like this: they meet the enemies->enemies kick their asses-> they power up and kick the enemies' asses->they meet stronger enemies. Major flaws: during battle why would you target a much stronger opponent when her partner is right their asking for it?  Why would you fight the enemies of your enemies,...your saviors? What is the point of meeting people then talk trash rather than giving  important information? (I know... to keep the audience confuse even though the plot is so simple). The sound, esp. during fight scenes, is just bad. The art is ok, but the fight scenes don't look cool/epic at all. your saviors?

The fights consist primarily of well-choreographed hand-to-hand, with the flashy special attacks mixed in rather than dominant. Coupled with the two-on-two setup, this makes for plenty of exciting battles. Clearly this is Kurokami\'s strong point, enhanced by strong animation and the rock-style soundtrack. Also, though none of the characters could claim to be deep or complex, the main pair is a refreshing change from the contract mold. Kuro is not a seasoned vet, but rather wet-behind-the-ears with only her training to go on. And though Keita does threaten to be a typical whiny...male lead at first, before long he comes to fully embrace his role, including (gasp) actually being useful in battle.CONCERNS: The plot, while not bad per se, is fairly unspectacular. The ""doppeliner system"" turns out to be little more than a gimmick, and most of the developments can be seen a mile away. It does do its job in allowing for plenty of fights though, and unlike many manga-based series Kurokami comes to a full conclusion. Besides that, I\'d be remiss not to warn that battles usually start out with unbelievably cheesy ""synchro"" sequences, straight out of a mahou shoujo or super sentai show. Not really a big deal, but it will irk some people.PSA: There is often relevant content after the end credits of each episode, so be sure to watch for it. I found myself feeling a bit lost at the start of each ep until I figured that out.SUMMARY: I like to say that all an action series needs to be good entertainment is strong animation, music, and fight scenes. Kurokami is certainly a success on that front, and the plot and characters are just decent enough to keep from dragging down...

I saw this because it was on Crunchyroll for the iPod. Overall, Kurokami was enjoyable, especially some of the earlier hand to hand figting scenes. I'm no huge fan of those over-the-top channeling energy stuff, so that turned me off later in the story. However, it was well animated and had a cool plot twist near the end. It's fun to watch and definitely is worth your time, especially if you like action.Oh and I noticed some copy pasted animations, notably the Tera moves and Synchro. That got kind of annoying, especially after many Exceeds. "", 'This is my first review here, so please bear with me!Kurokami is about ""Kuro"", a mototsumitama and her human contractee Keita. They journey together to Okinawa to defeat Kuro\'s brother who abusing the dopperliner system. This system means that in the world there are 3 copies of the same person. If you see your doppelganger you will die. It gets a tad more complicated but I wouldn\'t want to ruin the story for you guys so ill stop there!--Story--I found the story really unique and interesting. There is one thing Kuro and Keita wish to do during the entire series, their main goal is to...defeat Kuro\'s brother Reishin. There is also a rather big side story relating to the K-on mart who also wish to take advantage of the doppeliner system. Series 1 has less of a story than series 2, it is much slower and gets you to know some of the characters. Series 2 is where most of the action is and where the plot really comes together and has you on the edge of your seat.--Art--The fighting scenes have to be mentioned here - I found them so well choreographed and they were very fun to watch. The art in Kurokami is beautiful, everything is very clear and vibrant. We also see those big cute faces especially Kuro\'s when she is eating Ramen! :3--Sound--This was not bad at all - the opening and closing for scene for series 1 was a little boring for me but I loved the opening to series 2 as well as the music the fights were choreographed to in series 2! Guitars are pretty heavy in a lot of the music in Kurokami.--Character--Character development for Kuro was fab, you really connect with her she\'s just so cute. In the first episode you see her eating Ramen with her big mouth and shes just so happy. It\'s hard to believe that she\'s a tough cookie when you see her like that. Throughout the series you learned more and more about where she has come from and why she is in Tokyo, why did she choose Keita to be her contractee? Why does she want to kill her brother? There are flashbacks as well as her own explanations. Unfortunately the same cannot be said for her contractee Keita. I felt that this anime made him look useless. He would hang back in fights and you didn\'t get to see his fighting spirit until quite a few episodes in. This series does not do a very good job of explain Keita\'s background.Other characters join in here and there, Steiner and Exel were my favourite background characters, they are a very powerful pair from Germany. You\'ll also meet another motosumitama from Kuro\'s clan who wants to help her to defeat her brother as well as another who wants to kill Reishin for revenge. I\'ll leave it at that :3--Enjoyment--At first I was disappointment with this anime - there was a lot of stuff thrown in that didn\'t make a whole lot of sense. After finishing series 1 I was almost ready to drop it but I\'m really glad I didn\'t as season 2 was much better.--Overall--If you like anime where there is lots of action and fighting then you will like this - there is a fight almost every episode and they are long. I can\'t say its the best plot ever because its not, its not the best anime out there but I would definitely give it a try! :3 defeat Kuro\'s brother Reishin.

The show is good. It really is. What I'm having a problem with is the ending. I don't want to reveal any spoilers, and it's not a typical ending, but I'm unsatisfied with it. If they would just change the last 2 episodes, it would really make me feel a LOT better about the show.Until Ep 21, I was ready to give this series a 9 for story and character, but the ending just ruined it for me.Now, don't get me wrong, it's a great story and the pacing is VERY good....I haven't seen something like this in a LONG time. It's the kind of story that keeps you engrossed and wanting to just see it to the end.The ending itself, they tie up all the ends, so there really isn't much left asking ...  but. ... well,, it's probably just me.The show itself is really good and I enjoyed it.

I really did."", ""It really bugs me when a very good story is ruined for various reasons. Unfortunately Kurokami has the same problem. It had a really interesting main-concept but the plot got butchered right after te second episode. This happenns because with such a complexity that a thing like doppeliners has the story could have countless twists and turns but instead of that the writters seemed like they wanted to get everything the easiest way possible. So we have a very complicated plot that could be amazing made into a really mediocre story. I believe this was mainly because of the huge changes that the writters of...the anime made in comparison with the manga. I haven't read the manga but i know that Keita is an adult in there and not a high school kid. Also -SPOILER ALERT- in the second episode we see Kuro replacing Keita's heart whne in the anime she replaced his hand. So as you could have probably understood the differences play a HUGE role in what  the anime is going to be like. Normally I wouldn't have a problem with that but the writters didn't manage to correspond to such a complicated story and the major changes that they did with the result the plot to be full of plot holes. As for the art well Sunrise is a good studio (it made Code Geass) but in this anime they didn't put as much effort as with their other works. Some repetitive scenes like when Kuro and Keita synchroed annoyed me pretty much.The openings and the endings were good but nothing really special. There were a couple of good OST's though. What about the characters? Well Keita is a patient of ''the Yuki Amano syndrome'' (that means that he starts off being a complete pussy). I liked that because it was more realistic and I was expecting a huge development. The development came eventually but it was so rushed and mediocre that it really disappointed me. Same goes with Kuro and almost every character of the anime especially the villains who they seemed to me really flat ad with not very powerful motives. Overall this anime was a huge disappointment to me. I couldn't enjoyed it and I certainly couldn't bring myself too love it. Seriously guys if you don't want a very good story to be butchered rigth in front of your eyes stay away from this anime. the anime made in comparison with the manga.

I kept watching and i started understanding more of the plot of the story.  After finishing this anime, i was happy to say that this anime is actually pretty nice and good!  The story in the beginning was confusing but after watching more episodes, i knew what was going on and enjoyed the anime. This anime is good if you didnt give up like other people.  I love this anime, the ending was so sad. ', 'Overall i would recomend this anime. I perfer subs to dubs but i watched the eng dub of the anime just because i like the main character\'s voice actor(kuro\'s). in my opinion episodes 3-7 or 8 start to have way more corny moments in them than the ones before them. i found this rather annyoing but it makes me wonder if the sub would have been this way, because i started to watch one of the subs once and one of the very first sentences was ""Shut the #*@% up"" and that same sentence in the dub was ""How qwant""..... (sorry for spelling qwant worng...i havent had much sleep and cant think of how to spell it right) so the dialog seams to be quite different in the dub than the sub. At some parts in the story i dont really think the characters react the way they should at points in the story. I am also not a reall fan of the way it ended. Thier is one point the story controdicts itself too... you probably wont notice it tho and it is to big of a spoiler a state here.

The animation reminded me of One Punch Man specifically the fighting scenes wich surprised me, because the main reason I watched this was cause I watched a tiny clip on youtube. Like all the animes I watch that have been out for awhile. The story sparked my interest in the beggining and then the theme of Doppelganger and the psychological factor as well when people died out of nowhere turns a bit emotional and makes you a little sentimental towards our MC (cause literally everyone one around him just dies out of nowhere).Dont know...if this consideres a Psychological Anime but it scared me of the though of one of the characters I started to like or actually like suddently died. Luckly for me no one died that fits that category except the little kid in the first episodes made me feel sad. But they kinda dont die but I wont spoil that much besides that I just mentioned just now.Note: Not a fan of Psychological anime dont know if this is considered one but I started watching just cause I saw a clip on youtube and was going in blind.

The anime is set in a world ruled by the Doppelinner system. The system governs that when a person is born his Tera (magic energy/life I suppose?) will be split into three unequal parts, among two subs and one root. When a root meets the sub, the subs will inevitably die and the root will absorb their Tera becoming what is known as the Master Root.Disclaimer: I have not read the mangaStory: The first four to five episodes really hooked me to this show. The gruesome faith of the...little girl who was ran over by a truck, the hard reality that no matter what they do they can\'t escape faith and the fact that it is a vicious cycle all sold it for me. Unfortunately Kurokami quickly loses track after that. The dialogue is very poor at times (episode five for example), lots of things end up unexplained (how does Tera work exactly, how come Keita and Kuro can use exceed seven times once and before that only up to three times when Keita never got more tera, how does Kuro\'s cycling tera make Kuro and Keita stronger), there are many repetitive scenes (synchro ones) and lots of unnecessary fights. The fights themselves get old after a while and extremely boring in some cases. Exceeds are largely bland and uninteresting, most of them being physical in nature. The only one I really liked was Steiner\'s, which really stood out the most. After episode twelve the anime seems to pick up, but it quickly dips down and retains that cycle of never truly shining. The last episode was largely unnecessary. Its one saving grace was the bittersweet ending (still depressed over that).All in all, Kurokami\'s storyline was great at the start, but it failed to deliver, getting atrocious at some parts. The beginning and the last two minutes of the story are its saving grace and thus it gets a rating of 6/10Art: The art is nothing to write home about, but I can\'t say I didn\'t enjoy it. It is one of those animes that you won\'t remember visually, but if you see it you\'ll still say that its art was good. The palette gets dark and moody at times, but otherwise maintains a decent look. The one thing that stands out are the very shiny and flashy exceeds and it does seem to work.Thus Kurokami\'s art gets a rating of 7/10Sound: Rock is my favourite genre of music so in this regard I am very biased, however I do think that they could have included more music along the way. The first opening is ok and the second one is decent, but what I really liked was the first ending. The singer is amazing, her voice is beautiful and I watched it every single time. All in all the sound is good too, same as the art. Thus it gets a rating of 7/10Characters: Oh boy. The weakest part of Kurokami is its characters, which at most are forgettable and at their worst downright horrendously made.Main characters: Keita - At the start I liked him. I think he had a fairly realistic approach to the issue and a believable negative outlook on the world and people around him, seeing as his mother was killed in front of his eyes, and later on his friend and the girl next door were killed the same way (a motif perhaps, heh?)However, Keita takes too long to develop afterwards, becoming a whining emo with contradicting actions and beliefs and he is quickly knocked down. He suddenly gets A LOT of character development in the span of a few episodes, spiraling down into the blandness and ending up as a battery for Kuro and repeating ""We will defeat destiny!""Keita\'s rating is 5/10Kuro - Kuro is by far, the best character of the series. Naive, happy-go-lucky Kuro hides a lot of trauma and sadness that is eventually shown in a realistic way. She has strong motives, a strong desire and a genuine wish to help all those around her. The thing with the Massamu (I already forgot their name tbh) was weird to me, but what really sold her as a great character was the ending. The sheer willpower to forever seal herself and never see her beloved contractor just so the world could be freed of its curse was bittersweet and her crying scene made me tear up.P.S. Why she and Keita are not shipped at all is beyond me.Kuro\'s rating is 8/10!Akane - The most worthless mc I\'ve seen in a while. She only serves to be a housewife and to be a plot device later down the line. First to an unbelievably (and unrealistically for such a short timeframe!) contract with Reishin, and then to have this huge amount of Tera so that Kuro can win against the main villains. She ends up marrying Keita which was beyond ridiculous to me, as I never saw a reason to ship them. Their romance was beyond weird to me.Akane\'s rating is 2/10Overall rating for the main characters is 5/10Villains: Reinshin - This one is really weird to me. Until the very end Reishin felt as a punching rag for the producers. He seemed tasteless and bland with shallow motivations (""I want to destroy the world"") and shallow past, and only in the end he ended up as a more rounded-up villain. Still I feel as though he ended up as butchered potential so I am giving him a rating of 5/10Kuraki - I liked him better. Kuraki was a cunning strategist, with a good, albeit idealistic idea. He outsmarted Reishin, Yuki and other characters, but ultimately ended up defeated by the power of ""cycling synchro"", which I still don\'t understand. In the end I think Kuraki was better suited to be the antagonist compared to the final boss.Kuraki\'s rating is 6/10Massamu/Massami/Massaki? - Whatever these beasts are called, they couldn\'t have been blander. They\'re so called gods, who want to destroy the world and... there\'s that. Their design is bland, their motifs are bland, their past is bland. Essentially, they\'re bland.Their rating is 1/10Overall rating for the villains is 4/10Side characters - Extremely shallow. They\'re uninteresting fodder, used for plot purposes and quickly discarded afterwards. We\'re given the idea that we should care about them, but we can\'t be bothered to. The only good side characters are Excel, Steiner and Yuki.Yuki is a good example of what happens when one average person attempts to go against fate and fails, and as someone who has been oppressed by her surroundings for being different. In this regard Yuki is relatable.Steiner and Excel are an interesting duo, with good design, an amazing voice (Steiner) and with interesting powers. You actually do get invested in them and for that reason we can\'t help but not like them.Despite these three amazing characters the rest is so bland that I couldn\'t help but give the side characters a 4/10Overall rating for the characters is 4/10Enjoyment: I found myself enjoying this show greatly at the start, but as it dragged on I was begging it to end. They really screwed it up, and I am sad that it ended up being extremely crappy at certain parts. I am hoping manga is a lot better. Even with all this, there are certain times when I was really happy to be watching Kurokami and for that reason alone I am giving it a very wobbly 6/10Overall: The show is a hit and miss. It has an excellent premise, a great main character (Kuro) and decent animation and sound. It tries to tackle deeply philosophical and ethical questions. However, it lacks in good characters and storyline and this messes it up completely. Regardless, Kurokami had its ups and downs and even with some extremely bad moments I did end up getting some enjoyment out of it. In the end Kurokami gets an overall rating of 6/10! little girl who was ran over by a truck, the hard reality that no matter what they do they can\'t escape faith and the fact that it is a vicious cycle all sold it for me. Unfortunately Kurokami quickly loses track after that. The dialogue is very poor at times (episode five for example), lots of things end up unexplained (how does Tera work exactly, how come Keita and Kuro can use exceed seven times once and before that only up to three times when Keita never got more tera, how does Kuro\'s cycling tera make Kuro and Keita stronger), there are many repetitive scenes (synchro ones) and lots of unnecessary fights. The fights themselves get old after a while and extremely boring in some cases. Exceeds are largely bland and uninteresting, most of them being physical in nature. The only one I really liked was Steiner\'s, which really stood out the most. After episode twelve the anime seems to pick up, but it quickly dips down and retains that cycle of never truly shining. The last episode was largely unnecessary. Its one saving grace was the bittersweet ending (still depressed over that).All in all, Kurokami\'s storyline was great at the start, but it failed to deliver, getting atrocious at some parts. The beginning and the last two minutes of the story are its saving grace and thus it gets a rating of 6/10Art: The art is nothing to write home about, but I can\'t say I didn\'t enjoy it. It is one of those animes that you won\'t remember visually, but if you see it you\'ll still say that its art was good. The palette gets dark and moody at times, but otherwise maintains a decent look. The one thing that stands out are the very shiny and flashy exceeds and it does seem to work.Thus Kurokami\'s art gets a rating of 7/10Sound: Rock is my favourite genre of music so in this regard I am very biased, however I do think that they could have included more music along the way. The first opening is ok and the second one is decent, but what I really liked was the first ending. The singer is amazing, her voice is beautiful and I watched it every single time. All in all the sound is good too, same as the art. Thus it gets a rating of 7/10Characters: Oh boy. The weakest part of Kurokami is its characters, which at most are forgettable and at their worst downright horrendously made.Main characters: Keita - At the start I liked him. I think he had a fairly realistic approach to the issue and a believable negative outlook on the world and people around him, seeing as his mother was killed in front of his eyes, and later on his friend and the girl next door were killed the same way (a motif perhaps, heh?)However, Keita takes too long to develop afterwards, becoming a whining emo with contradicting actions and beliefs and he is quickly knocked down. He suddenly gets A LOT of character development in the span of a few episodes, spiraling down into the blandness and ending up as a battery for Kuro and repeating ""We will defeat destiny!""Keita\'s rating is 5/10Kuro - Kuro is by far, the best character of the series.

Regardless, Kurokami had its ups and downs and even with some extremely bad moments I did end up getting some enjoyment out of it. In the end Kurokami gets an overall rating of 6/10!', 'This anime pretty much consisted of war cries and the main protagonist yelling ""KURO!"" in the complete wrong pronunciation - my mistake for watching the dub. It dragged on an had no plot development whatsoever. From start to finish - or at least as far as I got before just abandoning the show all together - I was confused as to what the heck was going on. The show doesn\'t bother to try and slow everything down so you can fully understand what\'s happening, so if you plan to watch this show, pay attention. If you daze off for even a couple seconds, you could...miss a lot due to poor explaining.In a normal anime that I love, if there are 24 or less episodes I usually learn all the characters names by the end due to good character development. Well, this anime lacked that, so I pretty much only knew Keita and Kuro from all the shouting of their names during the long and mediocre fight scenes.The show got an R rating because of violence, and at first I understood that because people were being brutally killed at the beginning of the show. After a while, the only ""violence"" that was going on was the Terra guardians and their contractees shooting balls of light at each other. I was super disappointed with this anime and can honestly say that it was the worst one I have ever seen. miss a lot due to poor explaining.In a normal anime that I love, if there are 24 or less episodes I usually learn all the characters names by the end due to good character development.

I tried it and liked it but at the end it seemed they rushed the whole episode and didn't explain much but idk. Good anime tho "", 'tl;dr: An anime that starts out trying and failing to have depth, but becomes quite solid in terms of action and characters when it embraces just being a good battle anime.I should firstly note that I haven’t read the manga. There are apparently major differences between the two which fans of the manga have disliked, but I’m judging the anime solely on it’s own merits independent of how well it adapts the manga.Kurokami is a battle anime centered around the Doppeliner System and Mototsumitama. The Doppeliner system is essentially this anime’s version of the urban legends surrounding doppelgangers, wherein if one see another then one...will die in the near future. This anime explains this phenomenon as one of the people being a Root with high Tera, which is essentially luck, and the other a Sub with low Tera, and upon meeting the Root absorbs the little Tera the sub has, thereby becoming even luckier while the Sub becomes so unlucky they die not long after. This system is watched over by Mototsumitama, who are essentially super strong human like beings that can form contracts with humans to become even stronger.The plot of the first arc, which spans the first half or so of the anime, mostly just sets the foundation for the latter two arcs. It introduces almost all of the important characters and provides some background on them while also fleshing out the various systems and such and how they tie into character’s motivations. The main characters are the Mototsumitama Kuro and her human partner Keita. Kuro was a girl who was seeking her brother, Reishin, who had strayed from the path that most Mototsumitama followed but was instead seemingly just trying to cause chaos. Keita inadvertently got involved in her fight when Reishin’s underlings came after Kuro while he was with her and in order to save him, she had to form a contract with him, and thus the two of them were connected.The majority of the first arc is pretty weak for a number of reasons. The first would be that like a lot of battle anime/manga, it doesn’t actually start out as being a proper battle anime, but rather tries to be something more complicated, focusing on the complexities surrounding the Doppeliner system and such. There’s still action, but it actually seems to spend a good amount of time trying to flesh things out in regards to ethics and such, but most all of it isn’t very good. Mototsumitama are meant to maintain the Doppeliner System to maintain balance or some other nebulous concept like that. However, it’s very clear that this system is god awful so it isn’t really clear why the viewer should be invested in that.Furthermore, while the villain of this arc’s motivations aren’t properly explained at this point, his goal seems to be to essentially mess with the system, which doesn’t seem like a bad motivation to have. That could have been the basis for some actually decent ethical issues, but as mentioned this is largely left completely unexplained, and the anime instead just explores small things surrounding that while kind of trying to portray maintaining the system as a good thing. This largely doesn’t make sense, and thus everything just feels kind of contradictory.The second issue is Keita’s personality during this arc. He behaves in a perfectly believable manner for someone that was dragged without a choice into an incredibly dangerous situation, and probably handles it better than I would have. That doesn’t change the fact that he still seems lame as hell. Him lashing out at Kuro and essentially trying to run away from having to be involved with any of this just felt kind of pathetic. This may well be because essentially all other similar stories seem to just have the protagonist roll with things like this and thus I’m conditioned to expect that, but it doesn’t change the fact that the protagonist was immensely unlikable.There are a few other minor issues as well, such as how there are some ridiculously forced moments for the sake of plot advancement, such as characters just randomly running into other important characters somehow and just going with the flow in a way that feels really unnatural. As a result of those issues, the pacing for the anime overall felt pretty slow and like it was really dragging on as a lot of the content simply wasn’t that good.Thankfully, all of that turns around near the end of the first arc, at which point Keita goes through major character growth, there’s solid growth in the relationship between him and Kuro, and the anime seems to drop it’s pretense about being deep and goes full battle anime. This leads to a pretty exciting climax to the arc, that doesn’t really resolve anything, but is a solid transition into the second arc, which spans the next quarter or so.The villain in the second arc seems to have somewhat complex motivations at first in that he tries to explain them as such, but it’s pretty clear that he’s just sacrificing others using the Doppeliner System for the sake of gaining power. Thankfully, the anime doesn’t really try to flesh things out as complex as it did during the first arc, and thus plays to it’s strengths by basically just being a battle anime with clear good guys and bad guys. There’s no exploration of complex themes, but there’s still solid character and relationship development in Keita and Kuro as well as solid character development in the side characters Akane and Yuki as well. Other side character’s don’t really get much in terms of development, but it builds well off the cast introduced in the first arc and a few still manage to seem pretty cool and add some variety to things. The anime felt well paced throughout with key moments built up to well and twists that properly felt exciting, and thus overall this part of the anime overall felt well written. This arc also ends in what feels like a proper conclusion.However, this conclusion immediately transitions into the final arc. The beginning of this arc was somewhat of a mess. It introduces a bunch of new characters, many of whom basically only matter once. It also provides a lot of explanation for things previously not explained properly, such as where the Doppeliner System came from or why the Mototsumitama were protecting it. It ultimately is somewhat complex from an ethical point of view, though for reasons completely unrelated to those that were explored in the first arc, rather the reasons here are much simpler and make a lot more sense. Though it doesn’t dwell much on that either, still primarily being a battle anime with the complexity mainly coming from who’s fighting who and why. The mess arises from the fact that a lot of this isn’t explained very well, either not really properly being explained at all, being explained in a weird order where characters, mainly Akane, feel really inconsistent, or being explained through straight up infodumps and infodump flashbacks which kind of kill the pacing.Still, ultimately everything is adequately explained, the mechanics of the world are clear and all the character’s involved have motivations that make sense, leading to a climax that’s intense, exciting, and easy to get invested in. This is paced reasonably well and ultimately ends in a pretty satisfying manner that showcases the major characters and the growth they had gone through quite well. After that, episode 22 essentially serves as an epilogue that isn’t action focused but rather focuses solely on how the characters will live their lives after everything had settled down. It builds heavily on the relationship between Keita and Kuro as well as other relationships built up to a lesser extent over the course of the anime for an immensely impactful ending. It wasn’t the type of ending I generally like, but I still found it pretty satisfying and a good end point for the series.The problem is that episode 22 isn’t the last episode. The actual final episode, episode 23, is essentially just a footage from throughout the series that adds some context to earlier scenes in the anime. The vast majority of this context is unnecessary and doesn’t feel like it adds anything at all, and the scenes that do add something would have been better if they were properly integrated into earlier episodes. It’s somewhat a recap of the series, but it didn’t feel like all that great of one, in that it’s written weirdly in how it uses flashbacks. This episode also has an extra epilogue that goes beyond the ending of episode 22, but it doesn’t actually change anything or add anything the ending of episode 22 didn’t already suggest would happen, so I feel it would have been better to just have left it out as the ending of episode 22 was a really strong emotional beat to end on and this epilogue kind of dilutes it.As for more general notes, the Doppeliner System is really interesting, even if the anime didn’t use it’s complexities all that well. I also wonder why the system was explained as involving three people instead of just two as the third never had plot significance with anyone and as far as I know the doppelganger urban legends only involve two. And if it wasn’t clear, I also really liked the action in this show. It’s mostly just fast and powerful martial arts, but with a single special move per character that was of the more supernatural variety to add some spice to things. It was really simple but also really effective and awesome to watch. The battles flowed incredibly well and were just in general really hype, in no small part to how the soundtrack and animation fit really well and greatly enhanced the experience.Speaking of the art and animation, overall it was really good. The art style fit quite well. The character designs started out kind of weak at first, but improved tremendously and overall were pretty much all nice, and I especially liked the clothing designs. The sequences used for special moves and power ups were also really cool, with the Synchro sequence never getting old. And as mentioned, the animation for action in general was great, feeling quite fluid and dynamic. The soundtrack had a number of memorable tracks that worked really well, the majority of these being vocal tracks for battle scenes. The OPs were both really solid and good at getting the viewer excited for the episode, though to be honest that didn’t really fit all that well for the first third of the anime when it was still slow. The EDs are much softer with simpler visuals but were decent enough. will die in the near future.

Korean mangas, the once i'm familiar with, Breaker and as an anime in Kurokami offer a completely different flow of story wherein they hope to do justice to the the theme of story as a whole rather than individual characters or plots. So dont be disappointed if the story hits a slump, the ending will be rewarding. The anime however offer good action in return but that too doesn't keep viewers interested enough because of lack in flow of the story, variety, and quality even. Initially It would feel like a story just made for some action where a bunch...of people fight against each other with some mystery to all of it.

Would recommend it to kill time."", 'Let me give you a description of a show and tell me which one it reminds you of. It is about your average teenage boy making a life pact with a supernatural fighting girl, which is responsible to maintain order in the world, and where there are copies of yourself as replacements in case something goes wrong, and everything is explained with a very weirdly named terminology… BZZZ, and no, it isn’t Shakugan no Shana but its lesser cousin, Kurokami. Sorry dear Kurokami, you do not have a loli tsundere voiced by Rie Kugimiya so you never stood a chance in succeeding from the very...second you got green light for adaptation. Further more, you do not have 4 goddamn seasons of endless softporn and millions of otakus who are watching you for the sake of wasting their brain cells. And above all, you are based on a mahwa, and there is no such thing as a good mahwa. Sure, there are very good in terms of fighting but their storylines plain suck. So there you go, I just explained to you why Kurokami never had a chance of being a good anime.Reader: That is the worst negative bias I have seen in my life. Won’t this guy talk about facts instead of straw men, or just say something about the damn show?Sure, I was about to do that. The above was just an introduction to what you are getting yourselves into. Something NOT good. So basically we get this story where your typical/boring/overused stereotype Keita meets this naive/kind hearted/dumb chick/super fighter Kuro and learns that the world is not what it seems to be. Every person has two others like him as safeguards and in case one dies, the other gets his luck and whatever superpowers that comes with. It is a weird concept but does have its captivating charm; imagine one day that you learn you are nothing but a replacement and that when someone dies is not tragic because his copy will inherit his luck/powers. Scary indeed.Otaku: WOOO! A show about a fighting chick and an intriguing premise. I am scoring it with a 10 right now and head to buy her figurine!Sit down no-lifer and let me finish! The premise and the fighting are the only good things in it because everything else is pretty much a mess. And sure, if all you care about is brainless action and shallow philosophy, I am sure you are going to like it a lot. Yet the moment you try to reason the whole thing, it won’t take more than 5 seconds to realize it is all nothing but gibberish. Fighting your fate with punches and kicks? Since when can raw power and violence solve such existentialism issues? And why is Kuro so willingly explaining all these top secret stuff to a random guy she just met? And why is such a dumb naive girl in charge of such an important mission to begin with? It all happens in the most silly way possible and makes everything feel shallow and passable.Action fanboy: Who cares about realism? Anime don’t need to be realistic, they only need to be entertaining. If it has good action and nude chicks, I have no problem with it.Good for you my superficial no-brainer; but I am not you. I like when things are excused to be as such and to pass as probable based on their importance. If a bimbo appears out of nowhere and starts mumbling about invisible pink unicorns, I will not take her seriously, nor will I care to participate in whatever she plans to do.Reader: Will this guy ever tell us anything about the ACTUAL show?I thought I was already doing that. Hm, anyways, I guess I will talk about technicalities like the production values. Animation and artwork are ok for this sort of anime but they are not amazing. They have a fair amount of details and colouring but they otherwise lack the finer touches that would make it look special or awesome. For example, all the backgrounds feel generic, it is just schools and buildings and streets I have seen a billion times already and no amount of details can save them from feeling generic. Every time I look at such sceneries I always end up comparing them to the “5cm per second” movie, and Kurozuka’s level is plain ok. I could say something similar about the character figures, who also feel generic in appearance and are occasionally drawn with inconsistent facial structure. As for the sound part, it is very passable in overall as the characters usually don’t have much passion in their voices and the soundtrack is average songs you will forget very fast.Action fanboy: Who cares about all that? Is the action good?Yes it is my fellow no-brainer. There is a lot of choreography in it to make it look like a good martial arts series, plus it has several superpowers to offer variety in tactics and counters. And yes, it also has some basic fan service too, as Kuro is always fighting without pants and her clothes keep ripping. And there are other nude scenes thrown here and there.Otaku: WOOO! Masterpiece! I will go look for her beaten up and in agony version.Whatever no-lifer; I was more interested in if any of that make sense as a whole. And guess what, they don’t. It is just the usual shounen stuff we see all the time, where injuries mean absolutely nothing if the hero has enough resolve or if the script said so. It’s the same thing all the time, they just storm in and punch rapidly at the baddies until they are beaten. The premise of the story ends up being nothing but a poor excuse after awhile since all it matters is punching your way through any obstacle. It gets too fake to like it after awhile and the directing is not helping much because most of the action has unfit BGM or the duration of the attacks is usually too short or too long to like them properly. As for the rest of the story, most of the plot is either fillers or boring events. It does have a solid conclusion but by then I didn’t care in the least about the basic idea. It was barely looked into.Reader: Just tell us a few things about the characters and be over with it; I am about to stop reading here.Ok impatient reader, I will. The characters are standard stuff you can find in many shounen. As usual, only the main ones end up being interesting and developed, with everybody else being nothing but ephemeral opponents and cannon fodder. The thing is, their chemistry is nothing we haven’t seen before and it sure feels less captivating if you compare it with other famous boy-girl pacts in anime. The ones I can think of right now are Fate/Stay Night, Shakugan no Shana, and Birdy the Mighty. Heck, even lesser works like Zero no Tsukaima and 3X3 Eyes feel more enriched than this one.Action fanboy: I don’t care if it looks like other shows, or if the story makes no sense. I am watching this for the same reason I am watching Bleach.Otaku: And I just want to increase my waifus and this is a perfect opportunity.Whatever you idiots; I told you it is not a good show and you are free to go waste your money/brain cells/time on it. Don’t say I didn’t warn you afterwards.Reader: What an asshole… *downvotes* second you got green light for adaptation. Further more, you do not have 4 goddamn seasons of endless softporn and millions of otakus who are watching you for the sake of wasting their brain cells. And above all, you are based on a mahwa, and there is no such thing as a good mahwa. Sure, there are very good in terms of fighting but their storylines plain suck. So there you go, I just explained to you why Kurokami never had a chance of being a good anime.Reader: That is the worst negative bias I have seen in my life. Won’t this guy talk about facts instead of straw men, or just say something about the damn show?Sure, I was about to do that. The above was just an introduction to what you are getting yourselves into. Something NOT good. So basically we get this story where your typical/boring/overused stereotype Keita meets this naive/kind hearted/dumb chick/super fighter Kuro and learns that the world is not what it seems to be. Every person has two others like him as safeguards and in case one dies, the other gets his luck and whatever superpowers that comes with. It is a weird concept but does have its captivating charm; imagine one day that you learn you are nothing but a replacement and that when someone dies is not tragic because his copy will inherit his luck/powers.

Kuromukuro,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32245/Kuromukuro,"['--- THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS ---Note (before review) : I wasn\'t expecting much from this series as I began watching it at the time of it\'s airing (Spring 2016) because it started off with some cliche aspects. But lemme say this, I\'m glad I took a chance and continued to watch it each week while it was airing as the story started developing, my lack of enjoyment for it increased to a level of...appreciation for this series.Kuromukuro may not be most original idea as it involves a character from a different time period being awakened to a more modern time period to his own. In this case a Samurai named ""Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma"", from the Sengoku Period waking up in the United Nations Kurobe Research Institute, summer of 2016 to save a Kawaii girl named Yukina Shirahane, who happens to look like his princess who he failed to save during his time period from the Demons, his enemy from his time period. The Demons turn out to be back this time around, and it gives him the reason to live in this time period  to fight for revenge for his Princess, even if it costs him his life. During his time in this world it was pretty amusing seeing him not know much about this time period at which he is currently now part of, mixed with Mecha fights against the Demons known as the ""Efidolg"" to protect Earth. The Efidolg have a goal and may not be what you had expected them to be, which you will find out if you watch this series. It was pretty interesting that he fought alongside with his Princess in a Mecha against the Efidolg during Sengoku time period, & now once more doing the same thing, in this new time period with a new partner, a girl who looks like his Princess. Lots of the characters in a series usually means a lot of characters that barely contributed to an anime but in this case, no so much. Even the Camera Boy Jundai has his purposes in this anime even if it\'s minor but still, I guess useful for this anime\'s development. I have no hate for any characters and like most of them. Personally I had a lot of excitement watching the fights in this anime, as well as the romance in this anime. Overall I enjoyed shipping characters with each other along the way as I love romance stuff in anime. The soundtracks in this anime were pretty good and I actually listened to the openings fully while watching this anime series, each episode. The art was perfect for this series but the art for the Mechas were not anything special compared to most Mecha anime. Thanks for taking the time to read this review and I hope you guys who are planning to watch this series, do so and enjoy it just as much, or better as I did. Again, I left a lot of details out such as a lot of stuff involving Yukina & etc to not spoil you guys. appreciation for this series.Kuromukuro may not be most original idea as it involves a character from a different time period being awakened to a more modern time period to his own.

I am really really not into mecha genre but Kuromukuro proved itself to be much more than that.For instance, you don't have super machines that have one superpower that destroys half of the city thus proving all of the battle scenes you have seen so far become obsolete. Instead, the action scenes are melee focused, and the mecha's don't outshine everything else and their powers are limited.Characters are somewhat intriguing, you will witness some development towards the end of...the season.  Their interactions are sufficiently designed. The plot isn't the most unique gem of anime history but it doesn't need to be. After all this a light hearted anime that will make you cool off as you watch. But that doesn't mean the story is irrelevant, it becomes more appealing as it unravels along the way.  Before i forget, the soundtracks of this anime are quite cool. I really enjoyed the openings.Long story short  i recommend watching this series. I do hope to get another season, the ending really suggested a sequel but in the end who has the money gets screen time. I sincerely hope Kuromukuro gets the popularity it deserves and continues to entertain us. the season.  Their interactions are sufficiently designed.

I sincerely hope Kuromukuro gets the popularity it deserves and continues to entertain us."", 'You know, it\'s one thing to go into a show expecting something it to be good.  It\'s another thing to go into a P.A. Works show and expecting it to be good.  Over the years, P.A. Works have shown us that despite having good animation and interesting ideas, you won\'t always end up with a good show and meaningful characters.  And so, after 15 years of churning out what are mostly original anime (which is honestly quite impressive given how original anime are such a rarity these days), we have Kuromukuro or \'Black Relic\', another mistake made by P.A. Works which is...another case of ""Cool idea, terrible execution.""Story: Shiragane Yukina is your typical high school student with a mother who works in a high tech research facility that produces mechs and studies this giant cube-like object that no one yet understands.  Upon what basically equates touching the cube, they find that inside the cube is a man who bears the personality and loyalty of a medieval Japan period samurai who quickly mistakes Yukina for someone else, tells her about the \'demons\' that threaten the world, and bring her to co-pilot a giant mech that they call the \'Kuromukuro\'.  (Hey look, title drop.)What started out as a mech series with elements of mystery due to the gradual feeding of details and story over the entire 26 episode runtime of the series quickly becomes one of the most boring and poorly written series that P.A. Works has made right up there with Glasslip.  The plot of Kuromukuro just has no sense of urgency and as a result, spends most of its time focusing on other ridiculous sideplots than the threat of the world.  Rather than saving the world or learning how to pilot the mech, we instead get stuck with a hotsprings episode, the school festival, making a movie, and all sorts of random shenanigans that have little to no place in a story focused on saving the world from the destruction of aliens!  It seemed like the show cared more about trying to be a slice of life anime with mecha elements rather than a mecha show with slice of life elements.  There\'s also the whole romantic sideplot between the two main characters which actually doesn\'t make if any sense when you put it in perspective.  The show just kinda threw them together to make the two seem important when in reality, these two characters barely do anything at all.  This squandering plagues the entire run of the series and puts it in a place where it has a confused identity, dooming the series with its lack of cohesiveness.So when you throw away all of the sideplot/slice of life garbage that the show tries to implement, what exactly do you get in the end?  The action and mech focus while considered as the main plot of the series doesn\'t bear fruit in the way you would expect it to.  (Plus, it\'s only like...20% of the entire show.)  Very little of the show is truly mechs sword fighting since the majority of this time is devoted to exposition, more exposition, and even more exposition which is kinda weird considering that the aliens or \'Efidolg\' as they call themselves have the generic ""Take over the world plan"" which...doesn\'t do the show any favors.  It\'s a very overused kind of plotline than when revealed, is kind of depressing to see since you sort of assume that there\'s something more to it when presented...but no, it\'s just ""Take over stuff.  Muahahaha!""  It doesn\'t help that the main characters have plot armor so thick that not even a complete alien takeover where literally everyone, protagonists included, are stuck helpless just waiting to be absorbed into the Efidolg\'s empire, thus making the entire struggle completely meaningless cause you know they\'ll never die.  Not only that, but the show has a few mystery elements that it tries to shove in there like mysterious disappearances and whatever that when revealed, don\'t actually have much impact on the story overall.  On paper they sounded good, but putting them into practice once again doesn\'t do any favors because of how unimportant the show made it sound.Pacing is also a huge leader in Kuromukuro\'s downfall and possibly why I cracked my table when watching the final episode.  The show is never even and it never wants to get to the good stuff or stay at the good stuff.  During the random bullsh*t, the show is at its most lethargic, spanning an entire episode or episodes focusing on an event that doesn\'t have in any way have to do with the main plot, before speeding up like a madman to get through the action/plot-relevant bits so that it can go back to its happy-go-lucky annoyances called side characters.  The finale especially is the biggest offender of this because it\'s by this point in time that P.A. Works realized that they wasted so much time before that they have only ~24 minutes to shove in a timeskip, a reconciliation, more exposition to explain what is going to happen, and a mini fight that scratches more heads than earns smiles because of the quality of its open ending where really nothing gets resolved.P.A. Works\'s attempt to celebrate their 15th year anniversary created a mess of a show that focused on the wrong things, had very generic conflict, and a love story that doesn\'t make sense due to how forced everything was.  The end result was a generic mech show that created more problems than it could solve, and a very disappointed reviewer who still prays to see a show as good as Shirobako or characters are good as Charlotte from a P.A. Works show again.Overview:-  Wasted too much screentime on slice of life-  Main plot was put on the back-burner-  Way too much exposition for a very generic plot-  Horrible pacing issues-  Several mystery parts with drab conclusions-  The most rushed ending I\'ve ever seenCharacters:  As a largely story-based show, the characters in Kuromukuro adhere to that by being puppets on the stage to do stuff in reaction to the current problem at hand.  As such, characters in Kuromukuro are far from deep with little to no character development for any of them.Why don\'t we start with Shiodome Miuna, I mean, Shiragane Yukina.  (Sorry, wrong series.  They just look so similar.) As the main heroine of this series, Yukina honestly doesn\'t do anything of value.  Her entire character is built around the idea that she\'s this meek little girl who eventually mans up and pilots the Kuromukuro along with the other main protagonist, but it really doesn\'t come to fruition.  Sure she\'s less whiny by the end of the series, but the only thing she really does is preach about wanting to save the world from the imminent threat that the show tells us about because ""lol, we ran out of screentime"".  She doesn\'t do anything of significance since other characters always drag her into things, creating a character that truly has no will of her own with a hint of damsel in distress that overall creates a character that I could give less than two sh*ts about.Then there\'s Ouma Tokisada Kennosuke, the 18 year old samurai from medieval Japan encased in a giant cube and preserved until the modern day.  You know how it is.  He\'s a dude that holds onto old and tired values that in the modern day, don\'t really make sense, and is also inept at technology because he never had them and as such is surprised at the thought that you can talk to someone via a tiny box you hold up to your ear.  Chivalrous as he may be, that\'s about all you\'ll get out of Kennosuke.  His character is that of a generic samurai beholden to the master that he serves and destroy all the demons!  His values and what he holds dear eventually change as the series goes on, but the whole samurai aspect and samurai code that he lives and breathes is such a central part to his character that that\'s about the only thing that he has going for him.  Take that away and you\'re left with what equates to an empty husk that doesn\'t have any real purpose.And then there\'s Sophie.  Oh Sophie.  Why you\'re quoted as a main character, I don\'t know.  I chose to talk about her specifically because the show makes such a drastic attempt to make her relevant, important, and overall a half-decent character at the start with this underlying hate towards Yukina that I expected to get explained later on, to a half-baked character with a pension for samurai (that never gets explained) who has little to no importance in the grand scheme of things.  I think P.A. Works was trying to fulfill a quota by having a little girl pilot a giant robot or something, since Sophie\'s entire existence is just a way of creating some form of plot progression using her character.Villains are unsubstantial since they assume that the whole ""Sending down one person to deal with the threat"" is enough to fulfill the malicious plans that they have in store.  They\'re stupid, none of it really makes any sense, and they\'re all generic to a fault.As for side characters, we have the plot related side characters and the slice of life related side characters.  To save the worst for last, let\'s start with the former.  Want exposition?  The guys working at the facility got ya covered.  These guys really have no reason to do anything aside from being either a slight nuisance, or be there to feed information to the audience so we know what the hell is going on.  There\'re also apparently other countries that come in and have their own say/actions in this series, but it\'s so minuscule and lacking that they might as well have not done it in the first place.And then there\'re the slice of life characters.  Oh boy, where do I begin?  These are if not the most annoying characters in the series.  Sad part is?  You see them more often than any other member of the supporting cast.  The most prominent ones are Yukina\'s classmates which begs the question of ""Why are you friends with these people?""  You have Yukina\'s best friend who\'s a cosplayer and the supposed \'wingwoman\' to the romantic subplot, you have the foreign guy who tries to get people to care about him by silently whining to himself when in reality, no one actually cares about him, the completely unnecessary other dude who adds nothing to the series aside from arrogance and a sad attempt at creating a love triangle that this show CLEARLY needed, and the annoying vlogger character who puts any and everyone in danger just so he can get footage for streams even when his life is on the line because clearly, your footage is more important than the dude\'s leg tendon that probably got cut when he jumped in and tried to save you from getting killed!  (You can probably tell who\'s my \'favorite\'.)  The show shoves these nuisances in your face so many times that it downgrades the viewing experience as a whole.  They desperately try to get you to care about these horrible people which doesn\'t turn out very well because they\'re so unnecessary, the overall quality of the would increase dramatically if they weren\'t in there.Overview:-  Lacking main cast-  Generic and uninteresting villains-  Way too many exposition characters-  Terrible people do not a supporting cast make-  F**k you, Jundai.  (Hope you get your camera shoved down your throat and choke on it.)Art: The art is actually really lowbrow for what P.A. works generally produces.  While the designs and overall look of the series do seem like a P.A. works show, the quality is severely lacking.  Nothing really stands out which is a shame considering the company has Angel Beats, Nagiasu, and Charlotte under its belt, thus leaving me puzzled as to what happened to make this project not be as stellar as some of their previous works since the only word that can be described for it is ""average"".Though despite that, the worst offender for this show\'s artwork are the mechs that the series has.  They\'re produced in CGI and don\'t really mesh in too well with the series.  Most of the action is done via CGI robots as a mecha show might suggest (plus, it\'s probably cheaper), and all I can say for the overall look of the show is...eh.  Average really is the only word that can describe this and that\'s really a darn shame looking back because I really do like P.A.\'s arstyle and quality.Overview:+/- Average artstyle-  Mechs don\'t mesh in too well tot he handdrawn background.Sound:  I don\'t really care much for these tracks honestly.  All of them are pretty generic and not particularly worth the time to listen to, so in essence...skip\'em.  Not worth the time.Personal Enjoyment:  It\'s pretty clear from the \'2\' rating and the rants sprinkled throughout the story and character sections that I LOATHE this show.  I\'ve consistently been watching shows made by P.A. Works and I truly believe that the company has imaginative ideas and good enough animation to create something that\'s good quality overall.  But time and time again, I\'m reminded that they go the other way instead and end up creating messes that beg the question ""How did this show end up this way?""  Kuromukuro was a show I went in without many expectations trying to see if P.A. Works would be able to make something half-decent again.  The very first episode didn\'t amuse me and every proceeding episode dragged the show down farther and farther and farther down the dreaded hole of P.A. failures next to Glasslip and Haruchika.  I hated watching this show, agonizing week after week until the final episode where the final letdown finally let me be free.Did I like this show?F**K NO!  The only thing that I could see as an upside to this gargantuan failure of a cohesive story is the fact that they animated a giant stone pillar crashing through a building that was represented as the main office building for P.A. Works.  That legitimately made me laugh and was probably a small apology for the amount of f**k ups that they have done.What didn\'t I like about this show?Everything.  Like legitimately, everything.  Especially you, vlogger boy.  You have literally no purpose in this series aside from being a gigantic prick.  Like seriously, who thought a completely unlikable character like that would be a good idea?!Would I recommend this series?No.  I would suggest you avoid this show like the plague.  It has really one-dimensional and lacking characters, wastes so much screentime that they\'re only about 4 proper fights in the entire series (each of which span roughly 3/4 of an episode only), all wrapped up in an incomplete bow where the main plot/threat isn\'t even solved in the end.  Happy 15th anniversary, P.A. Works, see you next year when you inevitably waste another good idea.  (Please prove me wrong.) another case of ""Cool idea, terrible execution.""Story: Shiragane Yukina is your typical high school student with a mother who works in a high tech research facility that produces mechs and studies this giant cube-like object that no one yet understands.  Upon what basically equates touching the cube, they find that inside the cube is a man who bears the personality and loyalty of a medieval Japan period samurai who quickly mistakes Yukina for someone else, tells her about the \'demons\' that threaten the world, and bring her to co-pilot a giant mech that they call the \'Kuromukuro\'.

This squandering plagues the entire run of the series and puts it in a place where it has a confused identity, dooming the series with its lack of cohesiveness.So when you throw away all of the sideplot/slice of life garbage that the show tries to implement, what exactly do you get in the end?  The action and mech focus while considered as the main plot of the series doesn\'t bear fruit in the way you would expect it to.  (Plus, it\'s only like...20% of the entire show.)  Very little of the show is truly mechs sword fighting since the majority of this time is devoted to exposition, more exposition, and even more exposition which is kinda weird considering that the aliens or \'Efidolg\' as they call themselves have the generic ""Take over the world plan"" which...doesn\'t do the show any favors.  It\'s a very overused kind of plotline than when revealed, is kind of depressing to see since you sort of assume that there\'s something more to it when presented...but no, it\'s just ""Take over stuff.  Muahahaha!""  It doesn\'t help that the main characters have plot armor so thick that not even a complete alien takeover where literally everyone, protagonists included, are stuck helpless just waiting to be absorbed into the Efidolg\'s empire, thus making the entire struggle completely meaningless cause you know they\'ll never die.  Not only that, but the show has a few mystery elements that it tries to shove in there like mysterious disappearances and whatever that when revealed, don\'t actually have much impact on the story overall.  On paper they sounded good, but putting them into practice once again doesn\'t do any favors because of how unimportant the show made it sound.Pacing is also a huge leader in Kuromukuro\'s downfall and possibly why I cracked my table when watching the final episode.  The show is never even and it never wants to get to the good stuff or stay at the good stuff.  During the random bullsh*t, the show is at its most lethargic, spanning an entire episode or episodes focusing on an event that doesn\'t have in any way have to do with the main plot, before speeding up like a madman to get through the action/plot-relevant bits so that it can go back to its happy-go-lucky annoyances called side characters.  The finale especially is the biggest offender of this because it\'s by this point in time that P.A. Works realized that they wasted so much time before that they have only ~24 minutes to shove in a timeskip, a reconciliation, more exposition to explain what is going to happen, and a mini fight that scratches more heads than earns smiles because of the quality of its open ending where really nothing gets resolved.P.A. Works\'s attempt to celebrate their 15th year anniversary created a mess of a show that focused on the wrong things, had very generic conflict, and a love story that doesn\'t make sense due to how forced everything was.  The end result was a generic mech show that created more problems than it could solve, and a very disappointed reviewer who still prays to see a show as good as Shirobako or characters are good as Charlotte from a P.A. Works show again.Overview:-  Wasted too much screentime on slice of life-  Main plot was put on the back-burner-  Way too much exposition for a very generic plot-  Horrible pacing issues-  Several mystery parts with drab conclusions-  The most rushed ending I\'ve ever seenCharacters:  As a largely story-based show, the characters in Kuromukuro adhere to that by being puppets on the stage to do stuff in reaction to the current problem at hand.  As such, characters in Kuromukuro are far from deep with little to no character development for any of them.Why don\'t we start with Shiodome Miuna, I mean, Shiragane Yukina.  (Sorry, wrong series.  They just look so similar.) As the main heroine of this series, Yukina honestly doesn\'t do anything of value.  Her entire character is built around the idea that she\'s this meek little girl who eventually mans up and pilots the Kuromukuro along with the other main protagonist, but it really doesn\'t come to fruition.  Sure she\'s less whiny by the end of the series, but the only thing she really does is preach about wanting to save the world from the imminent threat that the show tells us about because ""lol, we ran out of screentime"".  She doesn\'t do anything of significance since other characters always drag her into things, creating a character that truly has no will of her own with a hint of damsel in distress that overall creates a character that I could give less than two sh*ts about.Then there\'s Ouma Tokisada Kennosuke, the 18 year old samurai from medieval Japan encased in a giant cube and preserved until the modern day.  You know how it is.  He\'s a dude that holds onto old and tired values that in the modern day, don\'t really make sense, and is also inept at technology because he never had them and as such is surprised at the thought that you can talk to someone via a tiny box you hold up to your ear.  Chivalrous as he may be, that\'s about all you\'ll get out of Kennosuke.  His character is that of a generic samurai beholden to the master that he serves and destroy all the demons!  His values and what he holds dear eventually change as the series goes on, but the whole samurai aspect and samurai code that he lives and breathes is such a central part to his character that that\'s about the only thing that he has going for him.  Take that away and you\'re left with what equates to an empty husk that doesn\'t have any real purpose.And then there\'s Sophie.  Oh Sophie.  Why you\'re quoted as a main character, I don\'t know.  I chose to talk about her specifically because the show makes such a drastic attempt to make her relevant, important, and overall a half-decent character at the start with this underlying hate towards Yukina that I expected to get explained later on, to a half-baked character with a pension for samurai (that never gets explained) who has little to no importance in the grand scheme of things.  I think P.A. Works was trying to fulfill a quota by having a little girl pilot a giant robot or something, since Sophie\'s entire existence is just a way of creating some form of plot progression using her character.Villains are unsubstantial since they assume that the whole ""Sending down one person to deal with the threat"" is enough to fulfill the malicious plans that they have in store.  They\'re stupid, none of it really makes any sense, and they\'re all generic to a fault.As for side characters, we have the plot related side characters and the slice of life related side characters.  To save the worst for last, let\'s start with the former.  Want exposition?  The guys working at the facility got ya covered.  These guys really have no reason to do anything aside from being either a slight nuisance, or be there to feed information to the audience so we know what the hell is going on.  There\'re also apparently other countries that come in and have their own say/actions in this series, but it\'s so minuscule and lacking that they might as well have not done it in the first place.And then there\'re the slice of life characters.  Oh boy, where do I begin?  These are if not the most annoying characters in the series.  Sad part is?  You see them more often than any other member of the supporting cast.  The most prominent ones are Yukina\'s classmates which begs the question of ""Why are you friends with these people?""  You have Yukina\'s best friend who\'s a cosplayer and the supposed \'wingwoman\' to the romantic subplot, you have the foreign guy who tries to get people to care about him by silently whining to himself when in reality, no one actually cares about him, the completely unnecessary other dude who adds nothing to the series aside from arrogance and a sad attempt at creating a love triangle that this show CLEARLY needed, and the annoying vlogger character who puts any and everyone in danger just so he can get footage for streams even when his life is on the line because clearly, your footage is more important than the dude\'s leg tendon that probably got cut when he jumped in and tried to save you from getting killed!  (You can probably tell who\'s my \'favorite\'.)  The show shoves these nuisances in your face so many times that it downgrades the viewing experience as a whole.  They desperately try to get you to care about these horrible people which doesn\'t turn out very well because they\'re so unnecessary, the overall quality of the would increase dramatically if they weren\'t in there.Overview:-  Lacking main cast-  Generic and uninteresting villains-  Way too many exposition characters-  Terrible people do not a supporting cast make-  F**k you, Jundai.  (Hope you get your camera shoved down your throat and choke on it.)Art: The art is actually really lowbrow for what P.A. works generally produces.  While the designs and overall look of the series do seem like a P.A. works show, the quality is severely lacking.  Nothing really stands out which is a shame considering the company has Angel Beats, Nagiasu, and Charlotte under its belt, thus leaving me puzzled as to what happened to make this project not be as stellar as some of their previous works since the only word that can be described for it is ""average"".Though despite that, the worst offender for this show\'s artwork are the mechs that the series has.  They\'re produced in CGI and don\'t really mesh in too well with the series.  Most of the action is done via CGI robots as a mecha show might suggest (plus, it\'s probably cheaper), and all I can say for the overall look of the show is...eh.  Average really is the only word that can describe this and that\'s really a darn shame looking back because I really do like P.A.\'s arstyle and quality.Overview:+/- Average artstyle-  Mechs don\'t mesh in too well tot he handdrawn background.Sound:  I don\'t really care much for these tracks honestly.  All of them are pretty generic and not particularly worth the time to listen to, so in essence...skip\'em.  Not worth the time.Personal Enjoyment:  It\'s pretty clear from the \'2\' rating and the rants sprinkled throughout the story and character sections that I LOATHE this show.  I\'ve consistently been watching shows made by P.A. Works and I truly believe that the company has imaginative ideas and good enough animation to create something that\'s good quality overall.  But time and time again, I\'m reminded that they go the other way instead and end up creating messes that beg the question ""How did this show end up this way?""  Kuromukuro was a show I went in without many expectations trying to see if P.A. Works would be able to make something half-decent again.  The very first episode didn\'t amuse me and every proceeding episode dragged the show down farther and farther and farther down the dreaded hole of P.A. failures next to Glasslip and Haruchika.  I hated watching this show, agonizing week after week until the final episode where the final letdown finally let me be free.Did I like this show?F**K NO!  The only thing that I could see as an upside to this gargantuan failure of a cohesive story is the fact that they animated a giant stone pillar crashing through a building that was represented as the main office building for P.A. Works.  That legitimately made me laugh and was probably a small apology for the amount of f**k ups that they have done.What didn\'t I like about this show?Everything.  Like legitimately, everything.  Especially you, vlogger boy.  You have literally no purpose in this series aside from being a gigantic prick.  Like seriously, who thought a completely unlikable character like that would be a good idea?!Would I recommend this series?No.  I would suggest you avoid this show like the plague.  It has really one-dimensional and lacking characters, wastes so much screentime that they\'re only about 4 proper fights in the entire series (each of which span roughly 3/4 of an episode only), all wrapped up in an incomplete bow where the main plot/threat isn\'t even solved in the end.  Happy 15th anniversary, P.A. Works, see you next year when you inevitably waste another good idea.  (Please prove me wrong.)', 'I have to admit, Kuromukuro is a show that taken me by a surprise. It’s not just because of P.A. Works is involved in a mecha show (since when was the last time they’ve been involved in something like that?) but because of how quickly the first episodes takes a viewer like a storm. As an original anime, Kuromukuro is a series that’s like casino, gambling between the good and the bad.Simply put, Kuromukuro doesn’t simply want to be your typical giant robot-war drama but also more of an emotional ride. It wants to capitalize on its characters with its fictional world setting and most...importantly, character relationships. The storytelling also has a bit of background that took place 450 years from its present timeline. Back then, there was an alien force known as the Elf Dorg that invaded Earth. However, the Washiba clan and their heir Yukihime along with Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma were able to retaliate against them while using a weapon known as the “Black Relic”. Yukihime mysteriously vanishes around this time as well. Then, some 60 years ago, this Black Relic is discovered. In the present timeline, a young girl named Yukina Shirahane accidentally gets involved in these mysterious affairs when she triggers the peculiar mecha. See where this is all going? It’s essentially a show that connects events from the past to the present. And while this is hardly anything original, it offers promise as there’s a lot to explore from the initial premise.The show itself has both a serious and lighthearted tone. It combines elements of action, sci-fi, drama, and perhaps even romance. The most mysterious character is Ouma, a main male protagonist born around the Sengoku period. He establishes himself as Yukihime’s protector and he forms a peculiar relationship with Yukina as she resembles her. Being born around the Sengoku period, it doesn’t come as surprise that he is clueless about modern day technology either. Then, there’s Yukina, the typical school girl you can find in almost any sci-fi related series. Although I have to admit, she didn’t leave me with a good impression at first. This comes from the fact that she is often insecure about herself and has a ‘damsel in distress’ type of feel. Prior to getting some actual combat experience, she felt more like a character that needed to be saved rather than saving others. Luckily, the show is able to make her more likeable as the story progressed to show a stronger side with her character.Speaking of characters, the show actually offers quite a diverse range of them. From skilled pilots to dedicated researchers, you’ll probably find at least one character where your mind is thinking along the line of ‘oh that looks familiar”. One of the more prominent female characters in the show is Sophie Noel, a French exchange student who is considered a prodigy. In contrary to Yukina, she is very self-independent and more difficult to approach. Throughout the series, her involvement with the various conflicts brings light about her character. It’s shown that despite being a bit self-centered, she is also very courageous and wants to make a difference in her world. As such, the main three protagonists all stand somewhere on their own that differentiates them from each other. Still, the most mysterious character is unquestionably Ouma. His past isn’t very clear as we only see cryptic clues about them. Furthermore, Ouma’s personality is one that’s very formal although also comedic if you put him into a modern life environment like a school.Although the series has a serious plot (hello? An imminent alien invasion?), it also has a lot of lighthearted moments. This can result in more of a mixed bag reception because viewers may not take the show seriously as intended. The slice of life moments from school are prime examples of this while we also get the occasionally breather episode that furthers the pacing issue. What I do think holds value though is the character relationships. Besides the three main protagonists, there’s evident family dynamics especially with Yukina. She has a mother who is a chief researcher but also plays the role of a mother. Ironically, she seems to lack qualities that would make her a realistic mother but deep down does care for her daughter. (as shown in later episodes) Yukina’s younger sister sees Ouma as a role model because of her passion for historical dramas. Finally, it’s noticeable that Yukina’s father is not present in the show because he mysteriously disappeared. This brings back Yukina’s reasoning for lacking self-esteem as well. So at the center, Yukina is primarily the girl that somehow always gets involved with the mysterious events in the show. Whether it’s meeting a look-alike of herself or even getting abducted by aliens, it’s unquestionable that Yukina has an important role. But the real question is if she is likable? I think this can be viewed from several perspective but most importantly is her development. The show will test your patience as each episode progresses. From a personal perspective, I think she is acceptable but her first impressions aren’t what I call as memorable. At least compared to other characters, Ouma’s introduction will definitely leave an odd impression before your eyes.Produced by P.A. Works, it’s no surprise that the character designs looks familiar. Anyone who has seen Nagi no Asukara will find a similarity with the looks especially the main female characters. P.A. Works has always been known for their exquisite background scenery and the studio once again brings their talent to the table. We got gorgeous visuals with the natural forests and mountainous regions. In space, there’s a strong feeling of sci-fi when it comes to the action sequences. While the show isn’t known for its fan service, it is however known for more of man service thanks to Ouma.In terms of its soundtrack, the musical content of Kuromukuro works quite well. It delivers with an instrumental feel while also known for its emotional drama. However, I find the voice mannerism to be tolerable at best. Yukina’s voice took me a long time to get used to while Sophie’s tone is way too soft for someone with her talent. Of course, Ouma stands out the most with his manly voice, something that I find hard to ignore.It’s unlikely that you’ll find yourself watching Kuromukuro as a high priority on the bucket list. It’s hard to deny but with so many anime coming out these days, it’s one of the lesser noticeable mecha shows. However, I think Kuromukuro is worth the time investment. Yes, it is 2-cour that shuffles between a mecha drama story and all all-out galaxy war involving earthlings and aliens. Even if you’re not a fan of P.A. Works or mecha, it still has moments that can make you come back wanting for more. importantly, character relationships.

I glossed over this anime for a while just by the look of it and the summary because I don't care for cliche-robot-school-air head girls saving the world.Oh boy, was I wrong. And I'm glad I started watching out of boredom.The main characters look like cliches, but they really are very far from that. You wouldn't know it at a glance, but the characters are pretty creative from the very beginning. The main girl (Yukina) seems to get called...a typical 'airhead', where I assume they get from her poor grades from the introduction episode but in fact she's just not all that interested in school and has a passion for structures both man-made and straight from nature. That's refreshing to have a main character that seems very relate-able right from the beginning. The school element doesn't over power either, and that's great.The school-drama thing is not that prevalent which is great, this anime doesn't waste that much time with filler while at the same time developing at a nice steady pace. The love element is very spot on, and there's no beating around the bush like Ranma or Inuyasha. The animation is fluid through out, some fight scene repetition here and there, but over all it's of a much higher standard.While the BASE idea may have been done before, this anime easily develops a stand alone plot with the twists, plot points, and it's characters are creatively unique and strong all around.The ending doesn't happen in the feel-good way that you'd expect, and boy am I happy about that. Twists that feel like reality are very unexpected in animes!Overall, I will happily be awaiting season 3. a typical 'airhead', where I assume they get from her poor grades from the introduction episode but in fact she's just not all that interested in school and has a passion for structures both man-made and straight from nature.

ARE YOU READY FOR SOME- Samurai styled protagonist from the past in present time?- Mech fights?- Some slice of life highschool time- Alien robos crashing from the sky? (I SAYY CRRRIIIERR I SAAYY..nvm)- Mysteries of the past and the future of humanity at stake?- Cute gals like Chisaki from Nagi no Asukara (since its P.A. Works)?Then you got it down right here!...For an anime aired during Spring 2016 I sure left this one out. In fact, it didn\'t get that much attention during the season but boy was I glad I watched this!Personally this anime was so much more interesting than ""Dancecross Charlie"" (which was airing during the same time but had a whole lot more publicity obviously because of the franchise) and ""Crashlips"" (from P.A. Works as well, boy that was horrid).There are interesting mechfights. Characters with different personalities and their different agendas (and stereotypical characters like AMERIICAANNSS SAYING THEY\'RE GONNA BUST BULLETS UP UR A** EVERYTIME HE GOES TO BATTLE) I but I just adoooree P.A. Work\'s characters from which they followed the same style as Nagi no Asukara! Doesnt the main heroine just remind you of Chisaki?Not to mention there are some romance in this. No great anime has no shred of romance in it >:)Man I love how everything unfolded in this anime. Kennosuke\'s past, the evil alien\'s plans, and how it ended. Some say it was rushed, I personally thought it was pretty great.(/Spoiler/ This gave me a bit of nostalgia from Heroic Age. How he opened up that wormhole and unfortunately leaves that girl of his life to do what he must. )This anime was an overall a super satisfying 26 episode anime that answered the questions I wanted answered, ended the way I\'d loved it to end and making me wish there was a 2nd season ;_; For an anime aired during Spring 2016 I sure left this one out.

Well for that LA can say that the notion of this being an Neon Genesis Evangelion clone is a farce as it has it\'s own identity and own plot that strays away from being a clone of NGE quite quickly.In terms of mystery, there are several, like who Kennosuke really is, who are the invading alien robots and what does it have to do with the United Nations Kurobe Research Institute, what link does Yukina have with the Black Relic?. These questions for the majority are ALL answered thankfully the the end of the anime. This intrigue really was what kept LA from watching it to the end. These mysteries more or less justifiable as the plot progresses and it makes the world building of what the Black Relic and the invading aliens ""Efidolg"" motivations *cough* world domination *cough* typical *cough* and the plot twists do get explained MOST of the time.In terms of characters, we do have our stereotypical mecha pilots from again the ""kill all demons"" Kennosuke to the reluctant ""don\'t wanna kill"" Yukina, to the deadpanned ""do your job"" Sophie Noelle voiced by Reina Ueda and her butler Toshiyuki ""Sebastian"" Mozumi voiced by Taiten Kusunoki and finally the foul-mouthed ""RECKT YOUR SHIT"" Tom Borden voiced by Ryouhei Kimura as well as all the bridge bunnies and commanders of the mech fleet of Kurobe Dam. On the school side of things is where things get rather tame, from the love interest of Yukina, Ryouto Akagi voiced by Kaito Ishikawa to Yukina\'s best friend cosplayer Mika Ogino voiced by Asami Seto, the butt monkey José Carlos Takasuka voiced by Shuusuke Takeuchi and of course the weirdest character Jundai Kayahara voiced by Yuusuke Kobayashi who always have a camera with him and records EVERYTHING, just LA or is Jundai the manifestation of the modern age considering his ""record all AND NOTHING BUT THAT"" mentality. Really due to this wide and expansive cast, you\'ll think the development is slim, well actually it\'s not, for the majority of the character development, it\'s really touches upon most of the character motivations for the future and how something like the alien invasion can put a stop to all that, really be it Ryouto wanting to tell his feelings to Yukina, to Kennosuke\'s fate and then after to what Yukina wants to do (before or after she was linked with the Black Relic), Kuromukuro\'s characters really develops this huge cast quite nicely. LA\'s favourite character?...Sophie Noelle, why?...she\'s one of the more intellectual characters in the anime as well as one of the professional mecha pilots and her moment in the spotlight arrives MANY times outside or in battle. She really is the ACE IN THE HOLE of the anime. LA also had the soft spot for the shy ditzy teacher Marina Unami voiced by Manami Sugihira during the early episodes when Kennosuke and Yukina were a bit more grating together than usual.Yes on speaking of which, Kuromukuro does go into a rather vague romantic subplot, with a sorta love triangle formed with Kennosuke, Ryouta and Yukina and if you want to know LA\'s opinion of the romance, LA was pretty much sticking to Kennosuke x Yukina it was kinda obvious where this was gonna lead to. As for how LA actually thought about the romance, well that love triangle was predictable to say the least, but LA was more or less worried about Muetta voiced by Aki Toyosaki (Spoilers on this character so won\'t say much), Kennosuke and Yukina due to the complicated circumstance of this ""romance"" it was hard to pinpoint as well as erratic considering the situation this love triangle was in at the time. The romance is a more of an after thought as there are more pressing issues such as the invading mech army and their motivations, but LA can see why the romance element was there.There are a few pacing issues here and there, but considering the various of genres it\'s under of sci-fi, action, mecha and later on mystery and romance, it\'s pacing is rather inconsistent, it\'s not until the halfway point, it really changes focus on it\'s main storyline and that\'s where it really starts getting into the nitty gritty, however because of this, the pacing is STILL inconsistent but in a good way (as in it finally gets into the details and focuses on the main storyline and it takes it\'s time with it with it\'s add slice of life ""character developments"" but yeah that goes around being ""inconsistent"" most of the time)In terms of animation, expected of PA. Works to have the great detail in backgrounding once again, the character designs can get janky at times but that was really rare most of the times. Yes, LA needs to point out that the CGI on the robots are blatant most of the time, but NOT all the mech\'s are like this and more or less integrated them quite well on occasion. Really due to the varying and unique mech designs it also constituted the mech battles to be even more action-packed and fluid battles due to how PA Works integrated the CGI and traditional animation together and add in Yukina\'s tactical strategies and you have some very nice mech battles. CGI was used modestly to say the best and they just didn\'t put CGI whenever they could. Overall PA Works did great on the animation...which was expected.In terms of voice acting, it was decent for the most part, keeping most of the characters personalities in check. Youhei Azakami was great as the boisterous Kennosuke as well as Ryohei Kimura as the foul-mouthed Tom Borden. LA\'s favourite voice actor?...Mao Ichimichi, yes Mao certainly got grating in the early episodes (what with her whining and her butting heads with Kennosuke), but further down the plot, her focus and development both as a character and relationship-wise really gave Mao A LOT more material. Second would go to Reina Ueda for Sophie, because Sophie was a badass through and through.The plot twists given to Kuromukuro were rather unexpected to say the least and Kuromukuro really didn\'t give much hints to most of the mysteries LA said and the plot really likes to keep tightlipped about it. The plot twists does make Kuromukuro really ramp it up the tension especially during the latter half however one plot twist does feel like it went rather into an anti-climax which led it down the finale with some of the cliches to go with went to. Now for LA, LA kinda got the reasoning why, but LA still kinda saw the cliches bumping into LA distracting LA at the same time. On speaking of the ending...The ending was left rather open ended with no definitive ending and LA was expecting this as considering the circumstances, LA can see why it was left open ended. The ending did have a rather good ""final battle"" in a ways and once again really holds onto the ""future"" themes that was lingering around through the meat and buildup to the finale of this ending. The ""epilogue"" with it\'s timeskip was also a great addition to it and seeing these characters somewhat grownup and seeing what happened to them was pretty good. Whatever reasoning as to this open ended ending...LA was still satisfied, not only because LA saw that this ending couldn\'t push all these loose plot threads all into the finale, but the ambiguity really hones in the ""look to the future"" theme and it was still a good ending nonetheless.So, Kuromukuro...was it a bad or good anime?, well with what LA talked about with it\'s technicals, LA thinks the devil is in the details as just talking about technicals isn\'t enough to see how good Kuromukuro turned out to be, sure it had problems in it\'s early episodes but by the end of this anime as well as it\'s inconsistent pacing and for an original anime done by PA.Works and this anime being it\'s 15th Anniversary production, Kuromukuro did itself justice from it\'s intriguing mysteries, unique wacky characters and PA Works typically beautiful animation. LA really couldn\'t pin down if Kuromukuro was good or bad not until Episode TWENTY, there is a reason LA said it was LA\'s most indecisive anime of Spring & Summer 2016 but overall on LA\'s verdict, Kuromukuro did good, not great but still you did good nonetheless. alien robots trying to invade for unknown reasons, Kennosuke also goes through knowing how the modern age works due to his samurai-era like ways getting him A LOT of attention as well as troubles that goes along with it......yeah feels like Neon Genesis Evangelion just in a slightly lighter tone doesn\'t it?. Well for that LA can say that the notion of this being an Neon Genesis Evangelion clone is a farce as it has it\'s own identity and own plot that strays away from being a clone of NGE quite quickly.In terms of mystery, there are several, like who Kennosuke really is, who are the invading alien robots and what does it have to do with the United Nations Kurobe Research Institute, what link does Yukina have with the Black Relic?. These questions for the majority are ALL answered thankfully the the end of the anime. This intrigue really was what kept LA from watching it to the end. These mysteries more or less justifiable as the plot progresses and it makes the world building of what the Black Relic and the invading aliens ""Efidolg"" motivations *cough* world domination *cough* typical *cough* and the plot twists do get explained MOST of the time.In terms of characters, we do have our stereotypical mecha pilots from again the ""kill all demons"" Kennosuke to the reluctant ""don\'t wanna kill"" Yukina, to the deadpanned ""do your job"" Sophie Noelle voiced by Reina Ueda and her butler Toshiyuki ""Sebastian"" Mozumi voiced by Taiten Kusunoki and finally the foul-mouthed ""RECKT YOUR SHIT"" Tom Borden voiced by Ryouhei Kimura as well as all the bridge bunnies and commanders of the mech fleet of Kurobe Dam. On the school side of things is where things get rather tame, from the love interest of Yukina, Ryouto Akagi voiced by Kaito Ishikawa to Yukina\'s best friend cosplayer Mika Ogino voiced by Asami Seto, the butt monkey José Carlos Takasuka voiced by Shuusuke Takeuchi and of course the weirdest character Jundai Kayahara voiced by Yuusuke Kobayashi who always have a camera with him and records EVERYTHING, just LA or is Jundai the manifestation of the modern age considering his ""record all AND NOTHING BUT THAT"" mentality. Really due to this wide and expansive cast, you\'ll think the development is slim, well actually it\'s not, for the majority of the character development, it\'s really touches upon most of the character motivations for the future and how something like the alien invasion can put a stop to all that, really be it Ryouto wanting to tell his feelings to Yukina, to Kennosuke\'s fate and then after to what Yukina wants to do (before or after she was linked with the Black Relic), Kuromukuro\'s characters really develops this huge cast quite nicely.

It's actually funny, can be a bit ridiculous, and there are good fight scenes if you can ignore the CGI. The plot is good, too; just when you think you've got it all figured out, there's a plot twist. I even shed tears at the end of the second season, it was so sweet. All the characters are well-rounded and encounter their own difficulties. Loved the character depth and development. This anime has a really funny clash of genres but it's...interesting and really entertaining. Highly recommend. interesting and really entertaining. Highly recommend."", 'P.A. Works has tried a lot of genres in the past, but I really didn\'t expect them to celebrate their 15 year anniversary with a mech-action based show, an original work too! Kuromukuro is a show about saving humanity as we know it from alien invaders in overwhelmingly powerful mechs, extremely similar in theme and plot progression to the early part of Aldnoah Zero. However, the P.A. Works character-centric touch is here in its full glory. If you\'re looking for a show with a bit of mech and action but is, at its core, about its characters, look no further. Kuromukuro is a fun, enjoyable...ride and I\'m glad to report that this is another outstanding success under P.A. Works\' belt.Animation:Though the show has good coloring and decent shading, it\'s a step back from previous P.A. Works titles. The setting takes place in Tateyama, only a stone\'s throw away from P.A. Works\'s real-life headquarters. Given the proximity to lush mountains and serene waters, I\'d expected there to be more of a focus on the backgrounds like in Nagi no Asukara. Unfortunately, there just isn\'t; perhaps bowing to general industry trends, you can definitely tell that more of the backgrounds are CGI generated. Likewise, the fairly diverse group of CGI mechs isn\'t what I\'d call pretty; someone on the team was clearly obsessed with having lots of limbs. The actual characters fare much better. I see a lot of similarity in the drawing style between this and Nagi no Asukara; the girls definitely have a touch of moe. Facial expressions are a touch above your standard show- this is pretty important considering the complex nature of our heroine.There is a large amount of action in this show. A vast majority of it consists of mech to mech battles, luckily there isn\'t any particle spamming here- just melee combat with what look like gigantic, shiny vibroblades. The choreography is not bad and our protagonist\'s mech performs admirably in one versus many situations. Unfortunately, you can only impress so much when all the action is in 3D CGI; even the ""bleeding"" nanoparticles upon damage looks really fake. As with typical mech shows, expect a fair amount of blood and mass slaughtering of hapless regular soldiers. Though there is your typical bath scene, I wouldn\'t consider this an ecchi show.Sound:I likewise think that the sound package here isn\'t category leading. The show has two OPs and two EDs. Both OPs are by the same artist and share rock-based instrumentation and a playful feel. I don\'t particularly like either melody though the second one perhaps is a tad better. The first ED feels more fitting for the show, with an electro-inspired instrumentation and a decent melody. The second ED has a good melody and is rock based like the OPs. The BGM is supportive and lends well to tension at times, but doesn\'t have any core, repeating themes. There\'s just a single melody that I would consider memorable.The VA cast, on the other hand, is very strong; there\'s so much power in this cast that I don\'t even really know where to start. Our heroine Yukina is voiced by Mao, who does a great job and at an octave higher than her roles in Bahamut and Netoge. I think Asami Seto has come a long way from her earlier roles, and her performance here as Mika definitely shows it; honestly, her acting is what made Mika the second most interesting character in the show. Obviously, our out-of-place samurai, voiced by Youhei Azakami, is the most interesting, and is well voiced despite the VA\'s relative inexperience. Aki Toyosaki also lends her expertise in the latter half of the show to great effect as well.Story:In a parallel modern world Japan, the UN has set up a research facility to study mysterious artifacts, which happens to include a mech. Our heroine, Yukina, is a rather unmotivated teen who happens to be the daughter of the UN facility chair. While on a routine visit to the facility, the world suddenly comes under attack from an unknown force. Seeing one of the artifacts glow, Yukina touches it and out pops an ancient, 18-year-old samurai (Ken) who instantly greets her as ""princess"". The story follows this, rather quarrelsome pair as they are forced to work together, as Ken happens to be the pilot of the artifact mech, which he calls kuromukuro.The story follows a central plot that is told at a brisk, action-packed pace; for that reason, it feels a lot faster than Nagi no Asukara. The early part of the show reminds me of a synergy between the character elements in Inuyasha and the battle patterns in Aldnoah Zero. It\'s extremely enjoyable for me because Ken has to quickly adapt to modern society, and his reactions remind me of Inuyasha in the present time and Sagara Sousuke from FMP. The battles early on are rather predictable and, like A/Z, have antagonists showing up one at a time. Half way through the season, a pivotal event occurs that knocks the plot onto a different trajectory. This then builds to a very predictable climax and a rather interesting, open ended conclusion.What\'s unique about this interpretation of the mech genre is the character-centric focus. Rather than focusing on the political overtones in war or exploring why we fight, it focuses instead on the relationships between the students and researchers caught in the middle of it all. It\'s a refreshing twist that works rather well as the character development fits well in-between the many battles. Overall, it\'s not nearly as deep of a story as Nagi no Asukara, but definitely feels more contiguous than the painful trek through Valvrave.There are qualms with most shows, and this show is no exception. I definitely question some of the decision-making by protagonists and antagonists alike, and really feel like the studio has serious issues against the UN for some reason. It also doesn\'t help that there are some pretty strong plot shields on particular characters (think like the pilots in Valvrave) and that a fair amount of plot questions remain unanswered. However, I felt the strengths in this category far outweigh the faults.Character:The main cast in this show is superb. Our hero, Ken, is a brash, impulsive warrior who definitely stands out from your standard nice guy; given his historic background though he is still completely inexperienced at dealing with girls. His interactions with the initially reluctant and honestly petrified Yukina are extremely fun to watch, and their behaviors and feelings toward each other change through the show. Pay close attention to Yukina\'s career choices at the beginning of the show, I really liked how the show tied this to the ending.The show has a fairly large supporting cast consisting of a group of students at Yukina\'s school and a subset of the research workers and pilots at the UN facility. Though there is relatively little exposition on these characters, they still contribute meaningfully to either the plot or the main characters\' development. I also appreciated how many of these supporting characters had a good deal of depth in personality; Mika and Yukina\'s sister Koharu are great examples. However, I do feel that a few of the other supporting characters were a bit on the superfluous side, such as the fearless student who was obsessed with streaming everything that was happening. The antagonists were also mostly unexplored, pretty similar overall to those early on in Aldnoah Zero.Overall, I found this show to have a great amount of character development, good balance of character chemistry, and just enough of a hint of romance to keep me happy, especially considering the amount of screen time dedicated to action sequences.Value:Dynamic characters and good character designs/animation aren\'t usually the main selling points of a mech show. However, these P.A. Works hallmarks shine through in this show. Kuromukuro combines these with an original, contiguous story that is well-executed albeit still partially unexplored. There is some re-watch value as well as there are some foreshadows that could easily have been overlooked in an initial viewing. If you enjoyed previous P.A. titles or liked shows like FMP or Inuyasha, this should be an entertaining watch. If you\'re looking for a more traditional mech show with politics or inspiration for your next model kit, look elsewhere. While I won\'t consider this an absolute masterpiece, it was a greatly enjoyable watch and definitely worthy of the P.A.

Works name.', ""When I first saw this show on Netflix, I avoided it because, even though I'm a giant anime fan, I've never watched a mecha anime before because it seemed boring. When I first started it, it was a little slow and I didn't know how good the story would be, but as I continued watching, the better it became. This was the first mecha anime I watched and really enjoyed. I definitely recommend watching this. The only thing that annoyed me was the ending, I mean it was sweet but didn't meet my expectations (but that's just my opinion, I'm sure others really loved...it.). it.)."", 'Hello everyone, since you\'re reading this, you wanna hear my opinion and review of this, so let\'s just get right into it!The Story, (6/10)You can read it for yourself in the summary, but I personally think that it was a bit clichè when you have aliens trying to take over the world and fighting with mecha, but there are a few points where it did have me quite interested.The Art, (8/10)Since this was from the studios of P.A, I expected alot, and I was not disappointed art wise.If you haven\'t heard of P.A Works, you\'ve probably heard of anime they have made....I\'m sure you have heard of Angel Beats! And Another, Charlotte, Nagi no Asukara.And well, I personally thing Nagi no Asukara has the best art like, ever.I have watched, out of their works, Angel Beats! Nagi no Asukara, Kuromukuro and HaruChika.And Art-wise, Kuromukuro does not fall short.The Sound, (8/10)I personally enjoyed the songs, which were produced by Glay. And other songs of the anime by MICHI and Ami Wajima. For some reason the second ED makes me sad, but in a good way, (It was done by Ami Wajima) So I thoroughly enjoy them, and they are in my Itunes list.The Characters, (5/10)If you\'re like me, and you have watched the anime, you know you hate Kaya the camera dude and the school trio, they really are a downfall of the anime. And when the protaganist Yukina is not being saved from being kidnapped, she\'s whining. And the only people in the anime that have balls are Kennosuke, Sebastian, Borden, and Sophie, and the aliens.The characters (I\'m looking at you school trio) get in the way and become really annoying. They try to add slice of life in the anime when it does NOT belong.MY OFFICIAL OPINION:The Good,I definitely liked the art, and music, and action, especially the action because unlike most mecha anime, most of the battle was done melee, which I really liked.The BAD,The story often got sidetracked, from the stupid school trio, and the ending, if there is not a another season, could be considered a crap ending.So, why should YOU watch it?Well, if you\'re a fan of P.A you can watch it, or if you actually want a mecha anime where they don\'t just fight with beams and blasts. If you are looking for an exceptional story with good plot development, this is not for you. Kuromukuro doesn\'t bring much into the ""genre"" of ""Saving the world from aliens"" if that is a genre.So anyway, thank you for reading my review! I\'m sure you have heard of Angel Beats! And Another, Charlotte, Nagi no Asukara.And well, I personally thing Nagi no Asukara has the best art like, ever.I have watched, out of their works, Angel Beats!

Kuromukuro doesn\'t bring much into the ""genre"" of ""Saving the world from aliens"" if that is a genre.So anyway, thank you for reading my review!', 'This is my first review but i\'ll try my best.I first heard of kuromukuro from a friend of mine and he described it to me this way ""A samurai dude comes from the past and kills these mecha called Ogres while piloting another mecha"".Hearing this i didnt expect much but when i started it i really liked the first 2 episodes and had really high expectations, and maybe because of that there were things that i didnt like after watching all of it.The story even if there\'s the whole alien mecha cliche had some original plot like the mc being samurai from the...sengoku era that was sleeping inside an ""Artifact"".The sound and art were really good and was way better than most anime out there.Now comes the part i really hated, the characters, some of them were really annoying and pretty dull. One that i really hated was Ryoto Akagi, the writing for him was really lacking and that made him the stereotyipical ""i love the mc but will never get together with her"" and this was seen since the beggining.He tries to act tough or say that he\'ll defend her without any apparent reason shown in the anime, the only reason that we see is that he ""likes"" her.Another one is the female mc Shirahane, what i didnt like about her is that the anime makes it seem that she\'s important to be kennosuke\'s navigator but that\'s not really true, and we can see this in the 9th episode (i think?) where kennosuke tells her that he can pilot even without her (and, this is what i think, couldnt there be another navigator because first there was the hime and now shirahane, so why not another?), so why write her as being scared and not wanting to pilot and then instantly 1 episode later make her change idea even if she didnt have to?This was just a try to make the character seem more deep then it really is.Oh, almost forgot, she explicitly says, by her mouth, that she didn\'t want to be born from her father, just because some elementary or middle school (i dont remember specifically) called her a liar.Well, so much for family bonds.Kennosuke was alright, a loyal samurai that after finishing his mission wanted to commit seppuku for his master (at least at the beggining).Ill just finish with this last one, Jundai. Boy oh boy now this is a pretty dumb one. This guy loves to stream and videotape stuff, and now that these aliens came to earth he literally kamikaze\'s his way through military area to film the Ogres fighting, and the military does literally NOTHING TO STOP MILITARY INFORMATION FROM LEAKING.Well overall a good anime and people may find it better than i did, since characters are mostly about opinions, but i would give it a 7.Could have been better with a little bit of tweaking.(If you find any info missing or wrong pls pm me,Its been a while since i saw this anime and i couldn\'t find some info on the net.) sengoku era that was sleeping inside an ""Artifact"".The sound and art were really good and was way better than most anime out there.Now comes the part i really hated, the characters, some of them were really annoying and pretty dull.

I found about one-third of the characters to be interesting, but I found myself really disappointed with the story and plot. So many things were left answered, and several events in the story seemed far too convenient to be believable; it was just random at times, and I got lost partway through it all due to the lack of explanation and good story-telling.Don't get me wrong. Kuromukuro was not awful by any stretch of the imagination; it simply lacked a well-written and detailed story, in my personal opinion. "", ""At first, I was reluctant on watching a show with samurai and robots.... However, the conjunction of these polar themes make Kuromukuro worthwhile.The plot is original and is perfectly paced. The main characters aren't the recyclable mainstream anime characters and the show doesn't force the idea of romance between the two.The show also doesn't start off at the discouraging, slow pace found in many anime shows.I didn't believe that the show would be as good as it was. I can't even describe what is so great about it. Kuromukuro is just a show you have to take a chance on. "", '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)In Kuromukuro, Yukina’s mother forgets about her phone which ends up being the catalyst for the entire anime.I did something similar once. I used to own one of those dinky push-up cell phones that exposed a keyboard. I barely ever used it since I rarely reached out to anybody of my own volition, and it had no capacity for apps let alone the Internet.One day, I plugged it into the charger I kept in my bathroom (for whatever reason), and, in my infinite wisdom, I left it there – for three whole days. When I...finally remembered to get it, I had more messages in my inbox than I had ever seen. Texts of the “Where are you?” variety from my cousins, siblings, and grandmother, and multiple missed calls from my parents wondering why I wasn’t picking up.I later learned that my mother was ready to phone both my apartment complex and even the police to make sure I was safe since I was responding to literally nobody who contacted me. I apologized for my stupidity, and I promised never to do something so careless with my phone ever again.Kuromukuro doesn’t get to make any more promises since it has officially finished, but its mistakes were more and grander than mine ever was.STORYKuromukuro begins with Yukina, a high-school girl utterly unsure of what she wants to do or who she wants to be. Her teacher berates her, and her mother doesn’t provide much guidance, so she only wonders what the future has in store for her. However, when aliens invade Earth, a samurai named Kennosuke (Ken for short) reawakens, and she finds herself fighting them alongside him, Yukina must stop wondering and start pushing forward.On a narrative level, Kuromukuro contains a plethora of problems that bog down almost anything it tries to do.To be fair, it’s not all bad. In the first half or so, Ken is a newborn baby, shocked at the strange era he has been thrust into. He criticizes the girls for wearing “unbecoming” bathing suits (while occasionally, and understandably, sneaking a peek), and he almost believes that Yukina’s mother is a woman trapped inside a small “box.” Kuromukuro uses his ignorance mostly for comedic effect, but the bewilderment he brings rounds out the experience.The anime also showcases a lot of robot fights. Thanks to Ken’s kuromukuro’s penchant for swords, many of the mech battles involve close-quarters combat that give the fights more immediacy than guns or projectiles ever could. Later, when multi-robot skirmishes, flying enemies, and giant behemoths enter the stage, the fights gain variety to prevent too much stagnation.Kuromukuro even tackles a theme on freedom during its story. How the Efidolgs brainwash their enemies to use their bodies as puppets. Ken’s kuromukuro requiring two pilots. The space motif and the idea of being bound by one’s past.Sadly, these three traits are not nearly enough to stop its numerous other problems from swamping itself.One of the more apparent issues is where everything happens. Despite the entire Earth falling prey to the aliens and their invasion, the show rarely (if ever) depicts events happening elsewhere. Worse still, almost the whole story takes place in or around the research facility, preventing variance in its setting and amplifying the feeling of isolation even more.Retrieving Ken’s kuromukuro, the existence of the important pivot stone beneath the building, and the fact that no other country has the technology to face the aliens are the show’s reasons as to why everything keeps happening within the same general area. Meaning, this isolation is excused somewhat.Still, this story isn’t about a group of friends in school or a person trying to make it big in a city. Static settings in those scenarios make sense. Here, where the plot’s conflict is global (arguably galactic) in scale, the anime only serves to prevent its own conflict from growing to a level that befits the plight.The conflict itself also has issues in that it never seems to really build towards anything. Ken doesn’t seem to know what he wants to do after he defeats all the ogres, and Yukina floats along as the second wheel that is barely turning.In fact, the anime’s biggest conflict – ending the Efidolg once and for all – happens far and away, after the anime is done, and without ever being shown. It’s nice that Ken found a higher calling and that Yukina gained a more definitive path in life, even going full-circle with her “Mars” answer to her career prospects. But the whole situation reeks of too-little-too-late syndrome.From here, Kuromukuro finds itself in even rougher territory – no matter where it turns.Much of the science magic does not get explained. While perhaps unnecessary, the Artifacts, the weapons, and the alien technology are not given backing beyond the small snippets provided at the end of each episode which describe the machinery therein.The huge reveals are too anticlimactic. The nature of Yukina’s father’s death fails to work because he never had any prominent scenes. The conclusion to the big bad guy that led the attack on Earth doesn’t matter because he sat on his throne for twenty episodes straight. And the outcome of Princess Yuki’s demise lacks weight because her head being used for cloning purposes gets oddly forgotten.The show also tries to push a romance angle. Romance is the logical progression between Ken and Yukina given how the two ride the kuromukuro together and given how much time they spend around one another (at school, at home).Unfortunately, it’s only a half-bloom since these two don’t have enough special, private moments together. They bicker, he drags her away from some pestering paparazzi, and he saves her life a couple of times, but their relationship never definitively takes that next step forward, making their final dramatic scene together in the sky less emotional than wanted. His offhand “confession,” that he will make her his wife, should be evidence enough.The overt sexual scenes also have no place. Mika’s cosplays and Marina’s chest are technically not extreme in their lewdness. But, when the world is in danger of complete decimation, Shenmei massaging Yukina as she yelps in pain and pleasure fails to fit within the context of the story (no matter how titillating their girl-on-girl action may be).Even how most of the facility turn on Ken, Zell, and Muetta when they literally saved the entire world was lame. After everything that had happened up to this point, it comes off as unnecessary drama in the lead up to the finale. A murky problem, like all the others, that the anime cannot escape from.ANIMATIONKuromukuro does not do anything too fancy with its visuals. P.A. Works’ typical style for its character designs persists. The forced static setting prevents variation in the background art. Lighting and cinematography do nothing noteworthy. Actual animation remains consistent with the occasional extra spark.However, where the anime deserves praise is in its CG visuals. The robots never feel out of place within the environment, movements are not janky, and the CG elements appear much more frequently than what the average anime would include.In fact, the CG art and animation were so strong at times that it felt as though this anime was the guinea pig to test, practice, or otherwise flex P.A. Works’ graphical skills and capabilities. If nothing else, the CG work is arguably the best trait of the entire show and stands as a good example of how to do it successfully.CHARACTERSKuromukuro is, in some sense, a story about Ken and Yukina. The former finds himself in a weird world that wasn’t meant for him, the latter does not like this world she is in, and both struggle to discover their place within it.Unfortunately, the anime includes too many extra characters for its own good. The male students and the teachers from the school. The doctor, engineers, and radar people from the facility. The other GAUS pilots. The handful of aliens invading the planet. Yukina’s family members.Having a lot of cast members is not automatically a negative. What makes it a problem in Kuromukuro’s case is that the large number of extra characters simultaneously get in the way of Ken and Yukina’s own individual development and have very little given about them.For example, Muetta, the Princess Yuki lookalike, is an enemy of Earth until she gets captured by the humans and has revealed to her the true nature of her origins as a clone of the princess. She acts as a mental block for Ken, and she has a personable moment where she feels that she “shouldn’t be here” (i.e., Earth) when speaking with Yukina in a wooden shed. But her involvement steals time away from Yukina and, come the end of the season, Muetta’s role and purpose was little more than helping to pilot the kuromukuro units.Many of the side characters either fulfill a singular role or do so little that it’s a wonder why they were there in the first place. Paula and Giro are the main technicians for Ken’s kuromukuro. Jundai live streams everything on the Internet to let the rest of the world know what’s going on. Marina acts as an “adviser” for the students when necessary.Some of the side characters are even worse off, holding relative importance but never quite fulfilling their duty. Hiormi, Yukina’s mother, maintains this insincere-but-actually-sincere relationship with her daughter that doesn’t receive a clean resolution. The Efidolgs have weak personalities and even weaker backgrounds, turning them into narratively worthless enemies. And Princess Yuki, despite how much she has (directly and indirectly) influenced Ken, does not get the proper flashback treatment she deserves.Yet the worst offender is a side character whose “role” and “importance” are poorly planned: Zell. In essence, Zell is just a giant plot convenience, often used to provide swathing segments of exposition to explain the secrets of the enemy and the past whenever and wherever the anime feels like it. The anime attempts to write off why he never approached anybody for the previous 450 years by saying people, on sight, were either afraid of him or wanted to kill him. But that’s quite the flimsy excuse – especially when total world destruction is on the line.Sophie is arguably the only side character that receives extra attention that ends up meaningful. In the first half of the season, Sophie is the ace pilot whose calm demeanor highlights her maturity. In the second half, though, the surrounding threats cause her (never-shown) parents to ask for her removal from the GAUS program, fearing for her safety. She feels conflicted over whether she should obey the orders of her parents and high command, but, eventually, she steels herself thanks to Ken’s words and reaffirming her samurai code.Even in this dissection, Ken and Yukina have been sidelined thanks to the side characters. Nevertheless, these two have their challenges that they must overcome as the main protagonists.Ken, once a samurai of a time long gone, arrives in the modern era through coincidental fashion. Upon his reawakening, he believes Yukina to be his long-lost princess and vows to eliminate any and all ogres before him. While he soon realizes that Yukina is not the woman he originally swore loyalty to, he upholds his second promise, destroying the “ogres” with strength and ease.Much of his character revolves around his endgame. That is, when he accomplishes his goal, what does he plan to do? Initially, he simply wanted to meet his princess in the afterlife. However, after Yukina’s refusal to play along with Ken’s suicidal wish, he shifts his mindset, promising now instead to fight and live rather than fight until nothing remained.All the while, he becomes accustomed to the oddities of this period, like new foods and cars (or “horses” to him). He appears to be acclimating, but he still ponders what occurred to make his current situation happen. Fusunani, the captured Efidolg that Ken cuts down, reminds him of someone from his past, but Muetta’s arrival shakes his core. Her stark resemblance to Princess Yuki messes with Ken, conflicting his sense of loyalty as he tries to protect both Yukina and Muetta.Thankfully, Ken never fully wavers. He saves Yukina from abduction, defeats the Efidolg menace on Earth, and chases after their main fleet to stop them once and for all.As for Yukina, she followed a somewhat similar path to Ken. In the beginning, she does not know what she wants to do later in life. She’s not the best at school, she doesn’t pursue any interesting hobbies (besides aqueducts), and those around her aren’t giving her the clearest of guidance.When Ken arrives and puts her on his kuromukuro, though, she finds herself contributing towards something she knows she definitely wants no part of. Riding his kuromukuro not only scares her but also forces her to see death and destruction on a level that she cannot handle.But what gets to her the most is how nobody, not even her mother (who slaps her), seems to understand where she is coming from. All she wants is less ordering and more gratefulness. Ken complies, asking rather than demanding for her help, so she musters her courage to fight alongside him.Thus, she starts to gain more confidence. She trains hard during their summer vacation (both mentally and physically). She does what she can to save herself while abducted. And she even goes so far as to latch onto Ken’s kuromukuro to go with him across the galaxy. While this last action fails, it proves that she has finally discovered what she wants to do: be by Ken’s side. (And, in a kind move, the epilogue depicts Yukina getting just that chance.)Looking at Ken and Yukina more closely, they aren’t the strongest of characters. Ken remains mostly the same for the entire twenty-six-episode run, and Yukina doesn’t play as big of a part in the second half as Muetta, the other side characters, and the action-filled plot in general take over.Nonetheless, they and the rest of the cast do manage to explore the same theme as its narrative: freedom.Freedom plays a big role in the arcs of Ken, Yukina, and Muetta. Ken has devout loyalty to the princess, so his freedom is somewhat limited. Yukina had the freedom to do whatever she wanted, but was unsure of what to choose. Muetta had no freedom whatsoever, making her a (unknown to her) slave to the group she followed.As the anime progresses, their freedom gets explored. Ken realizes that it’s not about doing it for the princess but whether he himself wants to. Yukina doesn’t seem to have the freedom to choose if she wants to take part in the fights or not, and, by the end of the series, she freely chooses to chase after Ken. Muetta gains her freedom, doesn’t see a spot for her on Earth, and goes instead to fight the Efidolgs with Ken of her own accord.A couple of the side characters explore freedom, too. Sophie’s freedom gets constricted by her parents and the facility as she fights to fight. And Ryouto, the teenage boy who is smitten with Yukina, doesn’t let his limitations keep him down, fighting to keep Yukina’s freedom intact as he does what he can to be a better person.While nothing extensive, this theme on freedom at least holds ties to the story at large. Plus, it helps to make up for a lot of shortcomings in Ken and Yukina’s characters as well as the other cast members doing little else besides getting in the way.SOUNDAlthough the anime does not provide any notable voice-acting performances, it does include a few interesting musical selections.For instance, the first opening track, near its beginning, sees the guitar striking clear notes and fast playing as the vocalist sings quietly in the background and loudly at the forefront. Unfortunately, the second half becomes a bit too docile due to the inclusion of a piano, hurting the more battle-hardened tone that the first half setup.In comparison, the second opening track may sound quite similar to the first, but it changes its tune enough to be distinguishable. Especially in the middle of the piece where the short guitar riff combines with the background choir to introduce a sense of foreboding that fits the second half of the season nicely enough. Afterwards, the “battling” vocalists and the final pairing of guitar and singing end the piece strongly, giving it the distinction as the better of the two OPs offered.On the opposite side of the episodes, the first ending track does not root itself in guitar but rather techno effects and beats to match the futuristic motif of Kuromukuro itself. Orchestral instruments, like piano and violin, also help to give it a softer feel.The second ending track starts off soft and slow but quickly gets into its pop-rock structure. Yet the piece is so bland that it is hard to even remember what it sounded like let alone which anime it came from. In short, it’s easily the worst among the other openers and closers.As for the original soundtrack, it switches it up where it can. A samurai-inspired tune is used when Ken shows off his new “underwear.” A mystery-laced piece with plucked strings plus otherworldly sounds follows Yukina as she leads Ken to a “castle.” And a brooding, ambient track accompanies those tense moments like when the UN members interrogate the “captured” Fusunani.Yet it’s the battle music that stands out. Trumpets, male choirs, and flourishes make the fights more engaging, adding emotional weight through its more involved composition.ENJOYMENTThis anime didn’t do it for me.The romance is the only aspect that I found consistently fun. For, while it may have been sloppily put together, Ken and Yukina’s bickering and their shyness was still entertaining due to how much I adore anything romantic.The occasional cute reactions from Yukina, Marina’s heartfelt attempts at helping her students, and Ken trying to cope with technology each had me smiling. But these scenes weren’t exactly major or even that memorable.However, I must give credit where credit is due. Ken provides one of the best replies possible to a mean dude on the Yahoo-answers-esque forum: “Tomiko, commit seppuku and die.” I laughed quite loudly at Ken’s nonchalant response and how fitting it was given his samurai self.If I had to choose a favorite character, I would pick Kojo. He had almost zero scenes, but that white-furred ferret can ride a Roomba like no other.Otherwise, I was never at all invested. The fights were okay yet never enthralling (but they at least weren’t just shootouts). The drama and the crying and the tension didn’t get me worked up. And, when all was said and done, I didn’t feel as though I got anything out of it. A boring outing for most of its run.Kuromukuro survives the invasion but at too much of a cost. While the CG art stands tall, and the opening tracks provide a solid listen, the problematic story and the unimportant characters make this an anime worth forgetting about for more than just three days straight.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, a strangely isolated setting, an uninteresting central conflict, unexplained science, anticlimactic moments, weak romance, overt sexuality, and unnecessary drama bog down the familiarity contrast, the action, and the theme on freedomAnimation: Fine, while much of the artistry does not do anything fancy, the strong CG work arguably stands as a definitive highlightCharacters: Bad, too many pointless side characters impede Ken and Yukina’s individual development, but the continued theme on freedom keeps them from being a total lossSound: Fine, okay first OP, good second OP, okay first ED, bad second ED, okay OST, and average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, bickering, seppuku, and ferrets made for most of the entertainmentFinal Score: 3/10 finally remembered to get it, I had more messages in my inbox than I had ever seen.

In essence, Zell is just a giant plot convenience, often used to provide swathing segments of exposition to explain the secrets of the enemy and the past whenever and wherever the anime feels like it. The anime attempts to write off why he never approached anybody for the previous 450 years by saying people, on sight, were either afraid of him or wanted to kill him. But that’s quite the flimsy excuse – especially when total world destruction is on the line.Sophie is arguably the only side character that receives extra attention that ends up meaningful. In the first half of the season, Sophie is the ace pilot whose calm demeanor highlights her maturity. In the second half, though, the surrounding threats cause her (never-shown) parents to ask for her removal from the GAUS program, fearing for her safety. She feels conflicted over whether she should obey the orders of her parents and high command, but, eventually, she steels herself thanks to Ken’s words and reaffirming her samurai code.Even in this dissection, Ken and Yukina have been sidelined thanks to the side characters. Nevertheless, these two have their challenges that they must overcome as the main protagonists.Ken, once a samurai of a time long gone, arrives in the modern era through coincidental fashion. Upon his reawakening, he believes Yukina to be his long-lost princess and vows to eliminate any and all ogres before him. While he soon realizes that Yukina is not the woman he originally swore loyalty to, he upholds his second promise, destroying the “ogres” with strength and ease.Much of his character revolves around his endgame. That is, when he accomplishes his goal, what does he plan to do? Initially, he simply wanted to meet his princess in the afterlife. However, after Yukina’s refusal to play along with Ken’s suicidal wish, he shifts his mindset, promising now instead to fight and live rather than fight until nothing remained.All the while, he becomes accustomed to the oddities of this period, like new foods and cars (or “horses” to him). He appears to be acclimating, but he still ponders what occurred to make his current situation happen. Fusunani, the captured Efidolg that Ken cuts down, reminds him of someone from his past, but Muetta’s arrival shakes his core. Her stark resemblance to Princess Yuki messes with Ken, conflicting his sense of loyalty as he tries to protect both Yukina and Muetta.Thankfully, Ken never fully wavers. He saves Yukina from abduction, defeats the Efidolg menace on Earth, and chases after their main fleet to stop them once and for all.As for Yukina, she followed a somewhat similar path to Ken. In the beginning, she does not know what she wants to do later in life. She’s not the best at school, she doesn’t pursue any interesting hobbies (besides aqueducts), and those around her aren’t giving her the clearest of guidance.When Ken arrives and puts her on his kuromukuro, though, she finds herself contributing towards something she knows she definitely wants no part of. Riding his kuromukuro not only scares her but also forces her to see death and destruction on a level that she cannot handle.But what gets to her the most is how nobody, not even her mother (who slaps her), seems to understand where she is coming from. All she wants is less ordering and more gratefulness. Ken complies, asking rather than demanding for her help, so she musters her courage to fight alongside him.Thus, she starts to gain more confidence. She trains hard during their summer vacation (both mentally and physically). She does what she can to save herself while abducted. And she even goes so far as to latch onto Ken’s kuromukuro to go with him across the galaxy. While this last action fails, it proves that she has finally discovered what she wants to do: be by Ken’s side. (And, in a kind move, the epilogue depicts Yukina getting just that chance.)Looking at Ken and Yukina more closely, they aren’t the strongest of characters. Ken remains mostly the same for the entire twenty-six-episode run, and Yukina doesn’t play as big of a part in the second half as Muetta, the other side characters, and the action-filled plot in general take over.Nonetheless, they and the rest of the cast do manage to explore the same theme as its narrative: freedom.Freedom plays a big role in the arcs of Ken, Yukina, and Muetta. Ken has devout loyalty to the princess, so his freedom is somewhat limited. Yukina had the freedom to do whatever she wanted, but was unsure of what to choose. Muetta had no freedom whatsoever, making her a (unknown to her) slave to the group she followed.As the anime progresses, their freedom gets explored. Ken realizes that it’s not about doing it for the princess but whether he himself wants to. Yukina doesn’t seem to have the freedom to choose if she wants to take part in the fights or not, and, by the end of the series, she freely chooses to chase after Ken. Muetta gains her freedom, doesn’t see a spot for her on Earth, and goes instead to fight the Efidolgs with Ken of her own accord.A couple of the side characters explore freedom, too. Sophie’s freedom gets constricted by her parents and the facility as she fights to fight. And Ryouto, the teenage boy who is smitten with Yukina, doesn’t let his limitations keep him down, fighting to keep Yukina’s freedom intact as he does what he can to be a better person.While nothing extensive, this theme on freedom at least holds ties to the story at large. Plus, it helps to make up for a lot of shortcomings in Ken and Yukina’s characters as well as the other cast members doing little else besides getting in the way.SOUNDAlthough the anime does not provide any notable voice-acting performances, it does include a few interesting musical selections.For instance, the first opening track, near its beginning, sees the guitar striking clear notes and fast playing as the vocalist sings quietly in the background and loudly at the forefront. Unfortunately, the second half becomes a bit too docile due to the inclusion of a piano, hurting the more battle-hardened tone that the first half setup.In comparison, the second opening track may sound quite similar to the first, but it changes its tune enough to be distinguishable. Especially in the middle of the piece where the short guitar riff combines with the background choir to introduce a sense of foreboding that fits the second half of the season nicely enough. Afterwards, the “battling” vocalists and the final pairing of guitar and singing end the piece strongly, giving it the distinction as the better of the two OPs offered.On the opposite side of the episodes, the first ending track does not root itself in guitar but rather techno effects and beats to match the futuristic motif of Kuromukuro itself. Orchestral instruments, like piano and violin, also help to give it a softer feel.The second ending track starts off soft and slow but quickly gets into its pop-rock structure. Yet the piece is so bland that it is hard to even remember what it sounded like let alone which anime it came from. In short, it’s easily the worst among the other openers and closers.As for the original soundtrack, it switches it up where it can. A samurai-inspired tune is used when Ken shows off his new “underwear.” A mystery-laced piece with plucked strings plus otherworldly sounds follows Yukina as she leads Ken to a “castle.” And a brooding, ambient track accompanies those tense moments like when the UN members interrogate the “captured” Fusunani.Yet it’s the battle music that stands out. Trumpets, male choirs, and flourishes make the fights more engaging, adding emotional weight through its more involved composition.ENJOYMENTThis anime didn’t do it for me.The romance is the only aspect that I found consistently fun. For, while it may have been sloppily put together, Ken and Yukina’s bickering and their shyness was still entertaining due to how much I adore anything romantic.The occasional cute reactions from Yukina, Marina’s heartfelt attempts at helping her students, and Ken trying to cope with technology each had me smiling. But these scenes weren’t exactly major or even that memorable.However, I must give credit where credit is due. Ken provides one of the best replies possible to a mean dude on the Yahoo-answers-esque forum: “Tomiko, commit seppuku and die.” I laughed quite loudly at Ken’s nonchalant response and how fitting it was given his samurai self.If I had to choose a favorite character, I would pick Kojo. He had almost zero scenes, but that white-furred ferret can ride a Roomba like no other.Otherwise, I was never at all invested. The fights were okay yet never enthralling (but they at least weren’t just shootouts). The drama and the crying and the tension didn’t get me worked up. And, when all was said and done, I didn’t feel as though I got anything out of it. A boring outing for most of its run.Kuromukuro survives the invasion but at too much of a cost. While the CG art stands tall, and the opening tracks provide a solid listen, the problematic story and the unimportant characters make this an anime worth forgetting about for more than just three days straight.SUMMARYStory: Terrible, a strangely isolated setting, an uninteresting central conflict, unexplained science, anticlimactic moments, weak romance, overt sexuality, and unnecessary drama bog down the familiarity contrast, the action, and the theme on freedomAnimation: Fine, while much of the artistry does not do anything fancy, the strong CG work arguably stands as a definitive highlightCharacters: Bad, too many pointless side characters impede Ken and Yukina’s individual development, but the continued theme on freedom keeps them from being a total lossSound: Fine, okay first OP, good second OP, okay first ED, bad second ED, okay OST, and average VA performancesEnjoyment: Bad, bickering, seppuku, and ferrets made for most of the entertainmentFinal Score: 3/10', 'the main characters i think started out a bit cliche-y and they still felt a bit cliche-y by the end. just their relationship had improved from arguing a lot to implied romantic interests. everyone else though…not so much. the characters are a bit boring and the ones that seem interesting don’t get as much development as i thought they would get. still better than nothing.this series was interesting enough to make me keep questioning things but still able to predict how things would go.overall, it is a bit predictable and trope-y and normally i would give this kind of average anime a 7 rating,...but the animation was incredibly beautiful and constant. there was cgi use but it was only for the robot fights, which i think helps. and it’s only the robots so it’s not too jarring like say, berserk, which was all cgi.so i would recommend this if you like 1) action animes with mechas, 2) have a netflix account and want to see non-cgi netflix original anime (looking at you aijin and sidonia), and 3) if you have time to kill. don’t watch it and expect a masterpiece or a complete ending, as it’s a cliffhanger. despite its average-ness, i’m still interested enough to ask when the next season comes out. but the animation was incredibly beautiful and constant. there was cgi use but it was only for the robot fights, which i think helps. and it’s only the robots so it’s not too jarring like say, berserk, which was all cgi.so i would recommend this if you like 1) action animes with mechas, 2) have a netflix account and want to see non-cgi netflix original anime (looking at you aijin and sidonia), and 3) if you have time to kill. don’t watch it and expect a masterpiece or a complete ending, as it’s a cliffhanger. despite its average-ness, i’m still interested enough to ask when the next season comes out.', 'I gotta say, Kuromukuro surprised me a little bit, especially in the last episodes. I really enjoyed the conclusion they gave to the story, which, normally, it\'s one of the most difficult things to make.So, in general, I think it\'s an OK anime. There are several things that make me have the feeling of watching an ""imitation"" of Neon Genesis Evangelion. I\'m not a big fan NGE fan, but one of the things I really like about it, is the psychological genre. And that\'s exactly one of the NGE characteristics that aren\'t present on Kuromukuro. The comedy side also felt forced and unnecessary in many...episodes.The story is just more of the same. Not bad, alright, but also it ain\'t innovative. Aliens coming out of nowhere fighting humans controlling giant robots, basically, that\'s it, in the first episodes, at least. Later it\'s added to the story the existence of a nation that\'s trying to control the universe, also a concept that ain\'t new in the pop culture. Maybe the most innovative and bizarre element is the fact that one of the main characters is a samurai that had been ""sleeping"" for a long time.Also, there wasn\'t a character that I really enjoyed to see. And I couldn\'t stop thinking about some similarities, again, with NGE, like the main character being daughter of the director and the initial refuse to pilot the robot. There\'s also the fanatic one about technologies and robots that doesn\'t care about putting his life in danger, whether he can see or record the battles.The technical aspects, like the soundtrack and the art aren\'t great, but also don\'t disappoint.

In the first episodes it seems like it will be a cliché storm, but by the halfway mark it really comes into its own. This is a giant robot show for our times.There is a lot to like in this show, starting with production values. There’s a lot of great design here, from the mechas, which come in all shapes and sizes; to the characters, who do too....There’s a lot of CG, but it’s pretty well integrated with the regular animation, and there are both exciting robot-to-robot throwdowns as well as a couple of swordfights.The story was complex, with a lot of moving parts and evolving revelations, some of which are never definitively concluded. This seems to be a theme in this series: You can’t know everything for sure; you can only take the information you have and act in good faith. Pacing is sometimes a little off, but never totally debilitates the show. Salient variables in the plot include ancient legends, a disappeared dad, Kennosuke’s loyalty to a 450-years-dead princess, aliens, and loss of innocence. And despite the more fantastical elements, when it comes down to it our protagonists are just two young people trying to figure out how to survive in a turbulent world where pretty much anything can be lost.Characterization is where Kuromukuro most reminds me of Escaflowne. We have the brash warrior boy and the timid schoolgirl as our main protagonists. But this familiar dynamic is cleverly tweaked. Kennosuke is a young samurai who falls out of suspended animation completely naked (which is the opposite of what generally happens in anime: usually it’s the girl who comes in with no clothes on) right in front of Yukina, a hapless everygirl whose mother happens to be director of the paramilitary Kurobe Lab and whose father disappeared in a plot-related event eight years prior. Kennosuke is a great fighter and a seasoned soldier, but Yukina is the one who understands how the modern world works as well as being more emotionally mature. So while he definitely gets more action sequences than she does, she is openly confrontational with him in a way that serves to dovetail their character development. They have actual conversations instead of pretty-sounding exchanges. It is clear that they have a sense of companionship before they ever have a sense of romance, which really works to the series’ benefit. (And she does toughen up, in a realistic but gratifying way.)The supporting cast is well-realized: some are more flat as characters than others, but their thoughts and actions work to theme and in some cases become compelling in their own right. There is definitely a flavor of NGE in regards to Yukina and Kennosuke’s classmates, but it’s not a bad thing. They do here what I wish Saji Crossroad had been used for in Gundam 00: their simpler concerns act as a foil and a sounding board to the protagonists’ more violent conflict. It’s a great emotional storytelling device. (Also, I really really liked the bombastic and foul-mouthed asshole American Marine who, in combat, repeatedly threatens to “shove this .50 mm right up your ass!”)There is some fanservice, notably when one female character gives another a massage. But there’s no male gaze and the female mecha pilots’ uniforms are respectably formfitting instead of painted on. I should note, for the ladies, that Kennosuke's physique is glorious throughout.In conclusion, I say if you like some realistic character drama with your mecha, then this is the show for you. If Escaflowne flicked your Bic, odds are good that Kuromukuro will too. Both leads are complex and relatable, and the story has a lot of twists and turns. At the very least it’s worth the three-episode test.P.S. PA Works had Man at Arms forge Kennosuke’s katana here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q598DP27tGA. It’s worth a watch even if you don’t pick up the show, because they use traditional Japanese swordsmithing methods to make a truly beautiful blade.

Not that great though, but if you have nothing to do and you already watched all good titles in your season - it is worth trying. It's not mecha heavy and it's not totally predictable even if you are an anime veteran, so why not?Characters are not that bad and pretty likable. There are a couple of twists that were interesting and it was pretty nice mix of genre.Main character are also not bad, but you doubly will remember them latter.

Idc if it got melee fighting or stuff like that, it got 0 original character development, some of the scenes are as unimportant to the main plot as scenes in later Gundam, the dialogue is nothing. This is what i call a A4 or a netflix anime, a anime created purely for the sake of cashing in, following the most basic of storyline formulas and executing it poorly. The focus is all wrong, looks like the creators took more time creating good nature scenery instead...of creating a good story with interesting characters. :) of creating a good story with interesting characters. :)', 'I\'ll be honest up front and say this is probably the best mecha show I\'ve seen in a few years (having watched this in 2021). I\'ve had quite the spell of bad luck with show endings recently, with most of the last seven or eight non-seasonal shows I\'ve made my way through having had endings that just haven\'t quite worked for me. And, to give this show credit, it did play a bit with my heart with that; the two episodes preceding the finale were both a bit clumsy and messy, and even with the last episode there was some weird pacing. But I\'m getting...ahead of myself.""Kuromukuro"" is a mecha show with a distinctive samurai-inspired flavour, with the story in the present day stemming from flashbacks to a medieval backstory that could probably have been its own show. It\'s probably one of the most unique vibes for a mecha show I\'ve seen, with how the worlds of edo period Japan and the modern day (albeit with a very sci-fi feel to it) merge into themselves. This is seen perfectly in the titular mecha, which uses hi-tech katana to fight; it gives the fights a really cool feel, and isn\'t like anything else I can recall.Generally speaking, those fights are well executed. CG mecha rarely come across as quite as impressive as their 2D counterparts, but, while the fights still sometimes lack a sense of physical weight (a common problem with CG mecha in my experience), the choreography is nonetheless imaginative, with a lot of really creative mechanical designs, especially in the enemy mechs. All the mecha in the show feel distinct and yet comfortably like they\'re from the same world, which serves the show well.But, despite being a mecha show, this is very much not all about the robots. The real pivot point of the series comes in the romance between the two protagonists, schoolgirl Yukina and medieval-samurai-out-of-water Kennosuke, and honestly, their relationship really grounds this show perfectly. From their very rocky start, to seeing them grow closer together, to their eventual dedication to each other, the growth towards this relationship feels natural, and was probably one of the most enjoyable romantic storylines I\'ve seen in anime for a while. And they\'re nicely held up by a mostly solid supporting cast, who generally get enough development and focus not to feel like they\'re taking up space needlessly, but who don\'t generally distract from the characters that matter.And it\'s their romance, and the way it blends with the story\'s resolution, that ultimately secured it\'s score for me (the highest score I\'ll give a show that I don\'t consider a favourite (a 9/10) or a masterpiece (the full 10/10), so high praise indeed). See, I generally don\'t love open-ended or slightly unresolved conclusions to stories. Many of the endings I\'ve found disappointing recently, I\'ve found disappointing precisely because I haven\'t felt like there was adequate resolution. Here, however, I was presented with a somewhat open ending, that certainly leaves things in an open way, and which definitely doesn\'t spell out its resolution for us, but, where many such endings left me with a slightly hollow feeling, this ending felt perfectly suited for this show. Because, honestly, I don\'t think it was that open at all. The strength in it is, when the final scenes play out, it feels like what happens next is almost obvious. And that\'s because of the strength of that romantic storyline; at the end of the day, whatever forces conspire to keep them apart, they really feel fated to be togther.""Kuromukuro"" was a surprising show, that kept my attention for the whole time, and which gave me an ending that felt genuinely satisfying, in a way I wasn\'t quite expecting.

Which was incredibly refreshing.The characters are for the most part very enjoyable.

They all act in the way that their simply-constructed characters would act in each given scenario!The plot develops at an extremely nice pace with...'the reveals' coming it at very well timed points and extra characters being introduced precisely when needed for the plot to continue developing.Essentially Kuromukuro's strongest point is how meticulously the plot itself is constructed. It's not the most original by any means, and it isn't a perfect plot. There are a few (incredibly minor) logic-leaps about the aliens/demons that you could point out as 'logical flaws'... but even the minor ones mostly get at least some form of brief explanation!!!This anime was just a good story with fun characters told in both an interesting and entertaining way...

One thing that bothered me was the protagonist, like, he came from the past and did not understand any of our technologies but only with the passing of a few episodes and he\'s already messing with everything, he must have the highest IQ of all the umanity bordering on be a newton 10x more awesome. Another thing that bothered me was the French pilot, like, children in megazords is well cluck but in this anime that is more ""real"" was well forced.Story: Our face I liked very much, the idea of \u200b\u200bworking in the context of a folkloric interpretation is very good, to interpret demons (for those who do not know oni is demonio another interpretation is ogre (as ta na netflix) but in a broader sense of the word would be what we understand as a demon) as extraterrests is very good, another thing is that they speak Japanese, it makes sense because they have been in Japan for 500 years so they already had contact with the language but not with the variations of it, as demonstrated at various times that they do not understand foreignisms.

Im not a big fan of mecha but i watch this bcs pa works made it. I dropped this anime last year but i tried to watch it again this year.The story and the plot is good enough it tell us about this samurai guy from the past who is in the sleep for many years and wake up in our modern era, thats already enough to hook me...up from episode 1.But, the problem is this kennousuke guy from the past, he is a samurai who came from different era from them and at the beginning i really liked that this kennousuke guy have a strong personality, a man with high honor and pride. He have some temper, disciplined, uncontrolled, and rebel personality. He is a warrior from the past that had fought so many battles, saw his comrades fall and he feel so angry when he know that his princess died in battle long ago.Well i got no problem with comedy in this anime and i liked comedy but this strong image kenousuke shortly turn into a weak kennousuke in just 3-4 episodes in the beginning its like he is talking like a softie and he become one of the weakest member and treated with little respect in his squad despite his amazing ability, many experience with his legendary mecha and he is the only one who have the most of the information of their current enemy and he is the one who can defeat all of them in the beginning. He cant even win a debate with a little french btch and he cant maintain his pride as a great warrior in front of a little kid and his squad. This creator of kuromokuro needs to learn a thing or two about military.Im really disappointed with this, it can be better but it turns out to be bad.I guess i have too much of expectations from P.A works this time.

Watching this at the beginning I was afraid this is gonna be like all those other crappy animes I was watching when I started this show. I even went along patiently giving the show chances saying if the next episode I waited a week for suck your done for. Well look here I finished the whole first season and was itching to watch the next as I remembered the show...today. Let me tell you why I thought this wasn\'t a trash anime.Ussually people split up in to categories but here it isStory: 8Art & Character:9Sound:10 most animes pass this in flying colorsEnjoyment: 10Overall: Wait till the endThis show is not the best mech anime I have seen and I will say ""All Hail Britannia"" and you can get what I\'m saying.  The story is cliche with ancient warrior protecting his duty from the time of the samurai. Though I am split on 9 or 8 on the story I still believed it was made well. The Art was good though I do not like CGI style that is prevalent in these type of animes with robots or big monsters. I would prefer a Gundum style or Code Geass art,but this anime seems a little cheaper than those. The characters I kind of like and they are not annoying and not to bad as high schoolers expect I don\'t know how all the same classmates get chosen, but whatever its an anime.All that aside to get to the jist; this anime had me wanting to see the next episode even though my head was saying this show isn\'t amazing. I began to enjoy it and when the last episode of the first season was released I did not know I would have to wait. The show starts rough yet as the episodes develop it polishes itself gives both a lighthearted friendly anime while on the other side is a serious thing the characters must face. I believe this show was made well and deserves to be congratulated for its good work. This show is not amazing, this show doesn\'t suck, but this show is able to keep you hooked on. I could care less for all the other categories, but they all give this anime the final verdict of an......BIG FAT 8.(or 7.5-8ish)Please help me improve my reviews,Thank youSincerely Tatakin today.

I immediately loved this anime, the story is great and original.....binged watched it for a couple days in between my husbands shows. I loved the fight scenes, they were balanced and believable. The character development was great and I ended up liking characters I hated in the beginning. The show has a lot of fun moments as well and definitely will have you laughing the your a++ off.I really hope Netflix renews for...a third season, they left it on such a cliff hanger and I need to know what happens! >.> I really hope to see Ken and Yukina reunite! a third season, they left it on such a cliff hanger and I need to know what happens! >.> I really hope to see Ken and Yukina reunite!', ""Why would you send your mecha pilot woken up from a long ago past to high school?  Why wouldn't you teach the new co-pilot actual piloting skills?  Why didn't Yukino ever 'read the manual'?  Why mix inane slice of life with mecha.  It threw the pacing off horribly.I am totally okay with the mechs from outer space and time traveling samurai, but the fact that nobody actually questioned him about his past or the mecha or ANYTHING until the interrogators showed up just completely confused me.And Yukino is an embarrassment to all women everywhere.  She's very much a whiny YA...lead that takes forever to 'take up the call'.  I wanted to fast forward over everything she was involved in.I had tons of tech/military self-defense WTFs too.  Why didn't they even know the mother ship had arrived?  Why the slow reaction to 'oh something's come from outer space'?  It doesn't take 5 minutes for the emergency generators to kick in!  It doesn't!!!  And why would a UN scientific center have only one communications hub?  I mean.... Guh.Parts I did like were the mecha fights, Kennoske, the family.  And they kept me watching, but it annoyed me enough to write this review (which I get isn't up to MAL reviews, it's more like a Goodreads review) to vent my frustration.I wanted to like this more, but it just didn't get better. lead that takes forever to 'take up the call'.

A bit predictable, but it checks all the boxes you look for in a mecha drama.It has a pretty good story. The blending of slice of life elements and the ""warrior from another time"" aspect is quite refreshing, it\'s not something I\'ve seen done with mecha before and it works quite well.The mecha combat itself is well done, if you can get over the CGI mecha which is just something you pretty much have to do to enjoy anything in this genre anymore. You get all of the boxes for a good mecha show checked here. Cool models, a variety of suits that...offer different ranges of fighting styles, combining mecha, it\'s all here.The characters are where I feel this show lacks a bit, and where I feel this story borrows the most from other shows. The main character is basically a female Shinji except admittedly a lot more likeable than him, Senosuke is pretty much just his ""warrior out of time"" trope, which is a cool twist for this show but they don\'t develop him much more than just that. The other supporting characters also don\'t really stand out.All in all, this was a decent 2 night binge on Netflix. If they make a season 2 for it I probably won\'t watch it only because I feel the story wraps up very nicely where it does and doesn\'t need to go any further. offer different ranges of fighting styles, combining mecha, it\'s all here.The characters are where I feel this show lacks a bit, and where I feel this story borrows the most from other shows.

With such great animation and sound design you'd expect story and characters to be on par as well, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Characters are likable but divorced from reality and logic. Story backs them by throwing as many plot conveniences as possible. Things happen just at the right moment, at the right place, to right people so plot can move forward and some artificial drama can be introduced. Initially this is not as obvious but as time goes on it becomes impossible to ignore.That said there is an entertainment value to be had here...if you can ignore thick plot armor, story that has been told over and over again combined with characters who can do anything and get away with it. There's also some romance thrown in but it doesn't feel natural or justified.Overall, very mixed feelings. I know am dropping it in the middle, but you might like it. Give few episodes a shot and see. So sad for such great art to go to waste with stale plot and stiff fight scenes. if you can ignore thick plot armor, story that has been told over and over again combined with characters who can do anything and get away with it.

If you are, then this is not your type of anime as all anime is view differently among the community.', ""After seeing the super fast paced prequel or original/beginning of this anime,(no idea how to organize them on MAL since the production is all out of order); I was readily excited to view more of the same. Unfortunately I got something different.The plot seems to be in each episode standalone of whacky happenings that lead to no where and nothing. There is no set up, no movement, just random senseless activities. I tried my best to put pieces together, but nothing came up. It wasn't a rubix cube and none of the pieces fit. So what did I figure? Nothing. All this anime has...become is an excuse to make whacky experimental shorts. No substance at all. I was left drawing blanks left and right. So what do I give something that isn't there?Story ?/10 still waiting I supposeThe art style and color scheme is what drew me in with the previous production along with somewhat of a plot. But really, I loved the original and this as well for its art. It was zany and had vibrant sequences as well as cut edge angles and sequences. The colors were far out of the norm that you typically get with an standard anime presentation. I'm a fan of zany and art house animation so I kept on going for that sake.Art 7.5/10I've actually been reading the manga and it actually had some sensibility in it as far as the plot went. The characters actually had a purpose and the setting was somewhat interesting, but none of that transferred over into the anime. They do nothing here. So they feel as though they just are.Characters ?/10In the end the only reason I even stuck around with this was the hopes that the plot I had previously read in the manga would eventually develop. But sadly it never did. I rate this purely off of my enjoyment for zany art house animation and the silliness presented. I never felt like the producers made sense of the series and I've no idea what they were trying to present. If it is just the animation,(which I truly feel it is); then they have succeeded in that light. I'd recommend the manga as it has very sharp art style even better than the anime. I just hope more chapters are made because there is a plot for it.Overall 5/10 become is an excuse to make whacky experimental shorts. No substance at all. I was left drawing blanks left and right.

The ONAs definitely aren\'t very coherent, but having watched them a few times, I can say that the story means very little.  This kind of thing does apply to a lot of slice-of-life, where the episodes stand alone and the anime is more centered around other elements.Story:8You might be confused as to why I rate it so high.  For an anime that wasn\'t meant to have a real coherent story at first, they did a...good job at highlighting plot points.  My first impression when watching this anime was ""What am I watching and why is it so god damn awesome!?!?""  The episodes, which are paced very quickly much like FLCL and the likes, do give you a sense of whats actually happening.   Im trying not to spoil the plot points but by now most of you reading this have probably watched the TV series.  Sparing some details, Young Koto is looking for her mother (also by the title ""Koto""), who appears as a black rabbit hopping through gates to other worlds.  Koto follows the rabbit, and ends up in the 13th parallel, a world drawn by a monk, where crazy, crazy shit happens.Art: 9.5The art is easily one of the most captivating parts of the series.  Its colorful, with lots of fractals and great detail put into the animation sequences.  Again, like FLCL, it seems they did a lot of experimental angles in their shots, and they worked magnificently.  Imagine SHAFT without all the repetitive goddamn SHAFT-tilts.  Every scene is fresh.  The art also contributes to the sense of wonder that the anime conveys, enhancing its overall enjoyment.Sound: 10The soundtrack is taylored to capture any moment just right.  There are about 30 tracks in the OST, if that says anything about their reportoire of sound.  Bear in mind this is for a series of ONAs that only spans about an hour in its entirety.  Now honestly my favorite thing about the music is that it spans from acoustics and whistling to aggressive synths you would hear in hardcore EDM (electronic dance music, techno, whatever you wanna call it) and as a music producer, these make great samples.  The easy-going sounds like ""a whistle sounded"" have a very nostalgic feel and sometimes I find myself whistling the tune when im unhappy.Character: 10Without going into analysis of all the characters, because that might count as a spoiler, I have to say that each character was designed very well, and their personalities are fun and interesting.  As far as character design, Koto has many expressions about her and she wears them well..  The council of three are also well-designed.  Yase is probably the most elaborate.  Very much like a proper princess, and her outward appearance shows her as a child at heart.  However, Yase is half-demon and will wreck shit if she doesn\'t get her tea.  In a way she reminds me of a touhou character (not an actual one though).  Kurama is very zen-like.  He never gets angry and just lets life roll by him.  Myoue is more human than monk, immersing himself in the pleasures of love, and all that.  It might be confusing that he looks like the ""original"" Myoue, though.  And lets not forget Mother Koto.  She is insanely beautiful and emanates motherly love.  Talking about Inari might spoil some of the plot, but I will say that my opinion of him changed, at least when the TV series aired because there was more continuation to the story which developed him into something else.  But as far as the ONA goes, hes a loving father whose sole job is to raise Koto.  A and Un, Koto\'s little lackeys, are like comedic relief.  Last but not least is Shouko, an absurd gamer girl who has tonnes of gadgets and gizmos that control Mirror Kyoto.  When I say ""gamer girl"" I dont mean the stereotypical girl who does things for attention, not that the stereotypes true.  She is insanely dedicated to her job.Enjoyment: 10Kyousougiga 2012 was the first run of Kyousougiga that I\'ve watched.  That being said, it holds a spot in my heart.  I was actually on a good dose of MDMA when i watched it the first time, but rewatching it still gives me that feeling of unconditional happiness.  So if you don\'t do drugs then I guess Kyousougiga is one of the next best things. good job at highlighting plot points.

Mahoromatic: Motto Utsukushii Mono,https://myanimelist.net/anime/277/Mahoromatic__Motto_Utsukushii_Mono,"['Mahoromatic seasons 1&amp;2 where a buetiful blend with some classy acting from genoen. With some kick arse action scenes and smut humor :o, i enjoyed every moment of it, and i really felt for the charecters.So much so that this series has made me cry the hardiest then any other animeRemember kids, 15+ please ;P ', 'I think Japanese television is superior to American television. I do. I think that Japanese anime is truly great and because they limit most of their shows to one or two seasons, they allow for great stories with conclusions and romance and moral lessons that you could never get in America, where all that matters is extending the life of every show until people stop watching it.However, there is also something negative that, unfortunately, inherently comes with anime as well: incredibly bad endings. It&rsquo;s almost unfathomable how every now and then, you can watch a perfectly normal show and then be greeted with an ending...so egregiously bad, that you are actually laughing out loud. To date, I&rsquo;ve never watched an American show and laughed at a really bad ending, but I&rsquo;ve watched at least three of four anime series where this has happened. (Certain examples are Blue Drop and Magikano) It&rsquo;s truly disappointing, however, when you come across a good show where this happened, because you&rsquo;re enjoying yourself and you get hit with an anvil.Well, sadly enough, Mahoromatic Season 2, without a doubt, comes packed with the worst ending I have ever, ever seen. I had tears in my eyes as I laughed at its ridiculous last episode, and then when that died down, my mouth was merely agape. Now, I could go on and on about how miserably bad it was, but I&rsquo;m not going to bother, because it&rsquo;s that disconnected. If I had seen only the first 11 of the 13 episodes, I could write a completely different review with a lot of positives, so I&rsquo;ve decided that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do now.The story is essentially about a parentless boy Suguru, who is rich enough to hire a maid. His maid, Mahoro, is a hot, retired, android warrior who used to work for an organization designed to keep the peace between alien forces that are waging war in Earth&rsquo;s skies without humans knowing about it. There are two catches: 1. She&rsquo;s going to run out of life force in less than two years and 2.) she was forced to kill his father, who was a commander of Vesper, her old organization. For the first 11 episodes, Mahoromatic&rsquo;s second season gives a lot more of what it gave us the first season: some good laughs, sweet moments, well-done battle scenes, and a lot more fan service. Plus, there was romance, which was great, since it wasn&rsquo;t really assured if the show was going to turn that corner with the two main characters. And for the first ten episodes or so, its mainly fluffy slice of life &ndash; there isn&rsquo;t any real drama as one would think upon reading the synopsis of the story. In that way, the story is actually charming and the unique characters only make the show more appealing.There&rsquo;s a lot to take from this show and I would recommend it to anyone as long as they are fully aware that the ending to this anime is essentially the worst on&hellip;. like&hellip; earth. That&rsquo;s all. I can&rsquo;t say much more than that. so egregiously bad, that you are actually laughing out loud.

I can&rsquo;t say much more than that.', ""When I first started watching Mahoromatic I mistakenly considered it a light and fluffy piece of anime with just enough eechi in it to keep interest up. And in the beginning it was light and fluffy. But I fell into a trap; many great anime series started out light and slowly evolved into something completely different; Neon Genesis Evangelon and Trigun for examples.I thought at first it was a bit sad to remind the viewers at the end of every episode how many days Mahoro has left to live, and unlike western programs I know the Japanese aren't going to find a magic way...to save her but in the end it worked for the best.The story I rated 9 - it was very entertaining, with a lot of humor and sweetness to make you fall in love with Mahoro, but as the story develops it becomes richer with more depth as the back stories come to light. I only wish there were more information on the three struggling powers: Saint, Vesper, and Management. I also wish there were more information on Siguru's ancestry. My advice is to kick back and just enjoy the first season, but as the 2nd season progresses pay more and more attention to what's going on outside of the house.I also rated the art a 9. I don't rate anime on how well the drawings project the human body, but how well the drawings project the idea of the story.  When Mahoro goes into battle mode the art is incredible - the orange/red/black coloring of the artwork is incredible in its ability to project power. Then again the art also projects the tranquility of a Japanese spring morning, or the loneliness of a man without a home or a friend.The sound was ok, but what can I say, I'm a sucker for cute feminine voices and up tempo closing theme songs. A mambo! Who woulda thunk up that besides the Japanese.The characters were all well defined and stayed true to themselves through out the entire series. Minewa was the epitome of cute while Mahoro was the embodiment of sweet - even in battle mode. While a couple were a bit annoying their quirks made the more reasonable characters that much more reasonable.Enjoyment for me was a solid 10. While not Gone With The Wind or War and Peace material, it was a good solid view that left a lasting impression. Along with telling a wonderful story it also shows interesting things that the Japanese take for granted, things we westerners aren't familiar with; The Japanese version of Christmas is more like our version of Valentines, their version of Valentines is backwards compared to ours (the women there give candy) and White Day, where the man repays for the gifts received on Valentines doesn't exist here. The episode that showed the 'typical' New Years celebration was also fantastic. Many fansub groups do a good job explaining these differences but unfortunately the companies that release the DVD's to the US market ignore our need to figure out what they are doing.I highly recommend this for anyone (over the age of 16) to add to their library. to save her but in the end it worked for the best.The story I rated 9 - it was very entertaining, with a lot of humor and sweetness to make you fall in love with Mahoro, but as the story develops it becomes richer with more depth as the back stories come to light.

So let\'s get down to business:Story: fair 6Even if the plots only focuses on comedy, ecchi, sci-fi and drama the 3 genre\'s is enough to carry this anime through. Its other genre like harem, isn\'t much because even though this anime has a harem genre, it is not a true harem since the muchacho (male lead) only has feelings for the chiquita (female lead), the psychological genre part however is merely trivial to the overall anime.Art: poor...3What can I say, I really don\'t like the water color based paints that composes the art form of this anime.Sound: poor 3I just hate the opening and ending theme of this anime.Character: fair 6Well, I’d say that there are some characters here that really fit the part, but there are some who should have had some bigger part and not just regulated into bit roles, but then their roles have gone way beyond as to what their description said like:Mahoro Andou- ok, so she’s an android, but the way she was portray doesn’t make her one, instead she kinda looks like “Super girl” in a maid costume. Ok, so let’s put it this way, the author “Bunjuro Nakayama” thought he did made a good character out of her, but, he can’t seem to differentiae between a “Cyborg” and an “Android,” though both can be referred to as moving biped machines with humanlike features they are totally different, a cyborg is a “Cybernetic Organism” simply, it is part human or someone who was once human and integrated into a machine. Now, a cyborg would require 2 means of obtaining energy, first it’ll require human food to maintain it’s human part’s nutrition and 2nd it require a direct source of energy from a electronic charging apparatus for it’s mechanical fuction, also a cyborg has gender distinction, while an android doesn’t, in fact an “android” is 100% machine, it is neither a he or a she, unlike an android it only requires one source for power and it is usually direct from a charging apparatus. When it comes to there “Artificial Intelligence” and “Emotional Intelligences” androids are incapable of such emotions and it’s intelligence rely on it’s stored data, while a cyborg……well, it depends as to what purpose they were created or modified for and frankly that’s a grey matter. If we’re to analyze Mahoro, I’d say that she’s neither android nor cyborg. Let’s not forget that her organization VESPER did mentioned that SAINT technology was use in creating her so this make her a “Synthetically Enhance Humanoid,” which means that she has humanlike features, but possesses superhuman abilities, she’s not only intelligent, but she capable of having human emotions. However the technology use to create her also has a downside which is a limited life span.Suguru Misato- I’m puzzled as to how in the final episode of this anime as was he still manages to survived a stab in the heart from a light saber, when he is a  human? And I do wonder as if was able to find out as to what really happen to his father, I kinda find it funny with the awkward situations were he has to find a way to hide his porn stash from Mahoro and the fan service thing that involves his math teacher Saori Shikijo. I also felt a kind of sympathy for him at the 13th episode when Mahoro has to break her promise to be with him forever in order to save him.Minawa Andou- Geez, I really to know what to say about this character, but she kinda useless, but I do adore her relationship with one of Misato’s friend Hamaguchi, but I hate that her role is that of a clumsy cyborg living and working as a maid for the Suguru household.Slash- I would never understand why the author of this anime/manga has to make him into a big black talking cat.Saori Shikijo- I would probably describe her as the main ecchi in this anime/manga, though I find it her irritating that she’s freeloading in Suguru’s house, I do find her hot and cute especially in her naked glory. Though she does have some fantasies involving Suguru, but it is clear that she only wants to pop  Suguru\'s cherries but doesn’t wanna have any relationship with him except to freeload on food and to use his bath.Miyuki Sakura – According to info, she’s Misato’s childhood friend, but, unlike any childhood friend, she doesn’t seem to compete for Misato’s affection, in fact none of the other girls were competing for the latter’s affectionor at least in the anime.Rin Todoriki – Info states that she’s into martial arts, but in this anime I’ve never saw her get some actions except get into some awkward fanservice, and just like Miyuki, she doesn’t seem to have any romantic interest with Suguru.Chizuko Oe – Another one of Suguru’s friends and a certify foodie, but I really wonder as to why the author of this anime didn’t made a funny concept to make her look fat.Toshiya Hamaguchi and Kiyomi Kawahara – 2 of Suguru friend with a penchant for porn. In my opinion they’ll be funnier if there were scene where they peek at a girl’s locker.And the rest like Toh Ryuga and Feldrance they’re the antagonist and in this anime and  somebody has to be one, except for Toh, who did portrayed as an enemy at first and an ally next,Enjoyment: fair 6This anime isn\'t much, but to be honest it is the fanservice that attracted me into it at the first place, however I felt touch on the last 3 episode of this season 2 when the chiquita has to leave the mucahcho in order to save him at the cost of her remaining lives and I do mean ""Lives"" since she still has 200 something days  before she shuts down.Overall: fair 6Overall, even though this whole series of animes from season 1 to season 2 up the OVAs and specials, this anime is something to be given a benefit of a doubt, sure, there were some short comings but the bond that exist between the chiquita (female lead) and the muchacho (male lead) makes up for it couple with some funny fanservice. However, the problem with this overall anime is that it has a lot of special episodes and OVAs that could have be more appropriate if the author could just integrate in a regular episode like the 2 episode OVA “Mahoromatic: Tadaima  Okari” were it should have been integrated in this second season instead of being a separate series. 3What can I say, I really don\'t like the water color based paints that composes the art form of this anime.Sound: poor 3I just hate the opening and ending theme of this anime.Character: fair 6Well, I’d say that there are some characters here that really fit the part, but there are some who should have had some bigger part and not just regulated into bit roles, but then their roles have gone way beyond as to what their description said like:Mahoro Andou- ok, so she’s an android, but the way she was portray doesn’t make her one, instead she kinda looks like “Super girl” in a maid costume.

In my opinion they’ll be funnier if there were scene where they peek at a girl’s locker.And the rest like Toh Ryuga and Feldrance they’re the antagonist and in this anime and  somebody has to be one, except for Toh, who did portrayed as an enemy at first and an ally next,Enjoyment: fair 6This anime isn\'t much, but to be honest it is the fanservice that attracted me into it at the first place, however I felt touch on the last 3 episode of this season 2 when the chiquita has to leave the mucahcho in order to save him at the cost of her remaining lives and I do mean ""Lives"" since she still has 200 something days  before she shuts down.Overall: fair 6Overall, even though this whole series of animes from season 1 to season 2 up the OVAs and specials, this anime is something to be given a benefit of a doubt, sure, there were some short comings but the bond that exist between the chiquita (female lead) and the muchacho (male lead) makes up for it couple with some funny fanservice. However, the problem with this overall anime is that it has a lot of special episodes and OVAs that could have be more appropriate if the author could just integrate in a regular episode like the 2 episode OVA “Mahoromatic: Tadaima  Okari” were it should have been integrated in this second season instead of being a separate series.', 'Mahoromatic S2 is not really like S1. It has much focus on romance, slice of life and school life. But its ending is truly both breathtaking and confusing. And worse than S1. Be careful for an anti-climatic dramatic ending.I watched all in eng subs except for ep 10 and 14, which I watched in eng dub.Story:7We start off with a crisis, where a secret organization threatens SAINT and Vesper. Along the intro of the crisis, Minawa arrives, and then slice of life and romance galore. After quite some episodes and some small problems here and there, we have a major crisis with the secret organization.Well...I think that the slice of life segments were handled well, and everything after that sucks. Too many things unexplained, crises resolved too easily, too many tragical incidents after quite a number of ""sunny episodes"".The ending episodes was absolutely horrible. Closure was filled with twists, and the very last part of the closure was hard to interpret. But there is a forum post in ep 14 discussion that explains the last part quite well.Art:6Seems worse than last season, the colors seem to be watercolor, and at times the animation wasn\'t that fluid.Sound:7OP was quite good. ED song\'s tune and animation was ok, but lyrics was about boobs. Which was... lol.Character:5Bad. Very bad. Minawa\'s character development was mianly in her past only, and her presence was barely grown until only near the end of the series. The other characters do not have much character development.I realised too that by the end of S1 and S2 only Mahoro seems to be the defining character in this anime series.Character interaction was good though... relationships were handled and grown very well until the ending parts (where the secret organization struck till end of ep14)Character stability and closure was VERY VERY WEAK in the last 1 or 2 eps. Just watch and you should see why.Enjoyment:6I enjoyed the front part of S2, but started to have a headache and shake my head from the ep where Mahoro woke up in a strange way. From that ep on everything was kinda weird, too much unexplained stuff... and problems were resolved TOOOOO easily that they seem to be jokes.Somehow I am starting to wonder if GAINAX is bad at producing endings. For S1 and S2.Overall:7Good slice of life and romance in earlier eps, unique eps in ending parts. Could have been presented much better.Heart-warming but not really tear-jerking.

Practically the entire anime, both season 1 and 2 can be seen again. All the characters are drawn with a nice older touch, that is very rare in newly released anime. The Female main character is so cheerful that you can't help, letting off a little smile yourself.I watched the series all over again when i was done, because the characters warmed my heart.As for the story, i think it was...fine for the genre, but should the creaters of this anime read this review then i pledge them to make another ending, since what was a cheerful anime to me suddenly became very sad.So please do yourself a favor. Throw away the whole fast forward thing in the end and make it a better and happy ending. Including all the side characters as well. If this is possible then you would make my world a lot brighter :) fine for the genre, but should the creaters of this anime read this review then i pledge them to make another ending, since what was a cheerful anime to me suddenly became very sad.So please do yourself a favor. Throw away the whole fast forward thing in the end and make it a better and happy ending. Including all the side characters as well. If this is possible then you would make my world a lot brighter :)"", '(This review covers both seasons of the same series).Well, I already told you info about Gainax via the previous two reviews of anime I did on them so what about this another anime studio that they collaborated with, Shaft.  Shaft is known for producing such anime as the critically and somewhat fan-acclaimed Puella Magi Madoka Magica (and I actually love that show, along with the English dub of the show) and…..Dance in the Vampire Bund (thankfully, somebody already covered that show in this group) and that have collaborated more in the distant future but for Mahoromatic, this is a very mixed concept of a...show that manages that can be both fascinating and very awkward.The story is about a combat android named Mahoro has driven into guilt by her actions in her combat days want to retire her days in peace as a live-in maid, serving the son of her late commanding officer, Suguru Misato, a phenomenally messy high school student who lives by himself after his family passed away. However, if she lays down her arms and conserves her remaining power, the time she has left can be prolonged to just over a year and as for their later episodes, as the relationship between Mahoro, Suguru and his classmates develops further, another android girl enters their lives and becomes attached to Mahoro. All the while, the number of days before Mahoro is to shut down decreases steadily.Now, I really have low expectations when I came upon watching this so here are the things that I think are positive for the show: I actually like Mahoro as a character in the show because her character and backstory kept me intrigued and although I really don’t feel relatable to her because I really don’t know anyone as a combat maid or even a regular maid (I think, memory of mine is a bit fuzzy). Plus, you’ll start to actually care for her since you’ll know she isn’t long for this world since every episode ends with how many days before she stops functioning, even if the episode is more comedic than their serious ones.As for Suguru and his friends, well, they are the neutral part of the series for me. Suguru isn’t a bad character but he isn’t much of one in the series. He can be a bit of a weenie in the first few episodes but can stand up for himself a few times but I wouldn’t count on expecting it every time. Also, Suguru has some female friends Miyuki (the blue-haired tomboyish member of the Triomatic), Rin (the brown-haired and tallest member of the Triomatic) & Chizuko (the short blonde-haired girl who orgasms everytime she eats something) who I think want to get closer to him and be more than friends (‘lucky bastard’) although they really don’t carry the plot much. They are mostly the harem part of the show and yet most of the time he looks at dirty magazines with his friends Hamaguchi & Kawahara. Dude, you got not only one, two but FIVE girls admiring you from afar and yet you look at many images of naked woman and yet when you see them for real, you freak out which is normal when seeing one out of the blue but still….Suguru, you dull but lucky bastard. There is also Minawa, an android working for Management, the newer addition in the second season, who poses in school as Mahoro’s younger sister and she always manages to trip and fall down and always apologizes for doing that. I don’t want to say she’s slow, I don’t think she is but I can’t really defend her on that plus Hamaguchi does have a crush on her in a few episodes and that’s basically it on her.However, when the show stops funny, they bring out Saori Shikijo, the homeroom teacher of Suguru’s class and have a very deep attraction to him and always remind us every time about that. My God, she is the most annoying character in this show and all the times she appears out of nowhere, it is very cringeworthy on the screen and wish this character didn’t actually exists and I actually wanted Mahoro to really mess her up and the fact Shikijo always teases her about her breast size since by comparison, Shikijo wins in that area but she’s still a bitch.There is also Slash, the robot panther or “support mech” who works for Mahoro and Ryuga, who poses as a teacher to investigate Mahoro on what she’s doing at Earth. Alongside with Mahoro, these two is also my favorite characters on the show. I actually now want a robot panther as a pet now and having Steve Blum voicing Ryuga is icing on the cake, even if the cake is a bit tart.On the animation courtesy of Gainax and Shaft, the movements in the fight compliments much of the Gainax style even if it looks like it was made in the ‘90s (this show was made in 2001-2003) and has the depict of weirdness and surrealism (maybe) that most people expect from Studio Shaft. Did I forget to mention BOOBIES GALORE!?!?!??!!? Yes, every female on the show does appear either it’s a panty shot, in their underwear, and baring it all or it does get a bit tiring at some parts and kind of creepy, too. Look, some nudity is nice and all but I don’t always want to be expecting it at every nook and cranny. I don’t have much to say about the music except some of it does fit the tone of the series and yet I always skip the opening and ending songs as I really don’t care for them after the episode ends but the satellite poems after the songs are nice, too.FINAL VERDICT: Mahoromatic can be a bit problematic with some of the stuff they come up with. They develop a fascinating character to get into but brought in some very uninteresting characters that have nothing to do with the main story and one character to completely loathe. The fan service is very liberal in its usage but it gets very played out at some point. Some episodes I actually had fun with and enjoy some of the hilarity in them and the other episodes that contribute to the story helps as well. I wouldn’t recommend you watch the series immediately but for a Gainax series, it’s not actually mind-blowing but it’s passable. show that manages that can be both fascinating and very awkward.The story is about a combat android named Mahoro has driven into guilt by her actions in her combat days want to retire her days in peace as a live-in maid, serving the son of her late commanding officer, Suguru Misato, a phenomenally messy high school student who lives by himself after his family passed away.

Those who have watched the first season have probably come to love the nostalgic 90s cel art style, the lovable bunch of characters ranging from our favourite combat robot maid Mahoro to the little gourmet-cum-glutton Chizu, the uncensored bath scenes, the happy slice of life moments and the slight hints at romance interspersed with the overall plot. I watched the first season and loved every moments of it. But studio Gainax fails to deliver the same level of enjoyment in this second season.The season picks up...right where the previous one left off. Mahoro is working as a maid at Suguru\'s house and as we all are painfully aware, she still has a rapidly approaching expiration date. Right in the first episode we are introduced to a new character, Minawa, who is a combat cyborg similar to Mahoro. She has apparently deserted from her organization and hopes to find a new home. And in a predictable turn of events, our main character duo of Suguru and Mahoro decide to take her in. Sounds good so far, right? Well, the problem is that this is the only significant event that happens in the entire first 10 episodes of this season. Really, I\'m not kidding. The first season was much, much better in the regard that even though it felt like watching a slice of life anime, you could certainly feel the plot moving forward in each episode, whether that be in the form of character development or actual plot-significant events taking place. This season felt like watching Naruto filler.I guess the reason for this is that the creators wanted to delve into Minawa\'s character at a gradual pace, but no matter how you look at it, it was a terrible decision. Her character isn\'t even that complex or anything new. It\'s the same age-old trope of the character whose past is associated with the enemy but is actually still secretly a spy of the enemy however they come to love the main characters and after betraying them they decide to take their side in the end. Yeah, it\'s as simple as that but for some reason Gainax thought that they needed to dedicate 10 episodes for making the viewers realize this.Another gripe I have with this is that it spent so much time on pointless things but all the important things were just glossed over. For example, take Mahoro\'s guilt over killing Suguru\'s father. Normally you\'d expect that this will be touched upon in an entire episode, with Suguru finding out about it, and we\'ll see his reaction, how he deals with it, etc. But no, this is just glossed over in a 3 second dialogue during a fight scene. Absolutely baffling. There\'s also the case of how Mahoro\'s death occurs. With all the episodes ending with a panel saying ""XXX days left until Mahoro stops functioning"" you\'d expect that the when the time comes for Mahoro to finally rest in peace it will be something like Plastic Memories, a memorable, touching scene of parting. I won\'t spoil it but let\'s just say that it\'s nothing like that. Well, to be fair maybe it\'s just me that\'s bothered by this, though. Not everyone has the same expectations. Anyhow, it really does seem like Gainax just focused on Minawa and only remembered that there was a plot to wrap up when only 3 episodes were left.Well, I don\'t have the energy to type much more about this, but last thing I want to mention is the ending. All I\'ll say is that this anime has a classic Gainax ending. That essentially means that no person on this planet will completely be satisfied with it. It will leave you with an emptiness in your heart. Maybe it will lead you to read the manga, which supposedly has a different ending, or maybe it will make you curse Gainax and give all their anime a 1/10 rating. Whatever suits you. But the fact remains that you will never really find closure.And that\'s all folks, thanks for reading my review. I don\'t do these very often, after all. right where the previous one left off.

This season is a bit of a disappointment for me, I expected it to advance our main characters a bit. Unfortunately, that's all I got, a bit of character development. I liked the new characters that were introduced, they provided some entertainment. I like the way the characters were drawn, the colours and the backgrounds were fine. I liked the ending song of this season, but not as much as the one of the first season. And while the story slowly, very slowly advances, it feels like we are not getting anywhere....(are we there yet?) I enjoyed most of the situations the characters were put in, except for one thing. There was always a battle in every episode, most of which were unnecessary. The crew seem to have created confrontations that were pointless, and that just ruined the experience for me. I made it through 9 episodes before it became too much for me, I wish that the majority of the episodes had situations that didn't involve loud arguments and physical battles. It would have been a better series without them. (are we there yet?) I enjoyed most of the situations the characters were put in, except for one thing.

Apparently two secret organisations weren't enough because suddenly there's a third, along with a second combat maid. This season has all the hallmarks of a story that has prematurely run out of ideas, and just throws a pile of new characters in to paper over the cracks. Despite covering the remaining months before Mahoro is due to stop functioning, the story loses interest in her for almost the entire season, instead shifting the focus to this new cyborg maid Minawa (whose primary trait is that she falls over a lot) and her faltering...romance with a character who manages to be even more devoid of personality than the protagonist. Those characters then vanish from the story altogether for most of the final few episodes, which hastily try to course correct the focus back to Mahoro as we find out what ultimately becomes of her. It's all too rushed and so its attempts to tug at the heartstrings fall flat. All this culminates in a thoroughly miserable final episode that tries to pivot to an uplifting ending at the last minute, but without having done anything to foreshadow its final twist it feels nonsensical. I'm still not entirely sure what the hell happened at the end.Sadly the production values take a nosedive this season too, with only a scant handful of shots in the action scenes showing any of that trademark Gainax flair.

Although the art and animation quality hardly deviate from the first season.It's safe to say that the second season doesn't bring anything new to the table. Instead, it's a mere repetition of the first season with a few changes here and there. The introduction of a new human organization might add a bit of suspense, but it's nothing groundbreaking. The comedy is...predictable and relies heavily on cliches, with Minawa's clumsiness being the only new addition.

Macross 7,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1397/Macross_7,"[""I'm one of what is probably the most rare breed of western anime fans, those who will defend Macross 7. While not masterpiece of the anime art form, there is a lot to like about Macross 7. Since the series is so polarizing among fans, I'll take a pros vs. cons approach.Pros:1. Music. While obviously a matter of taste, I find most of Fire Bomber's songs quite enjoyable. They're one of the few anime soundtracks I will listen to on their own merits.2. Fun factor. Basara is genuinely entertaining to watch.3. Nostalgia. There are numerous ties to the original series, and it's interesting to see...how things developed. Most notably, it's great to see Max and Milia again. Also, it continues the concept of the colony fleets introduced in Macross Flashback 2012.4. Focus on characters. While ostensibly a mecha series, the focus of the story is on the characters. Fire Bomber's road to stardom, Basara's quest to move people's hearts with his music, Mylene growing up and understanding her own feelings for Basara and Gamlin, reconciling Max and Milia's relationship, etc. If you avoid mecha shows because they have too much technobabble and focus on the robots more than characters, this is not a problem here.Cons:1. Music. Some people hate it. If you don't like pop/rock, especially of a Japanese variety, you will be assaulted by it for the duration of the series.2. Use of stock footage. Especially early on, there is an extreme use of stock battle footage of VF-11's and Elgarzorenes fighting.3. Lack of focus on mecha. Fans expecting to have lots of cool animation of all the new Valkyrie models introduced here will be sorely disappointed. I recommend you pick up the VF-X  games for the Playstation instead to get that fix.Macross fans should give the series a chance, and don't give up on it too soon. This is certainly one of those anime deserving of the time honored line &quot;it gets better later.&quot; Just be aware of what kind of show this is you're getting into. Macross 7's greatest flaw is simply that it isn't what people expected of a continuation of Macross. how things developed. Most notably, it's great to see Max and Milia again.

Macross 7's greatest flaw is simply that it isn't what people expected of a continuation of Macross."", 'Macross 7 is so far the most different installment of the Macross franchise. While it retains the three main story elements of all Macross series (Love Triangles, Music and Variable Fighters), for everything else it tries to push the envelope of strangeness while trying to keep it within the confines of the Macross universe. For that reason, it may rub viewers, especially older fans of the franchise with certain expectations, the wrong way. As a result, Macross 7 is truly an anime that you either love it or hate it, no in between, and the only way one can tell which camp you fall in...is to watch the whole thing for yourself. Make no mistake, I for one am glad I did complete the show as I found myself enjoying it greatly.At its core, the story of Macross 7 is about a rock singer (Basara) trying to find his way in the world (or Galaxy whatever) with his singing. Sounds fairly typical fare, but the show introduces so many far-out story elements that you might wonder if the writers were on drugs. Someone once described Macross 7 as ""Rock singers flying around in transforming robot planes fighting space vampires with the power of music"", and I find that description is pretty dead on, so if you have trouble swallowing that it is unlikely this show is for you. Most Macross series pride themselves in not taking things too seriously, and Macross 7 not only revels in it but thrives on its weirdness, and that is really the fun of it. The key to enjoying it is to accept the silliness and go with the flow. I do understand that may not be to everyone\'s tastes, it reall tests the boundaries of one\'s suspension of belief. The show does drag at times, especially in the first 10+ or so episodes where they just seem to repeat each other. At the end it is painfully obvious that they could have done the show with a lot fewer episodes.  When the story does pick up in the middle to late episodes, depending on whether you\'ve allowed yourself to be immersed in the show\'s strangeness, it can turn out to be a fun ride.Macross 7 has a rather memorable set of characters. They may not be especially deep, but everyone from the main cast to the smallest side character are each built around a unique quirk which allows them to play off each other pretty well. From Gamlin\'s relative squareness to Miriya\'s hot headedness to unnamed Flower Girl\'s unending quest to present flowers to Basara, each of them helps breathe life into Macross 7\'s environ giving it a rather organic feel. The only real problem for most is the main character, Basara, who like so many things about the show, you either like or not. A lot of people are turned off by his seemingly pig-headed and abrasive personality, he does not go out of the way to make himself likable. But for me personally, I find that is what makes him rather interesting in the way he effects change in those around him. A welcome change to the standard type of main protagonists we\'ve been seeing in other shows in the same genre.As expected, Music is very integral to Macross 7\'s story. The soundtrack mainly consists of Japanese Rock so if that\'s not your cup of tea, well then steel yourself for 49 episodes plus plus worth of it. Even then, early on, it does not show much diversity with Basara repeating the same two songs over and over again for the first few episodes until you are sick of them (afterwards he then repeats them so many times you end up liking them again) However this actually makes sense within the context of the show as Basara is still trying to find his voice early on and eventually as the story progresses, each time he achieves some self realization, he gets newer and better songs to play with.As for the animation, well, you can tell that their budget was rather limited, even for an older show. There is a noticeable lack of big dogfight sequences that characterize other Macross shows, so if you are a fan who is in it for the Itano circuses, you might end up disappointed. Recycled cels means you end up seeing the same Valk being blown up every other episode even till the later end of the show so there is a certain sense of laziness in this department.As I said, Macross 7 is a show that you need to watch in its entirety to give proper judgment on it as the early episodes do not do it justice. Even I admit that it took me 3 tries before I could move past the first few episodes, but I found myself rewarded with a rather enjoyable and surprisingly engaging ride by the end. Its 49 episode count may seem rather daunting, but I do encourage you to not give up so easily and try to endure it to the end. It is a show you either steer clear or watch all the way to the end. It is Macross at its silliest, and the show knows it. If you acknowledge this, Macross 7 might end up surprising you with a rather fun, and atypical Macross experience. is to watch the whole thing for yourself.

I was properly warned, but it was still destiny for me to watch Macross 7 as well. Not only was it the next in a franchise that had yet to do me any wrong but it\'s the first and only true sequel to the original SDF Macross. I had to watch it, despite Macross 7\'s reputation of being a huge departure for Macross.The first series was one of the pioneering works of the ""Real Robot"" genre along with Mobile Suit Gundam. It combined the aesthetic appeal of...mecha with more ambitious storytelling that focused on character drama and more plausible science. Macross 7 unabashedly goes towards the opposite ""Super Robot"" genre, featuring absurd plot devices, supernatural powers, and a lighter tone. Macross 7 refers to the ship fleet that\'s one of many Macross fleets traveling the galaxy in search of habitable planets. The fleet is comprised of several domed ships that completely replicate Earth life inside of them. Eventually the fleet comes across the Varauta army, an alien race with their own technology that survive on draining the life energy of humans, ""Spirita"". When traditional weapons don\'t cut it only the civilian Nekki Basara and his band Fire Bomber can defeat the enemy using the almighty power of... rock music.Things won\'t be easy for him, though. The military refuses to believe in the power of his singing, and his irritable personality causes him to clash with his own bandmates. Regardless, he\'s Macross 7\'s only hope to defend against the Varauta as they travel aimlessly through space. Joining Basara are his bandmates Mylene Jenius, Ray Lovelock, and Veffidas Feaze. Only three SDF Macross characters return for this installment, notably Max and Milia who command the fleet and govern the city, respectively. Got it? Let\'s rock this series.I once heard someone call Macross 7 the ""G Gundam of the Macross Franchise"". That\'s true for many reasons. Not only is it two real robot franchises introducing a super robot series, but they also both lighten the known serious tone considerably. Also, they\'re both mediocre and considered the dark horse of their respective franchises. Macross 7 isn\'t lacking because it\'s different from the other series. Take it from me, who thought the concept sounded awesome and went in incredibly optimistic. Macross 7 fails because, as anything would, it poorly executes basic story writing principles and undersells its own original ideas. With the basic plot out of the way, let\'s break this down starting with the main cast of characters.Nekki Basara is our hero and a truly odd one. Almost always silent except when he sings and almost always shouting otherwise, he rarely has the most spoken lines in an episode despite his important role. Though in some ways a typically hotblooded shonen protagonist, Basara is a surprisingly abrasive character that\'s practically antisocial. He\'s completely dedicated to the power of music as a means of emotional communication and flies out into battle with his custom Valkyrie unit where he can play his songs and control the mech with the same guitar. Basara is an extreme pacifist who goes out in the middle of dogfights alone to sing at the enemy while dodging countless attacks, hoping that the enemy will be moved by his songs of love and peace and will stop fighting. Basara\'s catch phrase is yelling at everyone to ""listen to my song!"" whether it\'s in public or after he\'s shot speaker pods into the enemy mechs.Yet, we get the least backstory of Basara out of any major character. He\'s the leader of a rock band, believes music can influence people, and never lets anyone stop him from singing at the expense of his own life. Why he does this, why he thinks like this, where he came from, what influences him, why he\'s a good pilot, etc., none of these things are ever explained throughout the entire series. Though this would normally be a major slight against characterization this may actually be perhaps what I find so charming about him. Basara is a main character who\'s a genuine eccentric and not at all like anyone else, but over time he succeeds in reaching out to others despite his attitude and normal communication problems. For all talk of Tomino\'s Gundam protagonists possibly being ""autistic"", I\'m surprised I never hear that lodged at Basara who fits the bill much more realistically. Despite the total lack of depth to Basara\'s personality due to little insight into his head and not really developing as a character ever, I have to say I\'m pretty fond of him and still think he\'s the best Macross 7 character simply because he has a strong distinctive personality that\'s entertaining to watch and stands out among anime protagonists. When Basara does anything at all you\'re interested in him because you want to understand anything more about the weirdo, but in the end the only context you have is his songs. Though he probably wouldn\'t have it any other way.To fill the shoes of generic lead chatterbox is Fire Bomber\'s female vocalist, Mylene. Vain, whiney, and dull, Mylene is a typical 14 year-old and it makes perfect sense that she\'s the only person stubborn enough to stay in the band after putting up with Basara\'s self-centered spontaneity and rudeness. Mylene apparently has no life or personality prior to the events of Macross 7, and her character arc revolves around her being lectured on the true heart and soul of music by Basara acting as her borderline mentor, as well as learning about the dangers and seriousness of war when she eventually joins Basara on the front lines. I don\'t really hate Mylene, but she\'s a very annoying and typical character who\'s given far, far more lines than anyone else in the series despite having little interesting things to say. Her character progression is incredibly obvious, so to see her continuously resist and repeat it as she argues with Basara and acts like she isn\'t attracted to him is very tiring and boring. Whenever something bad happens she cries and whines despite the fact she\'s got shit to do.Mylene is a weak character because she\'s essentially a complement to everyone else. She\'s a link between her parents, Max and Milia, she\'s the token confounded reaction towards Basara\'s strange actions which also prompt the majority of Ray\'s dialogue, and she\'s the object of affection and source of motivation for Gamlin. Her fight for autonomy ends with her being a generic hero without the eccentricity of Basara. Mylene is what we call a ""resource character"", and it\'s an easy one for the necessary female lead to fall into. But it should never be such a major character, and she\'s focused on far too much in storyline plots at the expense of developing pretty much anyone else.The keyboardist Ray is the odd duck of Fire Bomber: he has to be at least 30 making him the oldest member by far, and he\'s black. In fact, he\'s the only black character I remember seeing in Macross 7. There are more aliens in Macross 7 than black people. Anyway, Ray is the voice of reason in Fire Bomber. He\'s inspired by Basara\'s passion and believes in him to the very end, often defending him when Mylene complains about him doing something on his own accord. Ray has acceptable backstory detail but it\'s all delivered in very unsatisfying short asides. There are one or two episodes tops that are devoted to him, and I find this a shame. He\'s perhaps the most all-around likable, sane person on Macross 7. He never denies the obvious fact that Basara\'s singing has an effect on the enemy but is reasonable in his negotiations with the military and others. Ray is super cool, but unfortunately he\'s so busy trying to make up for everyone\'s insanity that he never gets enough time to talk about himself.Veffidas is the full-blooded Meltrandi drummer. Veffidas drums. That\'s it. Veffidas\'s gimmick is that she is almost entirely mute, and although she\'s in every single episode she probably speaks less than twenty words the entire series. At first this is very cute, but there\'s several issues. One, it\'s disappointing that the only identifiably Zentradi character in the series does practically nothing. Yes Milia is Meltrandi also but looks and behaves like any other human in Macross 7. Veffidas has the distinctive pale skin look and super strength but her role is so minor. It\'s like anime whitewashing. A much bigger problem though is that she further unbalances the team dynamic. She\'s a member of Fire Bomber, and it\'s a waste of such a large role to keep her silent when she\'s such a constant in the series and could offer a greater range of dialogue and personality. Ray is already overshadowed by Basara and Mylene, and Veffidas\'s insignificance drags him down further since they\'re paired together in battle but neither are ever the center of attention. If this strong silent gimmick had to be used on someone it shouldn\'t have been on a character with a natural relation with the main characters that could\'ve been exploited.Next to Basara and Mylene, the most important character is the military pilot Gamlin Kizaki. An ace pilot and member of the special Diamond Force, Gamlin is extremely strict about duty and protocol. Naturally he\'s very irritated by Basara\'s presence on the battlefield and even finds his songs annoying. This makes him the only character in the series who doesn\'t think Fire Bomber\'s music is the best thing ever. Gamlin is not only a sour sport but also pines for Mylene\'s jailbait ass even though he\'s certainly in his 20s. This is very strange, but what\'s stranger is that it\'s Mylene\'s parents that hook them up. Anyway, Gamlin is a good character by Macross 7 standards. His progression is also incredibly obvious but it\'s done with a gradual subtlety that makes it surprising when you realize he actually has changed. Eventually I began to appreciate him for being one of the characters who has sense, and his relationship with Mylene can be slightly entertaining and offer some of the more decent downtime between the main plot due to the fact their meetings always end up with him reflecting on himself for the entire duration. Macross 7 fails the Bechdel test hard.The beloved SDF Macross characters Max and Milia make their return as adults here. Their relationship has becomed strained and the two frequently clash when it comes to authority over Macross 7. It should come as no surprise from the above that Milia is always the instigator of their conflicts, but I know I can\'t be one of the only fans very happy to see them come back. Though they\'re both very popular characters they weren\'t that important in the original series. This gives them proper time to shine. Max behaves just how you\'d expect an adult version of him to, and although Milia\'s hotshot personality has been compromised in her old age her elitist nature has remained. I\'m glad that though Macross 7 changed so many things the franchise established it didn\'t lose sight of what it kept. I appreciated this moderate connection to the original series and I rooted for their character development because I already had an attachment to them.Side characters include Mylene\'s squeaking pet hairball Guvava that mimics all her emotions; an unnamed silent flower girl who\'s used as a running gag in every episode as she attempts to give Basara flowers but is interrupted every time; and lastly.... You know what, screw it. Those are the only side characters in Macross 7 who consistently appear, let alone have some kind of role. The rest are almost never seen except for when the writing explicitely uses them for the sake of another character, like the female biker Rex to make Mylene jealous of her and Basara. Because she is never used in any other context it\'s impossible to care when she does show up because she\'s just a plot device. Macross 7\'s side characters suck and barely exist, but what can you expect from a series that didn\'t even make its four main band members important in 49 episodes?But the real characters Macross 7 drops the ball on are the villains. The Varauta army aliens are awful. Every one of them has an obnoxious speaking trait that\'s drove into the ground endlessly because they never die and show up in every episode to provide the token action segment. The leader, Gepelnitch, speaks only in obtuse metaphors to convey the simplest of thoughts which makes him look like an idiot instead of condescending. Gavil is a hairy bird-man-thing whose every sentence contains the word ""beauty"". I HATED this character. His manner of speech is incredibly repetitive to the point he speaks the same sentences constantly even though he\'s the most common villain in the series. He\'s an irritating bastard who is constantly a wedge between the series and any plot progression, as well as my patience. Sivil is some flying pixie girl who multiple characters are inexplicably obsessed with and most of her spoken lines are just her making high-pitched screams or yelling ""Spiritia!"". Goram and Zomd are telepathically connected for some reason and finish each others sentences while sporadically teleporting around and laughing annoying modulated laughs for no reason. God, my fucking ears. I hate these villains and they\'re as completely shallow as their goal to drain Spiritia from humans for food. Very compelling.Even by mecha standards, Macross 7\'s pacing is so poor that it\'s practically devolved into a Saturday morning kids show. The majority of the series has every episode structured as such: Basara does something to annoy Mylene, Mylene complains at him, Basara says Mylene doesn\'t know what he\'s talking about and storms off, Mylene complains again, Ray defends Basara, Gamlin is shy around Mylene, the enemy is shown as Gepelnitch says some shit that means nothing, the writers realize the arguing between Basara and Mylene has gone too far and calls the enemy in, Basara deploys and sings until the enemy decides to leave after doing what they want, Gamlin complains about Basara, and then everything is back to normal. You might think you saw a hint of character development or plot progression, but rest assured any of that will be pushed into the background and ignored as long as that\'s possible. Even when the plot does move it\'s in no way that\'s impressive because it ultimately comes down to a plan to seriously hinder the enemy failing or succeeding but not actually in a significant way, and either the army or enemy gets a power up that doesn\'t change their relationship or the circumstances. Characters will rarely show growth, but it will be in the most predictable ways.Possibly the biggest letdown of Macross 7 is its focus on the culture of music. This is the biggest role music has ever played in a Macross series and the step from pop idol to a full band is a good and natural idea. Yet Fire Bomber are apparently handled by writers that have no idea what it\'s like to be musicians. There are several anime focused on music, and these look into the thoughts and ideas people have about music and how they create it. We see Fire Bomber practice in a studio constantly but we never see them actually discuss writing songs, lyrics, talking about other bands, even mentioning other bands, or what music means to them beyond an extremely simple pleasurable nature. This is the biggest waste of potential in Macross 7. Making a story that\'s seemingly about a band, but not their relation to music. This would\'ve created far more interesting subplots and character development than what\'s currently in the series while establishing its theme on a deeper level. But something like that would probably require too much intimacy, something that\'s not really demonstrated in the series as is.Though there\'s nothing much behind the music, Macross 7\'s songs are pretty good. And they sure as hell better be for how much you hear Fire Bomber\'s songs. The entire soundtrack is composed by the actual fictional band and everything has vocals. If I had a particular complaint here is that there aren\'t enough songs and you end up hearing the same ones over and over. I got sick of Planet Dance extremely fast but I had to wait for Basara to write more songs. What sense does it even make that he\'s performing live at the start of the series but has only written one song? I would\'ve liked a more even spread. Some songs are barely played, and some are played way too much. The opening and ending theme songs, ""Seventh Moon"" and ""My Friends"", are among my favorite combinations of opening/ending themes ever in anime. I never got tired of hearing those ones, even though both ending animations creepily sexualize Mylene.There are some odd inconsistencies with the sound design, however. In some cases I\'m impressed, like how if Basara happens to speak in the middle of a song the vocals actually will stop while the other instruments continue. At other times there are too many instruments playing for what\'s going on onscreen, which makes the music dangerously impersonal from a series that\'s supposed to be stressing the opposite. I don\'t know how Mylene can just start singing by herself and all of a sudden a bunch of instruments start backing her up. And who the hell does their backing vocals? Ray and Veffidas don\'t sing at all. Do they use pre-recorded backing tapes? Where are they? I at least want to see them in the act of making them.Because only one major character isn\'t a pacifist, action scenes in Macross 7 tend to have extremely little weight to them as it\'s just grunts fighting in generic mechs. Badly choreographed fights and stock footage galore. Macross 7 definitely skimps the budget frequently. Reused stills are everywhere as well and pretty noticeable. Though cheaply drawn and animated, I still like the way Macross 7 looks more than anything else about it. It\'s full of extremely bright colors and you can often get a full rainbow in every still. Macross 7\'s visuals could put me in a good mood and engage me in the show when I very well might not have been otherwise. I just love to look at those colors.For 49 episodes I have very little to say about Macross 7, but that\'s because it has very little to say about itself. The show would have benefitted greatly by having its length cut in half, but the show\'s main problems aren\'t just in its incredibly poor pacing and lack of pay off. Macross 7 isn\'t a show ruined by bad ideas, it\'s a show full of good ideas that apparently isn\'t conscious of any of the reasons why they might be good. Crossing the music/band genre with super robot mecha was a fantastic idea full of fun and the potential to combine rock music and action to create some truly memorable moments, but instead its just endless frustration as it focuses on weak characters, generic relationships, and a simple yet overextended plot. Macross 7 could\'ve been a classic if it just had more conviction.... Fire! mecha with more ambitious storytelling that focused on character drama and more plausible science. Macross 7 unabashedly goes towards the opposite ""Super Robot"" genre, featuring absurd plot devices, supernatural powers, and a lighter tone.

Only three SDF Macross characters return for this installment, notably Max and Milia who command the fleet and govern the city, respectively. Got it? Let\'s rock this series.I once heard someone call Macross 7 the ""G Gundam of the Macross Franchise"". That\'s true for many reasons. Not only is it two real robot franchises introducing a super robot series, but they also both lighten the known serious tone considerably. Also, they\'re both mediocre and considered the dark horse of their respective franchises. Macross 7 isn\'t lacking because it\'s different from the other series. Take it from me, who thought the concept sounded awesome and went in incredibly optimistic. Macross 7 fails because, as anything would, it poorly executes basic story writing principles and undersells its own original ideas. With the basic plot out of the way, let\'s break this down starting with the main cast of characters.Nekki Basara is our hero and a truly odd one. Almost always silent except when he sings and almost always shouting otherwise, he rarely has the most spoken lines in an episode despite his important role. Though in some ways a typically hotblooded shonen protagonist, Basara is a surprisingly abrasive character that\'s practically antisocial. He\'s completely dedicated to the power of music as a means of emotional communication and flies out into battle with his custom Valkyrie unit where he can play his songs and control the mech with the same guitar. Basara is an extreme pacifist who goes out in the middle of dogfights alone to sing at the enemy while dodging countless attacks, hoping that the enemy will be moved by his songs of love and peace and will stop fighting. Basara\'s catch phrase is yelling at everyone to ""listen to my song!"" whether it\'s in public or after he\'s shot speaker pods into the enemy mechs.Yet, we get the least backstory of Basara out of any major character. He\'s the leader of a rock band, believes music can influence people, and never lets anyone stop him from singing at the expense of his own life. Why he does this, why he thinks like this, where he came from, what influences him, why he\'s a good pilot, etc., none of these things are ever explained throughout the entire series. Though this would normally be a major slight against characterization this may actually be perhaps what I find so charming about him. Basara is a main character who\'s a genuine eccentric and not at all like anyone else, but over time he succeeds in reaching out to others despite his attitude and normal communication problems. For all talk of Tomino\'s Gundam protagonists possibly being ""autistic"", I\'m surprised I never hear that lodged at Basara who fits the bill much more realistically. Despite the total lack of depth to Basara\'s personality due to little insight into his head and not really developing as a character ever, I have to say I\'m pretty fond of him and still think he\'s the best Macross 7 character simply because he has a strong distinctive personality that\'s entertaining to watch and stands out among anime protagonists. When Basara does anything at all you\'re interested in him because you want to understand anything more about the weirdo, but in the end the only context you have is his songs. Though he probably wouldn\'t have it any other way.To fill the shoes of generic lead chatterbox is Fire Bomber\'s female vocalist, Mylene. Vain, whiney, and dull, Mylene is a typical 14 year-old and it makes perfect sense that she\'s the only person stubborn enough to stay in the band after putting up with Basara\'s self-centered spontaneity and rudeness. Mylene apparently has no life or personality prior to the events of Macross 7, and her character arc revolves around her being lectured on the true heart and soul of music by Basara acting as her borderline mentor, as well as learning about the dangers and seriousness of war when she eventually joins Basara on the front lines. I don\'t really hate Mylene, but she\'s a very annoying and typical character who\'s given far, far more lines than anyone else in the series despite having little interesting things to say. Her character progression is incredibly obvious, so to see her continuously resist and repeat it as she argues with Basara and acts like she isn\'t attracted to him is very tiring and boring. Whenever something bad happens she cries and whines despite the fact she\'s got shit to do.Mylene is a weak character because she\'s essentially a complement to everyone else. She\'s a link between her parents, Max and Milia, she\'s the token confounded reaction towards Basara\'s strange actions which also prompt the majority of Ray\'s dialogue, and she\'s the object of affection and source of motivation for Gamlin. Her fight for autonomy ends with her being a generic hero without the eccentricity of Basara. Mylene is what we call a ""resource character"", and it\'s an easy one for the necessary female lead to fall into. But it should never be such a major character, and she\'s focused on far too much in storyline plots at the expense of developing pretty much anyone else.The keyboardist Ray is the odd duck of Fire Bomber: he has to be at least 30 making him the oldest member by far, and he\'s black. In fact, he\'s the only black character I remember seeing in Macross 7. There are more aliens in Macross 7 than black people. Anyway, Ray is the voice of reason in Fire Bomber. He\'s inspired by Basara\'s passion and believes in him to the very end, often defending him when Mylene complains about him doing something on his own accord. Ray has acceptable backstory detail but it\'s all delivered in very unsatisfying short asides. There are one or two episodes tops that are devoted to him, and I find this a shame. He\'s perhaps the most all-around likable, sane person on Macross 7. He never denies the obvious fact that Basara\'s singing has an effect on the enemy but is reasonable in his negotiations with the military and others. Ray is super cool, but unfortunately he\'s so busy trying to make up for everyone\'s insanity that he never gets enough time to talk about himself.Veffidas is the full-blooded Meltrandi drummer. Veffidas drums. That\'s it. Veffidas\'s gimmick is that she is almost entirely mute, and although she\'s in every single episode she probably speaks less than twenty words the entire series. At first this is very cute, but there\'s several issues. One, it\'s disappointing that the only identifiably Zentradi character in the series does practically nothing. Yes Milia is Meltrandi also but looks and behaves like any other human in Macross 7. Veffidas has the distinctive pale skin look and super strength but her role is so minor. It\'s like anime whitewashing. A much bigger problem though is that she further unbalances the team dynamic. She\'s a member of Fire Bomber, and it\'s a waste of such a large role to keep her silent when she\'s such a constant in the series and could offer a greater range of dialogue and personality. Ray is already overshadowed by Basara and Mylene, and Veffidas\'s insignificance drags him down further since they\'re paired together in battle but neither are ever the center of attention. If this strong silent gimmick had to be used on someone it shouldn\'t have been on a character with a natural relation with the main characters that could\'ve been exploited.Next to Basara and Mylene, the most important character is the military pilot Gamlin Kizaki. An ace pilot and member of the special Diamond Force, Gamlin is extremely strict about duty and protocol. Naturally he\'s very irritated by Basara\'s presence on the battlefield and even finds his songs annoying. This makes him the only character in the series who doesn\'t think Fire Bomber\'s music is the best thing ever. Gamlin is not only a sour sport but also pines for Mylene\'s jailbait ass even though he\'s certainly in his 20s. This is very strange, but what\'s stranger is that it\'s Mylene\'s parents that hook them up. Anyway, Gamlin is a good character by Macross 7 standards. His progression is also incredibly obvious but it\'s done with a gradual subtlety that makes it surprising when you realize he actually has changed. Eventually I began to appreciate him for being one of the characters who has sense, and his relationship with Mylene can be slightly entertaining and offer some of the more decent downtime between the main plot due to the fact their meetings always end up with him reflecting on himself for the entire duration. Macross 7 fails the Bechdel test hard.The beloved SDF Macross characters Max and Milia make their return as adults here. Their relationship has becomed strained and the two frequently clash when it comes to authority over Macross 7. It should come as no surprise from the above that Milia is always the instigator of their conflicts, but I know I can\'t be one of the only fans very happy to see them come back. Though they\'re both very popular characters they weren\'t that important in the original series. This gives them proper time to shine. Max behaves just how you\'d expect an adult version of him to, and although Milia\'s hotshot personality has been compromised in her old age her elitist nature has remained. I\'m glad that though Macross 7 changed so many things the franchise established it didn\'t lose sight of what it kept. I appreciated this moderate connection to the original series and I rooted for their character development because I already had an attachment to them.Side characters include Mylene\'s squeaking pet hairball Guvava that mimics all her emotions; an unnamed silent flower girl who\'s used as a running gag in every episode as she attempts to give Basara flowers but is interrupted every time; and lastly.... You know what, screw it. Those are the only side characters in Macross 7 who consistently appear, let alone have some kind of role. The rest are almost never seen except for when the writing explicitely uses them for the sake of another character, like the female biker Rex to make Mylene jealous of her and Basara. Because she is never used in any other context it\'s impossible to care when she does show up because she\'s just a plot device. Macross 7\'s side characters suck and barely exist, but what can you expect from a series that didn\'t even make its four main band members important in 49 episodes?But the real characters Macross 7 drops the ball on are the villains. The Varauta army aliens are awful. Every one of them has an obnoxious speaking trait that\'s drove into the ground endlessly because they never die and show up in every episode to provide the token action segment. The leader, Gepelnitch, speaks only in obtuse metaphors to convey the simplest of thoughts which makes him look like an idiot instead of condescending. Gavil is a hairy bird-man-thing whose every sentence contains the word ""beauty"". I HATED this character. His manner of speech is incredibly repetitive to the point he speaks the same sentences constantly even though he\'s the most common villain in the series. He\'s an irritating bastard who is constantly a wedge between the series and any plot progression, as well as my patience. Sivil is some flying pixie girl who multiple characters are inexplicably obsessed with and most of her spoken lines are just her making high-pitched screams or yelling ""Spiritia!"". Goram and Zomd are telepathically connected for some reason and finish each others sentences while sporadically teleporting around and laughing annoying modulated laughs for no reason. God, my fucking ears. I hate these villains and they\'re as completely shallow as their goal to drain Spiritia from humans for food. Very compelling.Even by mecha standards, Macross 7\'s pacing is so poor that it\'s practically devolved into a Saturday morning kids show. The majority of the series has every episode structured as such: Basara does something to annoy Mylene, Mylene complains at him, Basara says Mylene doesn\'t know what he\'s talking about and storms off, Mylene complains again, Ray defends Basara, Gamlin is shy around Mylene, the enemy is shown as Gepelnitch says some shit that means nothing, the writers realize the arguing between Basara and Mylene has gone too far and calls the enemy in, Basara deploys and sings until the enemy decides to leave after doing what they want, Gamlin complains about Basara, and then everything is back to normal. You might think you saw a hint of character development or plot progression, but rest assured any of that will be pushed into the background and ignored as long as that\'s possible. Even when the plot does move it\'s in no way that\'s impressive because it ultimately comes down to a plan to seriously hinder the enemy failing or succeeding but not actually in a significant way, and either the army or enemy gets a power up that doesn\'t change their relationship or the circumstances. Characters will rarely show growth, but it will be in the most predictable ways.Possibly the biggest letdown of Macross 7 is its focus on the culture of music. This is the biggest role music has ever played in a Macross series and the step from pop idol to a full band is a good and natural idea. Yet Fire Bomber are apparently handled by writers that have no idea what it\'s like to be musicians. There are several anime focused on music, and these look into the thoughts and ideas people have about music and how they create it. We see Fire Bomber practice in a studio constantly but we never see them actually discuss writing songs, lyrics, talking about other bands, even mentioning other bands, or what music means to them beyond an extremely simple pleasurable nature. This is the biggest waste of potential in Macross 7. Making a story that\'s seemingly about a band, but not their relation to music. This would\'ve created far more interesting subplots and character development than what\'s currently in the series while establishing its theme on a deeper level. But something like that would probably require too much intimacy, something that\'s not really demonstrated in the series as is.Though there\'s nothing much behind the music, Macross 7\'s songs are pretty good. And they sure as hell better be for how much you hear Fire Bomber\'s songs. The entire soundtrack is composed by the actual fictional band and everything has vocals. If I had a particular complaint here is that there aren\'t enough songs and you end up hearing the same ones over and over. I got sick of Planet Dance extremely fast but I had to wait for Basara to write more songs. What sense does it even make that he\'s performing live at the start of the series but has only written one song? I would\'ve liked a more even spread. Some songs are barely played, and some are played way too much. The opening and ending theme songs, ""Seventh Moon"" and ""My Friends"", are among my favorite combinations of opening/ending themes ever in anime. I never got tired of hearing those ones, even though both ending animations creepily sexualize Mylene.There are some odd inconsistencies with the sound design, however. In some cases I\'m impressed, like how if Basara happens to speak in the middle of a song the vocals actually will stop while the other instruments continue. At other times there are too many instruments playing for what\'s going on onscreen, which makes the music dangerously impersonal from a series that\'s supposed to be stressing the opposite. I don\'t know how Mylene can just start singing by herself and all of a sudden a bunch of instruments start backing her up. And who the hell does their backing vocals? Ray and Veffidas don\'t sing at all. Do they use pre-recorded backing tapes? Where are they? I at least want to see them in the act of making them.Because only one major character isn\'t a pacifist, action scenes in Macross 7 tend to have extremely little weight to them as it\'s just grunts fighting in generic mechs. Badly choreographed fights and stock footage galore. Macross 7 definitely skimps the budget frequently. Reused stills are everywhere as well and pretty noticeable. Though cheaply drawn and animated, I still like the way Macross 7 looks more than anything else about it. It\'s full of extremely bright colors and you can often get a full rainbow in every still. Macross 7\'s visuals could put me in a good mood and engage me in the show when I very well might not have been otherwise. I just love to look at those colors.For 49 episodes I have very little to say about Macross 7, but that\'s because it has very little to say about itself. The show would have benefitted greatly by having its length cut in half, but the show\'s main problems aren\'t just in its incredibly poor pacing and lack of pay off. Macross 7 isn\'t a show ruined by bad ideas, it\'s a show full of good ideas that apparently isn\'t conscious of any of the reasons why they might be good. Crossing the music/band genre with super robot mecha was a fantastic idea full of fun and the potential to combine rock music and action to create some truly memorable moments, but instead its just endless frustration as it focuses on weak characters, generic relationships, and a simple yet overextended plot. Macross 7 could\'ve been a classic if it just had more conviction.... Fire!', ""So, since I'm hell bent on watching all the macross series I thought I'd start on Macross 7. For a while I thought I'd made a big mistake.StoryIt took a LONG time to finish this series which already indicates at first glance it's not all that exciting. It's all about Nekki Basara, guitarist and lead singer of the band Fire Bomber (what a great band name). The band starts unknown, living and practicing in a hovel on City 7, joined to Battle seven. They're the mainstay of the colony fleet Macross 7, searching for a habitable planet to live on.First part deals with character...development (boring) then the protodeviln appear. Instead of getting exciting it's a wash-rinse-repeat of Nekki using his songs to save the day. There are a few plot twists but overall this series though keeping with the Macross themes of Love Triangle and Power of Music ... is not done very well and honestly could have been squeezed into 26 episodes. There is a LOT of filler (1 min flashback at the start of every episode) and too much &quot;Basara is a rebel&quot; for my taste. Wakate, wakate, we get it, Basara is a rebel. Luckily the story picks up towards the last 10 episodes but it took a really strong will to continue watching this series!Art/AnimationDated animation and TONS of frame reuse. Like every episode there's frame reuse. I hate when it's done badly enough that I felt like fast forwarding through the same old animation of the same old battles with the same old songs. The mecha look nice but that's about it.SoundShoot me now! The first 25 episodes I *hated* Nikki's singing. Oh god he's singing the SAME old song. Again! and Again! and Again! Ugh! Hate hate! Play something else dammit! I don't know if they did it to save money by reusing the same songs/frames but somewhere around episode 35 I started enjoying the songs and found myself singing along at some parts. Ack! Insidious! So ... that was their evil plan! Repeat the song until the viewer starts liking it. Well, I hate to say but it worked. I guess I now have to go download the soundtrack. Grrr!CharacterThis is a mish-mash. There are a lot of characters, all with different personalities. I really started to feel for some of them towards the last 15 episodes so I guess you can say this series &quot;grew&quot; on me.The lead protagonist is Nekki Basara, the cool tough rebellious guitarist/lead singer who has a huge ego and doesn't care what other people think. He's also a pacifist who sings instead of blowing up enemies. Of course while he's singing there's plenty of innocent people getting blown up by the enemies he won't shoot. But somehow no citizens protest his peacenik ways getting others killed. I hated this character.The secondary singer/bassist of Fire Bomber is Mylene, daughter of Maximilian Jenius and Milia Fallyna. Supposed love interest who spent most of the episodes in teenage angst. Mylene is cute, young (14 years old) and spoiled. She treated her suitor, Gamlin, not too well. I hated her too.The other 2 members of the band are Ray, the ex military guy and 3rd guitarist, and Veffidas the zentradi drummer. Ray was ok but Veffidas was just big and must have had Obsessive Compulsive Disorder to drum everything in sight when she isn't at her drums - car windows, tables, chairs, other people's bodies etc. Veffidas is the strong, silent type. When she showed her strength and spoke it was with great impact. I loved Veffidas.Then there's Max and Milia, the first human and zentradi love connection from the original Macross Series. Max is older and handsomer, Milia got all straight laced. Estranged in this series (he's the military commander and she's the civilian's Mayor) I spent the whole series waiting and hoping for them to get back together. If only Macross 7 was about Max and Milia this series would have scored much higher. I loved them both!Lt. Gamlin is important and such a nice, honest, man. That's not good when you start falling in love with a 15 year old girl with no brains and who will likely choose the &quot;bad boy&quot; thus giving birth to the saying &quot;nice guys finish last&quot;. I was 15 once and liked bad boys then but now that I'm more mature I wouldn't marry one. Gamlin is really likeable and he is the only human of 3 characters that really develop over the course of the series (other 2 are protodeviln). This was a well written character and I loved him too.There's a whole slew of other side characters. Mylene's ecchi fan. Basara's fan who is always trying to give him flowers. Take the damn flowers Basara! Learn how to treat your fans better! I just pitied some of the side characters.EnjoymentWell I wasn't enjoying this series at the start (it sucked) but it started changing around episode 33 and by episode 40 it was fun.

I defiantly give this show a 10 out of 10, but I understand that this is highly subjective.  I will explain what the show has to offer and point out parts that you will love or hate.Story: Macross 7 takes place some time after the origonal super dimensional fortress macross.  For those of you that watched the original there is a fun surprise character wise in this for you.  Macross 7 takes the spirit of the show, as in ""Music can stop war"" and makes it a...literal effect.  Nekki Basara is a singer/songwriter/martial artist/ace macross pilot.  He wants to push his music as far as it will go.  As the show moves on the enemy this time wants to suck out human spirita.  Basara possess the strongest spirita and can fend off attackers with his singing.  Right hear if this concept annoys you, it stays thoughout the whole series.  Personally I find it rather amusing that his singing can hurt his attackers, and even revive some of the men who have there spirita sucked out.Art:  For its day macross 7 looked pretty sexy.  Now a days it might seem a bit dated, and the fact that it is almost 50 episodes with lots of space combat means that some animation is going to get reused.  This should not affect your enjoyment as since one attack is the same as another attack, do you really need to see the same thing a slightly different way?  If you do then this will annoy you.Sound: Most macross shows are known for there music, but macross 7 is a bit more special in that regard.  The show uses actual music from a Japanese band.  Because of this (and because the music was already licensed at the time of the creation of the show), there are only a few songs sung and resung thoughout the show.  New songs are added over time, but if you do not like the first song sung stop watching the show now, because you will hear that song over....and over....and over....and over... and did i mention you will hear it over....and over....  -ahem-  Yes the music is repetitive in the sense that they sing alot, but its good rock music and I enjoyed it.  Also the music is used as narration for the space battles like it is in other macross shows which is also very well done.Characters: This show shines because of its characters and there complex interactions between not only each other but the whole network of relationships as a whole.  Basara and his band have quite a back story for each one of them, not to mention back stories of some characters once they paired up. (this will make sense if you watch it).  None of the characters are one dimensional, and they always make logical decisions based on what is happening around them.  In other words no one does anything stupid just so that they can make a filler episode of cleaning up the mess.  Nothing from this area should turn anyone off.Enjoyment: Outstanding, when you combine good visuals with great sound and some awesome characters on a well throughout plot you get one hell of a ride.  I actually like this Macross a lot better than the original.  Id say its about tied in interest with frontier.

I’m being completely serious, and I’ll try to explain some of why I found it so special.BOMBER!! Let’s start with the music. SDF Macross was made to sell toys, and Macross 7 was made to sell CDs. To accomplish this, the show focuses on the band Fire Bomber, who have about a dozen insert songs in the show. At first these songs may seem tacky or repetitive, and it doesn’t help that the early episodes keep using the same two songs, but the soundtrack seriously...grows on you to the point where it’s hard not to sing along. The song lyrics can feel nonsensical at times, but by a certain point in the show, everything clicks and suddenly all the song themes directly correlate with what’s happening on the screen. The opening and first ending are also totally kickass.I can’t go any further without talking about the elephant in the room: Basara. He’s our main character this time around, and boy is he different. Unlike the military recruits of every other show, Basara is a guitarist and vocalist who is completely opposed to war and fighting, believing that everything can be solved with music and love. But he’s not a totally stoned-out hippie about it! He’s impulsive, feisty, and extremely faithful to his beliefs. in other words, he’s an asshole. Most people who don’t like 7 can’t stand Basara, but I think he’s so fresh and interesting. His flaws are very pronounced but understandable, since his morals are so straightforward and idealistic.  He’s a beatnik through and through and I’m glad we have him instead of a by-the-books military man as the main character.We actually do get that exact military man in the form of Gamlin, who’s painted in such a poor light through his pathetic social interactions. Even if he can save the day he can’t save a failing dinner date for his life. It’s also a messed up that he spends the whole show trying to marry a fourteen-year-old.Mylene, the band’s bassist and backing vocalist, is our fourteen-year-old in question. She’s bratty and irrational most of the time, which gives her a very bad rap amongst many watchers. But c’mon, that’s how fourteen-year olds really are, especially if you spoil them with rich parents and giant music robots! Mylene is a great foil to Basara, two jerks for different reasons trying their best to be a part of something much greater than their own egos. This doesn’t make them bad characters at all, it makes them really stand out compared to most anime characters.This is a show about a band, which makes it a different beast than the other Macrosses! Like its shift in genre from idol to rock, the show is rowdy, more rough around the edges, and not afraid to try some new stuff. This more experimental approach is interesting because it’s at complete odds with the low budget – cels and audio samples are constantly reused, but in some rather interesting ways the more the show goes on.With bands come fans, and there is no better fan in any anime than Flower Girl. She’s a cameo figure, showing up in every episode. She dreams of meeting Basara and giving him flowers but the plot intervenes every single time to prevent her from doing so. Her struggle goes from being a gag to being really depressing to being emblematic of the show as a whole, with some episodes jump-cutting to her to represent loss or determination or unrequited love. In a show bursting at the seams with annoying yet lovable jerks, she stands out as a beacon of light.Macross 7 totally could have done more with its unique concepts though. Imagine a rival punk band appearing halfway through the show to challenge Fire Bomber’s monopoly on the music scene. Imagine everyone needing to switch instruments for an episode. Imagine them getting washed up and trying to radically reinvent their image and sound. Imagine the songs themselves eventually getting really experimental, as if Basara had suddenly joined Throbbing Gristle. Imagine the production studio really going all out on the vocals recording and imbuing the fight scenes with way more auditory inflection and power. If Macross 7 cut some of the alien stuff and focused more on the trials and tribulations of being a band, it truly could have been a 10.One last thing, for all you art fans out there. The colors are really good?? Like, stupidly good??? The animation cels are nothing to write home about, but the backgrounds are beautifully painted with bright pinks, oranges, purples, blues, and pretty much any pretty combination you can think of. So many good panned-out sunset shots. Also, this is a show where outer space is blue, and I think that's wonderful.Macross 7 is great because it is able to so effectively walk the lines between campiness and seriousness, it can really defy your expectations. Those 49 episodes will feel like a breeze. It’s the most experimental of the Macrosses by far, and in the wake of safe boring shows like Delta, that carefree nature and willingness to explore new thematic territory really pays off. I don’t feel like I sold the show quite well enough in this review, so let me just say I felt a certain magic that I don’t normally feel when watching anime. A feeling of flow, of really connecting with and grooving along with the show. Maybe this is what Spiritia really is. grows on you to the point where it’s hard not to sing along. The song lyrics can feel nonsensical at times, but by a certain point in the show, everything clicks and suddenly all the song themes directly correlate with what’s happening on the screen.

Maybe this is what Spiritia really is."", 'Macross 7 was one of the first sequels to the Macross franchise made around the same time that Macross Plus came about. This chapter of the franchise focuses on the human and Zentradi members aboard the spacecraft Macross 7 dealing with a new enemy alien threat called the Protodevlin and a guitarist named Basara Nekki cutting in during heated fights in a Valkyrie unit between the forces to try singing to the enemy for seemingly unknown reasons. Continuity wise, the series takes place 35 years after the events of the original Macross series, clearly evident with the appearances of Maximillian and Milia, the first human-Zentradi...coupling to come about from the original series.This particular entry in the Macross franchise has a good deal of infamy among its fans as such where many consider it the franchise\'s black sheep. In part, I can kind of see where these thoughts would come from. The first dozen or so episodes to the series are a bit on the repetitive side as Fire Bomber are doing a performance, Mylene and Basara get in some sort of argument, a Protodevlin attack occurs, Basara flies in on the scene in his Valkyrie to sing to the enemy, the enemy retreats after getting what they need and the cycle repeats. Basara is a bit of a shallow and difficult character to connect with as we have no clue why he is behaving as he does and he doesn\'t seem to have much dimension to his character either as he mostly comes off as a free-spirited and impulsive pacifist. Even throughout the entirety of the series, Macross 7 offers little exploration to Basara\'s character and the viewer has no clue what drives him to do what he wants. The majority of the Protodevlin are also rather shallow as villains and the quirks with some of them can border on obnoxious. Plus unlike the original series that had a ""real robot"" approach to the mecha genre with plenty of drama to milk, Macross 7 crosses into ""super robot"" territory with its more light-hearted mood and absurd ""power of song"" plot devices milked to combat alien threats capable of wiping out planets.In spite of the mentioned issues though, I would not necessarily consider this the worst offering in the Macross franchise in the same vain as forgettable entries in the franchise like Macross II or compressed film adaptations like Macross: Do You Remember Love? and the two Macross Frontier movies. The supporting cast in the series do rather well for the most part to carry along things in spite of how subpar things are with the series lead and the main conflict of the series. The series offers some nice exploration of Milia and Max\'s relationship as it has clearly been shown to degrade over the years in spite of the two gaining influential positions on the Macross 7 spacecraft and trying to raise their young teenage daughter, Mylene. Mylene\'s character also gets a good deal of development in the series as she tries handling the strain in her parents\' relationship, comes to grips with the hostilities of war when events in the series escalate and get in an implied love triangle with Basara and Gamlin. The majority of the side characters in the series involve those connected to Fire Bomber\'s performances or involved with the military yet relevant characters still get enough focus to show there are more to them than a simple archetype.The series also subverts some of the typical plot formulas you would expect from a Macross title. Outside of the ""super robot"" approach being milked, the love triangle dynamic that most titles in the franchise implement has a minimal presence despite the implications played up involving Mylene, Basara and Gamlin. The series is instead more focused on expressing its main themes of understanding and acceptance of others, the implied reasoning behind Basara\'s refusal to attack enemy forces when he rocks out in front of enemy forces. This message does lead to gradual developments with a number of the characters in the series as they come to understand why Basara had been behaving as he was during early episodes in the series and even leading some among the Protodevlin to switch sides when they come to understand Basara\'s intentions. As simple as the message may seem, Macross 7 still does well for the most part in expressing it through developments taking place throughout its run.Presentation wise, Macross 7 is a mixed bag. The visuals were obviously done with a cheap budget in mind as scenery shots and character designs are on the plain side and plenty of corners get cut with animation as shortcuts like reused frames and still shots are a regular occurrence here. The soundtrack milked by Fire Bomber is a nice change for the series as unlike the original Macross\' use of pop music, this series makes use of rock music. The energetic rock beats are fitting for the light-hearted mood given off by the series and the lyrics accompanying them fit in with the title\'s theme of understanding and acceptance. Only low point with the soundtrack is that there are points in the series where it gets repetitive as some of the same songs get recycled until new ones are composed for later episodes in the title\'s run.Overall, I guess I could say my thoughts of Macross 7 as a whole are somewhat mixed and I think it\'s infamy among Macross fans may be overblown. While rather generic and repetitive in aspects of its premise and characters, the series still offered up some fresh aspects to the typical Macross plot formula, an engaging supporting cast, an energetic rock soundtrack and a simple yet well executed exploration of its main themes. Your mileage may vary on how you perceive the series with how different it is from other installments in the Macross franchise. But I would advise that one should check out the full series to properly judge it instead of ditching it in early episodes due to their repetitive setup for plot. coupling to come about from the original series.This particular entry in the Macross franchise has a good deal of infamy among its fans as such where many consider it the franchise\'s black sheep.

But I would advise that one should check out the full series to properly judge it instead of ditching it in early episodes due to their repetitive setup for plot.', 'I\'m going to try to remain as objective as possible in this review, but it\'s fair to mention beforehand that this IS my favourite show, however I am well aware of it\'s flaws. This review contains no spoilers.Macross 7 is absolutely nothing like it\'s predecessors, Super Dimensional Fortress Macross or Macross Plus. That is most likely why it gets such a bad rep - people went in expecting what is basically the opposite of what they got. Macross 7 is a heavily character-driven show and it takes it\'s time away from the plot to really develop it\'s characters, which is something I personally thought SDF...and Plus criminally lacked.-STORY-The premise of Macross 7 is that an unknown alien species tries to take what\'s essentially life energy from people, and while the military tries to find a way to destroy these eldritch abominations, Basara, our hero, only wants them to listen to his songs, which carry a message he wants everyone to hear and heed. The plot goes into some bizarre directions and makes some choices you could only see in anime.I found it very unique and while the pacing suffers in some places, the story that this show is telling is still very entertaining and definitely makes me excited (and worried) to see what happens next.In a story like this, you will most likely be able to predict how it will end, but it\'s the journey there that takes many interesting turns.Kawamori, the creator of Macross, has stated that he wasn\'t happy with how he ended the first show, as despite the power of music, it was still the weapons that ended up saving the day. He decided to fix that problem in Macross 7, having music be the sole saviour in the end.The series does have a lot of what most would consider filler episodes, but I firmly stand my ground when I say that it\'s those episodes that really make you care for the cast. The shows starts off mostly focusing on the band and their band-related shenanigans, and it slowly develops as things start getting more and more dire.For me, it\'s Basara\'s character and his actions that really make the story, as he\'s such an unusual protagonist. It\'s often hard to guess what he\'ll do next, but one thing is for certain; he will definitely jump right into the fray and yell his signature ""LISTEN TO MY SONG!!!"" before he drops some of the sickest riffs in the entire Macross franchise.-ART-Since most of the budget in this show went into music, the animation suffers for it, but I\'d say it was a worthy exchange.There\'s a lot of reused footage, and I mean a LOT of it, and some animations definitely look off. For a music-focused show, the animations the characters have on stage are quite sub-par.However, the art style itself is perfect for the show, as it allows for some very subtle yet strong expressions, which suits the often inexpressive main character a lot. Occasionally the animators decided to drop some really fun and cartoony expressions as well, which made the characters even more lovable.Colour-wise, the show also delivers REALLY well, as it\'s very bright and colourful, which is another thing I appreciated from an artistic standpoint.Lastly, Haruhiko Mikimoto\'s character designs are absolutely beautiful.This show definitely has some of my favourite anime character designs, especially with Sivil and of course Basara, who\'s look is absolutely iconic and I don\'t think anything about it could be done better than it is - absolute retro perfection. I think this show by far has the best character designs in the Macross franchise when it comes to colour, recognition and just the right amount of detail.-MUSIC-Fire Bomber has became my favourite band before I even watched the anime, and they were the reason I got interested in the first place. As if the songs themselves don\'t already sound fantastic, having a very 80s-90s rock feel to them, Yoshiki Fukuyama as Basara\'s singing voice really sets the songs on fire.In the show, Fire Bomber\'s music has the ability to restore people\'s life energy.I would believe it if someone told me it can do that in real life too.Lyrically, most of Basara\'s songs carry a message of togetherness, determination and better future. There isn\'t a single negative or sad song in their entire discography and even the most melancholic ballad of his carries a powerfully positive message.I can\'t really speak for Mylene\'s songs however, I found her voice to be a little bit weak and not the best match for Fukuyama\'s incredibly powerful vocals, but that might just be my personal preference as I tend to heavily swing towards upbeat and loud music.Another downside to the music might be that the same songs are used over and over and I can see that annoying some people. New songs are added to the show as it progresses, but the shows starts off with only about 3-4 songs at first.-CHARACTERS-What makes the protagonist Basara Nekki so interesting and unique is, that character-wise he\'s pretty much everything your standard protagonist isn\'t. He\'s not a fighter, at least not in the traditional sense. He\'s a pacifist that sticks to his ideals through hell and back. He\'s not very charismatic and is actually pretty bad with people, and not in a comedic \'misunderstanding\' way; he\'s genuinely NOT a people person.He\'s extremely flawed, but his flaws are extremely important, as they reflect into his strengths. He\'s stubborn, but that\'s why he\'s determined. He\'s focused, but that\'s why he\'s dismissive. One couldn\'t work without the other, making him a really well rounded and realistic character.He\'s also an artist and an introvert, and that\'s what struck me the most. Being an artist and an introvert as well, I found myself understanding exactly where Basara comes from in most cases, and I think this is where most of the issues people have with Basara come from; it might be hard to like him if you can\'t understand his VERY realistic artistic perspective.It\'s not just Basara who\'s an impeccably written character; the supporting cast is equally interesting and lovable. By the time the show comes to an end, I loved nearly every character.A complaint this show often gets is the amount of filler, however it\'s that filler that ends up making you love the cast so much. Especially the main three characters (Basara, Gamlin and Mylene) get some really good character development and three entirely different and very well handled character arcs; A flat character arc, a growing up character arc, and a finding oneself character arc. All three types of arcs are equally valid and interesting and keep the character\'s stories diverse.-OVERALL-I found Macross 7 extremely enjoyable, fun and emotional, as it has a good balance of everything that makes a show great. It has comedy, character development, intense action, unique and creative ideas, great character designs, emotional moments executed so well that i get goosebumps just thinking about them, a cathartic ending, it made me care about what happens next, and it made me eager to rewatch the show as soon as possible - three times within the year of discovering it.The core message of the show is to stick to your ideals and never give up (classy!), and I think that it\'s length, as much as people tend to criticise it, plays into that a lot. Basara suddenly becomes a much stronger character when you realize that pretty much every episode up until later in the series is considered a failure in his eyes. The guy literally fails and fails and fails continuously and hardly ever wavers because he\'s just that stubborn and 100% convinced that he\'ll succeed eventually. Giving up is not even remotely an option. There\'s a reason why \'Try Again\' is the title of the song that saves the galaxy.The show also carries a strong message for all the artists, which is to let loose and create from your soul and from your raw feelings. Be true to yourself and put yourself into your art. People will notice when your art is genuine. This I can most certainly say is true, from my own experience.All in all, this is one of those shows that I am incredibly grateful to have found as it resonated with me on a very personal level. I found Basara to be one of the best characters I\'ve ever seen, his music is exactly what I need in my life, and his story makes me want to keep going no matter what life throws at me.I truly hope that other people can find such joy in this show, because I want people to feel as good and as happy as I felt when I watched it.Thank you for reading and peace out,-neonUFO and Plus criminally lacked.-STORY-The premise of Macross 7 is that an unknown alien species tries to take what\'s essentially life energy from people, and while the military tries to find a way to destroy these eldritch abominations, Basara, our hero, only wants them to listen to his songs, which carry a message he wants everyone to hear and heed.

I found Basara to be one of the best characters I\'ve ever seen, his music is exactly what I need in my life, and his story makes me want to keep going no matter what life throws at me.I truly hope that other people can find such joy in this show, because I want people to feel as good and as happy as I felt when I watched it.Thank you for reading and peace out,-neonUFO', 'Fanatic pacifist hippy mc who doesn\'t care how many innocent people and ""asshole"" soldiers have to die so he can keep forcing people to listen to his singing in the middle of battle. He repeatedly intereferes with the elimination of the enemy because he is convinced his singing will make everyone buddy buddy. One of the most annoying MCs, he is right and everyone else is wrong, he does whatever he wants, no one can tell him what to do, such a rebel!And it doesn\'t help that they made like 4 songs for him for 49 episiodes and he keeps repeating the same one for...the first 20 or so episodes. While the scenes are also repeated, they reused a lot of scenes to the point that sometimes you can\'t tell if it\'s a flashback or not. the first 20 or so episodes.

I have loved you ever since I first watched Escaflowne. The way you drew mechas and created characters that felt real, that acted with emotion. The way you handled personal character development, and the impact of every movement a mech would make, the fluidity of a valkyrie switching to flight mode, gerwalk, or battroid.  I would do anything for you. I wish it were possible to freeze time so I would never have to watch you pass. You had a rough childhood but you never gave up hope. You are amazing, even void of...the anime world, I have no doubt that you are a great husband/father. I forever fear and dread the day that comes when you and I will both no longer be part of this world at the same time. I would sacrifice my own life if it were the only thing that could make you direct a new Macross show in cel-animation. You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember the first time I watched Macross Plus and my heart was broken into a million pieces. Although some people may not like your work, I will always hold it dear.  I wanted you to return home, and you did, but unfortunately my love couldn\'t harbor with modern day Macross or Basquash or Aquarion.  I was crying, I was bawling, yet I remembered these words that changed my life forever, ""Dedicated to you, our future pioneers"". Not only have you changed the world of anime, mecha, the culture as a whole, but you\'ve forever made a lasting impact on my life and the ideology that I personally believe in. As I watch you get older every year, sadness befalls me knowing that our days are limited but you will always be my GOAT.

MacrossSome time ago, circa 2012 I decided I wanted to watch the original Japaneses Macross series, as all I had watched before was the heavily edited Robotech, some friends advised me that Macross was a good watch, so I decided to give it a try, what I found out was a masterful crafted tale of romance, drama, comedy and self discovery that I have seen just a couple of times before with shows like code geass, eureka seven and full metal alchemist, Macross blew me away with excitement so, of course a wanted to see what the franchise had to offer, I was...super exited to dive in on this amazing universe and experience new adventures after the final credits rolled for SDF Macross, so I watched the next one, Macross plus and OH BOY was it good !!!! at that point my excitement for the series was beyond comprehension, first series was GREAT and its follow up Macross Plus was UBER GREAT , what can possible go wrong with the series ?? Macross 7 that is ...Ok so Macross 7 takes place decades after the original series as mankind is expanding to next horizons in space in order to preserve the human race in case another attack like the one that happened on the first series exterminates humanity. We are aboard a giant ship crossing the universe looking for a suitable new home in command of captain Maximilian Jenius (yes, the awesome pilot from the first series who looks inexplicable young after all the decades between the first series and Macross 7 )Then we have the music band that is a staple on the Macross franchise, which, is composed of a rude black guy, an almost non existing drums guy...or girl I don't know, with little to no personality, a beautiful girl a la Mimmei, who is also captain Jenius's daughter ( but not the one Jenius and Milla had on the original series, that one is not even in the show ) and then we have .... Basara... our main protagonist who is an spoiled brad who thinks he is super special and that he can solve every problem by singing his pop/rock songs ... IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE!!! ... clearly inspired by Lin Mimmey from the first series, however, while Mimmey warmed the hearts of humans and zentradi unknowingly, Basara is constantly trying to make people listen to his songs and to like them by force, he goes in the middle of an space battle with his guitar controlled mech ( yes it is as stupid as it sounds ) only to get frustrated at people not listening to his songs. it takes little time before you start hating on this guy, however, I'll have to admit some of his songs are actually catchy.Then we have the animation... oh boy oh boy.. while the first Macross was very inconsistent with the animation ( some times it looked great for the time, some other times it looked horrible complete with badly draw faces ) it has the excused of being an 1982 anime and for the time, it accomplishes some very impressing animation sometimes. then we have Macross plus, while obviously a high budget OVA series with fantastic animation it came out on 1994 with animation that was very ahead for its time ( even for a high budget ova series standard ) then we have Macross 7, of course it didn't had a great budget and it was proposed as a long series with more than 40 chapters but its unexcusable at how bad the animation can get . Let me tell you something that happened to me by chapter 5 or 6 of the series. On the second battle against the aliens on space the anime started to used the same exact animations they used during the first battle, whole scenes were literally re used from that first battle to the point I didn't know if I was watching a flash back or new events, that was lazy and very mediocre and it wasn't only that time, reused scenes were used during almost all the chapters I endure while watching this abomination.Overall this series killed the franchise for me as I did some research Macross 7's story is very important to the Macross universe expanding over movies, manga and Ovas, so if I wanted to continue watching the next series on the Macross franchise I needed to finish this garbage and that is something I can't see myself doing unfortunately ( although some have told me the newer series are not all that great )It is a real shame I really wanted to like this show but that was nearly impossible and my love for the series will remain split between the original, Macross plus and Macross 0 ( prequel to the original ) super exited to dive in on this amazing universe and experience new adventures after the final credits rolled for SDF Macross, so I watched the next one, Macross plus and OH BOY was it good !!!! at that point my excitement for the series was beyond comprehension, first series was GREAT and its follow up Macross Plus was UBER GREAT , what can possible go wrong with the series ??

It's shamelessly and unapologetically absurd. But how does Macross 7 stack up taken on its own terms?It's almost like a Magical Girl series with a male lead instead; Basara attempts to bring his message of peace to the universe through song and his skills as a guitarist in the band Fire Bomber. Like in all Macross music is used to move the masses. He's selfish, stubborn, single-minded, and usually takes his bandmates for granted. Yet...it's this very nature which makes it plausible he'll succeed by sheer force of will, due to the show's larger-than-life logic.Over the course of the series he makes groupies swoon, a flower girl with no dialogue constantly stalks him, and a space vampire is driven to euphoria simply by his love of rocking out; yet he remains oblivious to it all, focused on his ideals to the point of single-minded obsession. Unfortunately, we learn almost nothing about what led him to become this way, and most of what we do learn comes quite late, which leaves him rather hollow yet simultaneously provides a certain mystique. Granted, this is also likely to leave the audience distanced from him. Still, I'm certain he's the type some will happily project themselves onto.Next we have our bassist Mylene, who's actually easier to relate to since her history's at least better fleshed out, being the daughter of Max and Miria from the original series, and she also maintains a more approachable demeanor. What also helps is that she forms a stronger bond with many of the cast members than our protagonist. In many ways I'd consider her the real main character. However, she rarely moves the plot directly, serving more as a catalyst for other cast members, who tend to either pine after her or try to direct her life.Then we have Ray, an older, wiser, level-headed musician who often acts as the voice of reason. Sadly other than a small bit of exploration about his military history he's never focused on much, despite having one of the more endearing personalities. I feel his more down-to-earth demeanor could have helped anchor a show rife with overt silliness.Lastly we have Veffidas, the sole fresh representative of the Ventradi race of any note. Sadly she only has a few lines and most of her 'characterization' consists of randomly drumming on whatever's currently available. Like so many things in this show she's wasted potential.Another notable character is Gamlin, who represents the military, and serves as a foil to our protagonist. The straight-edged soldier who broadens his mind is a common archetype, but it's executed pretty well here, as he shifts from a straight-laced mindset to one that's less rigid. Sadly one of his most climatic scenes is quickly undone for the sake of a happy ending. Granted, I do feel the series means to leave its audience feeling upbeat by the end.As for the antagonists, most of them are quite one-note. Our main villain Geperuniti is mostly a standard evil overlord type who only stands out due to his androgynous nature. Goram and Zomb never rise above the level of a gimmick, although their designs are suitably creepy. Grabil amounts to little more than a typical monster with a special ability.Gavil is probably the henchman with the most recurring presence yet is simultaneously the most annoying one; he constantly draws comparisons to how beautiful destruction and the like is until he completely wears out his welcome, but refuses to die.Sivil is an improvement as she at least forms a stronger connection with our protagonist, and is far less grating overall, despite her rather shrill voice and obsessive nature. However to my surprise, my favorite of the bunch was Gigile, who I believed would be a throwaway stock henchman; yet he has a rather dynamic arc despite his smaller amount of screentime.It's also nice to see characters like Max, Miria, and Exsedol return, but at the same time they feel somewhat underused. There are also some cute nods to Minmay's continual impact on the Macross universe and the fans she inspired. Still, I'd rather a show concentrated on building fresh ideas rather than simply rehashing what proved popular the first time, so overall I feel confining them to the supporting cast was the right move. The slow start ultimately pays off, as it allows us to see how the world has changed, down to colonies trapped within bubbles which float across space. It's quite a striking image which leaves one with a sense of wonder, that helps to further define the mood this show wishes to create.At 49 episodes the show overstays its welcome and could have easily condensed its ideas into less than half the runtime. Couple this with repeated stock animation and it can really test your patience, so I wouldn't recommend marathoning this show. However it has the charm of a flashy music video which exudes coolness, due to its colorful designs, archetypal characters, and earworm soundtrack, so once you learn to roll with it you may actually come to find it inspirational. Simply learn to roll with all the blatant silliness and it may leave you satisfied. I know after I finished my watch it felt like I could take on the entire world!Addendum: What about the spin-offs/side stories?Macross 7 Encore: Almost mandatory viewing. Three unbroadcasted episodes of the series which fill in vital background on Basara and Ray's relationship. There's also some notable development for Miria and to a lesser extent Veffidas. Easily the best of the extensions.Macross 7 The Galaxy is Calling Me: Listed as a movie, but it may as well be an episodic side plot. It's a stock story of our protagonist befriending a youth that idolizes them, and a chance meeting with an enemy soldier who turns out to have more in common with our protagonist than either would think. The rock out scene at the end is cute. Watchable but disposable.Macross Dynamite 7: A sequel to the main series which is pretty much a Moby Dick/Ahab story. You know, lone vengeful guy, only here he happens to be an alien, and his prey is a group of space whales. There's also what seems to be an environmental message where Basara runs afoul of poachers. It's harmless but adds very little to the series.Macross 7 specials: Tiny vignettes that are mostly used for comic relief. The highlight is getting to see Veffidas before she was Micronized (Shrunken to human-size) street fighting.

there\'s alot of bs.I\'ve bit the bullet and started watching Macross from the very beginning and completely... almost completely love it.The review:The art is really cool and lovable but art reuse could have been toned down but other than that, the music is awesome and great to listen to, the characters are all lovable (almost) and developed well, the story is captivating and continuing in expanding in space. Everything* is really good, honestly, you should watch it, even if you\'re not into...old anime or old art styles (Like me). Some experiences are worth the compromise of your comfort.(Wow wth, how did I come up with that, I\'m convincing myself x\'D)****TLDR****Ok, enough review of all that stuff. Here\'s the punch.Everything is greatBUTthe drive of Basara is driving me insane.When I encounter a character who believes fighting is not the answer, will get in the way and will sacrifice thousands of innocents for their way of ""peace"" to me is like the insane person who becomes the accessory to mass murderer. I\'m not going to butter it. That is Basara.Peace is only possible because someone has defended that peace. Fighting is always going to be inevitable because there\'s so many different kinds of people that no one is going to completely understand each other - not that completely understanding each other brings peace either, so saying peace purely without fighting (Basara) types of characters drive me insane.Review/rant done. Will pick this up this anime at a later date, still love it except 1 character. old anime or old art styles (Like me).

Will pick this up this anime at a later date, still love it except 1 character.', 'A direct sequel to the original 1982 Super Dimensional Fortress Macross, comes twelve years later in the form of Marcross 7. Studio Nue (Macross, Macross Plus, Dirty Pair) with the help of director Tetsuro Amino (Iria Zeiram the Animation) and music by Yoko Kanno (Macross Plus) set the tone perfectly for the anime. Yoko Kanno must be given so much credit because music is so key to Macross 7, without it, this anime would downright fail.Taking place about 35 years after the events of the original, in 2045 a colony spacecraft and its’ fleet sets off into space for colonization. During said journey, the fleet...encounters an alien race that sucks the spirit out of life, but the anime tends to focus more on a rock band called Fire Bomber. In the band are the main characters of Nekki Basara, Mylene Jenius, Ray Lovelock, and Veffidas Feaze. Why focus on the band and not the military? Well, Macross 7 is all about Nekki Basara and his journey to get everyone to listen to his music and in turn, music will stop war.For characters, Nekki Basara is Macross 7. He is short temptered, knows what he wants, and singing for others is what he lives for, a good character overall. Mylene Jenius (daughter of Max and Millia; captain and mayor of Macross 7) is also a good character with decent development for a 14 year old, while the rest of the characters in the show are in their 20s to 50s (technically). The portrayal of age is pretty hard to judge and other needed character developments are left alone for the sake of more music.Issues with Macross 7 begin and end with re-hashing animation. Very quickly Macross 7 continues re-hashing fight scenes, lines between characters, and even the good music becomes repetitive. There are two scenes (notable) where the music hit perfectly setting the stage and really gets the heart pumping, but overall, the good music of Fire Bomber was there as background. Where there could have been a deeper plot, or even on the same level as the original Macross, Macross 7 falls just short of a fantastic show making it only a good anime. encounters an alien race that sucks the spirit out of life, but the anime tends to focus more on a rock band called Fire Bomber. In the band are the main characters of Nekki Basara, Mylene Jenius, Ray Lovelock, and Veffidas Feaze. Why focus on the band and not the military?

In fact it cannot even be called a sequel, it practically runs parallel (non-canon) to the timeline of events in the original series (after the zentraedi arc but before the protoculture masters arc).To me macross is is both nostalgia and a standard for space anime stories because it was the first space anime I ever watched. Macross 7 is an insult to whatever reputation the original macross series built. Macross 7 completely misinterpreted the relationship of music to the...macross universe taking the idea that music is literally a weapon humans can use to an absurd level. I consider the movie ""Robotech: Shadow Chronicles"" to be the last known canon sequel to macross (Robotech series). After that every sequel to date is just a parallel story to the original, a spin-off so to speak. This knowledge is the only consolation for me when it comes to the horrible mistake that is ""Macross 7"".Following ""Macross 7"", another spin-off was made in 2007 ""Macross Frontier"" that resembled ""Macross 7"" in background story but the plot was completely revised to make it more consistant with the original ""macross"" universe (including getting rid of the human faced abomination in Macross 7 and the gothic fantasy-ish storyline). The human colony ship can be recognized from Macross 7 but the background story of ""Macross Frontier"" completely denied any connection with ""Macross 7"" (unless colony ships are renamed during their journey). It is also a spin-off running parallel to the original series timeline in approximately the same time period as ""Macross 7"". In my opinion ""Macross Frontier"" was a revised ""Macross 7"" to reconcile the sequel to the original series in theme and core storyline. I believe ""Macross frontier"" redeemed the series from the horrible blunder of ""Macross 7"" and saved macross series from becoming a joke due to ""Macross 7"".Incase anyone wants to watch macross series in chronological order here is what I consider the best timeline arrangement:-------<MAIN STORY TIMELINE>----<SPIN-OFF SEQUEL TIMELINE>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------.......................................................................................................Macross Zero................................................................................... .............|......................................................................................................v.........................................................................................SDF Macross_____________________________________..........(Robotech: Zentraedi arc)............................|...................|.............. .............|.................................................v...................|...........................v..........................................Macross 7.............|...............Robotech: Sentinals(movie).............................................v...........................|................................................................Macross Frontier.............v.....................................................................|................Robotech: Untold Story(movie)........................................v.............................|.................................................................Macross Delta.....................v............................................................................................Robotech(Masters arc, Invid arc).......................................................................|..........................................................................................................v.............................................................................................Robotech: Shadow Chronicles (Movie).................................................. macross universe taking the idea that music is literally a weapon humans can use to an absurd level.

Véanlo no se van a arrepentir', 'As many, I grew up in the early-90s watching re-runs of Robotech, which eventually led me to now the original source of it\'s first generation: Super Dimension Fortress Macross. I watched (on pirated VHSs, of course) Macross Plus, II, DYRL and Flashback 2012, but I never got into myself to watch Macross 7. Why? Easy. I found it too cheesy for my liking, too ""Super Robot"". The first image I had from 7 was the robotic humanoid face of Basara\'s Valkyrie after transforming which inspired me to NOT watch this series until this day, twenty years later.And what can I say about Macross 7? Well,...it\'s a solid... 7. It\'s enjoyable if silly. The characters can be funny, even if they\'re also very flat. And the story is...well, passable. Honestly, don\'t watch Macross 7 waiting for something as serious as the original Macross or Macross Plus; or even as interesting as Frontier. Macross 7 is to the Macross franchise what ZZ was to Gundam: a slow-starting, funny mess you can enjoy if you shot down your expectations.And honestly, I don\'t regret watching it, even if I\'m sure I\'m not watching it again in the future. It\'s a \'good\' series, but not memorable. The character desings are passable: Basara is the shonen archetype, while Mylene is your typical Japanese, tsundere, eye-candy, anime-girl. The mecha? Not that passable. The enemies? Laughable. But the series can be enjoyed nonetheless. Why?Because, Oh, My God, this series must have the BEST soundtrack in the whole franchise. It\'s not a secrete Fire Bomber\'s rock songs are good, but I never expected falling in love with this band after watching this series. Since the moment I started watching the first episode I haven\'t stopped listening to its soundtrack at home, in the car, at my job or even by humming it to myself. The soundtrack alone made this series worth watching. Sorry Minmay, Sheryl and even you, my beloved Sharon Apple, but nothing surpasses some good 90s JRock (by the way, as I wrote this I\'m yet to watch Macross Delta, but I don\'t think it has a better soundtrack, especially because I\'m not a fan of the Japanese Idol culture).So, in the end, do I recommend this series? Yes... and no. Yes if you have the patience to watch a very slow-starting series which will give you some memorable moments. And No if you want to watch an outstanding mecha anime based on Macross. If you are in latter, go watch something else from this franchise. Though, I don\'t know, maybe 7 will surprise you.Fire! it\'s a solid... 7. It\'s enjoyable if silly.

How could a classic series with great story, brilliant writing and fantastic design turn into such a major lack of taste show for 9 year olds? The quality is so poor it makes me wonder why they even called “Lovers Again” filler, when the supposed canon material is just as bad or worse.It is almost surprising that Shoji Kawamori himself partook in the story and designs of these characters when they turned out to be so uninventive and stupid. Mechanical designs seem more appropriate for Digimon, while...character designs are the work of a 12-year old. The story is childish and absurd leaving us lost. I cannot help but facepalm during every episode. This nightmare continues for 50+ episodes, four of which have only minor developments.The animation is lazy and does not live up to the quality of the opening sequence. The music soundtrack is almost absent, with just four horrible tracks that are played to death in every episode.Ultimately, this show completely misses the point of Macross and insults it repeatedly before proceeding to make itself even more embarrassing. character designs are the work of a 12-year old.

If you don’t watch the show, at least listen to Holy Lonely Night.Aside from the music, Macross 7’s other strengths are found in a cast of mostly enjoyable characters. But in everything else, it fails spectacularly. I’ll start with the cons, then the pros:Cons:Animation. Seriously, the laughable jank from SDF Macross was superior to the reused animation and static mech shots. It’s horrible. Hey, at least it does include a couple moments of SDF jank with a certain running sequence.Ages. Anime is no stranger to really stupid ages, but this should confound anyone. Mylene is 14. It makes no sense. And once you...watch the show, you’ll understand just how weird of a decision it was. Mylene actually acts like a teenager, but they really should have made her at least 18. Considering she lives on her own and drives a car, plus is being setup for an arranged marriage, it feels like the original script featured an older Mylene. And it’s not just Mylene’s age. Ray is 28, but in flashbacks it’s clear he should be much older. Most ages in the show would make much more sense if they were increased by 4-10 years, but it’s anime :/Fan Service. Some fan service is fine. The orgasmic reaction from a certain character didn’t ruin the show, even if it felt out of place. Millia in a swimsuit. No problems with that. No, the worst fan service comes from how often this show pervs on Mylene (often after emphasizing that she’s 14). Specifically in the way that it does. There’s an episode where a fan (who is a child) of Mylene is upset and flips her skirt. And when she gets angry at him as he continues to be a nuisance and he runs away, everyone tells her she’s in the wrong and should go after him. And then the episode ends on the fan flipping her skirt again. This is terrible even for 90’s anime. This might be the worst, but there’s other very creepy fan service in the show as well.Villains. The vast majority of them are annoying. Gepelnitch, Gigil, and Sivil were the only tolerable ones.Basara, the main character. At least he's not an alcoholic that wants to date his cousin. Basara doesn’t explain himself. He refuses to work as a team, which as a show with a strong band theme, is kind of ironic. He’s also an irresponsible dick. In one episode, he’s busy singing. When ordered to repair a part on a civilian ship with 1mil+ people that will be destroyed within minutes if the repair isn’t finished, he refuses. The plot caters to him and bends over backwards to always make sure he’s right.Love triangle. It's funny that Macross II is so reviled, when Macross 7 pulls off the same love triangle. At least II’s actually made some sort of sense (which is almost none, but greater than zero).Story/Consistency. The story is horrible. In SDF, they balanced the necessity and horrors of war. Here, let’s just save everything with music! That can work in its own fun way, but they fail to pull it off at the most important points. The show drags in a lot of places. Eventually, it borrows from the worst parts of tokusatsu and Sailor Moon, fusing it into a mech show. A lot of plot points are dropped, there’s tons of very obvious logical inconsistencies, etc. Still better than the last 9 episodes of SDF though.Pros:Characters. Gamlin and Mylene steal the show. But there’s other great characters too. From the return of Max and Millia (even if they are very, very underused), to Veffi, Ray, Guvava, and Flower Girl. But all of these characters are underused so we can hear Basara shout some nonsense about music. Millia and Max are the worst of the wasted potential, as their storyline is never properly explored. Also, what happened to their 6 other children? Did it turn out that tossing babies was a bad idea?Hype Moments. Somewhat let down by the animation (though usually not terrible in these scenes), the show definitely delivers on some great moments. The first time the giant missile speaker is used comes to mind. Very cool scene. There’s even a decent death scene for one character.Soundtrack. The music is superb. Many great tracks, and with both singers for Basara and Mylene for many of them, it’s made even better. The show’s directing unfortunately doesn’t always make great use of them (Basara’s vocals appearing in Mylene’s songs when he’s not even around for instance). Holy Lonely Night just blows away an already perfect soundtrack.Overall:The story can certainly be fun and entertaining at points. But most of the time it meanders through poorly animated mech fights where the villain always flies away. In order to prove that pacifism is the only way, you’re basically delivered a story that literally disables any options to the contrary, and makes those with more balanced views out to be comically stupid or evil.The characters, when actually allowed to get around the black hole that is Basara’s personality, tend to shine. Gamlin and Mylene really grow and change throughout the series. The fact that the series actually made me like Flower Girl and Veffie with so little invested into them drives home just how many great characters it had, all of which were sacrificed for Basara. Because ONLY Basara can save the day.The end is just sort of there. Various threads are left hanging, and it leaves you wondering why the hell you watched this in the first place. Everytime there was a great episode, it'd be followed by three bad or mediocre ones. It also seems like it’s a little too busy dunking on Macross II, when that show’s overall writing is far more nuanced than 7 can ever dream of being. But even at just being a fun, music saves the day show, Macross 7 still fails in the end to deliver a satisfying conclusion to almost any plot point.This show also fails to understand DYRL on a fundamental point. Ai Oboete Imasuka is effective not because Minmay sang it; it’s because it’s an old, forgotten love song that people at one point loved. There’s absolutely nothing special about it, being one of the most basic parts of culture, and yet it has that strong of an impact. And Minmay sings it beautifully, but it could have been any other singer that could deliver a simple message of love and culture in their singing. In 7, it’s only Basara who can truly reach those heights and move anything; Sure, a few others can generate power with their music, but it’ll never be enough. ONLY Basara. Bomber!I really struggle to encapsulate how torn I feel on this show. This would be my favorite Macross show (animation aside) had the writing not been atrocious. I did enjoy it a lot at points despite my heavy criticism, but for me it just really flopped in the end. Had the story not catered to Basara and actually had him grow like Gamlin or Mylene, it may have turned out amazing. But it squandered the potential of its main character, and despite its other flaws, that’s what ultimately kills a lot of my enjoyment of the show. On the other hand, it gave us the Pink Peckers. What more could we ask for? watch the show, you’ll understand just how weird of a decision it was. Mylene actually acts like a teenager, but they really should have made her at least 18.

Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41103/Koi_to_Yobu_ni_wa_Kimochi_Warui,"['This anime feels like watching Pepé Le Pew from Looney Tunes, but with the kitten falling in love with the skunk for no reason.In one line, it\'s a show trying hard to romanticize sexual harassment.This is the story of a creepy grown ass man romantically pursuing a high school girl by stalking, harassing and gaslighting her. His obsession starts by the simple fact that the girl apparently has been the only non-shallow woman he has met that rejected his creepy advances, so he immediately sets on a mission to conquer her whether she likes it or not.Even though the MC girl already told him to...stop and that she\'s uncomfortable with the unwelcome attention, the male MC still continued relentlessly after that. Some of the creep\'s actions include: multiple unsolicited phone calls even late at night, sending unwanted gifts, pressuring for dating, touching the girl while she was sick sleeping, etc.The second harasser is the male MC\'s sister, who acts as a plot device supporting her creep brother and providing him with all kinds of intel info on her ""friend"" and setting up convenient scenarios so he can prey on the MC girl easier (e.g. literally gave out her friend\'s home address since episode 1, brought the brother\'s gifts to school, tricked her into giving out her phone number, schemed all kinds of settings to facilitate their encounters so they would appear as ""coincidences"", etc).There are even more red flags when observing the male MC character\'s behavior that provides a clear view on the kind of toxic relationship he\'s pursuing, just to list a few:1) VIOLENT: He had no trouble in assaulting an adult woman in a public place and threatening her with further physical abuse.2) POSSESSIVE: Got triggered just by the fact that a classmate was talking to MC girl and felt the need to act in a threatening way towards the teenage boy. His own male friend is aware of this, who is seen SECRETLY hanging out with the female MC admitting that he himself would be in trouble with the creep if he knows they\'re hanging out. Not being able to casually hang out or even talk with friends sounds like the depiction of the worst type of toxic relationship.3) MANIPULATIVE: Despite the fact that the creep is the one harassing the inexperienced girl ignoring her requests to stop, when the girl tried her best to take a strong stand against his behavior and called him out, all it took was him doing a pikachu surprised face to make her feel guilty resulting in HER APOLOGIZING TO HIM. This is not a light observation, as the creep was literally shown rejoicing himself in the fact that she was the one who apologized to him. That\'s some dark stuff right there for those who can see past the shojo-esque colorful backgrounds and cute faces.As for the rest of characters, most of them seem to have been designed by the author to create an unrealistic sexual harassment fantasy where all the society surrounding the abuser is happy about his actions. Just as an example, you have the girl\'s mother who was being enthusiastic about all the unwanted gifts (instead of the more realistic approach of being suspicious/worried) and also not caring at all even after she found out the dude sending them is a grown ass man... instead, the mother was instantly added to the male MC\'s harem.The animation is nothing special, just alright and the art style is average. Nothing really stands out.Sound quality was awful mostly with the character voices. The opening and ending songs are quite cool though, which thankfully can be purchased and enjoyed independently without having to watch this anime.Overall, this looks like a typical trash josei story with an abusive male MC where the author went overboard with the harassment fantasy and destroyed all credibility of the world depicted, converting this supposed romance comedy into something mediocre that is neither funny nor romantic in the slightest. stop and that she\'s uncomfortable with the unwelcome attention, the male MC still continued relentlessly after that.

Not being able to casually hang out or even talk with friends sounds like the depiction of the worst type of toxic relationship.3) MANIPULATIVE: Despite the fact that the creep is the one harassing the inexperienced girl ignoring her requests to stop, when the girl tried her best to take a strong stand against his behavior and called him out, all it took was him doing a pikachu surprised face to make her feel guilty resulting in HER APOLOGIZING TO HIM. This is not a light observation, as the creep was literally shown rejoicing himself in the fact that she was the one who apologized to him. That\'s some dark stuff right there for those who can see past the shojo-esque colorful backgrounds and cute faces.As for the rest of characters, most of them seem to have been designed by the author to create an unrealistic sexual harassment fantasy where all the society surrounding the abuser is happy about his actions. Just as an example, you have the girl\'s mother who was being enthusiastic about all the unwanted gifts (instead of the more realistic approach of being suspicious/worried) and also not caring at all even after she found out the dude sending them is a grown ass man... instead, the mother was instantly added to the male MC\'s harem.The animation is nothing special, just alright and the art style is average. Nothing really stands out.Sound quality was awful mostly with the character voices. The opening and ending songs are quite cool though, which thankfully can be purchased and enjoyed independently without having to watch this anime.Overall, this looks like a typical trash josei story with an abusive male MC where the author went overboard with the harassment fantasy and destroyed all credibility of the world depicted, converting this supposed romance comedy into something mediocre that is neither funny nor romantic in the slightest.', '""I don‘t regret what I did for him that day. As for what I said to him that day… I have nothing but regrets."" -Ichika Arima. What does the message of this quote from Ichika want to express? You have to watch the entire show to know. :)The show wouldn\'t be your realistic nor typical romantic comedy. But who cares. It\'s Anime. What seems like a weird and creepy show is a sweet and wholesome one.Ryou is a 27yo handsome office worker and is loose with women. After being saved by Ichika, a 17yo typical high schooler. He suddenly meets her again as his sister’s...best friend. Ryou being the usual womanizer, offered his body to Ichika as thanks. Ichika acted in disgust and reasoned out that she didn\'t help him in exchange for his body. This sparked something inside Ryou and he falls deeply in love with her. This starts the comedic one-sided love of Ryou for Ichika. As Ryou then pulls off his hilarious antics to express his love for Ichika. While Ichika thinks he is fooling around her with the kind of personality he has. But as it goes on, Ichika realizes Ryou\'s seriousness for her.The show can be annoying for others. But Koikimo is my kind of guilty pleasure. I view Ryou as a helpless person in love. Ryou is a good-looking guy, and every woman around him before treated him for his appearance. Ichika is the first person who treated him with goodwill and made him feel like that. Knowing that the vast age gap feels weird. The crush of Ryou has made him more helpless. This just makes me want to root for him.Ryou and Ichika\'s interactions are sweet and funny. It makes my heart flutter every time. The show is so underrated. People are disliking it because of Ryou\'s annoying behavior and the vast age gap. I personally love this show, although I know it isn\'t everyone\'s cup of tea. You should give it a watch! Don\'t mind the negative reviews. Give the first three episodes a try before you judge the show as a whole.The show is far off being a Masterpiece. The art isn\'t outstanding either. But this doesn\'t make Koikimo bad as it has its uniqueness and is good in its own way. Among other romance I\'ve watched, I like this kind of style.I can\'t count how many times I played the OP and ED in repeat. They are both SO GOOD, and they perfectly fit the mood of the show. My favorite this season. ♥ best friend. Ryou being the usual womanizer, offered his body to Ichika as thanks.

My favorite this season. ♥', '“You can’t judge another country by your country’s standards” A simple, yet oft forgotten message. Koikimo is a series that exemplifies the differences between the west and Japan in terms of entertainment. If you’re sensitive or not able to accept that fiction does not equate to reality, you should avoid this. If you are sensible and understand that you can enjoy a story, without necessarily agreeing with the premise and characters’ actions, this is a gold mine.Koikimo’s premise is truthfully a bit… odd, with the MC basically stalking the girl he likes, who happens to be a high school student and classmate of his little...sister, but it’s presented in such a way that makes you forget what’s even going on. Koikimo uses a really cute aestethic to hide a questionable premise, and does so very well in my opinion. Again, you don’t have to agree with what’s going on in a show to like it. It’s fiction, not a documentary.Shoujo Romance is my fave genre of LNs/animanga, so I check out any that air every season. I had no idea about this LN coming into the season and was immediately surprised by how much I love this damn show. In fact, it’s grown to be one of my faves. Ichika and Ryo’s relationship, while starting out in an unconventional way and with some weird circumstances, becomes very wholesome and downright adorable as the series progresses. Once the initial stalker phase ends, I liked the interactions between the two, a lot. Putting aside the age difference, their interactions and growth felt very organic to me and was the highlight of the show. The romance was well written and believable. It may not be socially acceptable, but things are not always black and white in life.In addtion to likeable main characters, Koikimo’s side cast was really good as well. A love rectangle of sorts begins to form at a certain point, and I thought it was navigated perfectly. In romcoms there’s always going to be someone getting their feelings hurt, but if you do it the right way it doesn’t hamper the experience. Koikimo certainly did that.Artistically, there’s nothing crazy or new going on design wise in the show, but I did really enjoy the bright colour palette throughout. I think it helped to create a cutsey atmosphere, in contrast to Higehiro, which ironically is the other series this season with a controversial premise. The OST is pretty solid as well as the OP and ED being bangers.In closing, I loved Koikimo. I’m not ashamed to say that. It’s not for everyone, but I encourage you to keep an open mind when watching not just this show, but any anime. You’re watching a medium that was created for people in a totally different society. There’s going to be things you don’t like or agree with, that’s ok. Luckily for me, once the show got going, it was easily my third fave show of the season and something I looked forward to on Mondays to start my week. I will certainly miss my fave ship of the season, but I’ll be checking out the manga and LN for more. Koikimo gets 10 out of 10. sister, but it’s presented in such a way that makes you forget what’s even going on.

Koikimo gets 10 out of 10.', '(TLDR Review at the bottom, as usual, thanks for reading.)Is Spongebob Squarepants an asshole for pissing off Squidward?Is Peppa Pig a douchebag for body-shaming her dad?Is Richard Watterson someone it would be better to kill due to his lack of support in society and being a somewhat bad parent to his children?I don\'t see how anything I have said above is legit criticism in any way other than the enjoyment factor. So I don\'t really understand why characters in Koikimo are getting hate for doing their roles.""Almost every single season nowadays, it seems there has to be a scapegoat. An anime which you are somehow...obliged to publically hate on or you\'ll be looked down upon by the community and no one will take you seriously.""To you, (1)4 years from now. Nothing has changed.The romance genre is prone to some easy hate, which is very understandable. Taking into consideration some questionable themes that like to pop up for no good reason, other than to maybe satisfy some guilty pleasure, it\'s no question why this genre can have its titles that derail from the norm so very easily. Also with anime having a large western audience, a clash of cultures is inevitable, which brings forward some interesting events. Koikimo is a suspect of such a case. And with such cases like Koikimo, it is easy to bash the show for what it brings for not aligning with moral standards, which ends up making it a victim of its own product, and something you don\'t really know is either good or bad due to the large magnitude of polarising viewpoints. Koikimo is said to be a ""disgusting anime"" as a reason to dislike it when really and truly, it is a somewhat disgusting anime. Hell, it is literally there in the title ""It\'s Too Sick to Call this Love"" is the translation for this anime title. I don\'t know what people thought they were watching when they thought it would be something trying to ""hide pedophilia"". In any case, I don\'t see how Koikimo is anything bad for something it brings forward, it is very much fine to dislike the premise and be on your way, but with different applications to morals in a fictional realm from everyone, it becomes very inconsistent to rate something on such a base. I intend to rate this on a normal basis for reasons of non-bias, so, let\'s get into it.Narrative:Koikimo\'s introduction is quite interesting, it starts off with philanderer, Ryo Amakusa, stumbling across Ichika Arima for dumb reasons are dumb. But then it takes a quick turn of events with Ryo going full simp mode on a high schooler girl he just met. For the most part, everything here is consistent here on out, in other words, there isn\'t any improvement or degrading in any sense, even in characters. Only the quirks of Koikimo actually differentiate this from anything I have seen, because otherwise, this is a pretty baseline for itself. I honestly can\'t go on and talk more about the story, because it plays out as every rom-com should. There honestly is nothing special here so I don\'t know what is the point of saying anything more about the story. You know, it works, doesn\'t really have any flaws but at the same time, it is no distinction and is generally something you find in the bunch.The characters are interesting. For a rom-com as described above, you\'d think the characters are pretty baseline too, and to some extent, not really. What I will say is that the characters are indeed baseline in anything that would link to personalities of initial bases, but honestly, I thought the character growth here was actually done very well. Seeing characters like Ryo get out of his damaging lifestyle and becoming a better person through Ichika was actually really nice to see, I suppose the character development is to be expected in something like Koikimo, but this was slightly different, with the age gap actually having a say in the relationship between the two. Ryo changed in ways that really made him think, even though he still has this creepy love for Ichika I do believe he understood what it meant for him to be with her. He is self-aware of what he is doing but is also in the irrational realm of love that makes him do questionable things. I can say this because his interactions with people like Arie, for example, isn\'t all one-nighter then sayonara, in other words, he has learnt to be a better person. It\'s an interesting development for the guy and all in all made for him to be quite interesting.Now I genuinely cannot say the same for people like the others. First, Ichika is your average rom-com girl character, honestly has no distinction other than her like some anime. You could say that this was smart in that some regular high school girl managed to change Ryo\'s mad life. But I refuse to believe that this story even dared to go to Shakespeare playing field. I mean, it could have though. Who knows. Anyways, Ichika is pretty basic, not much to say with her. The same goes for Rio, though her character is interesting, being a somewhat snarky observer. Tamaru is pretty average as well, being that kid who finds himself to be a rival. And Arie, who also finds herself to be a rival, a nice person with a cool interest in anime, but that is about it. Honestly, this lack of attention to characters is quite upsetting, but with this being a general standard rom-com with that one quirk to it, characters like these do fine, I suppose.Audiovisuals:For visuals, it is pretty box standard. What I will say is that the character design is ever so slightly strange, almost like its evolution went backwards to an older style. It\'s honestly not even that bad, but it is a new one, or do I call it an old one? Whatever it was, it was very easy to get used to and allowed for some cool original designs to some extent to have a watch too. But I mean it was still pretty box standard at the end of the day.Visuals is a funny one too. First off, OP and ED are actually really good, with the former being catchy, the latter being quite a nice little way to touch off with, both stick to me as well. OST is mid if you are wondering, nothing fancy here at all and it serves as only background music for ""in the moment"". The character voicing, however, for some reason, it sounded like someone forgot to filter out all the echos from the studio and just slapped the raw audio on the final product. Once you pick up on the odd-sounding, you will get used to it, and it isn\'t so annoying, but it was something pretty strange regardless. I\'ve seen numerous people talk about the same thing with the audio problem. With issues like that, which rarely happen in anime, it is something to criticise but doing so becomes a futile effort with how minuscule it actually matters to a wide audience. Everything is fine though.Enjoyment:This isn\'t the most entertaining thing to watch, and how you watch it matters as well, considering that I watched this weekly, it actually made my weeks slightly better waiting on what will become of everything towards the end, though, I should have guessed what would happen from the very start because no rom-com pulls any fast ones because they don\'t. In a universal sense, assuming you aren\'t offended by this two-dimensional cartoon\'s premise, Koikimo has its light-hearted moments, it has its wholesome moments, and generally just very chill, going with its vibe throughout the entire series.Overall - 6.6 (7)----------TLDR Review:Story - 6: Pretty generic rom-com type story, uses age-gap as a quirk to differentiate from others.Visuals - 6: Some kind of backwards character design that makes this look a little unique.Audio - 7: OP and ED are really good, OST is basic, character voices feel a little off due to technicalities.Characters - 7: Ryo is the most interesting character, everyone else is on the generic side of things.Enjoyment - 7: Light-hearted, a little wholesome, and just chill.Overall - 6.6 (7)----------Only a few seasonals keep me really intact for me to go to length as to watch it pretty much every week. For some odd reason, Koikimo was one of them, idk, it was really relaxing to watch every week I suppose. I didn\'t really watch anything else like Koikimo this season, even other titles I enjoyed a lot more. The human mind is a strange one, isn\'t it? Anyways, there goes another controversial anime. It was fun for the most part and I will probably read the manga in my spare time. At the end of the day, this creepy anime did a decent job at being creepy, but it was a different kind of creepy, something that didn\'t make me lose faith in humanity kinda creepy, and what matters is whether or not this is enjoyable for us.

So I leave off by saying, Koikimo is something I found somewhat fun.', ""Koikimo is dangerous because it uses cutesy art and rom-com cliches to hide what it's really about: A creepy adult man harassing and grooming a high school girl. The girl rejects the man, calls him disgusting, yet he continues to pursue her romantically and sexually. He takes pictures of her without consent, he visits her uninvited, he gets close to her mother, he flirts with her while she’s vulnerable and alone, he gives her tons of gifts, and he expects her love in return. Worst of all, it is targeted at teenagers. Not cute. Very fucked up.The art, animation, and sound are terrible too. Even...though there is barely any animation, the character's faces morph like melting plastic. Their body proportions are constantly changing depending on the angle. Rather than using verbal dialogue, at times they copy text boxes straight from the manga and paste them on screen. The music sounds like nails scraping a chalkboard or simplistic stock elevator tunes played on repeat. I respect the voice actors’ effort but the audio processing sounds awful. It's like you’d expect from a low-budget OVA, not a TV anime.Every character in this show is a banal archetype, and they act in very strange ways. The generic female protagonist is friends with the businessman’s sister, which is how they got introduced. The sister is very aware of her brother’s behavior yet she nudges them together like cupid. She tells the man her address, gives him chances to be alone with her, and never warns her. For example, one time the sister said, “My brother’s insane in more ways than one, so just be on the lookout.” She said this to a male classmate who is in love with the female main character. Every time he pursues her, the businessman threatens him.Both of the main characters have alternate love interests. The girl’s male classmate and the man’s co-worker. Yet, the adult man chooses the high schooler instead. Even though the show describes both female characters in the same way: Kind, caring, happy, and big anime fans. Why does the man choose the young girl? Because he is a pedophile. Everyone acts like it's fine that an adult is in love with a teenage girl. The side characters treat pedophilia, stalking, and grooming like it's a normal relationship. There’s no room for interpretation. Koikimo is an anime about a pedophile who grooms a high school girl until she is tricked into liking him. though there is barely any animation, the character's faces morph like melting plastic.

Romance wise, the execution is quite sub-optimal. Comedy is subjective, yes, but I didn\'t really find anything in Koikimo funny, so no points there either.I would\'ve rated this a 1, but Tamaru was such a great character that I couldn\'t do him wrong, so Koikimo gets a 2 in my book just for this...giga chad.TLDR: Koikimo, controversy aside, is still a bad anime. Comedy falls flat, the entire cast except for 2 characters are hugely uninteresting and boring, and the plot/story is horribly paced and designed.Story: 1/10There\'s not much of a story. In fact, we don\'t see any progress whatsoever in the main duo of Ryo and Ichika. It\'s just the same antics over and over; Ryo does some manipulative or cringe shit, Ichika reacts somewhat negatively, other people react/help out, etc. etc.Worse yet, we have some attempt at a ""dramatic problem"" thrown in at the last minute with the appearance of Ryo and Rio\'s dad, who of all things chose to speak facts.There\'s not much of a plot or any form of progression to be found in Koikimo, it just bumbles onwards until the end.Art: 4/10At first, I thought the art was nice, but the quality dipped a bit after the first 4 episodes and I began to notice it actually wasn\'t as good as I thought.Sound: 2/10The only good thing about the audio design for Koikimo is the OP (an absolute banger on a regrettable series) and the OST used throughout the anime (which was alright).I respect the voice actors for trying their best, but honestly, I\'ve heard high-school projects with better recording systems than whatever the fuck Koikimo used. The sound is actually so horrible, at first I thought it was just my shitty earbuds giving out after years of use.Character: 3/10Not going to deep dive here, but it\'s basically a bunch of psychopaths doing psychopathic things. Very weird and not very romantic or funny.I get anime logic that characters behave irrationally at times, that\'s acceptable. But Koikimo really takes it to the next level with the amount of bullshit going on.The only saving grace out of all the characters would be my boy Tamaru. Watching him confess and try his best was truly the best part of the series. Arie was a close second for the same reasons. Looking back, I found the anime to be quite enjoyable when it came down to character interactions involving one of these 2: they were the only well-written characters in the entire show and it\'s a damn shame they weren\'t given the spotlight.Enjoyment: 2/10This would be an easy 1/10 if it weren\'t for Tamaru and Arie; as I alluded to above, any interactions involving these characters are actually quite good. So much so that it seems out of place for an anime with horribly written characters and plot progression like Koikimo. giga chad.TLDR: Koikimo, controversy aside, is still a bad anime.

So much so that it seems out of place for an anime with horribly written characters and plot progression like Koikimo.', 'Everything about this show is wrong, but let\'s try to summarise.The male protagonist, Ryou, is a 27 year old man, with a good job, good salary and good with the girls. The female protagonist, Ishika, is a regular high school girl of 17 years old, she\'s kinda otaku and as her best friend says is just an ordinary girl.So, what\'s wrong with the plot?First point: this is the portrait of a sexual predator harassing a teenage girl, not a love story, and there shouldn\'t be any kind of discussion about it.Second point: even when Ichika is not a child, she\'s got something called consentment. From...the first time she met Ryou on her friend\'s house she states his rejectment to Ryou\'s propositions, showing a genuine disgust with it. We all can change our opinion about someone else, but the problem here isn\'t Ichika but Ryou and that carries us to the third point.Third point: Ryou is a 26 year old man, not a teenager and as that, he shouldn\'t try to engage himself with an adolescent, period. Even if we get lax about our ethics and we allow him to try it, at the very first moment he got rejected he should have stopped his harassment to Ichika. Instead, he increased his harass and even started to show up in places he knew Ichika was going to be. That\'s against the law in a lot of countries, not just a moral judgement on the character.Fourth point: Ryou\'s sister and Ichika\'s friend is a really dangerous character. If your older brother tries to hook out with your friend, you, both as friend and as sister should be the first one opposing said behaviour as, like I said before, it\'s illegal. To portrait this characer as someone that not only doesn\'t directly oppose to his brother harassment but in fact encourages it and helps him, it\'s a terrible example of what a friend should do: they should try to protect you from predators, not serves you to them.Fifth point: It\'s common knowledge that the men from the otaku subculture around the world are known by their misogyny and disrespectful -if existent- treatment to women, shows like this are terrifyingly servicious to fortify said behaviour because it reinforces the idea that ""the world is wrong and all these sjw and feminists are my enemies, I\'m right in seeing women as objects without the right to speak by themselves"". I know this is obviously a generalization, as like in any other human group there\'s otaku men who treat women just like another human being as it should be, but the critic is not aimed to them.My last point about this show it\'s that it is an ode to sexual harassment, and shows like this shouldn\'t be allowed on international streaming services. Japan has a serious problem with pedophilia and the anime industry it\'s a clear example of that. This show is a good demonstration that not only idol and lolicon shows are pedophile but regular romcoms can be it too the first time she met Ryou on her friend\'s house she states his rejectment to Ryou\'s propositions, showing a genuine disgust with it. We all can change our opinion about someone else, but the problem here isn\'t Ichika but Ryou and that carries us to the third point.Third point: Ryou is a 26 year old man, not a teenager and as that, he shouldn\'t try to engage himself with an adolescent, period.

This show is a good demonstration that not only idol and lolicon shows are pedophile but regular romcoms can be it too', 'Reason for watching: I went into this thinking it would be more Comedy than Romance, and had thought some negative reviews were exaggerating.But honestly not much exaggeration.*Mild spoiler as I do give out the basic premise and gave a general layout of the storyline.TL;DR at the bottom.Let me do a quick review and opinion on this:Visuals: Definitely up my alley. I like the animation of the story, the art style of the animation, the OP, and ED. They are beautiful to me. Of course the animation could be better,  but is not like this is some shounen show with lots of action,...so I do not expect them to put a lot into animating each scene. 8/10Audio: Seiyuus performance were fine. Is as good as you can expect from such animation. The female lead is able to show emotions through her voice so is not that bad. Male lead on the other hand just seem pretty bland, even for the humane/sentimental (not his stoic persona) scene, there\'s pretty much not much tone difference. OP and ED are nice, which is the only reason why audio score is above average. 6.5/10Characters: Very simple. The story relies more on the story plot than the characters personality to tell the story. You can switch around the characters\' personality, and the story can still work with a a little tweak here and there. Very average character, and subpar  character ""growth"". Not like I expected much character growth for a 12 episode show. But Male lead essentially just became ""kinder"" because he fell in love. I get falling in love will make someone happy, but to change how they interact with almost everyone (in a matter of weeks, WHILE not seeing the love of his life frequently) is kind of  a stretch. Male Lead\'s dad just somehow became more understanding because of a one liner from the Female lead... That is not character growth. that\'s just superpower. 5/10Story:Oh this is the part where is ridiculous.I will echo many reviewers that the premise of this story is unpleasant. To put it badly, is Pedophilic. To put it nicely, is border lining Pedophilic. Yeap.Is of course not as jarring as the porn genre. But this story definitely has a pedophilic undertone. There is no other way around this. A ""Japan\'s culture.."", A ""is fictional..."", A ""consenting age is different..."", doesn\'t change the fact that is pedophilic. You don\'t see people all up in arms with the porn genre of pedophile(hentai, I know child porn is a big offense) or sexual assault, because we all know is fake. Doesn\'t change their genre, no excuses to ""defend"" them either. Also the circumstances leading to those genres in porn aren\'t as realistic as this story.The story is of a full grown man, 26 Year old, falling in love with a 16 year old high schooler who is also his sister\'s BEST FRIEND. Reason for falling in love is sketchy but I do  believe we are not able to control our feelings and emotions. But what we, humans, and definitely grown adult, can control, are our actions.So Male lead falls in love, confessed, got rejected harshly, but still decided to pursue a 16 year old kid openly. Obtains her address without her consent, and consistently ignoring her ""NOs"" (this part is infuriating actually. regardless of what culture there is or which part of the world this story takes place. When a 16 year old repeatedly rejects you, respect it! Don\'t tell me is fiction, so NO can be seen as a YES, or she has a tsundere character or she\'s shy. What world do we live in if we can\'t understand CONSISTENT ""NO"" means NO even from a fictional character?).Male lead tries his best to win the heart of the female lead even when FL is uncomfortable. Then every other side character that knows about this aggressive courtship is accepting of it, enabling a full grown adult with a good number of romantic and sexual experiences, and exposure to mature interactions to pursue a 16 year old child who has zero experiences with Romance, and limited interpersonal interactions, AND obviously much less exposure to the world and its complex dynamics, AND also not fully in touch with her emotional and psychological state yet.The first 3 episodes are disgusting. Middle 6 episodes are fine if we can ignore how it all started. Last 3 episodes is a pathetic attempt to ""correct"" the show\'s logic (or just some sort of subpar redemption arc).If the story had started with ML and FL having normal interactions that grew closer and their feelings for each other developed independently, the age thing would not have bothered me this much.I do enjoy a plot with aggressive courtship like what male lead is doing here, but not when the other party is lacking so much in experiences and emotional and psychological development. If the female lead was a regular 20 year old university student, this wouldn\'t be as disturbing. She would have went through university meeting all sorts of people, and have much more experience as well as more maturity to assess her emotions and mental state.10 years age gap is not a problem here. Is the age itself that is a problem.Middle 6 episodes are just normal cliché rom com scenes where ML not so aggressively courts FL, and both the ML and FL have alternate love interests popping into the story.Last 3 episodes are FL\'s 16 year old feelings developed romantically while ML realizes that he might be hurting/treating FL badly, because of their 10 years age gap that would be a cause for concern in society\'s standard... No is really not the age gap. No one really cares if a 45 YO and 35 YO falls in love. Not sure why they think making the 10 year age gap as the biggest problem actually makes sense. Even if japan culture generally raises sensible children, and consent is younger, doesn\'t change the fact that FL was not able to make an informed decision as well as ML due to their experiences. Is not fair game when FL was robbed off of growing up herself without all that calculated and targeted gaslighting.So is a happy ending as ML will brave through criticisms of the 10 years age gap and is determine to protect FL from the less understanding society\'s judgment, while FL with all her 16-17 years experience on Earth (more than half spent on studying and novels and anime) makes the determination to trust her feelings of LOVE and reciprocate ML\'s advances.I honestly don\'t know how anyone can think pedophile/ manipulation/ grooming elements is okay in a regular anime show because is a fiction.If mutual sex scenes between adults in shows require R21 rating. We should at least have rating for pedophilic story lines, maybe like rated C-reep? At least porn/hentai will rate them R21 and tell you the genre outright. This is not RomCom, is RomCriminalOffence. 5/10 (Story is okay, premise is bad).Total: 6.1/10 (6)TL;DRDefinitely has pedophilic undertone no matter how fictional this story is (even if you add in talking clouds and flowers). Uncomfortable premise if you have awareness on how pedophilic crimes are the absolute worst. If you imagine FL to be at least 18 years old or have the maturity of a 20 years old, the story gets a little better lol. Cute songs and art style. Cute storylines in the middle 6 episodes lol.Mixed feelings because FL is not TOO young and there\'s no sexualization in here, If she\'s any younger, this would be a ""Not recommended"" sentiment. Basically a ""vanilla Pedophilic"" plot.- coming from someone who is not saintly or overly reserved (Eye for an eye plot, SA, cruel gangster plots, torture, murderers, anything with blood I do enjoy, even if it was 2 16 YOs falling in love and maybe get a little sexually curious, I am also fine), but when you exploit children, then is a no-go for  me. so I do not expect them to put a lot into animating each scene. 8/10Audio: Seiyuus performance were fine.

However, I think those numbers are pretty inaccurate and this anime deserves more than this. Those numbers are only based on 2 episodes, which cannot represent the whole anime.

""it doesnt have any sexual innuendos"" you must not have caught the way he offered to sleep with the mc in the first episode, huh? knowing full well she was a minor (she had her school uniform on). you also mentioned he changed after meeting her. yeah, that\'s bc he was stalking and harassing her bc he was obsessed with her. anyone would change. you guys will do the most complex mental gymnastics to justify this guy being attracted to a minor and its not working.7) ""One thing I must say, this anime is not for everyone since it\'s adapted from a manga for mature audience...male lead is kinda stalkerish (they already date though) and ""heavy"" but more wholesome and obviously healthy because the female lead try to make him change but many reader still hate it because they can\'t accept his behavior...So is he pedophile? Of course not! She is already 17 years old...""so many things wrong with this. ""mature audience"" my ass, nothing is ""mature"" about a pedophilic relationship. it\'s just creepy and very strange. ""kinda stalkerish"" he *is* a stalker, no way to sugarcoat it. the female lead clearly denied his advances but he continued to pursue her. and yes he\'s a pedophile because a pedophile is attracted to children. not just pubescent children. all children. the mc is a child. you go on to talk about the laws in japan and how 10 years isn\'t strange. it would be a lot more acceptable if they were older but they are not, so thats one. number two, it doesn\'t matter that she\'s the age of consent in japan, she literally didn\'t give him consent. she told him no multiple times and he continued to pursue her. that is harassment. do not defend it.8) ""Basically a wholesome romance anime when a 27 year old guy falls in love with his sisters friend who\'s 17 and how he comes on to her a little too forcefully (in a comedic pg sort of way showering her with gifts) and her coming to terms with her honest feelings for him.""coming to terms with her honest feelings? she\'s said no many many times. if she\'s developed feelings because of it she\'s been groomed. that\'s literally grooming. it\'s not comedic nor is it wholesome. it\'s disgusting.well that\'s all for this long review!! if you like this anime and find nothing wrong with it please seek out therapy!! it literally makes me want to vomit just thinking about it. while watching the first episode I literally screamed multiple times and had to pause bc I just couldn\'t believe my eyes.if you genuinely see nothing wrong with this show then please seek professional help. i would rate it a 0 if I could.responding to some reviews that rated this highly for some godforsaken reason:1) ""What seems like a weird and creepy show is a sweet and wholesome one.""how did you contradict yourself with a single sentence. it\'s very weird and very creepy, and there\'s nothing wholesome about it. this a man stalking a high school girl. nothing more nothing less.2) ""It\'s not even like Ryou is physically attracted to her, it\'s more an emotional attraction that started out because she saved him from -spoiler- and gave her lunch to him.

""they are starting to warm up to each other"" she literally told him no how many times? stalking her and giving her unwanted gifts and attention? unwanted flirting? it\'s literally grooming, how do you not see that? and you mentioned they\'re fictional...and? fiction affects reality. god knows how many irl girls go through this same shit. it\'s disgusting and shows like this only normalizes it.3) ""If you have a creepy character in a show that already knows that already acknowledges a creepy relationship.""thats the issue with the show-- it *doesnt* acknowledge that the relationship is creepy!! if it did the sister wouldn\'t have encouraged it, the girl\'s family would\'ve stepped in, authorities would\'ve been called, and the man would be in jail. done!! but no, they decide to make it cute. how disgusting. im not even going to bother responding to the rest of this review bc they\'re really doing the most to justify a pedo. sickening, really.4) ""I think the main reason people don\'t like this anime it\'s because the story\'s about a middle-aged playboy trying to make a move on an under-aged teen. Everyone has a different opinion, but personally, I don\'t see it as a problem, this is anime and not something real and it\'s really fun and emotional""""personally, I dont see it as a problem"" jail time. please. fiction affects reality. and...fun and emotional? whats fun about a girl telling a grown man to leave her alone and him continuing to harass her? tell me quickly please bc I dont see the appeal whatsoever.5) "" So far Ryou san has been such an amazing character. From something that could be perceived as creepy they managed to make him wholesome. The witty conversations are very entertaining and you can also appreciate his dedication to his new found love.""""that could be perceived as creepy"" he *is* creepy, end of story. and they managed to make him wholesome in 4 episodes? when in just the first one he was being rejected left right and center, harassing and stalking her? in four episodes? really? they really romanticized a pedo relationship and you\'ve fallen for the trap. amazing. ""you can appreciate his dedication--"" no no. not dedication. harassment. learn the difference.6) ""It\'s unfair to call this sexual harassment when you\'re probably still so in love with Jobless Reincarnation and Higehiro. Don\'t get me wrong, I do like both animes but I just find it frustrating that JR and Higehiro are much loved by many while Koikimo is being shunned in the corner when it doesn\'t even have any sexual innuendos. Sure, Ryou might have been a playboy and whatnot but the point here is that he has CHANGED after meeting Ichika.""sexual harassment is sexual harassment?? no matter what anime its in?? if those anime had it too then they deserve to be just as criticized. but I doubt its as bad as this. no way theyre as bad as this. ""it doesnt have any sexual innuendos"" you must not have caught the way he offered to sleep with the mc in the first episode, huh? knowing full well she was a minor (she had her school uniform on). you also mentioned he changed after meeting her. yeah, that\'s bc he was stalking and harassing her bc he was obsessed with her. anyone would change. you guys will do the most complex mental gymnastics to justify this guy being attracted to a minor and its not working.7) ""One thing I must say, this anime is not for everyone since it\'s adapted from a manga for mature audience...male lead is kinda stalkerish (they already date though) and ""heavy"" but more wholesome and obviously healthy because the female lead try to make him change but many reader still hate it because they can\'t accept his behavior...So is he pedophile? Of course not! She is already 17 years old...""so many things wrong with this. ""mature audience"" my ass, nothing is ""mature"" about a pedophilic relationship. it\'s just creepy and very strange. ""kinda stalkerish"" he *is* a stalker, no way to sugarcoat it. the female lead clearly denied his advances but he continued to pursue her. and yes he\'s a pedophile because a pedophile is attracted to children. not just pubescent children. all children. the mc is a child. you go on to talk about the laws in japan and how 10 years isn\'t strange. it would be a lot more acceptable if they were older but they are not, so thats one. number two, it doesn\'t matter that she\'s the age of consent in japan, she literally didn\'t give him consent. she told him no multiple times and he continued to pursue her. that is harassment. do not defend it.8) ""Basically a wholesome romance anime when a 27 year old guy falls in love with his sisters friend who\'s 17 and how he comes on to her a little too forcefully (in a comedic pg sort of way showering her with gifts) and her coming to terms with her honest feelings for him.""coming to terms with her honest feelings? she\'s said no many many times. if she\'s developed feelings because of it she\'s been groomed. that\'s literally grooming. it\'s not comedic nor is it wholesome. it\'s disgusting.well that\'s all for this long review!! if you like this anime and find nothing wrong with it please seek out therapy!!', ""This anime holds no value outside of being a creepy and disturbing reflection of the struggles that many if not all women have had to deal with for far too long.There's a literal adult man harassing and stalking a highschool girl, she clearly tells him she's not interested multiple times, she expresses discomfort over and over again and yet everyone around her enables him because of course they do.Just because the male lead is the brother of the female leads' friend doesn't suddenly make it ok to harass her the way he does. The female lead literally couldn't make it any clearer that he's...bothering her but he doesn't listen and persists anyway.

That\'s the anime.When I started I thought I\'d at least be in for at least SOME nuance, since I\'m not inherently against age gap romances, I wouldn\'t even be against sexual harassement of a teenage girl in fiction if it\'s done with the purpose of exploring a certain toxic type of relationship, but this does neither explore or make a commentary. It\'s supposed to be cute. Yeah. But I can\'t possibly find it cute...when the ML does nothing but be insisting, possessive, do things nobody asked for and continously profess he\'s undying love because this one girl just happened to be a normal human being with common sense. It\'s even more jarring when the anime tries to make a sort of love triangle with a guy that at least has some chemistry with her, but ultimately ends up being entirely pointless.Honestly I just felt like I wasted my time here, so if you\'re not into this weird trope, just listen to my advice and stay away.

We begin our journey with our heroine “saving the life” of our tragic hero, thus earning his undying affection and love. Interestingly, this very situation could...be playing out with Studio Nomad, the “brains” behind Koikimo. Perhaps this hastily put together narrative reflects the fact that much like Ichika saved Ryo, Nomad hopes that Koikimo will save the studio. Sadly, life is not an anime.Napkin #2Art (2/10)The animation (or lack of) in Koikimo can best be observed by taking a manga volume or a weekly coupon book that arrives in the mail and rapidly turning the page to create the illusion of movement. Character movement is kept to a minimum, with unexpressive faces and numerous still shots attempting to mask the lack of effort or budget.Napkin #3Sound (3/10)The OP, Monochrome City, might just be the best music piece put to an entertainment medium since John Williams composed the score for Star Wars. Not only is it dynamic, upbeat, and catchy, it masks the poor animation in the OP! Unfortunately the OP appears to be the only piece of music that can be defined as a song throughout this anime, as I can not remember any background tracks or the ending. My only wish was that as Suspect #1 confessed his feelings to Victim #1, Romansu Nante, performed by a gospel choir, was played in the background.Napkin #4The characters (1/10)There are three crucial characters to analyze if one is to understand the work of fiction that is Koikimo. First, Suspect #1, Ryo. Ryo is a boring office worker who apparently was never taught the word “no”. Instead, Ryo makes continuous advances until the miraculous revelation occurs that due to the 12-episode nature of the series, Victim #1, Ichika, must now appreciate his advances and fall for him. But wait… the non-existent character development doesn’t stop there. Meet Ryo’s sister, the Boogeyman, whose sole defining characteristic is her desire to set up her best friend with her brother. Just like the Boogeyman, Rio has a tendency to appear when Victim #1 is at her most emotionally confused, always steering her towards her brother. I suspect Rio’s motive is a desire to set her brother up with the underage Ichika, have him arrested, then steal the assets from her and Ryo’s parents before their untimely death. As a side note, could these dubious parents not choose a better name that merely taking Ryo’s name and changing the “y” to an “i”. Needless to say, I am not awaiting the spinoff series with Roo or Rao. The character designs are uninteresting, with Ichika and Ryo appearing bland and forgettable, much like the ED.Napkin #5Enjoyment (2/10)Entertainment is supposed to entertain, but watching Koikimo evolved into a form of mental labor as I dragged myself to my computer, pried open my eyes, and danced to Monochrome city as Big Brother looked on, eager to call an exorcist. The shallow characters, ridiculous pacing, poor animation, and stupid premise fail to make this show enjoyable, leaving Koikimo reminiscent of prune juice for the soul.ConclusionNow looking at our five napkins on our table, we are left with a predicament. There is no food to enjoy. Setting aside the questionable nature of the relationship between Ichika and Ryo, the show fails for the simple reason that it is not entertaining. In the rom-com genre, better shows and manga, whether Rent A Girlfriend, Kaguya-Sama, or Komi Can’t Communicate, all exist and have more redeeming features than this anime.Score: 1/10 Koikimo be playing out with Studio Nomad, the “brains” behind Koikimo.

I don\'t mind age-gap anime/manga, in fact, one of my favorite mangas is an age-gap theme. But here\'s the difference between this age-gap anime and others that I\'ve seen. First off, this grown man is offering a teenager first a kiss and then sex because she did a simple act of kindness that any decent human would do. Like, excuse me? First red flag. Then, the fact that the sicko\'s sister ""thinks he\'s serious"" about Ichika, so she gives her friend\'s ADDRESS to her brother so that he can go over to her private...space uninvited when she literally already flat-out rejected him and told him that he\'s creepy. So, not only is her ""friend"" an enabler of a predator and encouraging this predatory relationship, but she\'s straight up a bad friend and puts Ichika in vulnerable situations so that her brother can be with her. And when she says him giving her things is a bother (another rejection), the man literally says that he\'s not going to stop and that no matter what she does or says, he\'ll continue to pursue her. WHAT?!?! This dude is just predatory and the mangaka is trying to put this in some weird ""this is so cute, look how in love he is and how hard he\'s trying to change her mind"" kind of light and that is so awful.He not only grooms her throughout the episodes and harrasses her, he, as a 27 year old man, threatens a 17 year old kid because he was talking to Ichika and it was soooooooooo weird and uncomfortable and literally gave me chills because it was just so wrong and creepy. I honestly would prefer to see a show about Ichika and Tamura than a grown man creeping after a high schooler.Aside from the inappropriate actions of the main guy, the animation isn\'t good and the sound is terrible. I literally changed servers because I thought the first one was messed up, but nope, the sound is just crap.Like I said, I don\'t mind age-gap theme, but I\'ve never seen one this uncomfortable where the younger person literally straight out rejects the older person and the older person just doesn\'t give a crap and continues to pursue despite all of their actions being unwanted and even predatory.

Me, being the rational person that I am, waited until it aired to see how it actually is. I do like shoujo romance anime and while most of them tend to be copy and paste stories, they do give me enjoyment and some have a really cute and fun-loving romance. Koi to Yobu wasn't like that. If anything, it somehow went below my expectations, which wasn't high to begin with.Characters (2/10)Ryo and Ichika are by far the blandest and boring characters I've come...across who have just about enough chemistry as oil and water.

Before I go further, No, I will not talk about the age gap because that has been discussed to the point where it's practically a meme at this point.

There, that's pretty much the entire plot. I will give credit where credit is due and say that some parts of it were funny and got a chuckle out of me.

It\'s like you have no more happiness left in your life and only left you with depression.Before I say anything I want to say that Yes I absolutely acknowledge sexual harassments, rapist, that\'s happening around us and YES it\'s a SERIOUS CASE THAT I ABSOLUTE DISGUST! I have a friend who has fallen victim to this harassments, If I can I will absolute wipe all them out the face of the Earth but I\'m not God so all I...can do is try to help out what I can around me.There\'s some behavior of Ryo\'s that I really dislike and It\'s probably because he\'s very confident about himself. But overall he\'s not a bad person. I am also aware that He use to date a lot of women, but He takes his feelings for ichika very seriously. He also said that he\'s not doing that anymore. Love can be surprising, It can hit us at any moment without warning and once we felt it that person becomes very dear for us.Despite his feelings for Ichika, he also knows his place. He even said that his feelings for ichika is ""Unrequited"".All that things that he\'s doing for ichika, Sending gifts, Calling her, etc. I call that EFFORT. I mean Ichika did say to stop, but she also said that she doesn\'t dislike the gifts he send to her. And when they talk to the phone, they talk about the things that they did and be done.What I know about these two is that THEY\'RE ARE BOTH SERIOUS and it\'s a very good thing. RYO about his feelings and Ichika trying to figure out if Ryo is serious and I hope she realized that he is serious about her.

But deep down she appreciates everything he does, she even said she missed him (which is very cute). Their taking their time, slowly. I really hope it works out for them.IF there is something abnormal and f*cked up about this show I would know but all I see in this show is a very cute romcom anime.For all the anime that I watch (I mostly watch slice of life and a lil bit of action) I WANT TO THANK YOU and The creator who made this anime (Mogusu was it) THANK YOU!Story: (9)Art : (9) I really like the art, it\'s cute.SOUND (10000000000000000000000000): BRO OPENING AND ENDING ARE SO OP I JUST LOVED IT.

But overall he\'s not a bad person. I am also aware that He use to date a lot of women, but He takes his feelings for ichika very seriously. He also said that he\'s not doing that anymore. Love can be surprising, It can hit us at any moment without warning and once we felt it that person becomes very dear for us.Despite his feelings for Ichika, he also knows his place. He even said that his feelings for ichika is ""Unrequited"".All that things that he\'s doing for ichika, Sending gifts, Calling her, etc. I call that EFFORT. I mean Ichika did say to stop, but she also said that she doesn\'t dislike the gifts he send to her. And when they talk to the phone, they talk about the things that they did and be done.What I know about these two is that THEY\'RE ARE BOTH SERIOUS and it\'s a very good thing. RYO about his feelings and Ichika trying to figure out if Ryo is serious and I hope she realized that he is serious about her. In the end It\'s up to her whether to return his feelings or not and I\'m sure Ryo would RESPECT whatever she decides to do.IF ichika really hates everything he does she\'ll know what to do, She would never answer his call talking all stuff, she would throw away everything he gives her and she probably will involved the police.

And for fact or fiction, this season we\'re facing 2 back-to-back similar-but-different approaches to that: this show (KoiKimo) and HigeHiro, the former: an unrelenting adult on a sexual predator\'s level of unhinged stalking and harassment towards a typical normal high school JK; the latter: everything else that is this show but the complete opposite (and not to mention better in every other way).Disregarding HigeHiro for...now, KoiKimo for better or for worse, I\'d say is ""Redo of Healer"" levels of the rom-com genre, though it was marketed at that from face value (which is entirely misleading). But the subtlety of everything that contradicts what a normal relationship looks like, this source material attempts to replicate all that\'s wrong with the age-gap premise that unfortunately exists in the real world, coupled with the endless research about the pros and cons of such debacle topics that the human race has seen throughout the past decade. For good or for bad, it exposes the reality that age-gap relationships are here to stay despite all the controversy and hearsay of news all around, much less the fact that if you have friends that are or have been in such a situation like this before (which I have to put a big disclaimer that results may vary, regardless of culture). Social disapproval is a common theme for the many who are watching this anime, love it or hate it.For such a show framed as “It’s Disgusting to Call This Love”, love CAN be described as disgusting at times, but it\'s more of less a very strange feeling that reasoning can blight off self-morales...mostly to your very own benefit, if it isn\'t mutual. And for that, I have to give KoiKimo props for even trying to explore a taboo topic such as this, even if this show will be puked at by the general consensus on both the human moral and cultural standpoint, Western or otherwise. Nonetheless, I\'d have to blame the original mangaka Mogusu for this as most of what happens within KoiKimo is on very extreme levels of ""What should you NOT do in a relationship"", partly counting of stalking and everything else that will push viewers away from the get-go, more than just the uncomfortable levels of cringe-fest that this show tries to divulge and make us feel ""sorry"" for the young female JK MC. Sorry, but that\'s not gonna happen, even if the persuasion goes to the epitome of ""putting yourself in their shoes"".There have been many stories of forbidden love done before, heck I\'d say that 2018\'s Koi wa Ameagari no You ni (a.k.a After the Rain) is an infinitely better example of this to tackle the illusive age-gap issue, albeit that\'s one-sided and learning rightaway that the implications of such a relationship will raise eyebrows, but still pursuing the relationship regardless and keeping to one\'s own if the answer is yes or no. KoiKimo however, just blatantly disregards all thoughts of the characters to: ""I have a motive, therefore if I get my answer or not, I must make it happen."", and that is especially frightening for a taboo issue that focuses on the other side of the coin...on an insane pedigree of human instincts.Take the instance of 27-year old Ryo Amakusa and 17-year old Arima Ichika: a not-so-coincidental feeling of meeting at a train station to create the obvious cliches (as to serve the first milestone/pivotal point) of a hurting coincidence, only for the main MC lead to be mesmerized by the typical young JK, and because her name is Ichika (which literally means ""one flower""), his next thought is to stalk her by buying stalks of ""one flower"" just so that he could capture her attention, regardless of whether it works out or not, stratagem after stratagem, for this inconspicuous relationship to work out. Now tell me if you have gone through such a relationship as this to the point that the boy/girl you just met is literally one that\'s in accordance of a stalker. Surely you\'d think that the reciprocating party must feel so awkward and forced to push back all these unnecessary advances, but with the prying of a close friend in school, poof, those matters are soon long gone, as if the big mountainous heaps of trouble has been easily overcome time and time again by blood relations alone. Not exactly a big help considering that there\'s just too much of a disparity between a young adult and a JK in their own environmental conditions of growth. To get unwavering support from close friends (for Ichika: Rio, blood sibling to Ryo, and for Ryo: not just his sister Rio, but also freelance photography nerd Masuda) is rather amicable, I\'ll give it that, but that\'s as far as my generosity goes of a rather large age-gap relationship such as this. Pair that with a decent cast that are more like accomodations ranging from a (close to) wingman, wing-girl, crushes on either side of the picture (Kai Tamaru and Arie ""Arietty"" Matsushima for both Ichika and Ryo respectively), and I just don\'t see any benefit to such a crass story plot that seeks to serve as a bird\'s eye view to the long-age issue, but rather, self-serving short-term stopgap ones that are created and fizzled out as they come. Improvements come and go no doubt, but in the overall picture, as much as I secretly desire that both Ichika and Ryo would just stick to the status quo of dating their close contacts, the fact that this story exists is a powerful stoic articulation in and of itself, as a reminder to not seek relationships as morally disgusting as this one is. It\'s literally in the name.Animation itself is subpar since it\'s Nomad, and their work record is also teetering on the low-end as well. Also, if you\'ve seen shows like ""Gokushufudou"" or even ""Back Street Girls: Gokudolls"" that J.C.Staff director Kon Chiaki simply loves slicing and mimicing complete manga scenes into anime, you\'ve got it here in short snippets as well, which truly contradicts the meaning of the word ""animation"" and putting all that focus into the ""low-budget"" aspect. Good that it\'s self-aware on knowing how much more could be done, but the ever-present limitations of funding means that it can only produce borderline mediocre stuff like the bread-and-butter rhetoric, as by the standards of the show that serves to keep this low-budget studio working: ""Jashin-chan Dropkick!"".Of all things, if everything fails, let not the one constant fade away, which is the music department. Say what you will about the OST if you\'re the type who always skips either or both the OP and ED, but this is one of those trope moments where ""You hear it the first time, nah. Let it grow on you, and it starts being good."" And true indeed, the more you hear it, it starts growing on you to the point of decency while being catchy. A prominent showing that is only as good and long as how this show lasts in its run.There are shows that with its tantalizing mount of ""reasoning"" that can be resonated by everyone, whether you love or hate it, is worth being notable about a.k.a HigeHiro. However, KoiKimo, more than being that unscrupulous kid on the block that shuts his/her ears to the world\'s cries, is playing the Devil\'s Advocate that whatever it tries to promote and/or showcase, it tries to discover and implore the audience to give this an open mind (to which I totally agree, but quickly disagree), to just downright being disrespectful of what we\'re watching in the real world as well on the taboo subject of huge age-gap relationships.We don\'t need narcissistic shows like this to tell us that ""the grass is greener on the other side"", it depends on the fictitious work portrayed that tells their side of the story. While I don\'t hate this show by a large mile, unless you\'re the rare minority that doesn\'t mind that this show exists to tell the story willy-nilly and find it good, stay away from this show as it\'ll teach you the same eloquence as the ""Little Red Riding Hood"", in a non-romcom sense even if instincts do exist or otherwise. now, KoiKimo for better or for worse, I\'d say is ""Redo of Healer"" levels of the rom-com genre, though it was marketed at that from face value (which is entirely misleading).

But I'm not complaining cause this is simply too addictive...This might be like opening the Pandora box amidst the negative reviews but someone has to speak up so here we go. Please stop with the double standards. It's unfair to call this sexual harassment when you're probably still so in love with Jobless Reincarnation and Higehiro. Don't get me wrong, I do like both animes but I just find it frustrating that JR and Higehiro get so much love while Koikimo is being shunned in the corner when it doesn't even...have any sexual innuendos! Sure, Ryou might have been a playboy and whatnot but the point here is that he has CHANGED after meeting Ichika. If anything, it might be a bit cliché but nevertheless addictive.A massive WARNING, this anime is one of those that require minimal brain cells but yields maximum joy, like a crossover of Ouran and Kiss Him, Not Me. So if you're looking for huge character development and a killer plot, then this is not for you. However, if you're ready to take a carefree ride through rom-com land to blow off some steam, then hop right on~Having read the manga, I was over the moon when I heard that it's getting an anime adaptation. While the story did start off slightly bumpy with the age gap and excessive infatuation, which I know can turn a few people off, it will certainly pick up soon. Personally, I love the dynamic of the Amakusa siblings, which we will get to explore more as the story progresses, where Rio becomes closer to her brother Ryou through Ichika. And the relationship between the leads will become more meaningful as well as Ryou and Ichika get to know each other more (mind you, in a non-sexual way).In terms of production, the art quality has been fairly stable. The OP and ED are also quickly growing on me.  I'm really enjoying this anime so far. Can't wait for the next episode! have any sexual innuendos!

Can't wait for the next episode!"", 'It\'s easy to be offended by a show with a premise like this, but let\'s just stipulate from the beginning that this is an age gap romance between an adult man and a high school girl. We all know the deal here from the synopsis. If this sort of a thing is a hard no to you, you probably aren\'t even reading this review. So, taking Koikimo on its own terms, does it succeed at creating a compelling romance? I will spare you the suspense, the answer is an emphatic no.Before diving into the meat of what went wrong with this series, I think it\'s...worth mentioning that the presentation does it no favors. Character designs are bland at best, ugly at worst, and the animation is consistently below average, with characters frequently going off model. This is even worse considering how unambitious the storyboards and layouts are, and the lack of any dynamism or energy from the direction keeps the series feeling listless even when it heads into juicy dramatic waters.But no amount of inspired direction could have saved this series from its main couple. Yes, male lead Ryo is quite clearly stalking and sexually harassing 17 year old Ichika, but that is not even the fundamental problem here. The real problem is that the series never establishes any sort of convincing reason for why she would suddenly stop being uncomfortable with his behavior and fall in love with him. Really they don\'t even attempt this. Ryo\'s behavior (""borderline criminal"" in the show\'s own words) simply continues unabated until a switch flips in Ichika\'s mind and she somehow realizes she was In Love With Him All Along because she\'s been Thinking About Him All This Time. It is laughably thin, and combined with their nonexistent romantic chemistry, never gives you any reason to want to see them get together, even if you are into this sort of thing.The show does briefly threaten to become interesting with the introductions of age appropriate romantic rivals Tamaru (Ichika\'s classmate) and Arie (Ryo\'s coworker), but it\'s no great spoiler to say that they are tin cans being set up only so they can be shot down. The show certainly makes that clear right off the bat. Don\'t get attached to them, because when they\'re finished playing their roles as romantic foils, they may as well have vanished into thin air.The side characters really end up being the oddest part of this whole tapestry, because over the course of the series, many of them find out about Ryo\'s obsession with Ichika, and every single one of them either accepts it or actively attempts to hook them up, including Ichika\'s own mother. At the very least they could have included some societal disapproval to put some sauce on the taboo nature of this whole thing, but in the interests of making sure the audience believes that This Whole Thing Is Actually Fine, no character is allowed to utter a word of criticism about any of this. It\'s both morally troubling AND bereft of any juicy drama that might at least make this soapy and fun.In the end, I think that\'s where this series falls the shortest. It is committed to depicting a deeply taboo relationship, but only in the safest ways imaginable. Instead of being shocking or ridiculous, it just feels like any other low effort romcom, but with one of the participants aged up by 10 years. The main couple is extremely boring, both as a pair and as individuals, and if I\'m going to ignore my sense of good taste and propriety to watch something like this, I would at least like to be entertained. Instead, Koikimo straddles the fence and ends up being too uncomfortable for normal viewers and too tame for perverts. worth mentioning that the presentation does it no favors.

Yeah, is dreadful, but we all knew what we were going to get. Gotta give the anime credit though, it was really self aware of what it was doing.Art: 3/10My sister told me the art looked like a it was from a hentai. Did she lie though?Sound: 9/10I'm giving this a 9 solely because of the op. It was the best of the season and you can't change...my mind. Also, shout out to Junya Enoki and Kana Hanazawa for being two of the best seiyuus rn.Character: 3/10I hate everything about the main guy; his design, his personality, even his voice (the actor was fine, but I didn't like the timbre that he went with). Ichika and the rest of the characters were okay, though I did find the best friend/sister of the main duo annoying.Okay now LET'S TALK ABOUT TAMARU. He was the solely reason why I kept watching the anime, and, are you kidding me?! Ichika and him had nice chemistry, much more things in common, looked cute together, and you still had her end up with the pedophile? I already knew it was going to happen, but I'm still mad they did him dirty.Enjoyment: 6/10Came for the memes, stayed for the op and Tamaru, and stayed 'till the end just for the sake of completing it. As I said before, I knew I was going to get trash coming into this, but I find myself skipping through some parts towards the last episodes because I felt bored. I did enjoyed the first half though.Overall: 4/10It wasn't annoying enough to put it lower than 4 (that's an honour that only Ao Haru Ride managed to accomplished). my mind.

They are just generalizing the fact that this anime includes age-gap. But look deeper into the character itself. His attitude towards the girl he likes, doesn't include any sexually explicit motives or anything like that.The age gap, yes, I know many people might think this is creepy, but the character itself, Ryo is a gentleman tho. It's not like he did something bad or sexually harassed her. He is a soft guy, he actually get scolded a lot by the girl. He respects the girl...so much. watch it first before you judge the anime.(and please, let's just enjoy this LITERARY piece) so much. watch it first before you judge the anime.(and please, let's just enjoy this LITERARY piece)"", 'Jesus Christ what am I supposed to say?This anime is pretty problematic, for multiple reasons (obviously the age gap). But also the male MC\'s stalkerish nature and his inability to take ""no"" for an answer.The first episode is quite literally titled ""he\'s not entirely bad""And just the fact that they\'re going to get together is quite... disturbingFurthermore, there are people within the show who are encouraging this behavior, including the sister (and possibly the mother).Besides what\'s obviously appalling in its nature, everything else is mediocre to bad. The animation is fine.... but the storytelling is quite laughably bad in some scenes. It\'s very all over...the place. the place.', 'So before I delve into one of my favourite romance animes that\'s just finished airing, I\'d like to point out a couple of things.1. The anime has a satisfying ending that would, imo, end all arguments slandering this anime for this age gap.2. Ryo (the male MC) has never overstepped any boundaries (at least from my perspective he hasn\'t)and 3. He never sought out a high schooler and fell for her, it was all just a big coincidence that led to well... this. I feel like the third one is important because before Ichika happened, I don\'t think Ryo had ever considered...courting a high schooler let alone falling for them. To which the quote ""you don\'t choose who you fall in love with"" can be taken horribly depending on the circumstance but shouldn\'t be wrongly applied here, because I strongly believe the romance going on in this anime is more than fine and even sweet.I was originally wary upon reading the description of this anime. I didn\'t like the idea of a 10 year age gap between a full-time working adult and a high schooler, but eventually caved when I was bored and looking for something new.The first episode immediately grabbed my attention. Before I knew it, I had caught up on all the episodes that had currently released and was looking forward to every Monday. (It\'s sad to think that it\'s over).Koikimo is the perfect balance of romance and comedy. It has great characters that are not just one dimensional and it has really sweet romantic moments. I, for one, adore Ryo as a character and love interest. The dynamic between him and Ichika is funny, heart-warming and innocent for something so many people look down upon. Idc, I\'ll preach my love for this anime to this world with no shame.I like the realness of it, the doubts, confusion, realisation. I like the role Rio played in it as both Ryo\'s younger sister and Ichika\'s best friend. I also loved Tamaru as a character, slightly similar to Ryo in a sense, but a younger version of him. I liked the pacing of the story, I never found any episodes boring or slow, and the ending is perfect for an anime tackling this kind of story.But the romance just sells it for me. It\'s the slow development of a relationship between Ichika and Ryo. Their little moments, their conversations, their personalities. It\'s an unlikely couple, I\'ll give you that. I\'m afraid I can\'t offer that many, or even any, bad sides to this anime. It\'s a top tier romance for me in both enjoyment and execution and I\'m well aware many people will disagree.And I think what makes this anime more satisfying is that it ended on such a good note, and with not too much drama, purely because of the people Ichika and Ryo are. Specifically Ryo. We\'ve all seen high school romance animes with only one season. Sometimes even two, where the ending is ambiguous or unfinished or will just (sadly) never get another season. And Koikimo finishes it nicely with a bow. Why? Because the relationship is different to that of high schoolers. (I would like to flag up that I don\'t by any means encourage this as a norm and am aware that age gaps like this with high schoolers in the real world are no where near similar to this) (Therefore worth noting that this relationship is not representative nor generalisable to relationships in the real world, thank you).Long story short, I highly recommend this romance anime. Don\'t take it so literally and relationships like this that work in real life are RARE, if not a miracle. The point is that age gaps don\'t matter so much once you\'re an adult and that is addressed in this anime. Age gaps are not a subject taken lightly in this anime regardless of how so many people have perceived it. courting a high schooler let alone falling for them.

They're still grossly in love with way too much PDA for a couple their age, but I digress. The disclaimer is to show that while age gaps can work, they only work between adults and NOT an adult and a minor (my mom was 25 when she met my dad who was 38).I've seen reviews that point out how predatory and dangerous this anime is by covering up the premise with cutesy art, an incredibly catchy...soundtrack, and dainty shoujo elements, and I wholeheartedly agree.This anime is about a 27 year old man forcing his feelings onto a 17 year old girl, the synopsis does a great job at telling you everything you need to know because there's no more substance than that.We watch a man consistently harass a high school girl, stalk her, and mislead her for 12 episodes. Not to mention while I love the art style, the production quality leaves much to be desired (the microphones they're using make it sound like they're recording underwater).I'm shocked an anime like this was made and approved (Or not I guess since there are all kinds of weird things out there) but I highly disapprove because I don't think we should ever normalize harassment from adults to minors.At times it gets even, dare I say pedophilic, and somehow I forced myself to watch through the whole thing thinking that somehow this would get better and redeem itselfSurprise: It does not. soundtrack, and dainty shoujo elements, and I wholeheartedly agree.This anime is about a 27 year old man forcing his feelings onto a 17 year old girl, the synopsis does a great job at telling you everything you need to know because there's no more substance than that.We watch a man consistently harass a high school girl, stalk her, and mislead her for 12 episodes.

There is a big issue that to some, will make people feel uneasy, to others, it won't matter to them, and they can look past it. But something like it, would be enough to make someone drop it. So I should warn you before going forward, to take it with a pinch of salt, and really think if it'll both you or not before you watch this show.But as for what I think, and how I feel? Let me explain!Story and charactersThe story is a romance comedy...sort of show. Following an adult in form of Ryou, who has seemed to have never found 'the one' for him, that is until a high schooler in Ichika, saves his life before he goes tumbling down many steps. It was a sweet moment, as life flashed before his eyes, and as if he's seen an angel, that has come and saved him. Now he's madly in love with her, with her being a mix of unsure, and a little bit creeped out by it. The story basically follows how that develops, and the fun and cute moments between them, and between other characters within the show. With other characters, such as his sister in Rio, whom happens to be Ichika's best friend too, that tug the story along to make for a good experience, but it can get weird if you realize the age difference. If they were same age, or only a year apart, it would be very high praised I bet.But besides that, it can be a real cute and sweet show at times. It's a good watch.As for how the characters are? They're sweet in their own way. Ichika is a sweet honest girl, with only more of her personality coming out thanks to Ryou. Ryou is sweet himself, set as a 'womanizer' but he actually does care for people, and is very hard working. His sister in Rio, is very supportive in her own way, and can come off as a sweet supportive sister towards her brother and best friend in her own ways. Even if it's questionable in some areas.Music and artOne of the big highlights of the show for me, is the art style itself. It's super colourful, and bright, and great to look at. One of my favorite things, is the ending scenes, because of the style it's drawn and coloured in. It's real lovely to look at, and I just love how it's a thing. Much like the sound within the sound, it really fits together with the vibe of the show, which all connects together, to make an enjoyable experience on that front. I spoke on the art at the end credits. But the music for the ED song too, is just as good.I want to really like this show, I really do. Just the big issue at hand, does weird me out a little bit. I'll keep watching, and you should too! Long as it doesn't bother you. sort of show.

The characters are all pleasant and nice. Rating it lower because it\'s devoid of a plot that doesn\'t rely on the romance.This reminds me of Tamaki and Haruhi dynamic from Ouran High School Host Club but on steroids.The premise is problematic. Ryo nearly trips from falling down the stairs on the subway and Ichika saves him with her umbrella. She then gives him her bento.

Ichika doesn\'t take it seriously at all and just calls him a creep.It\'s problematic that his sister then wants to ship her older brother with her best friend. What is problematic is how he gets her number and calls her everyday from there and tries to meet her whenever he can, because Rio his little sister offers to help him. It\'s not really stalking, more so that I found it pushing the boundaries too far in that Rio wants to force a romance out of them.The whole anime just finds way for Ichika and Ryo to interact, whether it\'s bumping into each other at the convenience store or Ryo taking care of Ichika when she\'s sick.There\'s no plot, but what shines is how believable the character interactions are. Ichika doesn\'t fall for Ryo until later when she realizes he\'s actually serious about her.

The story pace in some parts is pretty fast but the way they execute it is on point also this is a very refreshing anime. Second of all this anime, the story is pretty unique I know a few that have a similar plot but it this have a different elements that just does it for me, some might find the age gap to be too wide but come on 10 years is not that I've seen worse in real life, I know you also do but you hate to admit it since its real life and this is an anime so its easy for people to nitpick it.Art: 9The art is pretty cute and it somehow reminded me of fruit basket but some of the features of the character are unique and the world-building is pretty decent. But overall the art just really fits the cute but kinda strange love story vibe.Sound: 9I lOVE THE OP like the intro of the anime brings me to the band and they're pretty underrated also for the OST it's also pretty good it matches the anime vibe and plot.Character:8don't get me started on the characters they all very lovable except Tamaru Kun, I hated him, but all the other characters complement each other very well and some are easily relatable.Enjoyment:10This is the type of thing that you'll get at the edge of your seat and be hype for the next episode again it's very entertaining and kinda stand out from the rest of the rom-com I've seen.Overall:9The anime is pretty great and I highly recommended that you watch it or at least try the rating of the anime doesn't bring it justice and instead it scares some people to not watch it but hey at the end of the day an anime and real life is 2 separated matter. cliche, but for Koi to Yobu the anime story is very entertaining ngl like this is the type of thing that you would binge on.

Now, let\'s get into the anime basics.Story; Our heroine Ichika Arima, your normal high-schooler, saves the man Ryo Amakusa from falling down a flight of stairs at the train station. Not having any connection whatsoever, they both don\'t think of each others meeting as anything important... until Ryo comes home to find Ichika on his couch. Little...did he know the high-schooler who saved his life was his sisters friend from school(WHAT A COINCIDENCE).

You\'re creepy, why would you offer your body to a high-schooler?"". From then on, Ryo pursues Ichika with pure intentions of wanting to be her boyfriend.

I do not encourage anyone to get this anime as a message to get out of the norm and try to court a ""highschooler"" (or a minor depending on your laws). The fictional characters inside this anime are good people, but this kind of relationship does happen in real life. And it could end good, but also, it could end bad or really bad. Is outside the norm and heavily criticized by our current unwritten rules of our living society. So, is an atypical...love story dear reader. Please, watch this anime with proper discretion and with a clear open mind. Don\'t judge it, because it could happen to your daughters, to your sons, to your brothers, to your sisters, to any friend or someone close to you, you never know. I know I\'m speaking as if I have witnessed something like this before, and you are right, this happened to the sister of my best friend. That being said, take this anime as something new to learn about strange relationships that you may never know and make your own conclusions.Continuing...Look dear reader, there are stories that can have issues for the sole fact that it goes against some morals and the unwritten rules of society. And it can end up being a risk to the studio or the company that produces it, or morals of society. Now, those same rules are pushed to the limit because anything goes in love, and more so in the entertainment biz. Koikimo is shocking for the same reason, because the story can uppercut fist your internal moral kidney right from the start. It tells the story of the relationship\'s progress between a salaried adult and a young high school student. (I already said my opinion on how shocking this is in the paragraph above). Regarding the execution of this anime, apart from the story being a whole new perspective, the characters are perfectly structured with the due maturity and the psychological complexity according to the ages presented, adulthood and youth. Superb characterization of the very first rule they have to follow, telling apart the age difference. Now, if you ask my personal opinion, it is enough for me to see the effort they gave to tell a scandalous story but that they came to take into account all the key points within the context. As we already know, according to the relationship between these two characters, an adult and a young student, one can imagine that there will be resistance, reluctant reactions, social criticism, criticism within each personal circle, and the handling of all this issues while keeping the relationship with the utmost discretion. And if we assume that the relationship is going well, other obstacles may appear materializing in internal doubts that can diminish love due to the difference in ages, other love interests, and above all, the reaction of the relatives themselves. The truth is, the story covers that completeness in the context and is perfect, something that is rare and I praise their execution (even the VAs, they did an amazing job). Many times I find the authors, especially in rom-com, having difficulties to create a perfect balance between the positive and negative elements inside the drama of the story in question without leaving gaps or plot holes. This anime should be the clear example of achieving that perfect balance, making not only the story scandalous, but also accurate and perfectly scandalous.For everything else, the art and music is exceptional, performing well and remaining consistent with the mood of the scene. I must highlight this personal thought, it was hard for me to skip the openings and endings because they were a banger.The comedy from my personal perspective does not achieve the diversity that I expected. Sometimes it feels repetitive. I feel like they had to be a bit more creative to make it diversified and let it breathe within the episodes. For that simple reason I do not give it a 10.As I said before, I had the opportunity to witness the progress of a relationship like this one pretty close. You may think that it will affect my objective opinion, but no. It just improves my opinion about this anime that is actually accurate and remarkable, (regardless of its scandalous implications because that\'s subjective to the viewers). That\'s why so many people are not objectively qualifying this anime. So much outrage is undervaluing the quality of this anime. But, makes sense since that is what a morally questionable story will do and I can not do anything about it. I can only say that reality does not care about your morals or your views. Stories can be really surprising, and this kind of stories happen in real life more often than you may know. What you may call a moral issue, is someone romance. What you may call disgusting, is someone else purpose and goal in life. Situations are relative to the people. Is a mistake to judge without knowing the contents. That being said, please watch with discretion, enjoy, analyze and make your own conclusions.Overall score: 9/10 love story dear reader. Please, watch this anime with proper discretion and with a clear open mind. Don\'t judge it, because it could happen to your daughters, to your sons, to your brothers, to your sisters, to any friend or someone close to you, you never know.

Koikimo is shocking for the same reason, because the story can uppercut fist your internal moral kidney right from the start. It tells the story of the relationship\'s progress between a salaried adult and a young high school student. (I already said my opinion on how shocking this is in the paragraph above). Regarding the execution of this anime, apart from the story being a whole new perspective, the characters are perfectly structured with the due maturity and the psychological complexity according to the ages presented, adulthood and youth. Superb characterization of the very first rule they have to follow, telling apart the age difference. Now, if you ask my personal opinion, it is enough for me to see the effort they gave to tell a scandalous story but that they came to take into account all the key points within the context. As we already know, according to the relationship between these two characters, an adult and a young student, one can imagine that there will be resistance, reluctant reactions, social criticism, criticism within each personal circle, and the handling of all this issues while keeping the relationship with the utmost discretion. And if we assume that the relationship is going well, other obstacles may appear materializing in internal doubts that can diminish love due to the difference in ages, other love interests, and above all, the reaction of the relatives themselves. The truth is, the story covers that completeness in the context and is perfect, something that is rare and I praise their execution (even the VAs, they did an amazing job). Many times I find the authors, especially in rom-com, having difficulties to create a perfect balance between the positive and negative elements inside the drama of the story in question without leaving gaps or plot holes. This anime should be the clear example of achieving that perfect balance, making not only the story scandalous, but also accurate and perfectly scandalous.For everything else, the art and music is exceptional, performing well and remaining consistent with the mood of the scene. I must highlight this personal thought, it was hard for me to skip the openings and endings because they were a banger.The comedy from my personal perspective does not achieve the diversity that I expected. Sometimes it feels repetitive. I feel like they had to be a bit more creative to make it diversified and let it breathe within the episodes. For that simple reason I do not give it a 10.As I said before, I had the opportunity to witness the progress of a relationship like this one pretty close. You may think that it will affect my objective opinion, but no. It just improves my opinion about this anime that is actually accurate and remarkable, (regardless of its scandalous implications because that\'s subjective to the viewers). That\'s why so many people are not objectively qualifying this anime. So much outrage is undervaluing the quality of this anime. But, makes sense since that is what a morally questionable story will do and I can not do anything about it. I can only say that reality does not care about your morals or your views. Stories can be really surprising, and this kind of stories happen in real life more often than you may know. What you may call a moral issue, is someone romance. What you may call disgusting, is someone else purpose and goal in life. Situations are relative to the people. Is a mistake to judge without knowing the contents. That being said, please watch with discretion, enjoy, analyze and make your own conclusions.Overall score: 9/10', ""I'm not a fan of long reviews so I'm going to keep this short and to the point...Just a generic shoujo aimed at females. Its as generic as generic can get with nothing new to offer other than having a 17 year old girl like a handsome, wealthy 27 year old guy, who happens to be her best friends brother. Despite this huge age gap, the show is self aware of how it is bad, although some characters don't show it.  However, the heroine knows its wrong, and later on other characters mention it too as well as guy who likes the heroine....The story as I said is just a typical romance comedy, in the end it offered nothing original and was basic from the start to the end.The art was pretty normal, there was use of CGI which was noticeable but wasn't anything too major and did not harm anything much. But other than that the art was just standard. The animations were okay I guess.The characters were the typical you would expect. Otaku heroine who likes a handsome guy and they fall in love, classic romance. Most characters did not get much about them, so they seemed mostly bland.The voices sounded a bit weird in my opinion but it wasn't anything major.Story - 5Art - 5Sound - 4Characters - 6Enjoyment - 5Overall - 5I wouldn't say its worth watching, you can skip this.

I don\'t know if people are overreacting because they watched the show or just because they wanted to jump on the bandwagon of bashing it purely based on its title.Koikimo is nothing like it is often described. As someone whose relatives met and got together in similar ages (18-25), I can tell you, anyone who is quick to dismiss this series just because of the age difference is seriously jumping the gun. Not every relationship with an age gap is predatory, and high school is...the regular age where people start being conscious of romantic relationships. Ryo and Ichika actually have a very fun and respectful rapport and banter. He is the one who is romantically pursuing her at the beginning, but people are acting like he\'s sending her dirty pictures instead of flowers. When did our perception get so twisted?Koikimo is honestly, depicting one of the healthiest relationships in shoujo/josei series. People are bashing it and then clapping right under series like Higehiro, while I\'m left dumbfounded and think: ""Wait. Koikimo is your problem? Does anyone remember that series where the guy was blackmailing the girl and treated her like a dog? Or the one he bullied her? Or the one he stalked her? Or the one he straight out threatened to r*pe her? Or the one he called her an idiot, never appreciated her and she ended up antagonizing her own daughter for his attention? Or the one she fell off of a building because he rejected her? Or the one she got pregnant, didn\'t know who the father was and chose to go with the most wealthy one? Or the one she was actively pursuing a man of not 10, but 30 years of age difference - no, not that one. The other one. Or the one she was so *cutely innocent* she thought that holding hands was naughty? Or the one that he was an immortal non-human being that bought her in a human auction?

It is basically the story of how two people of 10 or so years of difference will end up together. There is no sexual aspect to the series - the romantic interest is there but it is purely platonic. There are 3 episodes left but I doubt that anything more than a kiss will ever happen in this series. They might not even get together before Ichika hits the age of 18 - it\'s a serious possibility, since she\'s 17 in the series universe. They are flirting. They are having fun. They are struggling. Ryo is funny. Ichika\'s reactions are funny. And that\'s fine. Ryo isn\'t predating on Ichika - he sincerely has a crush on her, and even though he teases her constantly to get the ""disgusted"" reaction out of her, he is actually very respectful, never crosses the line to make her uncomfortable or creeped out for real, and has never laid hands on her, not even as a joke.It\'s seriously not a harmful series, not in any way. I know that anyone who might think so tries to warn others about the dangers of being predated on in high school by older men, and that is a real danger, (regardless of the age of consent, which is different in many parts of the world) but we need to understand that this is a fictional series. It doesn\'t depict the situation you think it does and it doesn\'t contribute in absolutely any way to any harmful real life situations. Seriously, what do you think will happen? That a real life high school girl will watch this and then will be made a victim by a predator?

Looking at the quality of the anime itself, there isn\'t much to like: the art is average, the animation is often choppy, and the sound quality is poor.The technical issues are far from the worst aspect of this anime, though. Plenty of people have already pointed out the flaws in the plot/characters, so I\'ll get straight to the point: a 27-year-old man pursuing a girl ten years his junior is creepy no matter how you slice it. It\'s frustrating how self-aware this anime is of its own disgusting...premise whilst still trying to masquerade as a cute, lighthearted romcom.Ryo is selfish, possessive, incredibly manipulative, and downright gross. Masuda, Rio, and Ichika\'s mother are hardly any better; each of them manipulate her into believing that its acceptable for her MANY protests against Ryo\'s pusuit of her to be ignored in favor of allowing Ryo\'s self-serving, disgusting behavior to continue unchecked. Meanwhile, the age-appropriate love interests of the two main characters are completely ignored despite being FAR better choices.If age-gap romance is your thing, there\'s plenty of content out there that features two mature, consenting adults in a healthy relationship. Koikomo does not.When Ichicka finally confesses in the last episode, she says that Ryo is ""on the verge of comitting a crime"" by pursuing a relationship with her.

I don\'t even hate it for the usual reasons people seem to hate it for (the huge 10 year age gap, and the fact it\'s borderline pedophilia).Koikimo is about a 27-year old successful, good-looking businessman named Ryo and his romantic pursuits of his younger sister\'s 17-year-old high school friend whose name is Ichika. On the surface it already raises a red flag with a grown ass man romantically pursuing a high schooler, but it\'s not...bad enough for you to just judge without giving it at least a chance. That being said though, it\'s MUCH worse than that summary.Simply put Ryo\'s actions from start to finish were absolutely appalling. Not only did he want to sleep with her almost immediately after their 2nd time meeting, but after she denies his advances, he suddenly falls in love with her and decides he\'ll instead stalk, harass, send unwanted gifts and make dodgy late night phone calls with her every night?

Instead, she ENCOURAGES it, because in her words, ""It would be fun to see my brother dating my best friend"". Yes great reasoning for enabling and actively helping her brother\'s creepy behavior.

When you are at the movies watching an action movie and you see the MC killing a bunch of people and causing a lot of distruction. Do you abandon the cinema because he\'s doing things that are wrong in reality? of course you...don\'t! You know it\'s a movie (not real life). Not all adults in real life have ""predatory settings"" in their brain. Even if some fall in love with minors (depending on the context of course, not everyboy has bad intentions in life, of course there are some bad apples out there and I wish all girls in the world to be safe and sound but this show doesn\'t have anything to do with a predator-like man). It\'s not like a little girl will watch this and say ""oh, I would like to have a 27 year-old random boyfriend"", at most she would just want a bf that treats her like him.HelenaHills*** basically said what needed to be said so I will copy-paste part of his comments here (agree 100% with this person):Koikimo is nothing like it is often described.

If anything, please normalize relationships that are respectful despite the odds and not the ""I treat you like garbage because I actually like you and because I have a bad relationship with my parents, doesn\'t that make your heart melt, I\'m such a misunderstood bad boy"" ones. don\'t! You know it\'s a movie (not real life). Not all adults in real life have ""predatory settings"" in their brain. Even if some fall in love with minors (depending on the context of course, not everyboy has bad intentions in life, of course there are some bad apples out there and I wish all girls in the world to be safe and sound but this show doesn\'t have anything to do with a predator-like man). It\'s not like a little girl will watch this and say ""oh, I would like to have a 27 year-old random boyfriend"", at most she would just want a bf that treats her like him.HelenaHills*** basically said what needed to be said so I will copy-paste part of his comments here (agree 100% with this person):Koikimo is nothing like it is often described. As someone whose relatives met and got together in similar ages (18-25), I can tell you, anyone who is quick to dismiss this series just because of the age difference is seriously jumping the gun. Not every relationship with an age gap is predatory, and high school is the regular age where people start being conscious of romantic relationships. Ryo and Ichika actually have a very fun and respectful rapport and banter. He is the one who is romantically pursuing her at the beginning, but people are acting like he\'s sending her dirty pictures instead of flowers. When did our perception get so twisted?Koikimo is honestly, depicting one of the healthiest relationships in shoujo/josei series. People are bashing it and then clapping right under series like Higehiro, while I\'m left dumbfounded and think: ""Wait. Koikimo is your problem? Does anyone remember that series where the guy was blackmailing the girl and treated her like a dog? Or the one he bullied her? Or the one he stalked her? Or the one he straight out threatened to r*pe her? Or the one he called her an idiot, never appreciated her and she ended up antagonizing her own daughter for his attention? Or the one she fell off of a building because he rejected her? Or the one she got pregnant, didn\'t know who the father was and chose to go with the most wealthy one? Or the one she was actively pursuing a man of not 10, but 30 years of age difference - no, not that one. The other one. Or the one she was so *cutely innocent* she thought that holding hands was naughty? Or the one that he was an immortal non-human being that bought her in a human auction? And... in the midst of all of that... Koikimo is our problem????""I\'m not saying these series shouldn\'t have existed: On the contrary. We seriously need to outgrow the constant censorship of ideas just because some people might find them uncomfortable - art doesn\'t (and shouldn\'t) always tend to your personal needs. That\'s a) impossible and b) it defeats the purpose of challenging new ideas. I\'m not saying there shouldn\'t be boundaries, especially where childlike characteristics and childhood seems to be projected as anything remotely sexual - there are lines you don\'t cross. But there also needs to be a distinction between series that work as ""comfort food"" and the rest.Koikimo is very nearly trending towards the comfort food territory, but it still has the age gap hook to challenge so it never quite gets there. It is basically the story of how two people of 10 or so years of difference will end up together. There is no sexual aspect to the series - the romantic interest is there but it is purely platonic. There are 3 episodes left but I doubt that anything more than a kiss will ever happen in this series. They might not even get together before Ichika hits the age of 18 - it\'s a serious possibility, since she\'s 17 in the series universe. They are flirting. They are having fun. They are struggling. Ryo is funny. Ichika\'s reactions are funny. And that\'s fine. Ryo isn\'t predating on Ichika - he sincerely has a crush on her, and even though he teases her constantly to get the ""disgusted"" reaction out of her, he is actually very respectful, never crosses the line to make her uncomfortable or creeped out for real, and has never laid hands on her, not even as a joke.It\'s seriously not a harmful series, not in any way. I know that anyone who might think so tries to warn others about the dangers of being predated on in high school by older men, and that is a real danger, (regardless of the age of consent, which is different in many parts of the world) but we need to understand that this is a fictional series. It doesn\'t depict the situation you think it does and it doesn\'t contribute in absolutely any way to any harmful real life situations. Seriously, what do you think will happen? That a real life high school girl will watch this and then will be made a victim by a predator? If anything, please normalize relationships that are respectful despite the odds and not the ""I treat you like garbage because I actually like you and because I have a bad relationship with my parents, doesn\'t that make your heart melt, I\'m such a misunderstood bad boy"" ones.', ""Edit 1: Wording.This review does not contain exact spoliers, but you can predict the plot based on my conclusions.Jumping right into the question of whether or not you'll even be able to enjoy this or whether you'll want to watch this, it ultimately boils down to one main reason. The reason being your culture: if you come from a society that frowns upon the relationships between adults or minors, you're unlikely to find this watchable.However if you can continue to swim forward, look past the age differences of the main characters and start watching this show, it probably still isn't worth your time.The characteristic...features of the show's mains is one of the things I found quite enjoyable: romance revolves around a cool guy in his twenties that sleeps around and a shy undecisive highschool girl. The people used in this situation in other anime are usually just regular highschoolers or adults with no differentiating qualities to their name.The plot though is as basic as they get: from the moment they met, Ryo (the dude) tries to pursuade Ichika (the girl) into dating him. That's not completely wrong, no, but it just got very tiring to me and eventually burned itself out.The personalities of the main characters were ordinary and annoying, sometimes being unable to decide or just expressing questionable behaviour. To add, the characters actually got a background that wasn't important at all to the main focus of this anime, it seemed as they were just mere decorations to the characters. To bring an example (this shouldn't spoil anything): Ryo actually had some disputes with his father about his lifestyle, yet it didn't even matter at all or even conclude in any way. This act of adding useless information for the viewer just clogs up his/her memory and is just pointless.The worst being the supporting characters maybe except for one (Ryo's little sister), who actually played a proper role in progressing their relationship. As for all the others, they hardly contributed and, the more the show went on, the more they were forgotten.*MINOR SPOILER*Now the thing that you were looking for when you came here, romance, is actually present in this work, but in a mediocre condition. Ryo and Ichika are most of the time the focus of action, yet the progress is so slow and literally depends on only Ichika's indecisiveness. The romance is merely visible at all during the first half and slowly only starts to appear later.Still I can appreciate the whole balance of the flow, the chill vibe the show gives and the effort that went in. I wish the ending was less rushed and that they would have spent more time on a clear and conclusive ending to this story.In conclusion the show has few enjoyable keypoints, but didn't excel at anything and it will not be remembered for it's content, but perhaps for its age related topics. features of the show's mains is one of the things I found quite enjoyable: romance revolves around a cool guy in his twenties that sleeps around and a shy undecisive highschool girl.

That’s it. With all the contrasting extreme love/hate reviews I’ve read all over for this show for me it’s a solid 5. Because this show is just as bad as it “could” have been good. Confusing I know. Let me explain.So, the title clearly says, “It’s disgusting to call this Love”. And yes, it is! There are so many aspects that make this relationship cringy. Ichika, the 17-year-old high schooler, clearly rejects Ryou, the 27-year-old office worker. In spite of all her NO’s he still keeps on pursuing her by every means possible for his own amusement. All of it’s just plain...creepy. But hey! it’s in the title so I guess that’s the point. That’s what the creators wanted you to feel and they did their job.But what majorly bothered me was, out of all the points in this particular “love” that could be called “disgusting” the creepy age gap/issue is nowhere addressed as it should be. Everyone in the show seem pretty nonchalant about it. Ryou’s friend, Ryou’s sister, who is also Ichika’s friend, even Ichika’s mom. They all are ok with it. And that broke my brain. Especially since, I am watching Higehiro simultaneously, a show which is basically revolves around the aspect of the underage/age gap issue in depth. So, watching Koikimo, making this into a pretty casual romance made me glitch. And that got me thinking. If that was the case, and out of all the red flags in this relationship if this was not going to be one of them, then they could have honestly done it without the 27-year-old guy. Ryou could have just as easily been a senpai in her high school teasing her the same way, pursuing her the same way and it might have the same effect. So, if it about the “chase”, and there are people into it, sure this could have been an actual fun anime, silly, cute romance that usually is expected or appreciated in shoujo animes, right? So honestly the ridiculous age gap wasn’t even needed for the plot that they intended to go with.Now for the things I did appreciated in this anime:1. I do really like the voice acting for Ryo-san done by Toshiyugi Toyonaga. So, I didn’t mind listing to him being cheesy and a tease through my earphone every once in a while.2. The OP is pretty boppin'; it took me less then 5 seconds to add this to my Spotify playlist of animes tracks.3..(Minor spoiler) Major second lead syndrome. Both male and female. If you powered through the show the way I did and are caught up, y’all should be rooting for Tamara-kun, ne? ne? They make way more sense to me than this entire show.All that being said, once I tried to put aside my brains issue with the age gap, thinking it’s a silly romance anime, there were some moments where I did giggle or occasionally went all aww. But that’s pretty much it. This show isn’t anything special, nor is it anything outright creepy. It just did what the title suggests. But honestly there are much cuter romance animes out there that are worth your time if you are genuinely conflicted about this one. You aren’t missing out on anything too special.Will I watch it to the end to see if the creators have something up their sleeve to point out why exactly they are calling this “love” if it’s disgusting? Maybe. Will I drop it? Quiet possibly. Let’s see. It’s disgusting to call this curiosity. ;p (sorry! I had to. don’t hate me). creepy. But hey! it’s in the title so I guess that’s the point.

Amakusa Ryou(the lead male) kinda reminds me of Hayami from Glass no Kamen, both have great sense with flowers. Well at the start of the story i didn't except much but a good laugh, but later romantic rivalry makes the story serious. But i can say every age group can enjoy this show, nothing 'kimochi warui',with absolutely no fan service just pure love romance and genuine feelings just captivates my heart. The most i could say that this anime deserves better...than so much hate. than so much hate."", 'Is... is this what grooming looks like?The story begins with Ichika (17?) saving Ryou (27?) from falling down the stairs and after this she offers her own lunch because he looks pale. By mere coincidence, turns out Ichika is Ryou\'s sister\'s friend and it\'s visiting their house (who for some reason until then has never been to their house until that same day...). After Ryou offers to have sex with Ichika as thanks (wtf), and she calls him disgusting for offering something so rude, Ryou falls in love with a minor, I mean, with Ichika. And after that day he starts courting (stalking) her.I...wanted to watch this anime because the premise sounded a bit interesting and tbh, some seiyus I like worked in it, but I thought the age gap was going to be something like 4 years (Ichika 18, Ryou 22), but nope, a 10 freaking years age gap. So that\'s my biggest issue with this, and probably I would keep on watching if the story was good, but maaan is it bad.I thought we were past toxic ""romantic"" stories with bad writing that only promote unhealthy behaviours, it made me feel like it was the early 2000\'s all over again.The way Ryou stalks Ichika is creepy and disgusting, she repeatedly asks him to stop but Ryou doesn\'t give a flying ffff. Ichika is a plain and boring character, at first I thought she was going to be like Nanami from Kamisama Hajimemashita, but I was soon very disappointed, she\'s blank, like the ""insert your name here"" type of character blank, but still, she\'s being the victim of a grooming adult so I won\'t judge her besides saying she\'s boring.It\'s effed up that Rio (Ryou\'s sister), instead of making his brother 10 years older stop harassing her friend, encourages them to date and even gives Ichika\'s personal information to her brother so he can stalk her friend with more ease.To add insult to injury, Ichika\'s mom is completely ok with a man (10 years older than her daughter), sending Ichika flowers and even let him into Ichika\'s room completely unsupervised!I know that this is a fictitious story, but c\'mon!The humor is dead with this anime, every joke is seriously not funny, almost every joke revolves around Ryou stalking Ichika and it\'s so poorly written that it only makes me mad, and I\'ve laughed with jokes revolving stalking before, but this anime can\'t be humorous no matter how hard it tries.The animation it\'s passable, there are some parts where the drawings and backgrounds are not that good and look wonky, but if you don\'t care about animation that much, you won\'t notice.About the voice acting: it\'s decent, but I was disappointed with Ryou\'s seiyu, his voice sounds forced and it makes Ryou even more annoying than his character already is. It\'s as if he\'s trying too much to sound like a ""gentleman"" or a ""sexy man"" but it only made my skin crawl a bit. wanted to watch this anime because the premise sounded a bit interesting and tbh, some seiyus I like worked in it, but I thought the age gap was going to be something like 4 years (Ichika 18, Ryou 22), but nope, a 10 freaking years age gap.

They’re not overly dramatic and are very realistic. They’re all mature about handling their feelings, which is a huge breath of fresh air.The art and designs are pretty good too, and the OP and ED may be in my top 3 of the season.All of the characters reflect on their actions and grow from them, especially...the male lead who is deemed as “creepy.” I was honestly nervous watching him throughout the whole way, but the last few episodes really solidified his character and growth for meThe female lead, Ichika, is a pretty normal girl, but she’s honest about her feelings and doesn’t let Ryo push her too far, and knows where to draw the line. This balance is what makes the show work.The series also has a conclusive and very satisfying ending. Unlike most shows that get worse as they go on, the finale really made the anime for me.Age gap is properly addressed by many others as well as Ichika and Ryo.[SPOILER (May be important to know if you are considering watching tho)]Ichika and Ryo decide to wait until she is an ADULT before formally getting together. Big pog!!!Cons:Ryo is creepy. He just is. For the first half of the anime, he calls, follows, and flirts with her, giving her unconditionally unwanted attention. This is played off as a comedic gag, but the series touches over these issues several times and does not brush over them. Nevertheless, he is creepy.The sound for the VAs in the first few eps is rough, assuredly due to COVID restrictions. This didn’t stop me from watching, but it did make those scenes less immersive, so beware.The other 3 supporting characters don’t really get a conclusion of their own. This may or may not be touched upon in the manga, but as an anime only, I was slightly dissatisfied.Overall, good show, better than I thought it’d be, and if you like romcoms that don’t drag on with misunderstandings and have good pacing, give this a shot! the male lead who is deemed as “creepy.” I was honestly nervous watching him throughout the whole way, but the last few episodes really solidified his character and growth for meThe female lead, Ichika, is a pretty normal girl, but she’s honest about her feelings and doesn’t let Ryo push her too far, and knows where to draw the line.

A 27yr old man in love with a 17yr old girl is something that cannot be considered romantic. Not to mention the way Ryo acts, he is harassing Arima in every way possible. I'm surprised that no other character from anime has reported him to the police yet.I'm rooting that these two don't end up together because that would just make the whole anime even more messed up. I'm not against age...difference, but 10 years? That sir, in my opinion, is not justifiable in any way.

At first episode, I had to stop watching as I find Ryo creepy and disgusting. Red flag was up the moment Ryo met Ichika the second time and learned she was actually his sister's friend. What he said that time is not what a man would normally say to a teenager, so yep, it was a no-no.A couple of weeks later, I gave the...series another chance thinking that it couldn't be just all that. There might be still a depth in the story. I thought about condemning the author if she/he made Ryo a total scum who had nothing in mind but harass a teenager who is a decade younger than him.I am quick to judge, but somehow, I am not closed-minded. I tend to look for reasons and to give benefit of a doubt. Though I agree pedophilia is one serious and very alarming issue and should not be tolerated, I wouldn't go as far as condemning ALL age gapped and teenager-adult romantic relationship, as not all adults mean harm to the younger ones, which was shown in KoiKimo.KoiKimo (author) seems to admit how disgusting the MCs situation is, as the title implies. But I like how the series actually tries to show the different side of age-gapped relationship—a side that most people refuse to see and try to understand because of disgust.At first, I definitely questioned Ryo's sincerity for Ichika. What I thought was—he was only challenged by Ichika's attitude which is the total opposite of the women he used to date. Ichika used to always refuse him, which left him impressed as again, he used to get his ways easily with grown up women.Never was it shown that Ryo was pursuing Ichika because he had malicious intent, nor because he wanted to abuse or exploit her(so technically, there was no grooming involved)Ryo came to a point that he also got confused with what he was feeling for Ichika, but then was enlightened by his friend, Masuda-san, when they had the chance to talk about it. No wonder he would be confused because again, Ichika was never like his previous women.Ryo was actually falling in love with Ichika, and people close to him knew and understood that, hence the support they've given him(especially Rio).I doubt Rio would support her brother if he would be that bad for her best friend. Rio, out of all the charas, is the one who knows both of the MCs really well.On the other hand, Ichika clearly knew she shouldn't be attaching any strings to Ryo. Ryo was an adult pest and she found him disgusting but due to Ryo being persistent on annoying her, it just has become a daily routine and got used to him. At the same time, she got the chance to know him better. And slowly, she was falling for him as well.Ryo was willing to let everybody else know that he is in love with a teenager only to prove that he was serious about Ichika.Ichika, however, knew the consequence so she ended up lying about the two of them dating on White Day.Ichika has learned that Ryo was not an actual creep she thought he was, but she was dead aware of how judgemental and harsh society is(just like the majority of the viewers of this show) and realistically, she had grown wary of other people's opinion.Ryo, although kinda too late, had realized and understood Ichika's fear. He came to a point that he decided to try leaving Ichika to save her from scrutiny of other people.Ichika, not wanting to totally let go of Ryo, ended up asking him a favor to wait for her until she becomes an adult. The latter agreed, of course. Why? Because he is in love. Because both of them are genuinely in love.Nope. The series is not tolerating pedophilia. It is not fantasizing something that is wrong. It's just telling a different story about something society is disgusted about.This series will only bare those who can actually understand, and those who are blinded by their so-called morals. series another chance thinking that it couldn't be just all that.

It's just telling a different story about something society is disgusted about.This series will only bare those who can actually understand, and those who are blinded by their so-called morals."", 'Okay, lets begin with the controversy.I will be honest, for me personally, the age gap was not that big of a deal. I am not saying that it is completely healthy or normal or right, for an adult pursuing a relationship with high school girl, but honestly, it is not disgusting or terrible either. It happens sometimes.When I was in high school, 3 of my classmates were in relationship with adults, age gap was very similar, if not exactly the same. So growing up and seeing this on daily basis, I got used to it. Probably because of this environment, It does not...bother me that much.Also, I think that animation is partially responsible for the fact, that I don\'t find the age gap that bad. Visually, I don\'t see any major difference between the 17 yo and 27 yo in this series. They looked pretty similar to me, around the same age, so sometimes, I just ""forgot"" that he is much older. I was actually more disturbed, in some other series I watched in the past, where 18 yo looked like 11 yo.I didn\'t have any major problems with the characters. I will not talk about the main characters, but rather focus on supporting ones. I don\'t think that Rio and Masuda were bad people, because they supported the idea of Ryou dating a high schooler. I had the impression, that they actually supported the change in Ryou\'s behavior. That he is capable of truly caring for someone, that he is slowly becoming a better version of himself. It was not like he was trying to sleep with Ichika, he bought her bunch of flowers, helped her with homework and was speaking with her on the phone.Also, that thing with Ichika\'s mom letting Ryou enter Ichika\'s room when she had the cold. Was it really that bad? Mom actually asked Ichika, if I remember correctly, 3 times, if it is really OK to let him in. On top of that, mom and Ryuo had a 30 min chat before and he explained that he is her best friend\'s older brother. He wasn\'t some stranger in my opinion...To sum up, I had mixed opinions at the beginning, but overally, I enjoyed it. So in general, if you are not strictly against the age gap relationships, give it a try. Animation and sound are nice, story is very simple but entertaining, ideal for binge-watching. bother me that much.Also, I think that animation is partially responsible for the fact, that I don\'t find the age gap that bad.

People will find the first episodes creepy and weird and I was quite ashamed to share to people that I love watching this anime. People might find me creepy or questionable too. But after watching all the episodes, I was at peace and I was proud to have witnessed such sincere story hence the review. It's a shame for those who cant get passed the early episodes but is still understandable.KoiKimo is not just a romcom. It delivers a great lesson...thru its maturing characters anchored by love and support. The questionable premise was resolved without compromise of what really matters.Story10/10 - Has great dialogues and lessons. Premise is not really something  different but the delivery, characters, and resolution made it stand out among its peers. Weird at first but remained wholesome throughout.Characters10/10 - You will see the flaws in the first episodes but they always move forward. Character development is the main point. Main and supporting characters made matured decisions and developed naturally, and not forcefully and out of the blue. The characters really carried the story. I think, if not all, most of them, delivered great dialogues and imparted different lessons.Art9/10 - I thought it could have been refined more especially the transitions but what really drives the score high are the art clips in the ending credits plus the huge moments in the stories depicted in simple yet captivating picture.Sound9.5/10 - Voice acting was great  but the recording was not good (I read somewhere that VAs recorded at home due to restrictions). This anime has the best opening and ending songs I have heard for any animes in the Spring 2021 Line upEnjoyment11/10 - I wish I could score this higher than 10.  I really really enjoyed this anime and in the end also gave me peace. This anime is very funny, has some unique comedic flairs, wholesome, light, and sincere.Overall10/10 - Funny. Wholesome. Light. Romantic. Sincere.This anime is not life changing and share few but noticeable similarities to animes with the same premise. But this one is an eye-opener and unique in many, many ways. The story is not driven by its audience's motivation or wants but the characters'. The story felt like it did not belong to anyone except the characters' but it did not feel unrelatable to me. I was like a friend or someone beside them in the train or coffee shop enjoying the romance and funny dialogue and listening to them realizing things and making matured decisions.I am looking forward to some animes with the same resolve. thru its maturing characters anchored by love and support.

I am not one of those people and I only started the anime not realizing what it was. I wish I didn’t have this problem where if I start something I must finish it or it will bother me, because that’s the only reason I watched to the end. So, just be aware that my review may not give this show justice but I’m trying to be fair.(Mild spoiler warning here on in) It felt uncomfortable to watch most of the time being that the male protagonist...really pushes his feelings onto his love interest. I’m not sure I would enjoy watching a guy do that to a girl of the same age, so I definitely don’t enjoy seeing it happen to a younger girl. She is even visibly disturbed by all of it, but somehow still ends up slowly falling for him. In fact, at a particular part of the series where both protagonists have other characters taking interest in them individually, I was hoping it would work, just so I wouldn’t have to see a grown man hitting on a high school girl anymore (I knew it wouldn’t happen since that would defeat the purpose of the story but a guy can dream…).The characters themselves aren’t anything different and the only reason I don’t like the protagonists is because one is creepy (he’s literally called that in the anime too) and the other one just seems easily manipulated after enough force. The only thing I saw good about the male protagonist was that near the end he becomes aware of how assertive he was but by then it seemed pointless to even come to that realization since he’s already won the girl over for the most part.Putting my personal tastes aside though, it was a pretty mediocre show. Art was average, story didn’t seem special (aside from the age difference aspect), and I will probably forget the characters in a week. I tried to watch the last few episodes from the point of view that the main girl is almost an adult and then it will be fine, but since the anime was all about a guy chasing a young girl I still couldn’t feel comfortable watching it. Therefore, I just couldn’t really care to try and find the silver linings, so I’m sorry if you enjoy big age differences but it’s just not for me. So, if you do like that kind of stuff, you may enjoy it and I don’t judge you… we all have something different we like. If you’re like me then I suggest you just skip it since it isn’t really worth your time if you’re only gonna be uncomfortable while watching. really pushes his feelings onto his love interest.

However, with the episodes that followed, all the development of the story and the relationship of the characters, Koikimo turns out to be a very wholesome anime to watch. Of course, the age difference is difficult to deal with, but it is important to understand how this difference in ages affects the environment around the main characters and themselves. I think for those who like a good rom-com Koikimo is a great option to laugh, cry and have a great time.Personally, I really enjoyed Koikimo. Although I liked it, I think some aspects...could have been better developed. Despite a great development in the relationship of the characters, I felt that something was missing that would make each one of them unique. The animation is quite ordinary, with nothing special to note. Finally, I just have to say that Koikimo has one of the best openings of the Spring 2021 anime season.PT:Após ver o primeiro episódio de Koikimo fiquei um bocado receoso.

By the synopsis alone you might think it's gonna be weird and creepy and I also thought this going into it. What I got was a super wholesome very enjoyable story about a dude who's just simply infatuated.There really is a lot to like about this show, the characters are all really sweet and likeable, and also strangely realistic for a show like this. Our main two are definitely the highlight of this show but there are also some side characters I thoroughly...enjoyed too. But speaking about those main two, the way they're portrayed is very realistic, if they existed in real life you'd expect them to behave like they do in the anime - they both stay very true to their characters, Ryo especially - he's incredibly charismatic but this charisma doesn't need to be explained, he almost oozes it through the screen. The whole issue of the age gap is one I honestly tried not to ruminate too much on, obviously it's a major plot point but the show is so wholesome that I didn't let it get to me and I think this is how you were meant to view it instead of getting angry because this is an anime not real life.The comedy in this show definitely doesn't miss, it's very light-hearted and I found myself smiling from the start of each ep all the way through to the end, it kind of just has this weird really happy energy to it..? It's hard to explain but it's the type of show to always put you in a good mood. Plot-wise the development definitely moves at a good pace and nothing feels rushed, you believe that the characters would think how they do and you definitely root for them.I gave this an 8 because while I think it is definitely above average, it just didn't have that special spark required for a 9 or above, not because it's flawed necessarily. Also I don't know where else to mention this but DAMN the OP is insanely good!Overall, if you can look past the age gap, this show is really wholesome and fun with a realistic cast of characters, I'd recommend it if you are looking for a lighthearted romcom but I don't think you'd miss much if you didn't watch it. enjoyed too.

Now that that\'s out of the way, let me do a serious review about this series.Story - 9/10========================The story is fresh and I don\'t think I\'ve ever seem something quite like this series. All in all, it\'s pretty wholesome and funny, the guy is indeed insistent, but I can understand him because love rarely knows boundaries.It\'s also nice watching them both slowly falling in love with each other,...and the comedy it ultimately leads to each episode.Trying not to spoil anything, the end is just as you\'d expect of a ROMANTIC comedy anime series. Maybe that\'s spoilers enough?Art - 8/10========================Art is good, but nothing special like you\'d find in Vivy Fluorite Eye\'s Song (the hand drawn eyes, cenery and expressions in that series is seriously 11/10), so I\'d almost all it standard art for nowadays common sense.Sound - 6/10========================By far the worst thing in the series, the voice of some male characters specifically is muffled and sounds like they\'re in a bathroom or something, which is kind of a turn off. I wouldn\'t drop it just because of that though, as the other points do compensate for this bad feature.Character - 8/10========================Characters are well written, albeit they\'re not original, I\'ve seen plenty tsundere-type like the female MC, and the male MC is just kinda of a bully in love? Some Nagatoro vibes without the actual bullying? I don\'t know. They just don\'t seem good enough for more than a 9.Enjoyment - 9/10========================Even knowing more or less how the end would be, specially because of the final cover of the final volume of the manga series - seriously, the author didn\'t even try to hide that -, even if you don\'t read it, it takes but a picture to show you what\'ll happen.Anyway, I was digressing. The series is fun, quite wholesome, the male MC is sort of a chad and is loyal to his feelings, and the female lead is a tsundere, but slowly becomes more dere as the series go on, and she even takes the initiative to (SPOILER ALERT) invite him on a date on the last episode. (SPOILER ALERT END).So there\'s actual character development (maybe I should\'ve added this in Character?), comedy, a bit of drama, (SPOILER ALERT) I\'ll never ever forget the woman crying after she gets rejected by MMC, it was a very sweet and sad moment in the series (SPOILER ALERT END) and, of course, romance. They\'re all very well distributed and the series does surprise you sometimes with some sad moments.Overall - 8/10========================I\'ve not found this series to be a Masterpiece, but it\'s still very good and I do recommend you watch it. There are some reviews that point the series at 1, but seriously, I think both of them on the front page are by guys that either only review with 1 or 10, or another guy who only scores 1 or 2. I don\'t know about you, but I cannot give credit to crap like that. There\'s no way a series is so bad it\'s a 1, or it\'s so good it\'s a 10, for like, 5 reviews, or every single anime series you\'ve watched is 1 or 2.Anyway, I digressed again.The series is a nice change of pace, although it does stay in our Highschool-like comedic romance turf, but it\'s new because it goes into quite unexplored territory with a romance with quite a gap in age, something haters love to point out as being ""rapey"" or whatever. (SPOILER ALERT) Dude, they barely even kissed, and he did promisse he\'d wait until she became an adult (whenever that is, really), so... Yeah, I really can\'t agree with that bullshittery. (SPOILER ALERT END).Anyway, that\'s it for this one, I\'m guessing this review will never go front page because haters and people who actually watched the series posted way before and have hundreds of the ""Helpful"" thing, but I do hope this review helps you to decide whether or not to watch Koikimo. and the comedy it ultimately leads to each episode.Trying not to spoil anything, the end is just as you\'d expect of a ROMANTIC comedy anime series.

Where you see a cute boy who works fall in love with a teenager, from minute one there is the age conflict that leaves you shocked. After a while he begins to focus on the conquest of the girl who did not give him any wave he did not want to relate to the boy since he was not attracted to him. As the chapters go by, the boy has to think of ways to conquer her and little by little we see how a closeness with the protagonist is created each time they are closer until the last chapter...arrives. The anime is very entertaining if you want to see a romance between a schoolgirl and someone older I recommend it if you want to see a generic romance this is not your anime, it is good because it comes out of what we are used to but the plot does not convince me since the protagonist insists a lot, a lot.En español:Anime corto de 12 capítulos.

I'm pretty sure there are other mangas/animes that highlight an adult to teenager age gap, but this was the 1st one i've ever watched. and i have to say, it's pretty good. i like how the pacing is just right, nothing is...too rushed, though i haven't read the manga yet, so i have no idea if the anime cut anything out from the manga or not. either way, as an anime watcher, the story was smooth, and made me anticipate every Monday to watch this. i also like how the characters don't just instantly fall in love, but the development and the doubt that forms for their situation really hit it for me. it felt very realistic.Art: 7.8/10. the animation was fluid, and it showed the character's expressions really well.Sound: 8/10. for some reason i really like how Ryo's voice (the mc) sounded, it suited him perfectly; awesome work for Toshiyuki-san there. He really made it sound very natural, and it didn't feel forced.Character: 7.6/10. the main characters were splendid. it's the side characters that bug me a bit. i honestly wanted them to have a little bit more role in the story rather than just supporting the mcs, but i guess i expected a bit too much. i felt that they were none other than love interests thrown in for the plot.Enjoyment: 9/10. i iked it a lot. at first i thought that wtf why am i enjoying an adult and a highschooler romance...cause it sounds really weird if i try describe it to anyone else LMAOOverall: 8.4/10. what really made me like it is how mature the mcs were in approaching their feelings. it's definitely different from your average high school romance, whereas in here every single feeling is thought out carefully, and they don't just instantly accept the fact they are in love with each other.on another note the op and the ed slap so hard. will miss hearing these absolute bangers every week :(imo it's definitely worth the watch, especially if you enjoy big age gaps. i never thought i would give it a try, but i don't regret watching this at all. too rushed, though i haven't read the manga yet, so i have no idea if the anime cut anything out from the manga or not. either way, as an anime watcher, the story was smooth, and made me anticipate every Monday to watch this. i also like how the characters don't just instantly fall in love, but the development and the doubt that forms for their situation really hit it for me. it felt very realistic.Art: 7.8/10. the animation was fluid, and it showed the character's expressions really well.Sound: 8/10. for some reason i really like how Ryo's voice (the mc) sounded, it suited him perfectly; awesome work for Toshiyuki-san there.

Indeed a 27 yr old guy is hitting on a 17 yr old girl may seem weird, I wont say creepy, because the Male MC didnt go over the line into forcing sexual harassment (meaning rape), but rather he tried winning the girls heart and I would say that this is cute and sweet. If it would develop into a pure and plain relationship I will not say there is anything wrong to it, since age doesn't manner as we always say. I may just started watching...the anime but I will give it a fair shot, I believe the anime is not wrong and it didnt go over the line or it definitely is not as creepy as you think. If the anime portray it in such cute manner then in such cute manner should the audience view it and not try to make another interpretation with what one may consider as disgusting that is just being judgmental and misleading to other audiences.EDIT: I finished it and I stand by my statement its an epic and awesome anime the anime but I will give it a fair shot, I believe the anime is not wrong and it didnt go over the line or it definitely is not as creepy as you think.

That through line alone would raise all sorts of eyebrows in Japan and any other modernized society, and the nonconsensual nature of Ryo\'s pursuit would definitely be grounds for a criminal case.Yet throughout this series, only one character was strongly opposed to the relationship. Every other supporting character has either been supportive or enabling. I was most disappointed in Ichika\'s mother, who was obviously won over by Ryo\'s charms and allowed him near her daughter.What I...think about adult-minor age gaps or borderline-predatory behavior doesn\'t matter. Fictional works rightfully serve as risk-free space to depict deeds and scenarios that would otherwise be illegal or horrifying in the real world. But although Koikimo purportedly takes place in the real world, there is hardly any potential that Ryo will face any real consequences for his actions. That alone eroded my suspension of disbelief, which damaged the story.I struggle to make sense how there is any chemistry between Ichika and Ryo. She was clearly very disgusted initially by his improper and incessant advances, which rises into stalker territory at some points. Yet she is gradually drawn to him.I won\'t place much blame on Ichika since she is still a minor, but this raises the question of why she wasn\'t more forceful in rejecting Ryo—even calling the police if necessary. Although this was not addressed in the anime, I assume Ichika felt trapped because Ryo is the older brother of her best friend, Rio, and Ichika didn\'t want to hurt Rio by having her brother arrested.It also doesn\'t hurt that Ryo is good looking, is smart and has a good job with career prospects. I suspect if Ryo lacked these qualities, the story wouldn\'t last past the first episode.So this created the opening for Ryo to advance on Ichika. He kept sending Ichika gifts (in the manga, Rio told Ryo Ichika\'s address because ""I\'m not his package deliverer""), and he calls her every day late into the night (Ryo got Ichika\'s number after she called him to stop bothering her. A wrong move by Ichika that reveals her inexperience.)After a while (half a year to be exact), Ryo became such an overwhelming presence in Ichika\'s life that she lowers her guard and can\'t imagine life without him. To put it in a charitable way, it\'s a trope you see as far back as Jane Austen novels: familiarity (mixed with some abandonment play) breeds romance. Of course, the not-so-charitable interpretation is that this the end result of an adult man grooming a minor.Like I said, I am not opposed to the airing or publishing of so-called ""problematic stories."" But if you are going to romanticize such stories, it had better make sense. The series would have been a lot better if Ryo was staring at real consequences for going after Ichika. At the very least, have Rio and the rest of Ichika\'s friends think Ryo is being sketchy. I also think Ichika should have dialed up her disgust with Ryo a lot more, so he should have to work harder to prove that he is worthy of Ichika\'s affections.Story = 4: I can\'t take the story seriouslyArt = 6: Animators did their jobs adequately for this slice of life show. Scarcely any opportunities for sakuga, except for the soccer game, which was animated just as sparingly as ""Sayonara, Watashi no Cramer.""Sound = 5: Really standard OST and soundtrack for a shoujo romance series.Characters = 3: Characters almost uniformly unbelievable: There has to be more than a few high school girls that don\'t think any of this is okay. Ryo is completely unlikeable, even if Ichika *is* of age.Enjoyment = 5: Despite the series overall breaking the suspension of disbelief, I sort of liked the otaku-related B stories.Overall = 4: The series ignored opportunities to include real-world tension in favor of presenting a romanticized depiction of an age-gap relationship. think about adult-minor age gaps or borderline-predatory behavior doesn\'t matter.

Honestly I don't find the premise here that off-putting, high school students are basically adults in that there's not much difference between a 16 year old and an 18 year old. True your brain can still developing until around 25, but should we then disbar anyone from getting married until then? Historically women were married off as soon as they could produce children, which can be as young as their early teens. It's just a fact of biology that women are under a strict time-table for when they can become mothers and honestly the sooner they get started the...fewer complications there will be with producing healthy offspring. Men have no such time constraints so it's not uncommon to see a man marrying a younger woman. But how young is too young? Where do we draw that line?These are the kinds of questions you find yourself asking while watching this show. The protagonist is obviously portrayed to be somewhat creepy, that's kind of the joke. But then is hidden in some moments a level of sincerity that makes us wonder how much of his creepiness are we supposed to attribute to his shitty personality and how much is just bias from how we perceive the age gap. Legally speaking there's nothing wrong with their relationship, age of consent in Japan is 16* (at least in most prefectures the age of marriage for specifically for women is 16 usually requiring parental approval don't quote me on any of that I'm not a lawyer or even a Japanese citizen I'm just some guy on the internet.) Narratively the only people that seem to have a problem with the age gap in the relationship is Ryo's dad and near the end Ryo himself. Her mom is cool with it, so as long as she accepts his advances the only obstacle left to get around is the social stigma that would follow.But what I find really interesting is the question of whether or not Ichika actually likes him, or if she should like him or not. At the end she claims she does, but that's only after he spent the entire show basically gas-lighting her into thinking that. She can claim it's her own feelings if she wants, but I think Ryo is totally justified in his sudden doubts of whether they should be together. She hasn't got a lot of life experience and hasn't even ever been in a relationship, and the way she talks it almost sounds like she admitting she's really only latched on to him because he was the first to make a move. It's not a question that really has an answer but maybe it's a sign of good writing that the show can make you ask these sorts of questions in the first place.Anyway, enough about the age gap thing. What did I think of the romance story itself? I liked that despite introducing *shudders* love triangles into the mix to keep things spicy, the show never really entertains for a second the idea that those are going to go anywhere. I hate love triangles if you couldn't tell and I think if they have any place in a story, it's to die quickly and be forgotten. Introduce a second possible love interest only to affirm that the feelings the main couple has for each other are genuine, that's my thinking. Don't lie to us and pretend the other guy had a chance. Or better yet just don't introduce the love triangle at all. I'm so sick of them.This one gets an 8/10 from me, it was funny at times and a decent love story. fewer complications there will be with producing healthy offspring.

Skip to the end for my views on the art, voice acting, etc., under ""Is the show actually worth watching?""Controversy:As you could tell from the synopsis, the lead couple in this anime have a ten year age-gap with the female protagonist (17) being a junior in high school and her male counterpart (27) being a working adult. These have very concerning implications that aren\'t really addressed throughout the anime except in small, bite-size pieces. Instead, the anime largely frames their relationship as cute and harmless, treating the age gap as a...point of conflict in a similar way to how another romance anime would treat a tsundere\'s tendency to be violent or a male character\'s tragic backstory (i.e. important but not that much of an obstacle at the end of the day)Sides:If you took a second to scroll through some ratings like I did, you\'ve probably noticed that they\'re either really low (<2) or really high (7+). Those reviews that are low basically argue that the anime is problematic  because it paints a toxic relationship based on harassment and emotional manipulation as one you\'re supposed to root for. Others counter that the anime is just an anime and shouldn\'t be taken so seriously, pointing out that most anime are unrealistic and so, questioning why this one should be any different.My Take:I don\'t necessarily believe that the anime creators are trying to condone or encourage underage girls to be with adult men. While many of the scenes come off as disturbing when taken literally, I think there is an aspect of the show that redeems it: the title. Now, the anime is called ""It\'s Disgusting to Call this Love"" which is strange if it only wants to tell the cute story of two people. It also doesn\'t serve as an inside joke or even seem to provide much in the way of narrative significance so why bash the anime couple if the creators want to support/validate them? They are obviously aware of the inappropriate nature of this relationship but then why produce the show in the first place? I believe that this soon becomes clear once you start watching the show and the self-mockery makes itself known. The writers poke fun at the age-gap and the male lead\'s harassment all the time which, admittedly, doesn\'t  justify either of those things but does acknowledge them. Personally, this wouldn\'t be good enough for me until I remember the title again. Whenever the characters mention ""love,"" viewers should remind themselves that the title explicitly clarifies that this twisted version of affection is indeed, ""disgusting,"" and shouldn\'t even receive the label of ""love."" The show itself doesn\'t focus on that, however, because its just not that kind of show. It only wants to take its audience on a fun, lighthearted ride and uses this relationship as a gimmick to do so. Now, whenever a sketchy moment in the show appears, I laugh more than anything else at the irony of the characters\' actions (minor spoiler but none of the supporting cast really freak out at the age gap and respond pretty casually after their initial shock which I honestly find hilarious). Of course, I understand if you still find it offensive since it doesn\'t always feel like it\'s making the joke clear enough to its viewers but I wouldn\'t just disregard it right off the bat. Try out a few episodes and if you find the show more frustrating than enjoyable, that\'s totally valid as well. My opinion is by no means the only one.But is the show actually worth watching?Honestly, the storyline is very predictable and doesn\'t deviate much from that of the typical romance except when it deals with the age-gap. Some parts are still enjoyable though and the jokes are fairly decent. I think the show does do a good job with its dramatic moments by letting them breathe a bit within the characters\' internal monologue before moving on which many comedy animes don\'t do as much.The characters by themselves aren\'t really anything to look twice at but they play off each really well, in my opinion, especially the protagonist and Rio (the sister).The art is average, nothing bad but also nothing specialThe voice acting for the women are all pretty good and play their roles really well. The voice acting for the men though is probably the worst part to be honest. They all sound much older than they perhaps should and don\'t give much character or charm to the guys they\'re portraying. point of conflict in a similar way to how another romance anime would treat a tsundere\'s tendency to be violent or a male character\'s tragic backstory (i.e. important but not that much of an obstacle at the end of the day)Sides:If you took a second to scroll through some ratings like I did, you\'ve probably noticed that they\'re either really low (<2) or really high (7+).

It follows the same formula. Unremarkable, average-looking girl manages to somehow wrangle an attractive, successful man. It\'s like a self-insert fantasy for plain janes. Not only will I not begrudge them this, but I\'ll say it\'s reasonably entertaining in the process.Ichika ensnares a guy so far out of her league they might not as well even be playing the same sport, by calling him creepy instead of fawning over him like all the women in his life have done up to that point. From there, the guy is hopelessly infatuated with her and...the traditional manner of wooing her while selfishly having fun doing it is kind of his modus operandi. Over time, the series comes to butter its bread with the questions of ""is this okay?"" and ""am I hurting anyone?"" and how the characters come to terms with the answers. There\'s not really any grooming, despite what 21st century lazy feminists will screech, and the age gap isn\'t weird or even uncommon by the standards of pre-millennial generations.I will admit though, that there is a certain allure to grabbing that low-hanging fruit and going for the easy criticism about their ages, and some nebulous perceived imbalance in their power dynamic (even though she\'s clearly the one leading him along for literally the entire duration of the series). But if anything, that makes the show more appealing.

I started the show because I saw alot of negative reviews about it (I always watch the good and bad shows to make MY OWN idea about it), but the more I watched and the more I understood that people did only watch the first episode or they read the summary and no chance was given to the anime.So YES, the first couple of episodes are CRINGE, I wanted to drop after the first episode because I tough it would be like that for the rest but I gave it a chance (I always give everything a change and...that's what alot of people don't do).Every episode was getting better and better, the questions I was asking like: Why her, why is he so, etc) everything was answered in the end of the show.Give the show a chance, watch until the end and then judge it. You gonna see the morality behind is beautiful, for him and for her. Sometimes we have to understand and to try to be at the place of the guy/girl to understand why they act like that. that's what alot of people don't do).Every episode was getting better and better, the questions I was asking like: Why her, why is he so, etc) everything was answered in the end of the show.Give the show a chance, watch until the end and then judge it.

The first episode got me hooked right away while I wasn\'t up for any romance sht. The story was quite cliche for a romcom however the way it was pure and earnest really got me swooning. It\'s ending is just right, it didn\'t felt like it lacked something nor did it gave a cliffhanger.  The plot was just your typical romcom series with great execution. The art in the ending is stunning and inspired me to do more digital art~ osts weren\'t...catchy and as for characters the male lead was hot as hell but the fact that his appearance and attitude hides the \'grooming\' part as dreamy as he is, it is debatable. Besides the male lead, his rival caught my attention \'cause of the mole near his mouth TT well that was rare for a character design and made him look appealing and charming. As for the mc, she\'s that kind of character that\'s innocent, shy and sweet,,,, written to be likable- mid lol. Definitely would understand if others rated this a 1.

The large age difference was the main factor that made this anime popular.However, despite the sensitive topic, I loved this anime and the weird romance. There were plenty of comedic and kawaii moments that started out my Monday mornings in a good mood. The side characters had funny moments of their own, and they all pushed the story forward. Ryo’s sister, who was very chill and caring, was a great and wholesome wingwoman.For a romance comedy, there had...to be some drama, and not surprisingly, the major drama here was the age gap. After the first half, the tone of the anime turned serious, and the age gap struggle became more apparent. Ichika and Ryo both had to face the issue and reflect on their feelings and futures by themselves.Even though the anime is unique because of age gap, the progression was not new and the in last episode I pretty predicted what was going to happen. However, since I’m a sucker for feels-good romcom, I still loved those final scenes and felt very satisfied.Since the anime is only 12 episodes, there were subplots that were glanced over. The relationship between Ryo and his dad could have been delved in more.Overall, a lovely and enjoyable romcom anime that dealt with a controversial issue in a more lighthearted way. 8/10 to be some drama, and not surprisingly, the major drama here was the age gap.

If you are capable of differentiating fictional story where thing are meant to finish in a glorifying way, then this is a show for you. On the other hand if you can't give a pass to things that are problematic in real life, I highly recommend avoiding this show.Story: 3As the synopsis says, this is a story about a high school girl (underaged) and a grow up man (a mature person). From the first episode we are already greeted with an attempt of...that same grown up man making a move on the girl he knows is same age as his sister. The only reason why I can overlook this huge issue is that he didn't do it solely because she is underage but because that is his way of treating all women (which is absolutely disgusting and faulty, but that's a different issue). Later on things do develop, and for the sake of non spoiling I won't add more things, but as wrong as it is, if you approach this story with a mindset that this is just a story, it can grow onto you and not be that bad.Art: 6Colors are very vibrant and technically it's done well. It's definitely not flawless or amazing, but there's nothing particularly bad about it. Protagonists are made to look nice, with an obvious accent on the male lead which makes viewers rather overlook his actions (which I believe wouldn't be the case if he looked somehow different).Sound: 7I personally really liked EP and OP of this anime a lot. It wasn't too mainstream and I was able to really enjoy it (without feeling the need to skip it). During some scenes it was noticeable that they were missing some kind of sounds/music in the back, but overall it was good.Characters: 3Another issue I had with this anime is that it was subtly pushing a trope of a girl who saves a boy in trouble. Characters are overall very generic, but you do see some developments in main protagonists throughout time. Female lead is depicted as 'not like other girls' when approaching the male lead, which for her character is nothing bad and is in fact an interesting thing that makes her very likable. On contrary the male lead is very annoying even tho the story is trying to make us accept him. He doesn't understand boundaries nor when someone says ''no'' to him. Consent doesn't seem to be the word he cares about. His behaviour is just so problematic and should not be acceptable but this is just fiction, so unfortunately even these characters can  be liked. Supporting ones are literally just there to help the main characters so we don't see any of their growth or learn much about their background stories. It's not something by definition needed, but they are made to be 'perfect friends' who are very mature and always know what to say and do to help the leads.Enjoyment: 6Not considering the main plot, the anime is rather funny and amusing. It is very cutesy and an easy-going show. If you turn off your brain and just watch it to relax, you can find it very, very enjoyable.Overall: 5Since I am torn in-between, the best I can say is that it's somewhere in the middle. Pure enjoyment wise, it's undoubtedly good, but plot wise it's just problematic without actually needing to be.I don't necessarily say that you should avoid this anime by any means because of all the things I said above, but I do recommend everyone to do think just for a bit and reconsider accepting this anime as good. Therefore, I actually hope everyone will watch it and decide on their own whether they will see this just as a form of art, or call it out for romanticising things that shouldn't be accepted in real life.In conclusion I'll just add that as work of fiction this story is nice and if one has ever questioned how it'd be like if two people with big age gap would be like if the story was actually nicely written and not sexual in any way, shape or form, this is a perfect example and I wholeheartedly recommend. As much as it does show something that shouldn't be normalized, at the same time it doesn't promote it as a wonderful or the best way possible (for a love story to be like). that same grown up man making a move on the girl he knows is same age as his sister.

But even when keeping that in mind I still think this show is pretty good...Story - 7Yes... I am enjoying the story, even though I know Ryou, a 27-year-old fictional male character that fell in love, is chasing Ichika, a 17-year-old fictional high female character. Even though I know Ichika has said no multiple times, I think we all need to keep in mind that these are animated pictures we are talking about. It\'s not even like Ryou is physically attracted...to her, it\'s more an emotional attraction that started out because she saved him from -spoiler- and gave her lunch to him. They also are starting to warm up to each other, and Ichika doesn’t seem to be bothered by his presence that much anymore, she even seems to feel the same way about Ryou as he does about her. Of course I leave it all up to you how you want to interpret this show yourself, but for me it\'s just a normal comedy with some romance aspects, and it is succeeding in being what it wanted to be.Art - 7Artwise it\'s looking pretty good as well, it\'s not really an unique style, but I personally have not seen a show in this style for quite a while and so it\'s pretty refreshing for me. I was surprised when I saw how detailed the scenes like the supermarket scenes were, and if only the entire anime was with that quality artwise it would easily be an 8/8,5. But understandably most scenes were just average with some scenes that don’t have much details at all. Character designs are pretty neat as well, they fit with the rest of the artstyle and I must say that Ryou’s suits (and sister) look amazing.Sound - 7Tell me the OP is bad and I\'ll say you\'re crazy, oh boi this might just be the best OP of the season. ACE COLLECTION did not disappoint! As far as the OST and sound effects go it\'s all decent enough, I wouldn\'t call it anything new or special but it gets je job done and doesn\'t feel irritating at all. The voice actors are all doing a decent enough job as well, and their voices all fit their character pretty well, the quality seems to not be quite up to modern standards though, but that doesn’t really bother me personally. ED is not quite my taste but it fits the show perfectly.Character - 7Ryou, a 27-year-old with a business job, good salary and is good with the girls. After certain events in episode 1 (which I will not mention due to spoilers) he falls head over heels in love with the 17-year-old high school student, Ichika. Now we will get into the topics of sexual predatory and harassment again... because the dynamic between this duo has been how Ryou tries to approach her with many different methods, while at the start she responds simply disgustedly, including telling him ""No"" multiple times. Still, I feel like this dynamic works, seeing how it releases loads of comedic and pretty cute heartwarming moments. I feel like Ryou is not a bad guy at all, and if he noticed that Ichika actually would suffer from his actions he would probably stop. So would this be ok in real life? No, of course not don\'t be crazy, but this is still fiction, and in my opinion this isn’t going too far for a piece of fiction, if you decide you yourself don’t quite know how to deal with a series like this you can always turn it off. For the supporting cast the most important character up till now has been Rio (Ryou’s younger sister and one of Ichika\'s friends), she has been the one controlling a lot of the situations that occur during our main characters\' lives. She is really supportive of her brother\'s love, she sets them up to be alone with each other and tells her brother about Ichika. Though she also draws a clear line when telling her brother that if he takes things too far she will stop him immediately! The other supporting characters have at this point not been well enough introduced to me for me to be able to talk a bit about them. Masuda is another side character, a friend Ryou know way back from high school. Naturally he knows a lot about Ryou and occasionally helps out Ichika, his character is lots of fun to watch and he most certainly adds to the enjoyment of this show. Kai, a classmate of Ichika and Arie, a colleague of Ryou, are more or less the alternative romantic partners, they both try to gain their crush’s attention. Although they might come across irritating to the people in favor of the Ryou and Ichika relationship, they do add some more depth into the show and are in general pretty entertaining to watch.Enjoyment - 8Yes, as stated before I\'m actually enjoying this a lot, from the comedy being right up my alley to the refreshing artstyle, fun characters and a banger of an OP. Though the spring 2021 lineup might be incredible and there are better shows, this one is one we cannot allow to go by unnoticed.Overall - 7Overall I would definitely say this is a 7 (good) show up till now, nothing is really feeling cliché and it is exactly what it wants to be getting my laughs and “awws” out of me .So if you think you can get past the sexual predatory and harassment barrier I would definitely recommend you go give it a try! to her, it\'s more an emotional attraction that started out because she saved him from -spoiler- and gave her lunch to him.

A slightly atypical romantic comedy with a focus on the age difference. Here, however, the 10 years are not the decisive factor, but the constellation of a schoolgirl to an adult. Those who already regard this starting situation as questionable should skip the series, as there are also some other weaknesses. Here\'s what I noticed, decide for yourself whether you want to watch the anime anyway or not. Personally, I have no interest in a sequel.Story: Romcom with age difference that is unfortunately poorly realised (4/10)Arima Ichika...is a typical 17-year-old high school student with a faible for manga and anime. As luck would have it, she saves the life of Amakusa Ryō, a very desirable 27-year-old bachelor and womaniser, or at least prevents him from being seriously injured due to his carelessness. Amusingly, this incident is not the linchpin of the story. When they meet again, Ryō tries to show his gratitude in his usual way, completely ignoring the fact that he is talking to a young student who is completely inexperienced in matters of love. Accordingly, the student\'s reaction is clearly dismissive and, in my opinion, completely understandable and justified. Rejected by Ichika for his brash and direct manner, Ryō is now on fire. Unfortunately, the adaptation of the story offers no room for development, neither for the plot nor for the characters. I will take up this point again with the characters. The story has an ending, but does not really offer a satisfying explanation or even a conclusion.Character: Good basis, but no development (5/10)At first glance, all the characters shown seem aptly characterised, but then nothing more happens. Since this is a romcom anime, I don\'t expect a deep, psychologically based character study, but at least a credible development. However, this is missing until shortly before the end.Arima, Ichika:She is a nice, modest schoolgirl and in the first episode you sympathise with her and like the fact that she brusquely rejects Ryō. However, her development stops at that point. In the next one or two episodes, you still overlook this because her best friend is Ryō\'s sister and because her other classmates and even her mother have fallen for the charmer. Nevertheless, she doesn\'t take the chance to put an end to the Casanova\'s advances. She could talk to Rio and ask her to drop the matchmaking. Ryō is not a classmate, so she doesn\'t have to meet him. He\'s a businessman who could certainly stopped by threats with the police. But she never clearly says ""no"".Amakusa Ryō:His character, like Ichika\'s, would have had potential, but unfortunately none of it was realised. He could, for example, adapt his way of dealing with Ichika to her level of experience. She has clearly stated that she does not know how to deal with an experienced man. A grown man should be expected to understand that this makes her uncomfortable and scared. What I mean by this can be seen well in the example of the manga ""Living no Matsunaga-san"". Here it is a very similar constellation, only that the male protagonist doubts at first and does not try to be the greatest, but tries to deal with his lady of the heart in the right way.Tamaru, Kai:A pretty cool character. Despite his young age, he seems even more mature than Ryō. He knows his shortcomings and faces them, and says clearly what he thinks. The fact that he is not clear about his feelings at first fits his age. But he does a good job and even in conversation with Ryō he can keep up despite the age difference and the lack of experience.Matsushima, Arie:She would certainly be a good partner for Ryō and to me she seems like a slightly older version of Ichika. She actually has loving feelings for Ryō and is an attractive woman with a lot of heart. Probably Ryō wouldn\'t be good for her, but that\'s another story.Masuda:This is a buddy with whom I could well imagine going out for a beer. In his case, it\'s more like he gets drawn into the story between Ichika and Ryō because of the circumstances. I liked the scenario with Ichika at the Okonomiyaki restaurant. He told her something but let her figure out the conclusions on her own. Ryō could take a leaf out of that book.Visuals: The graphics are average but the animation is substandard (4/10)Unfortunately, the production values are too low for such a show to convey emotionality to the audience in a believable way. As a result, the overall visual appearance suffers. The graphics are not entirely bad, the character sketches could even be quite convincing. On the positive side, I noticed that facial expressions were present and could convey what the character was feeling to a certain extent. Unfortunately, there were also often external lines of the character that looked like thick pencil lines, which gave a sloppy impression. One could argue that this was intended to emphasise the comedy. So that alone would not be sufficient reason to devalue the art. But in combination with the background artwork, which consists mostly of emotionless CGI elements and an almost loveless colour palette, devaluation is inevitable, as the mood is often completely ruined, especially in emotional settings.Animation, the second major discipline in the visual department, is even less convincing. On cursory viewing, most people probably won\'t even notice it, so here is an example that is repeated several times. The pupils walk through the corridors of the school building and are shown in close-up. Only the upper body is visible and the movements seem unnatural and stiff. Simplifying the animation effort with the help of the box of tricks in order to save the more elaborate drawings and working time is a double-edged sword. Because if you save the lower part of the body and the leg movements, both the proportions of the body and the rhythm of the movements are missing. Simply put, the saving makes drawing and animating more difficult than it would be with full figures. As a result, the studio has saved money but created a stiff-looking animation that, when used repeatedly, is just awful to look at. If this is compounded by the fact that the inserted still images appear one-dimensional, so that there is no good imaginable sense of space, then the animation is simply not well done.Sounds: Beautiful OP & ED, but BGM is unimpressive and studio recording of VA flawed (5/10)The background music was composed by Tsutsumi Hiroaki and it\'s not bad, but it doesn\'t stand out in a particularly positive way either. I know that Tsutsumi-san has composed very nice background music for other anime, but this time it can\'t convince me.The opening title song is called ""Monokuro City"" by the band Ace Collection. The four-member Japanese rock band makes very cool J-pop. The group actually started in 2017 with cover songs and quickly became popular via Youtube. I like the music arrangement as the opening for the anime and the lyrics and melody fit well too.The title ""Rinaria"" as the ending credit song of the series is very well chosen and again the lyric relate to the series. The two singers ""MaRuRi"" To ""Ryuga"" of the musician duo formed in 2018 make very nice J-pop. The ED\'s music starts quietly at first, but then develops a nice beat and the vocals fit well with it.Looking at the dubbing voices, it is immediately noticeable that the voices are faulty. This faux pas also contributes to the negative overall picture of the series. The unsightly reverberation has made the rating more difficult. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight some of the dubbing actors, because they are not responsible for the poor studio recording and it would be a shame if their performance went unmentioned because of this. As always, I am more interested in the second tier of voice actors. Among the male supporting cast, Nakata Jōji particularly caught my eye. He voices the role of Zenji Amakusa, the father of Ryō and Rio. His deep voice and experience as a voice actor have a strong effect on the listener. This is also evident in the fact that Nakata-san only has short speaking roles and also only appears in a few episodes, but his performance still struck me as very positive. Among the female voices, I found Hasegawa Rena to be very pleasant. Her voice and her interpretation of Rio\'s character created a nice and coherent overall picture for me. I really enjoyed her performance.Regardless of its other flaws, I would not recommend the anime. In my opinion, the point and its implications, that Ichika is a teenager, are overlaid with too much inappropriate comedy. The constellation is better grasped in the context of a drama. At this point, the anime ""Koi Kaze"" would be a recommendation, but it is older (2004) and also deals with another taboo topic. Not yet adapted is the manga ""Living no Matsunaga-san"" with a very similar plot. Both are, as far as I am concerned, more credible in their realisation of the characters. You may also be interested in the manga ""Kame no Naku Koe"".  If anyone is looking at the latter recommendations, I hope you enjoy them.As always, thanks for reading. is a typical 17-year-old high school student with a faible for manga and anime.

Ryō is not a classmate, so she doesn\'t have to meet him. He\'s a businessman who could certainly stopped by threats with the police. But she never clearly says ""no"".Amakusa Ryō:His character, like Ichika\'s, would have had potential, but unfortunately none of it was realised. He could, for example, adapt his way of dealing with Ichika to her level of experience. She has clearly stated that she does not know how to deal with an experienced man. A grown man should be expected to understand that this makes her uncomfortable and scared. What I mean by this can be seen well in the example of the manga ""Living no Matsunaga-san"". Here it is a very similar constellation, only that the male protagonist doubts at first and does not try to be the greatest, but tries to deal with his lady of the heart in the right way.Tamaru, Kai:A pretty cool character. Despite his young age, he seems even more mature than Ryō. He knows his shortcomings and faces them, and says clearly what he thinks. The fact that he is not clear about his feelings at first fits his age. But he does a good job and even in conversation with Ryō he can keep up despite the age difference and the lack of experience.Matsushima, Arie:She would certainly be a good partner for Ryō and to me she seems like a slightly older version of Ichika. She actually has loving feelings for Ryō and is an attractive woman with a lot of heart. Probably Ryō wouldn\'t be good for her, but that\'s another story.Masuda:This is a buddy with whom I could well imagine going out for a beer. In his case, it\'s more like he gets drawn into the story between Ichika and Ryō because of the circumstances. I liked the scenario with Ichika at the Okonomiyaki restaurant. He told her something but let her figure out the conclusions on her own. Ryō could take a leaf out of that book.Visuals: The graphics are average but the animation is substandard (4/10)Unfortunately, the production values are too low for such a show to convey emotionality to the audience in a believable way. As a result, the overall visual appearance suffers. The graphics are not entirely bad, the character sketches could even be quite convincing. On the positive side, I noticed that facial expressions were present and could convey what the character was feeling to a certain extent. Unfortunately, there were also often external lines of the character that looked like thick pencil lines, which gave a sloppy impression. One could argue that this was intended to emphasise the comedy. So that alone would not be sufficient reason to devalue the art. But in combination with the background artwork, which consists mostly of emotionless CGI elements and an almost loveless colour palette, devaluation is inevitable, as the mood is often completely ruined, especially in emotional settings.Animation, the second major discipline in the visual department, is even less convincing. On cursory viewing, most people probably won\'t even notice it, so here is an example that is repeated several times. The pupils walk through the corridors of the school building and are shown in close-up. Only the upper body is visible and the movements seem unnatural and stiff. Simplifying the animation effort with the help of the box of tricks in order to save the more elaborate drawings and working time is a double-edged sword. Because if you save the lower part of the body and the leg movements, both the proportions of the body and the rhythm of the movements are missing. Simply put, the saving makes drawing and animating more difficult than it would be with full figures. As a result, the studio has saved money but created a stiff-looking animation that, when used repeatedly, is just awful to look at. If this is compounded by the fact that the inserted still images appear one-dimensional, so that there is no good imaginable sense of space, then the animation is simply not well done.Sounds: Beautiful OP & ED, but BGM is unimpressive and studio recording of VA flawed (5/10)The background music was composed by Tsutsumi Hiroaki and it\'s not bad, but it doesn\'t stand out in a particularly positive way either. I know that Tsutsumi-san has composed very nice background music for other anime, but this time it can\'t convince me.The opening title song is called ""Monokuro City"" by the band Ace Collection. The four-member Japanese rock band makes very cool J-pop. The group actually started in 2017 with cover songs and quickly became popular via Youtube. I like the music arrangement as the opening for the anime and the lyrics and melody fit well too.The title ""Rinaria"" as the ending credit song of the series is very well chosen and again the lyric relate to the series. The two singers ""MaRuRi"" To ""Ryuga"" of the musician duo formed in 2018 make very nice J-pop. The ED\'s music starts quietly at first, but then develops a nice beat and the vocals fit well with it.Looking at the dubbing voices, it is immediately noticeable that the voices are faulty. This faux pas also contributes to the negative overall picture of the series. The unsightly reverberation has made the rating more difficult. Nevertheless, I would like to highlight some of the dubbing actors, because they are not responsible for the poor studio recording and it would be a shame if their performance went unmentioned because of this. As always, I am more interested in the second tier of voice actors. Among the male supporting cast, Nakata Jōji particularly caught my eye. He voices the role of Zenji Amakusa, the father of Ryō and Rio. His deep voice and experience as a voice actor have a strong effect on the listener. This is also evident in the fact that Nakata-san only has short speaking roles and also only appears in a few episodes, but his performance still struck me as very positive. Among the female voices, I found Hasegawa Rena to be very pleasant. Her voice and her interpretation of Rio\'s character created a nice and coherent overall picture for me. I really enjoyed her performance.Regardless of its other flaws, I would not recommend the anime. In my opinion, the point and its implications, that Ichika is a teenager, are overlaid with too much inappropriate comedy. The constellation is better grasped in the context of a drama. At this point, the anime ""Koi Kaze"" would be a recommendation, but it is older (2004) and also deals with another taboo topic. Not yet adapted is the manga ""Living no Matsunaga-san"" with a very similar plot. Both are, as far as I am concerned, more credible in their realisation of the characters. You may also be interested in the manga ""Kame no Naku Koe"".  If anyone is looking at the latter recommendations, I hope you enjoy them.As always, thanks for reading.', ""The synopsis might trick people into thinking this anime shows a very sick relationship (which includes sexual abuse, stalking and similar stuff) which...is not true at all.SPOILERS !!The first episode includes that horrible side the ML has, but that's actually the beginning of his character development, showing how much he can change along the series while trying to show the FL he really loves her for her personality and not body, like he used to be before meeting her.Story: i agree, his attitude in the first episode when meeting Ichika in her friend's house was completely horrible, but i looked at it from the comedic...side, since this anime shows nothing explicit, and that attitude of his it's just for one episode. The last episodes really show how much Ryou changed, and the ending is a very beautiful one.Art: not the best art, but i did not see any horrible mistake or any mistake in it (at least not big one). The art style of the characters is pretty cute, and i really liked the colors they chose for hair, eyes etc. The ending illustrations are beautiful as well.Sound: both OP and ED are completely amazing, the songs were perfect for this show. The voice actors were doing a nice job, all of them were good for each character.Enjoyment: i started liking it so much after the first 3 episodes that every week i was so hyped for new ones to see how the story goes.Overall: this show does not include anything sexual, the ML DOES NOT TOUCH the FL at all, and especially not sexual, he never abused her and actually wanted to show her how much he loves her in a very childish way without being a creep. I know, he was a bit mean to her friend, but that was just comedic, he was never an a** and always acted very mature.I recommend this anime, its a very smooth and calm story, no harem, no ecchi, everything is friendly. side, since this anime shows nothing explicit, and that attitude of his it's just for one episode.

Hell, my favourite anime is Cardcaptor Sakura which has a student-teacher relationship that is much, much worse (the girl is like 11). I also love Violet Evergarden where Violet is 11 years younger than Gilbert, and he practically raised her.The issues I have with Kiokimo are mostly more technical, and I have issues...with how they handled the relationship.Now on to the things:Story: Is bad. It\'s about a guy who ""falls in love"" with a girl and then starts bugging her until she falls in love too. The story is pretty non-existent to be honest.Art: The character models are just plain bad, and they are constantly drawn off model. The characters are also, obviously, superimposed over prerendered backgrounds. They stick out horribly. I\'ve seen this done before in \'Minami Kamakura Koukou Joshi Jitenshabu\' but at least there the backgrounds were often times beautiful, if not breathtaking. Here it\'s just plain ugly.Sound: The voice acting is subpar at best. Besides the OP and ED being halfway decent the rest of the sound design is really laughable. Ryo\'s VA, especially, is horrible.Character: Ryo is just a creep. He harasses Ichika until she submits. And then avoids her because he ""doesn\'t want to hurt her"". It\'s supposed to be character development, I think, but it\'s poorly written.Ichika is boring more often than not.Rio is one of the only characters I sort of enjoyed. Her support of Ryo and Ichika was a bit weird but she was on the funnier side I guess.Tamaru was boring. I know some people like him but he just bored me.Matsushima was the only good character. She deserves better than being in the trash fire of an anime. She\'s the only character that made me feel anything and I was rooting for her to find happiness. She is similar to Ichika expect she has an actually personality. I felt bad for her when she cried while eating the White Day gift Ryo gave her... Still, Ryo isn\'t good enough for her regardless.Enjoyment: It took me a year to finish this anime. I tried to burn through the second half of the anime in a single day but I could barely make it through half an episode before I got bored.Overall: 3/10It\'s just bad. with how they handled the relationship.Now on to the things:Story: Is bad.

It\'s not a great series but it is by no means a bad one either.Story: 7Heavier on the rom then it is on the com, its a repackage of the trope where one person is damaged by ""love"" and the other is ignorant of it and both are going through the steps of learning about what it means to actually love another person through their own ways of living. Ryo, having been fawned over his who life for...shallow reasons and at one point tricked into consuming hair in a valentines gift has grown to see women in a negative light and comes to terms with just appeasing the base desires they chase him for as an easy out. Ichika, classic JK trope has never been in a relationship and at one point even thinks Ryo is mocking her inexperience. Both don\'t really know what they are doing or how the other actually thinks of them, and the mixed messages from Ichika\'s inexperience don\'t really help the matter.Art: 7Not really much to say here. It\'s pastel and plain, no need to be eye catchingly vibrant since that would take away from the presentation. It\'s not 60fps buttery smooth but its not a battle anime so it doesn\'t need to be.Sound: 5There are some noticeable problems with the audio. The VAs all sound the part, their voices fit the characters to a T. The problems though is that all the lines end in an extended exhale. You don\'t need to end every line by emptying your lungs, it sounds completely unnatural outside of heavy physical activity and ruins the performance once you can\'t stop noticing it. The other major problem is that the recording studio either had substandard equipment or had insufficient sound proofing because all character speech sounds like there is a mechanical underlayer or echo to it. Like the audio was recorded in 10 year old equipment. I would give Sound a 6 but those issues really bug me. The OP song is very TokyoPop in style and has kinda grown on me though.Characters: 7Ryo is emotionally damaged from a poor home life and the constant chasing the girls around him do, be it in his school life or work life. You can see how he doesn\'t have a grasp on how love works when he\'s surrounded by lust. His interactions with Ichika serving to teach him what an average boy would have learned in high school what he never could due to the shallow nature of his female classmates.Ichika is the first timer, unsure of how to even express romantic interest or who those interests of hers lie in. And it doesn\'t help her position that her best friend Rio has already shown her clear allegiance towards supporting her bother and Ichika getting together. Makes for interesting confusion but I can sympathize for those who want clear and concise answers when none can be had.Rio is the straight man roll to Ryo and Ichika. Her roll is almost zero comedy but it plays into her character where she use to really dislike her brother of how often he and their father fought but has grown into the familial affection for him due to his crush on Ichika. She\'s even stated she supports the two so long as Ryo doesn\'t hurt Ichika and has given a clear warning to Tamaru to back off.Tamaru is a good plot device for Ichika but He\'s really one dimensional as a character which is disappointing. Masuda is far more interesting the Tamaru but he\'s the gag character for Ryo so he\'s relegated to pure comic relief. Matsushima is a decently written love rival to Ichika and has enough character development to matter more then just a plot device for Ryo.Enjoyment: 7Its a Slice of Life Rom-com. Its nothin new, its nothin special. But its a decent pallet cleanser anime with no supernatural, super power, isekai or fantasy tropes in an ever growing market. It wouldn\'t be my first recommendation, but I would include it with other more interesting anime of the same feel for people who want to watch something to relax and enjoy for a time.Overall: 7The series itself is only slightly above average.

WARNING : This review can contain spoilers of the anime :)Overall: 7Good romance anime for the season, not the best but actually fairly surprising.Story: 6So as it is a Romance, the story isn\'t really hard and complex and so can be a little bit flat for a lot people. I think it is correct because it isn\'t hard to understand and it goes mainly straight to the goal. Also there was a part in the anime, I...think between the episode 5 and 8 in where the anime was quite flat and didn\'t went anywhere for me. Whereas, we can say that a Romance between an adult worker and a student is a bit uncomfortable for those watching it but it didn\'t bother me as I thought it would.Art: 6The animation is quite good, there isn\'t a moment when it was really badly done, and also it is a slice of life anime so there isn\'t a lot to do. I think the emotions are well transmited on character\'s faces so it makes the art better. My main problem is that the character design doesn\'t appeal to me and isn\'t making me attached emotionaly to the characters. Lastly, the opening and ending are well animated and wery well timed with the music.Sound : 8The opening and ending are very good and I think very underated anime songs this season. The opening does its job and is very groovy and makes me want to dance. The ending is very beautiful and does also its job pretty well. I don\'t remember well the OSTs but I think they were fair.Character: 6And here goes one of the main problem to this show for me, the characters are very bland and without flavor. Ichika the main character is pretty annoying as the show is going on. Also Ryo is very annoying when he tries to seduce Ichika from start to the end and is also when he starts his ""bad mood"" period. Rio was useless from start to finish, however at the end when she has her moment when her feelings were kind of revealed she became a better character. On the other hand, I very liked the characters of Masuda and Tamaru, I think they deserved more attention. The other characters are kind of useless.Enjoyment: 7I kinda enjoyed that to be honest, I was simping the Tamaru X Ichika but that was too bad it didn\'t happen but I\'m also happy that the end was delivered pretty well.

Yes it’s about a one-way crush of a 27 year old towards a highschool girl. Yes, it might be disturbing if it was a real life situation.  But, above all, it’s an anime- pure fiction and this isn’t even borderline disgusting if you compare it to many other titles.The best part about KoiKimo is it’s characters and their development. Be it the main characters or the side characters- everyone has their distinct roles and character development.  Despite the controversial theme, the romance part of the anime is truly enjoyable. On the...drama side -the troubles of age gap, choosing between potential partners, heartbreak, family connections, uncertainties of future and above all  the intricacies of love  - all are addressed well.I do agree that the anime accentuates the cutesy side of stalking , at least in the first few episodes.  Later it developed into a decent romance anime. It’s not free from cliches or anything, but it definitely delivers the feels expected from the genre. The ending was also satisfying, nothing special or new, but feels good.On the negative side, the story drags around here and there and rushes some places(like the last episode) , which affects the enjoyment a bit.I should also mention the OP and ED - both are absolutely fantastic, though the ED sounded better to my ears.KoiKimo is a well made romance anime ,and is definitely underlooked because of its theme. If you approach it with an open-mind, without prejudice I’m sure you will leave with a gentle smile on each episode. No matter what others say, this series knows it’s borders and becomes surprisingly wholesome and sweet by maintaining it.Overall Rating - 7.5 drama side -the troubles of age gap, choosing between potential partners, heartbreak, family connections, uncertainties of future and above all  the intricacies of love  - all are addressed well.I do agree that the anime accentuates the cutesy side of stalking , at least in the first few episodes.

As for what I said to him that day, I have nothing but regrets. Because \'creepy\' somehow turned into \'love\'.""To be honest, I was going to rate this show a 6, and no it\'s not my fault for doing so. The premise of the anime is just plain weird and cringe. I was going to drop it right away, but I\'m glad that I stayed. It\'s one of those shows where you\'re not interested at a glance but as you go on, it\'s so great that you will regret you hated it at first.Love...always comes as a surprise, even in the most unthinkable way, and Ryou Amakusa has experienced that. His very first encounter with the main heroine, Ichika Arima, was at a station, where Ichika managed to save Ryou as he was about to fall off a stair unconsciously. Later, he finds himself in love with her after they met for the second time.Their relationship was cold at first, and the reason for it mostly lies in how Ryou approaches his love for Ichika. He\'s creepy and would always contact her, or send her flowers every day. She sees him as bothersome. But as time goes on, it came to Ichika\'s mind that Ryo\'s weird way of conveying love has grown on her, even to the point where she can\'t deny that she has fallen for him.Unfortunately, things didn\'t go as smoothly as expected. The age gap is the reason behind it. Ryou is a mature and hardworking adult, and so hot-looking that girls surround her like bees. Ichika, on the other hand, is a high schooler whose mind isn\'t that mature yet and seems like a normal girl.What I like about this show is that it\'s not trying to have a superb plot and stays honest to simplicity, but that is what makes it enjoyable and heartwarming. From constantly getting annoyed to undeniably falling in love, this show has perfectly shown that along with the struggle that it entails. Resolve is needed for their relationship to work, and no it\'s not easy to overcome those thoughts of getting neglected by society. But Ryou has successfully proved that the age gap should not be seen as a boundary for love.Not only that, but the comedy aspects in this show are great. It\'s always funny to see how cold and hostile Ichika can be when she\'s with Ryou.If there\'s one thing that I should consider as a flaw is within the voice actor of the characters. I\'m not saying that it\'s bad, it\'s just that it could be a little bit better. I feel like it\'s the only thing that falls behind other anime on the same page. It clearly doesn\'t have enough emotion, especially Ryo. Also, another thing that I noticed right away is that the voice of Ryou sounds like it was recorded with a dollar mic. Anyway, this is just a nit-pick that doesn\'t really impact the show that much.To sum it up, I really like this show as a whole. Although the premise might be cringe at first but trust me when I say this, it will get better and better as you watched more of it. I can\'t really seem to find a genuine reason why people are putting a lot of hate on this show. Anyway, I recommend this show to all of you who are looking for a fun yet heartwarming anime at the same time. always comes as a surprise, even in the most unthinkable way, and Ryou Amakusa has experienced that.

It\'s always funny to see how cold and hostile Ichika can be when she\'s with Ryou.If there\'s one thing that I should consider as a flaw is within the voice actor of the characters. I\'m not saying that it\'s bad, it\'s just that it could be a little bit better. I feel like it\'s the only thing that falls behind other anime on the same page. It clearly doesn\'t have enough emotion, especially Ryo. Also, another thing that I noticed right away is that the voice of Ryou sounds like it was recorded with a dollar mic. Anyway, this is just a nit-pick that doesn\'t really impact the show that much.To sum it up, I really like this show as a whole. Although the premise might be cringe at first but trust me when I say this, it will get better and better as you watched more of it. I can\'t really seem to find a genuine reason why people are putting a lot of hate on this show. Anyway, I recommend this show to all of you who are looking for a fun yet heartwarming anime at the same time.', 'This season of amines there was a lot to choose or invest time in to watch, Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui is a show that is a diamond in the rough and falls in the category of don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover, or more importantly in this case don\'t judge an anime after 1 episode and at least maybe watch 3 or 4 episodes and if its still not to your liking that cool.Hell even before i watched this show i was judging this show and thought it was going to be something disgusting and just something i was going to...drop. Yes i get that this show in terms of storyline and context of morals raise concerns and not everyone\'s cup of tea and a lot of reviews for this show talk about these issue of sexual harassment, but I\'m not going to rehash what\'s already been said.This show deals with these theme in a progression where its clear that a misrepresentation of what love is being ""creepy"" can turn into true heartfelt feeling that is shared by both parties and be considered love. I found myself looking forward to a Monday night just to watch this and while this show is nothing new for a rom con and cliché in terms of male going after female and female initially hating the guy and comes around to having feelings for said guy, i still very much enjoyed this show and wholesome moments that were through out the show overall. I got a lot of enjoyment from watching the two main characters grow as people and change over time and coming to terms of the real potential troubles or issues around age gap and what love really means to them.I think if there was something that was a slight negative, was that it did take some time to really see the progress of feelings and ideas come out and i would say shine and stood out in the second half of the series, which i think some people might of given up on the show before it really started to come to life.I really think this show deserves a proper chance and very underrated overall. Out of all the romance amines this season, to be fair i enjoyed this way more then Hige wo Soru. Soshite Joshikousei wo Hirou which was also out this season and deals with similar themes and connotations with age, labels and relationships. drop.

If you like a creepy adult stalking a high schooler and forcing his love on her which ultimately becomes mutual then this anime is for you. ]>> STORY :The story is very simple. Amakusa Ryou a 27 year old office worker was saved by a 17 year old High schooler, Ichika while he slipped in a train station.Ryou immediately fell in love with her and incidentally Ichika happened to be his younger sister\'s best friend. By fate he met her at his home with her sister and immediately confessed and got rejected.And thus an annoying...story of Amakusa Ryou harassing Ichika begins. Even though she rejects him, calls him creepy and disgusting and clearly says ""no"" to him, Ryou doesn\'t back down. He stalks her, send her gifts everyday, calls her every night and it goes on and on to the point she starts feeling something for him.>> Characters :Every character in this anime lacks depth. You can\'t really connect with anyone and all of them are pretty forgettable.Starting with Ryou, he is a two faced guy. At office he is a cool headed guy dedicated to his work and the type woman would kill for in the anime. But outside that infront of Ichika he loses his mind and becomes a creepy lovestruck man.Ichika on the other hand is an average highschooler with a normal life but she is very indecisive. She doesn\'t really have a strong character never being able to decide what she wants. There are times where her decision making can be really annoying.Rio is Amakusa\'s younger sister and honestly she felt like the better character throughout the entire show. She is mature, level headed and handles both Amakusa and Ichika very welll.But lack of screentime killed her. The anime never focused on her even a bit making her just a mean for Amakusa and Ichika to get together.There are characters in this anime who were introduced solely for the purpose of being rejected and as soon as that was done, that was it for them.>> Animation and Soundtracks :The animation in this anime is very basic. It\'s the type you see in almost every generic slice of life, nothing too special.The soundtracks are the same, very basic and doesn\'t really make the scenes any better although I did like the ending song 『Linaria』by MaRuRi to Ryuga.>> Character design :Just like the animation the character designs are also nothing noteworthy. No unique designs and sometimes it\'s inconsistent.>> Overall :""Age doesn\'t matter in love"" yes that might be the case but not how this anime portrayed it. Someone possessive and manipulative creeping you out even after you reject them is never okay.There are better animes showing age distant romantic relationships in a much more acceptable manner than this. This type of obsessive behaviour as shown in the anime is really harmful and dangerous.Taking everything into account this anime was in no way memorable. Even if I do I\'ll probably remember it as a creepy anime.A lot of moments in this anime disgusted me. But one thing I will say I did enjoy was Ichika\'s reactions. She has some really different ways to express how disgusted she is toward Ryou and the reactions are probably worth watching.It can make you laugh but it can also make you creeped out on how f***ed up the story is.But we weebs love seeing things like this so if you find it acceptable then go ahead and give it a try. story of Amakusa Ryou harassing Ichika begins.

Essentially it seems that if you have been conditioned to think in cliches about 'power imbalance' in relationships and think age gaps are 'problematic' then you will hate this.If you have a more open mind then id say this is a pretty average show so far.The art is somewhat stylised and has a washed-out look as though they want it to look like a comic. Can't say i'm a fan but it doesn't particularly bother me. What can be jarring is the sound, some of the voices really give you the impression of listening to someone talking in a recording booth...- there's a bottled, confined harmonic to it. Catchy OP though.Now the central dynamic here is an older guy (27) chasing a younger girl (16/17), which seems to be a massive problem for some people, so let's see what is really going on:Ryo is a ladies man, he has had lots of success with women since he was in school due to his looks and intelligence, and now he is quite successful at work with a nice car and his own flat. But he has a poor reputation - as he always found success easy he has never been really invested in a relationship, never apparently been 'in love' and has a history of treating his conquests poorly. In fact Koikimo opens with him walking out on his latest conquest while unable to remember her name.So Ryo is a bit of a jerk and for my money the central theme of Koikimo is that he will have to change if he is to find love. Ichika rejects him outright in ep 1, calling him 'creepy' - and quite rightly. So do we see development from Ryo?The answer is 'some'. I am 9 episodes in now and Ryo has acknowledged that he makes a mess of things and is not very good at relationships; frankly he is possibly even more naive than Ichika, given that he has never been in a long-term relationship before and she is far more conscious of and concerned about the consequences of a relationship than he is.His relationship with his sister, Rio has also developed as a result of him spending more time at their parents' house (which it seems is about to be disrupted as their parents are going to be spending more time at home as per the last episode). Rio is a character I have not figured out yet - she is supportive of her brother but a real busybody, which makes it hard to like her.The developing relationship with Rio and Ichika has a noticeable effect on Ryo at work - enough that we get a side plot about how his demeanor changes for the better, he becomes more approachable and his newfound interest in Light Novels (Ichika's hobby) brings him closer to a colleague (who asks him out).Now for the controversial stuff:Power Imbalance - how does Ryo have power in this situation? He is not in any sense her superior (at work or school), he doesn't really flaunt his money (he only buys Ichika flowers and plushies and gets her a Light Novel for Christmas). He hasn't invited her to his flat or given her a lift in his car. So far as I can see he hasn't done anything that a persistent 17 year old couldn't do. All his supposed power or authority mean nothing to a high-school girl living with her parents.Age gap - is presented as a concern by numerous parties and immediately called 'creepy' by Ichika. So hardly presented uncritically. Koikimo is a very straight take on such a relationship, there is no fan service and little humour, so it gives the impression that it is trying to be taken seriously.He threatens Tamaru - well, he glares at him. Not really an issue.Summing up, I would say that this was not at all the 'creepy' anime it was being made out to be. It isn't anything I think people should be offended by, neither is it a masterpiece. I would say pretty average and personally I think the feels from Higehiro are superior, but the dynamics there are quite different as well. - there's a bottled, confined harmonic to it.

The secondary characters in this anime are also important for the story as they advise and help the protagonists to be more united and turn that disgust into love of Ichika towards Ryou and has a good ending that...leaves you more than satisfied.I recommend it?For my part, yes, I recommend it.Punctuation:9/10 leaves you more than satisfied.I recommend it?For my part, yes, I recommend it.Punctuation:9/10', ""This anime is a solid romance story. It had a good pace and characters that fit together. The conflict was a genuine challenge for the main characters and didn't feel forced. And they didn't overdo the drama.To get the negatives out of the way, I'll start with those. The age gap is not that big of a problem but Ichika is underage, which the show acknowledges is a major problem. The voice actors were mumbling for the most part and the art wasn't the best though I kind of liked it. Also, this isn't what you'd call super exciting.That aside, the story was done...properly. It had a natural flow which made it kind of relaxing. Character development was well-done and captured the personalities of each character. Ryou was a salaryman who was popular with woman which ended up giving him a shallow personality with love long forgotten and Ichika was a straightforward high school girl with not much charm or existing love life. It kind of feel's like The Ancient Magus's Bride in how the two interact, get to know each other, and build a relationship.This wasn't based on a fetish as most people think it is with the older guy and high school girl relation. One thing that I saw was that it took a cliché like visiting your crush who is sick, and, instead of doing something perverted, it made it feel like the story actually called for the situation and used it to resolve a conflict.I liked it. Though I like a lot of weird things. I'd say give it a try, if the first episode doesn't do it for you, than it won't get much better later on. properly.

Most romance anime follow a similar template but this does not.The anime brought up on age difference in romance and also talk about how society will view them, which is relevant to this society, compared to some cliché romance anime. Hence I do not understand why people find it hard to watch cause of the age gap.The opening songs, ending songs and OSTS are all top tier, like how other reviews said. One of the best few songs they have in anime, in...my opinion at least. One of the few anime that I would not skip the opening and ending tracks.Overall, It was an enjoyable anime and if you are romance anime fan to more in depth things such as oregairu I would recommend this anime to you. my opinion at least.

I liked Ichika because she was sweet with a conscience, but Ryou was gross af. After 2 episodes, I thought it was okay and that I could probably get behind the fact that Ichika was a high-school student, but episode 3 grossed me out when Ryou called her cold remarks ""sexier"" when she was sick. Why could we have not just focused on the premise of romantic love? I feel like if the plot would have focused on this aspect rather...than making it sexual, I would have been able to continue this anime. Not only that, but Ryou comes off as a manipulative creep along with his creepy sister who supports his constant harassment toward Ichika. I also don\'t understand what mother in her right mind would like her daughter dating a grown ass man while she\'s in high school because I\'m sure any mom\'s alarm bells would start ringing. than making it sexual, I would have been able to continue this anime.

The premise of the story is problematic considering that Ryo is 27 and Ichika is only 17. He offers his body after coincidentally bumping into her again as a way to thank her for saving him but she rejects him, calling him creepy (rightfully so). She helped him without expecting anything in return and her genuine and kind-heartedness in that moment makes him fall head over heels for her.The anime is your typical romance anime and for the most part has a light hearted feel, fueled by Ryo and Ichika's comedic yet...endearing interactions. It uses a lot of cliches but is well written enough that it's not cringey to watch. Koikimo, though it doesn't bring anything new to the romance genre it hits the spot if you're craving an easy to watch romance.For me, Rio really makes the anime. Rio (Ryo's sister) acts as a bridge between the protagonsts throughout the series and offers an objective perspective on the relationship. In a way she's the voice of the audience and points out the potential problems the main characters don't notice. Ryo's character development is pointed out throughout the series, having had a history of being a womaniser and is now really trying to be a decent person for Ichika.

I ask that you do not let that be a deterrent, yes I can see that this may appear as a predator attempting to groom a young girl. But I think they way this show addresses the feelings of each character is important and deserves reflection before immediate dismissal of the series.Story 7/10 - The story is light hearted without many complications its is an enjoyable experience  and did have me glued to my seat as I enjoyed the series. It does...have a myriad of shojuo Cliches that we see in many anime/Manga romance series but they did these cliches well and I didn’t feel bored at any point. The story is fresh enough to keep you intrigued but doesn’t break any boundaries in regards to the drama/SOL or romance genres.Art 7/10 - The art style was nothing ground breaking and truthfully I am not a fan of background CGI for characters. I am not to aware of the cost for background animation but it does appear lazy at times. Of course if it makes productions cost easier for the producers I can move past it and get on board. The art style of the main characters is soft and pleasant to the eyes. They highlight emotions well and really get the characters feeling onto the screen. Studio Nomad meet my expectations for this romance/drama story. Good job!Sound 7/10 - Alrighty I am a sucker for pleasant sound design. Without it most romance shows come up quite short. Ill brush over the OP and ED and say both were much better than I was expecting for this show. I’m used to mediocre OPs and EDs when it does come to this genre, but the OP/ED selection was great! Background/OST track was lighthearted for majority of the series and matched the atmosphere that the producers wanted to create. They did put forward some we drafted dramatic music and I think overall it was a behind sound experience.Charters 8/10 - The Characters are usually massive hits or misses in shows like this. I do not think I would have enjoyed the show as much without this cast of characters. Both main leads are very interesting albeit done before. Ryo piqued my interest the most as we see a diverse development of a mature adult who really begins to understand the implications of his sometimes outlandish actions. A big Critique of the series is the age gap between our main characters and Ryo’s apparent disregard for Ichika’s feelings. I can see where this may turn viewers away from the series but both characters learn to set boundaries throughout the series and Ryo appears to be a character that comprehend the gravity of the situation he places himself and his love interest in. The supporting cast was also a great bonus in this series. Matsuda and Rio were loveable sides characters that clearly had the best interest of our MC’s in heart. Matsuda is a charter troupe we have seen a thousand times but I didn’t once get annoyed by him so I give high props to the Voice actor. Overall great characters that seem real and somewhat done to earth.Enjoyment 8/10 - Being from Australia I currently find myself amid the restrictions of the pandemic. Stuck at home and feeling somewhat sour this show was the sweetness I needed to bring myself back to life. I enjoyed each episode of this series. I was pleasantly surprised by the characters and enjoyed watching them bond over the course of each episode. This series was something I could switch my brain off too and simply enjoy. Watching it in one sitting and reviewing immediately after probably won’t leave to the most thought out review but I hope it helps in some regard. But i can see myself rewatching it again!Overall 7.5: I was set on an 8 for this show but i think 7.5 suits it best. Nothing about this show got me up out of my seat cheering, but it executes a lot of features that contribute to a pleasant and enjoyable viewing experience. I think if you give this series the time it will treat you well and hopefully brighten your day as it did mine. have a myriad of shojuo Cliches that we see in many anime/Manga romance series but they did these cliches well and I didn’t feel bored at any point.

If you think the normalization of pedophilia+grooming is wrong, you'll empathize with the 1 ratings; on the other hand, the exploration of a problematic fantasy in fictional content is the general gist of the justification for people who give this series a 10 and that has,, a degree of validity to it. So what I'm going to say is that I went into this series acknowledging n agreeing with both of these thoughts - alternating between 1. enjoying this show's generic romance...moments/tropes and 2. being disgusted when my suspension of disbelief about the two protagonists' problematic relationship dynamics (which are inextricably tied to their difference in stages of life, i.e., yep, Ryou is a pedophile irl!) is disrupted by something that clearly shows how much of a high schooler/child Ichika is, etc.. But, I just finished the last two episodes and ugh they were bad enough to spoil the enjoyment that I DID get out of this show up till that point. The way that this show wraps up our heroes' relationship as they approach a new stage of it together is shoddy as hell and its poor quality is compounded by how seriously it takes itself. There's a lot more I can comment on but that's the most important part. This isn't worth the watch. The OP is pretty fun though, I had fun jamming to it weekly - if anything, maybe go check that out lol.Story: 4/10Art: 6/10Sound: 7/10Character: 3/10Enjoyment: 5/10Overall: 5/10 moments/tropes and 2. being disgusted when my suspension of disbelief about the two protagonists' problematic relationship dynamics (which are inextricably tied to their difference in stages of life, i.e., yep, Ryou is a pedophile irl!) is disrupted by something that clearly shows how much of a high schooler/child Ichika is, etc..

Here it is usually accepted to have an age gap that goes for even 15 years apart. Although of course, it ain't everyone's cup of tea,  including myself. Just to get that out of the way.Now my real issue with the anime is the characters and the lack of actual development in both them and the story. I am usually a sucker for romance/shojo animes/manga, but this one didn't click right with me at all. Maybe because I felt that we...don't really have any real connections with the main characters. Hell' even they themselves don't seem to know that much about each other, which is truly lame. I think this show had the potential to be good, yet it failed miserably. I wanted to explore the characters more and see them stuck in actual events that would show their true nature, but we got no progress with any of the characters.To sum it up, there is nothing special in this anime. It's your average romance show. I know that I won't be remembering it a few years from now for other than how controversial it was perceived when it came out.

I don't think this should be used as an example for real life, but to be enjoyed as a fantasy. In the anime, the interactions between the two main characters was very organic and the character development was pretty fantastic. I really liked how one of the mothers was a businesswoman, and that one of the high school girls wanted to be a lawyer. You don't see this very often in anime (mothers are usually restricted to dish-washing and cooking cameos and high school girls are usually air-headed fillers used to emphasize how cool a guy is...by sighing and squealing).Also liked how the older guy helped the MC with her subject choice. And how the MC herself was pretty realistic and had a good head on her shoulders. The only thing I found a tad off-putting was the reactions to the male MC, especially from the female MC's mother. There wasn't much resistance socially, and the only realistic reaction was from the male MC's dad. Not sure if this is cultural though. Overall a very enjoyable, light-hearted anime not to be taken too seriously. by sighing and squealing).Also liked how the older guy helped the MC with her subject choice.

I'm at a lack of words from the character design to the sound quality. To everyone who liked this, and on behalf of everyone who reasonably dislikes this anime, why? I found myself wanting to poke out my eyes with my nails multiple times while watching. Ill start with discussing the fact that everyone's character sucked. The only reason I'm giving character a 2 is because of my beloved Tamaru who carried the show like a king. There was so much unnecessary drama that could have been avoided or cut. The...quality of the art also quickly decreased after the first few episodes and their faces all started looking smooshed or the same. The story was also very strange to me because of how the characters reacted when they found out that Ryou was 10 years older then Ichika. It doesn't make sense to me how both of their families were pretty much fine with the crime that was happening. Very predictable anime and I beg those who are wondering if they should watch this show to instead watch paint dry, I guarantee you will find more enjoyment from that. quality of the art also quickly decreased after the first few episodes and their faces all started looking smooshed or the same.

Personally, I cannot say that I dislike the main focus, but I also do not allow myself to accept that ethically this is good, when at the beginning it was explicitly based on a harassment of the protagonist towards Ichika and that the reality was, that it is socially accepted by a theme of the Ryou\'s physical hegemony and charisma. Because if the MC had been a fat man with the smell of obo, they would all be founding the anime.Already leaving the...""politically correct"" anime is not a big deal either, the animation is even flashy, the designs are not too flashy even to have a shoujo demographic and the cast of characters is quite small and taking out the main couple is not they hint too much of them, even though they fulfill their role in the show.In short, I consider Koikimo a work for fans of the romance genre and they would have already appreciated the most award-winning titles or simply look for a series of this type that in recent years were scarce but it is truly a regular / acceptable work that the most rewarding you will find it is that it has a beginning and an end that in this type of work often cannot be adapted.Score 7/10 ""politically correct"" anime is not a big deal either, the animation is even flashy, the designs are not too flashy even to have a shoujo demographic and the cast of characters is quite small and taking out the main couple is not they hint too much of them, even though they fulfill their role in the show.In short, I consider Koikimo a work for fans of the romance genre and they would have already appreciated the most award-winning titles or simply look for a series of this type that in recent years were scarce but it is truly a regular / acceptable work that the most rewarding you will find it is that it has a beginning and an end that in this type of work often cannot be adapted.Score 7/10', ""Legally it's questionable, morally it's wrong, personally it's concerning.Setting aside these factors, this show revolves around your typical clichéd story of dramatized romance, involvement of a third-party on both ends(male lead and female lead) which ultimately ends up in both somehow realizing they truly like each other and care for one another.To begin with, the popular and seemingly used to hanging around women, known for being a playboy even by his sister. The male lead Ryo Amakusa comes across as a creepy and insincere person who is constantly stalking the female lead(Ichika Arima) and trying to coerce her into a relationship with him which...he is, if not for the fact that he is portrayed as a good-looking man in the anime.Overlooking that which is what 8-9 episodes of the anime consists of, my impression of Ryo gradually changed as time went on in the anime, from a worrying obsessive, intrusive 27 years of age adult pursuing a 17 year old high school girl into a guy who is genuinely in love and honest, expressing his uncontrollable feelings as direct as possible. Despite the way he approached Ichika and acted in a disturbing manner, Ryo is definitely one of those characters that will grow on you and somehow or another you'll begin to support him.On the other hand, the female lead Ichika Arima was depicted as a ordinary high school girl with no particular attractive feature apart from her sympathetic personality, her thoughtfulness and care for others. Initially, these characteristics of hers were attractive and all, however in contrast to Ryo, this caused my impression of her to decline. The reason was closely associated to her indecisiveness, her alarming way of thinking when it came to the way she approached her romantic feelings and towards people's romantic feelings towards her.Moving on, the male lead's love rival Kai Tamaru, the highschool classmate of Ichika. Some would want to support this ship, till you witness his cunningness and manipulation of Ichika to gain her favor and separate her from Ryo. Unsure of his feelings towards Ichika orginally, he quickly changed his mind after noticing Ryo talking to Ichika. Basically Ichika Nakano from the Quintessential Quintuplets. I mean a win is a win right?Next, the admirable character Masuda . Masuda being the perfect wingman but at the same time intruding at the most important moments, yes he is the cockblock character. However in those moments of need he is there to extend a listening ear to Ryo and Ichika and provide constructive criticism which helps the plot move along. Moreover in the commendable scenario that he happened to stumble upon Ichika and Tamaru on together on their Pilgrimage, he did not deliberately third-wheel to prevent Tamaru from making his advances.Not to forget, Arie Matsushima, Ryo's admirer. The one that was simply introduced just to be hurt. Her assertiveness when it came to her feelings though she knew it was a losing game and maturely respected Ryou's rejection and when Ryou pleaded t her to give up. Besides that she was also one of the factors which allowed Ryou to put into consideration and question himself on whether he was willing to bear the consequences of having a relationship with a highschool girl and endure the adversities they may face together. Logically speaking and lets be real, this is your best girl.And Last but not least, the one who set this all up, close friend of Ichika Arima,Ryo's  sister and romance counsellor Rio Amakusa. Perpetually meddling in all the characters issues and the main plot mover, she is there to oversee the relationship between Ryou and Ichika.In the end as mentioned before, it is undeniably concerning that not only do Ryou and Ichika have a 10 year age gap, but also the fact that Ryou is a working adult and is a well known playboy while Ichika is still in highschool.

A lot of people have mentioned that it romanticizes sexual harassment and i actually agree with this to a certain extent and i believe the anime (and its source acknowledge this). Ryo at the beginning is nothing short of selfish, entitled and arrogant. I mean further on the dude literally says he only sent her gifts to make himself feel good, completely dismissing her feelings, the feelings of a 17-year-old. But where i believe...many people go wrong when watching this anime is assuming Ryo is rewarded for his creepy behaviour at the beginning and never reprimanded - which is the complete opposite to a vital message i think the story tries to deliver us. Ryo in fact is never rewarded for being nothing short of a creep at the beginning but is given a chance to grow, he begins giving her presents out of good nature and the relationship which began one-sided evolves into a shared companionship, they do things which they both enjoy. Then, finally at the end his feelings for her aren't out of a weird obsession but genuine care as he detaches himself from her as he comes to terms with how selfish he has been. Yes, i completely understand why people dislike this anime and i really did for the first 8 episodes or so, of course it isn't perfect but it shouldn't be disregarded because it explores a, what is for the western world, controversial topic. many people go wrong when watching this anime is assuming Ryo is rewarded for his creepy behaviour at the beginning and never reprimanded - which is the complete opposite to a vital message i think the story tries to deliver us.

The art is pretty nice and the characters are cute but the intercharacter relationships are odd and questionable at best. A lot of people in this world pretend the dynamic between the characters is natural and even encouraged, which just didn\'t sit well with me. Most of the characters see no issue in someone stalking & heavily pursuing a high school girl, despite her clearly being uncomfortable, just because he is sorta really hot. If it was met with disapproval at any point & they acknowledged it a bit more seriously but still did what they wanted,...I think I\'d feel at least a bit better than just having them pretend the problems don\'t exist. They misrepresented, or completely missed the mark on the real troubles of an ""age-gap"" relationship ( and I\'m using this term very lightly considering one of the characters is a minor ) and completely avoid the heavy, truthful side of it.

Just keep in mind that the main and the biggest issue in the series is heavily glossed over and never really acknowledged for its real problems.This isn\'t to say the anime had to completely focus on those problems - it would become much darker and heavier that way, but at least a brief mention or a weird look or anything like that would\'ve humanized the relationship more and made the stakes heavier IMO.

Koimiko felt tailor-made to fit the most overused plotline in this genre though not enough to really go into depth. It\'s the same old (1) guy realizes he likes girl and tries to pursue the other party, albeit half-heartedly or insincerely at first; (2) hijinks ensues, (3) girl slowly liking them...back, (4) guy finally having 2nd thoughts after the ""chase phase"" because of their age difference and (5) they somehow find resolve so he can wait for her. While watching, it was like I knew all the major points.

He\'s chosen a quite mature way to deal with rejection and it\'s not something you see everyday in the shoujo genre.

I will keep it short and stick to what I think is necessary. Bluntly, I want to address the reception of this anime, especially after having followed it during its first episodes, I even found an instant lowest rating just for the fact of the age gap even if at the time only the first episode aired.Now, the plot or story is definitely not original, especially if you grew up in Asia, where there...are a handful of rom coms/drama of this type. Regardless, I still enjoyed this series. It was fun being able to see how the characters\' relationship towards each other and towards their own selves grew.Having mentioned that, such age gap circumstance should be kept in mind throughout the series. The anime provides a perspective covering this controversial topic, and I found it nice that the main ship still had to go through the usual bumps of a more normal romance story while still acknowledging that age gap issue at the same time.Having a 27 year old working man and a 17 year old jk (This ain\'t paedophilia because Ichika isn\'t really ""prepubescent"", which is the technical description required for paedophilia) the 10 year age gap does raise a societal issue. And given this, I like how the anime gives a different perspective in viewing this age gap.This brings me to my main point; ***I don\'t know how to explain this without hinting spoilers at this point, so take this line as a warning***Think about it for a moment: how would you perceive an 18 year old man being attracted to an 8 year old girl? I would subconsciously see this 18 year old as a paedophile.Now then: how would you perceive a 45 year old man being attracted to a 35 year old woman? It would be more acceptable to the social eye, wouldn\'t it? Still, when you think about it, it\'s the same 10-year gap.This anime had got me thinking about these things, and some of us may still be against this type of relationship, some may arrive at a more complex opinion after watching. This anime did a good job in addressing such a dilemma, that regardless of how you think afterwards, it can\'t be denied that the anime does make a fair point as the plot progresses (still trying to avoid spoilers here haha)Having said all that, I\'d like to close my review by stating that if you have an instant negative judgement after reading the plot description, it is a completely normal reaction, but I would like you to least watch this for yourself in order to gain a new perspective in age gap topic and how one can possibly handle such a situation. Genuine love is present between the characters in this anime and I really love how it handled the age gap issue, how the characters arrived at a way to address such an important factor.P.s. I rated this one point lower in the review since my taste seems to be lesser than the others in this community. What can I say? I enjoy life haha are a handful of rom coms/drama of this type.

A man is so deeply in love with someone the same age as his sister.He also has an office job and is ten years older than Ichika. Now, age gaps can be perfectly fine given the context, however, I think 17 and 27 are a bit of a stretch considering one hasn\'t even graduated. I think if Ichika was older this may have been acceptable, but she is simply not even an adult yet.It\'s quite...honestly, disgusting.Besides the age gap, the story is dry. Ryō is a creepy man who stalks a girl that saved him from falling down the stairs. Ichika, is clearly not interested, yet he goes to extreme measures so she can like him back, it\'s weird. He is basically a stalker. Learning everything she likes even to her favorite shampoo and her house address. But then Ichika takes a 360 halfway through the series and suddenly likes him back. Their chemistry is just very dry. I don\'t see love. I see infatuation.I also am weirded out by Ryō\'s sister. Who gives Ryō all of Ichikas information even though she was clearly not into him simply because the relationship is ""fun"". UMMMMM what???? Same with the parents I find it very odd how the parents just let this relationship happen.Lastly, there\'s Arie Matsushima (Ryos coworker) and Kai Tamaru (Ichikas classmate) who both fell in love with the main love interests. Arie and Ryo were so much better for each other than Ryo and Ichika. I saw more chemistry from them than the main couple. Arie was also a much more likable character, she\'s sweet and truly seems like she loves Ryo. The same goes for Kai and Ichika. I was so sad when Kai was rejected because it didn\'t make any sense. They looked very close and always enjoyed each other\'s company. Their chemistry seemed very real and not forced at all. They were very cute and would have been much better together. Also, Kai is just a much nicer person. Both Kai and Ryo were rejected by Ichika and the responses were much different. Ryo was a stalker, and Kai respected her choice and didn\'t pressure her into anything. I think that should speak volumes.In the end, this was very disappointing and kinda gross. But at least Ryo is waiting until Ichikas is an adult, like that\'s any better. honestly, disgusting.Besides the age gap, the story is dry.

Though based on an ongoing manga, these 12 episodes have a good self-contained arc and resolve all of the conflicts they raise. It handles the issue of a man in his late 20s chasing after a 16-year old girl quite deftly. Though Ryo has a history of being seen as a playboy, he falls for Ichika precisely because his charisma doesn't work on her and she won't put up with any of his bull. Moreover, it's hinted early on that, rather than him being a...womaniser, he was used more as a bored plaything for women who wanted him for his looks, and Ichika is the first person he's actively pursued. Though Ryo is very forward in making his feelings known (many, many times), it ends up being a surprisingly innocent and endearing story rather than the creepy grooming fantasy that you might fear by looking at the concept.The show's main weakness was the mediocre art and direction, which couldn't quite pull off some of the most important moments. The voice acting is good, but the recording quality has that made-during-a-pandemic sound to it; Ryo's seiyu sounds like he's recording in his wardrobe for the whole series. Fortunately the characters are likeable enough to power through any technical problems. womaniser, he was used more as a bored plaything for women who wanted him for his looks, and Ichika is the first person he's actively pursued.

Riddled with problems, and a sus concept, koikimo has raised a lot of discussions due to the nature of its story but in my opinion, despite its many flaws and shortcomings, it was a relatively enjoyable watch that I did want to tune into every week. Without further ado, lets get into the good the bad and the ugly for the spring 2021 anime, its disgusting to...call this love, koikimo.Starting off with the good as usual, we have the humour. I’ve probably mentioned this before somewhere, but I’m part of the faction who enjoys boke/tsukkomi comedy. Take araragi and senjougahara, mai and sakuta, where the entire concept is one party says something outrageous - the boke - and then a tsukkomi comes out of nowhere to shut that line of thinking down. In this anime its ryo who is the boke, saying outrageous and sometimes fairly creepy things whilst ichika shuts him down. The chemistry displayed by the pair in these scenes are lovely, and the humour had me dying from laughter a lot since, even though this type of comedy is hard to pull off, when done right it can elevate a story much more than expected, and puts a light hearted twist to moments, making the anime feel more airy if that makes sense.Then there’s the character progression. This anime suffers from daily bog standard character archetypes at the beginning, a playboy philanderer who has so many one night stands he can’t count, and a school girl who doesn’t know what she wants in life, but the changes these characters show are nothing to scoff at. Let's start with ryo. He gets out of his damaging lifestyle of work, play with a woman, forget to eat etc. and becomes a much better person through Ichika and this was actually really nice to see. Ryo changed in a lot of ways thanks to Ichika as he started to truly understand what it meant for him to be in love in general, let alone be in love with her. We can tell that his thought patterns have changed as he’s become pretty self-aware of what he’s doing with ichika by the end of the anime as he does realise what he’s doing can be grossly inappropriate but also in the irrational realm of love which doesn’t make anything easier for him. He also quite obviously changes with how he treats women, going from a womaniser who didn’t accept valentines chocolates without saying a reason to a man who accepted ones that were truly heartfelt. We see his different attitude with arietty for example, best girl btw, as he had the opportunity to beat and delete but instead he answers her confessions honestly and tries to make amends. In other words, by the end of the anime Ryo has undoubtedly become a better person. This really redeemed an otherwise kinda gross overbearing character that was hella weird to like or even root for at the beginning, after his unwanted advances and his pedantic stalker like attitude from the first episode, the change really fleshed him out.Then there’s the changes to ichika. She’s initially portrayed as this shy joshikousei who’s bloody average in all sense of the word. She truly has no distinction. Apart from her comedy, she didn’t really do much at the beginning, only rejecting the advances of ryo but she slowly changed as time dragged on. But as a character in this show, her role was executed quite perfectly all things considered. As the show goes on, ichika starts to be painted as a student with her own self-doubt and complications, as she struggles in school and with having someone like Ryo fawn over her. She’s unsure about her future, her present and her past but she keeps moving forward, trying to go with what she wants. She’s also got enough common sense to not just turn down the older man’s love confession, but also put him in his place which is quite funny in its own right considering the ten year age gap. And yet, as the series progresses, Ichika starts getting used to Ryo’s antics and lets him invade positively into her life. While it is bloody bad for a 27 year old to like someone who basically hasn’t even reached the age to go to university, you can quite easily see the kind of confidence booster Ryo’s actions have been for Ichika. Her doubts about herself don’t exactly go away magically, but she starts to accept them and work on them. We can often see that fIchika is slowly becoming happier and happier, lifting her head a little higher each day thanks to Ryo’s antics. When ryo made her the study guide when she was sick, she basically pushed herself to passing the exam with good marks to repay that kindness, giving her a boost and showing her what she can actually do if she puts her mind to it. We also see ichika slowly getting confidence in asking ryo out, and she becomes more confident in both actions - from the hug on valentines - and words - telling ryo to wait for her to be older so they can actually date, and she finally realises that she can turn her passion into a job, being an art curator, thanks to ryo’s meddling. She eventually becomes more assertive and starts striving for what she wants, and ryo was and is that gentle, yet annoying push for her to move forward.The last good I’ll talk about is the ending. Navigating an ending for such a premise with a 10 year age gap between a teen and an adult is a tricky situation, not helped by the mushoku tensei effect, and the fact that there will be two factions when the conclusion comes into sight - they either get together discarding the age gap or they don’t discarding the entire romance portion of this anime. Whilst the latter has had some beautiful renditions, like garden of words and after the rain, this anime was not in the slightest as poetic as those two or as explorative so that option would have caused outrage as well. By taking the middle-ground, both sides are left pleasantly surprised, as it's a truly good ending where the characters are given time to mature before coming back and tackling the age gap without being surrounded by naysayers, whilst also leaving the possibility of a second season that can hopefully follow the side character’s stories more, as I truly vibed with them as well.My last good for this anime is the animation itself, the art. It takes a more retro approach, that probably was chosen because the studio is broke but that’s a topic for another day, but the entire thing was painted in a fun cutesy style colour palette that was both visually pleasing and entertaining. The made use of flashes with character pop-outs so we can understand the emotions, the subtle washing of the backgrounds when the main duo were engaging in something romantic, pastel colours that really hit home with the shoujo them and so on. It was quite visually pleasing, and I really don’t think a larger budget would have done it any better as the sort of roughness of the bad cgi bystanders and the fairly sharp faces were definitely an attraction rather than a distraction for me personally.Moving on, now I’m going to talk about the bad. Sound design. Let me get this out the way first, the op and ed were certified bangers no questions asked and the relevant animations for them were also brilliantly done, with catchy hooks and bright tones throughout. But the voice acting. The voice acting. SDAHJKDBJKASD. I’ll be honest with you, nine times out of ten I’m watching anime on my phone in bed unless I’m working on something. Koikimo dropped around 2pm in the UK so it usually dropped whilst I was in the middle of studying so I’d have my headphones on right. I have these decent noise cancelling ones for sony that I use to revise with so I played the episode and my ears bled. Okay exaggeration aside, the voice acting was mixed horrendously. The voice acting itself was good, but it sounded like they threw the seiyuu’s into a cave and forgot that echoes exist. Like my audio isn’t all that great either, but I’m a bloody student running a youtube channel for fun using a scuffed setup and even I know that I need to reduce the background noise so my voice can be heard clearer. All things considered though, when watching in a relatively normal environment - i.e. on a phone or speakers, with windows open and with a slight amount of background noise, it isn’t that noticeable and after a while listening to the voices, I barely even registered it and that’s why its in the bad and not the ugly.Now to get into the ugly. Enabling. Ryo is 27. Ichika is 17. I don’t want you to forget that fact whilst I talk about this. Rio calls herself a friend to ichika and a sister to ryo, yet she doesn’t hesitate to essentially throw her best friend under the bus and give her private details mind you to her madly in love stalker like brother in the name of love because she thought it would be fun. Hmm. Then we got her own flesh and blood mother, who allows ryo to visit her when she’s ill, granted by accident, but leaves them alone by themselves and then gets on first name terms with the quasi weirdo whenever he comes over. Sure, it could be played off as ichika being tsundere since she doesn't explicitly want ryo to go away - by that I mean literally telling him sternly rather in a joke context- buts its still concerning. The only ones in this anime who seem relatively concerned are ryo’s dad, tamaru and arietty, with the latter two possibly having alternative motives for doing so but they still looked out for her nonetheless. Realistically, apart from those three and maybe ichika, ryo’s advances were basically allowed and without resistance it could be argued that they were more promoted by the others, but honestly, since it was ryo and the character progression eh showed when he wanted to distance himself after realising how overbearing he was to an underage teenager, we can see that everything he did was with good intentions and that if he was sternly told to not do what he was doing, he wouldn’t have carried on, but the point still stands.To conclude, this anime was quite enjoyable as something to wind down to, with its funny skits, interesting characters that pushed each other to change for the better, and came to a ridiculously nice conclusion that was well-thought out in my opinion. The chemistry of the comedic duo to the light glimmer of warmth that permeated every scene through the pastel colour palette that is synonymous at this point with shoujos to the weirdly expressive facial features that accentuated the scenes, coupled with banging sound tracks made this a relatively enjoyable experience. This anime is not the greatest of all time, far from it actually, with a shaky premise that wasn’t truly considering the interpretation of the audience, but the grounded execution that delved sporadically into the problems of it did show some self awareness that was pleasant to see. This anime might not be for everyone, but if you like shoujo’s where the comedy is the main selling point with relatively strong character development, do give this one a shot. Remember guys, if you enjoyed this anime, it won’t be considered too disgusting to call this love.-Review taken from the transcript of my video, do watch it on yt if you have the time! call this love, koikimo.Starting off with the good as usual, we have the humour. I’ve probably mentioned this before somewhere, but I’m part of the faction who enjoys boke/tsukkomi comedy.

It was quite visually pleasing, and I really don’t think a larger budget would have done it any better as the sort of roughness of the bad cgi bystanders and the fairly sharp faces were definitely an attraction rather than a distraction for me personally.Moving on, now I’m going to talk about the bad. Sound design. Let me get this out the way first, the op and ed were certified bangers no questions asked and the relevant animations for them were also brilliantly done, with catchy hooks and bright tones throughout. But the voice acting. The voice acting. SDAHJKDBJKASD. I’ll be honest with you, nine times out of ten I’m watching anime on my phone in bed unless I’m working on something. Koikimo dropped around 2pm in the UK so it usually dropped whilst I was in the middle of studying so I’d have my headphones on right. I have these decent noise cancelling ones for sony that I use to revise with so I played the episode and my ears bled. Okay exaggeration aside, the voice acting was mixed horrendously. The voice acting itself was good, but it sounded like they threw the seiyuu’s into a cave and forgot that echoes exist. Like my audio isn’t all that great either, but I’m a bloody student running a youtube channel for fun using a scuffed setup and even I know that I need to reduce the background noise so my voice can be heard clearer. All things considered though, when watching in a relatively normal environment - i.e. on a phone or speakers, with windows open and with a slight amount of background noise, it isn’t that noticeable and after a while listening to the voices, I barely even registered it and that’s why its in the bad and not the ugly.Now to get into the ugly. Enabling. Ryo is 27. Ichika is 17. I don’t want you to forget that fact whilst I talk about this. Rio calls herself a friend to ichika and a sister to ryo, yet she doesn’t hesitate to essentially throw her best friend under the bus and give her private details mind you to her madly in love stalker like brother in the name of love because she thought it would be fun. Hmm. Then we got her own flesh and blood mother, who allows ryo to visit her when she’s ill, granted by accident, but leaves them alone by themselves and then gets on first name terms with the quasi weirdo whenever he comes over. Sure, it could be played off as ichika being tsundere since she doesn't explicitly want ryo to go away - by that I mean literally telling him sternly rather in a joke context- buts its still concerning. The only ones in this anime who seem relatively concerned are ryo’s dad, tamaru and arietty, with the latter two possibly having alternative motives for doing so but they still looked out for her nonetheless. Realistically, apart from those three and maybe ichika, ryo’s advances were basically allowed and without resistance it could be argued that they were more promoted by the others, but honestly, since it was ryo and the character progression eh showed when he wanted to distance himself after realising how overbearing he was to an underage teenager, we can see that everything he did was with good intentions and that if he was sternly told to not do what he was doing, he wouldn’t have carried on, but the point still stands.To conclude, this anime was quite enjoyable as something to wind down to, with its funny skits, interesting characters that pushed each other to change for the better, and came to a ridiculously nice conclusion that was well-thought out in my opinion. The chemistry of the comedic duo to the light glimmer of warmth that permeated every scene through the pastel colour palette that is synonymous at this point with shoujos to the weirdly expressive facial features that accentuated the scenes, coupled with banging sound tracks made this a relatively enjoyable experience. This anime is not the greatest of all time, far from it actually, with a shaky premise that wasn’t truly considering the interpretation of the audience, but the grounded execution that delved sporadically into the problems of it did show some self awareness that was pleasant to see. This anime might not be for everyone, but if you like shoujo’s where the comedy is the main selling point with relatively strong character development, do give this one a shot. Remember guys, if you enjoyed this anime, it won’t be considered too disgusting to call this love.-Review taken from the transcript of my video, do watch it on yt if you have the time!"", 'A love between two people is a beautiful thing.

But even if they did it would not help the anime since it comedy relies heavily on the fact that he is aggressively pursuing her even if she constantly rejects him (which is not really funny, it's just weird, and romanticizes harassment).There are times it can give a wholesome vibe but unfortunately it gets tainted by the fact that he is 27 and she is 17...and there is no organic development in their relationship. Everything he learns about her is through information given to him from his sister or dates are orchestrated by her which is weird and also creepy.Tamuru (the other love interest) is a better love interest.You could try to overlook the age difference but unfortunately they constantly remind you about either explicitly or implicitly. and there is no organic development in their relationship.

It breaks my heart to see so many bad reviews which may have arisen from the awkward first 2 episodes and the age difference. If this is a concern of yours, I can say...that the male lead doesn't try to do anything indecent towards the girl.

I avoided Koi to Yobu ni wa Kimochi Warui (Kiokimo) for a couple of months because of the ""old-guy/young-girl"" story line.  That was my loss due to my truly ""prejudging"" the story.Ryou is a slick 27-28ish successful guy when we meet him who is too pushy, self-absorbed, with little awareness of the feelings of others.  But, he is also deeply drawn to someone for the first time in his life.  He is also, though emotionally pushy, not someone who would physically push himself on a...woman.Ichika is, though innocent and modest, a young woman who sees through Ryou\'s rubbish and is unwilling to put up with it.  It is unfortunate that some viewers have not seen how strong and smart she is and willing to look at her underlying feels.  Note that Ichika\'s, and for that matter Ryou\'s) choices are complex with no clear or obvious solution until the very end of the story arc.Looking at the elephant directly, the choices made by the creators were kind, tasteful, and I believe were within the boundaries of a modern society.That said, Kiokimo reminded me of two of my favorite story arcs, the Monogatari full series as well as the Kuzu no Honkai (Scum\'s List) single season arc.  Kiokimo is told using a fair amount of internal dialogue.  Additionally, the characters, themselves, and not treated as stupid cardboard cutouts but have dignity and the ability to learn from their mistakes.The real reason, though, that I consider this a masterpiece, is that it was deeply satisfying.  Not only was the story believable and choices made were understandable, but the whole package including the story and dialogue, beautiful artwork, terrific sound and pacing along with the creators respect and love for the characters made for an emotional and satisfying arc.  I was, as was Ryou, completely smitten from the very beginning!--Added 8/17/2021--Having watched the series a second time I want to add a few more specific observations:1) I really liked that there were helpful and supportive adult figures outside of the older protagonist. Masuda and Arie were full and interesting and there for Ryou with and ear and helpful advice.  Yuriko is a ""real"" mom to Ichika with thoughtful insight and ideas.  Masuda also is a caring presence for our heroine.2) Rio, Kai and Arie are fully fleshed out and deserve more prominence in a hoped for season 2.  As Arie says of Ichika, she is just an ordinary girl.  Rio, on the other hand is, like Ryou, complex and a little injured.  Arie and Kai are also very interesting people with complex motivations what I wanted explored more.  Kai is particularly insightful, and his interactions with Rio show and interesting direction that a second season could tak.3) Some might wonder why I compared this to Kuzu no Honkai.

The show had some nice romantic moments however it was impossible to enjoy when considering the age gap and blatant paedophilia.All of the characters except tamaru were annoying and selfish and had no character development.

Then after making her like him he decided to back off for a dumb reason and hurt her even further however in real life I would see that a manipulation tactic if love bombing and then distance to...keep a child hooked on them. Rio was a horrible friend since she never told her brother to stop despite seeing how uncomfortable it made her best friend because it entertained her. She easily gave away Ichika's address and phone number and even went as far as telling Tamaru to back off when he was much more age appropriate and better in general for Ichika. The only normal person in their family was the dad but he was painted as a villain for berating ryo's horrible behaviour.The storyline was creepy in general as the male lead was stalking the girl and actively pursuing her despite her many attempts to make him stop.

To redefine the definition of pedophilia it is a psychiatric disorder in which an adult has sexual fantasies about or engages in sexual acts with a prepubescent child [Merriam Webster].I personally do not think Ryou is a pedophile. He only fancies/likes Ichika because her response towards Ryou was different from other girls he had encountered before. In my observation around my social circles, usually guys will chase after a difficult, unapproachable tsudere girl because to them if they managed to capture the heart of...a stone-cold girl, changed her heart to sweet girl and get into a relationship, it will be an achievement for the guy.For a 17 year old girl, the 10 year age gap might be huge but as you grew older..such as 24 year old girl dates with 34 year old man, it may not seems as big as it should have been. Ichika’s choice of words spatted towards Ryou’s offer in Episode 1 showed her maturity well despite her age is just 17. I guess this is how Ryou fancies her and respects her.

First, Ichika is a minor. Although she is 17, she's still a minor. The first few episodes of the anime shows how Ryo bugged Ichika. It also disturbed me how, on the first episode where they met again, Ryo indirectly offered his body to Ichika. That scene made me almost dropped the anime but decided to give it another try. But to my disappointment, it continued. There's also the issue of consent and harrassment in the first few...episodes which didn't sit well with me. There's also that part where Ryo said he would wait for Ichika to grow up. I think it would've been better if he waited before pursuing Ichika and kissing her.Art 5 - The art is okay, though. I know how hard it is to draw and animate so I won't give further comment.Sound 8 - I actually liked the op and ed. I enjoyed listening to it and might download it later.Character 4 - Though the characters can sometimes be cute, I dislike the fact that they all encouraged the relationship between the two. I do understand that love can be complicated, but if they truly wanted what's best for the two of them they should've encouraged waiting. Although, personally, I wanted Ichika to end up with Tamaru and Ryo with his co-worker (I forgot the name). Speaking of those two, I actually liked Tamaru and the co-worker.Enjoyment 4 - I enjoyed the scenes of Ichika and Tamaru, they looked cute together. I also enjoyed watching the co-worker, she's so funny and straightforward.Overall 3 - I think we shouldn't allow this kind of mindset.

This has been long, if you read this, thanks. episodes which didn't sit well with me. There's also that part where Ryo said he would wait for Ichika to grow up. I think it would've been better if he waited before pursuing Ichika and kissing her.Art 5 - The art is okay, though. I know how hard it is to draw and animate so I won't give further comment.Sound 8 - I actually liked the op and ed. I enjoyed listening to it and might download it later.Character 4 - Though the characters can sometimes be cute, I dislike the fact that they all encouraged the relationship between the two. I do understand that love can be complicated, but if they truly wanted what's best for the two of them they should've encouraged waiting. Although, personally, I wanted Ichika to end up with Tamaru and Ryo with his co-worker (I forgot the name). Speaking of those two, I actually liked Tamaru and the co-worker.Enjoyment 4 - I enjoyed the scenes of Ichika and Tamaru, they looked cute together. I also enjoyed watching the co-worker, she's so funny and straightforward.Overall 3 - I think we shouldn't allow this kind of mindset.

The first one was that I hoped it would get better (though that was naive of me) and the second one was pure curiosity. I wanted to see how bad it could get. There were some things I enjoyed about it, and I liked some characters occasionally. However, I have a problem with the entire scope of the show. Some viewers might see grooming here and they won’t be wrong. Though love happens at all ages, it was creepy...to watch an almost 30 year old falling in love with a 17 year old high school girl only because she told him he’s creepy. The entire plot was flawed and creepy, even for an anime. But it wasn’t just that. After all, it’s fiction, you take it or leave it, but it was also quite poorly executed. The characters were insufficiently portrayed and their motives were often under-explained (or shabbily done so, their credibility was close to zero). I didn’t enjoy watching it, I don’t think it gives a good example in many ways and it’s also rather unskillfully produced. to watch an almost 30 year old falling in love with a 17 year old high school girl only because she told him he’s creepy.

This is that anime. Without a doubt, this show is downright creepy and absurdly disgusting to watch. It is quite literally ""Adult stalks and harasses high schooler: the anime"". Simply put, there\'s a reason why anime has a stigma about it to those who don\'t watch any. This show does not help and is one the reasons why anime is still stigmatized.The age gap is the first problem, and the most obvious. I don\'t care about age of consent. Legality of something does...not equal morally correct. There\'s no way you can defend this without sounding like a complete creeper. People who yell and cry about 17 and 19 are weird, I agree.

Genuine creeperRyo is older than me, and I could not imagine being with a high schooler. That\'s seems pretty abhorrent.

If that were to happen, this wouldn\'t have been as bad as it is and would\'ve been an average romance anime.The second major issue is that Ryo forces his feelings onto Arima.

Maison Ikkoku: Kanketsu-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2460/Maison_Ikkoku__Kanketsu-hen,"[""[Warning - Major spoilers for original TV series. You shouldn't watch this movie, nor read this review, if you haven't seen that already.]I withstood 94 episodes of misunderstandings waiting for Godai and Kyoko to establish mutual trust in one another and finally become lovers. Those wishes were met fully in the end, and to this day I consider the TV series to be the most rewarding in all of the romance genre.So I didn't appreciate this film throwing all of that patience into the trash by creating another silly misunderstanding about Kyoko sending letters to an unidentified person and Godai suspecting her of cheating....The tenets, as per usual, do everything in their power to goad Godai into believing he's not good enough to date Kyoko and perpetuate the misunderstanding. The love scorned Yagami, one of the most annoying characters in the series, contributes in the witch hunt too. Some of this could be forgiven if this unnecessary drama didn't take up 90% of the movie, leaving hardly any time to focus on the soon to be married Godai and Kyoko (who doesn't even appear until the halfway mark)As if emphasizing some the worst parts of the TV series weren't bad enough, the aesthetic is noticeably different. The eye designs are less shapely than before and the animation is choppy, missing the fluidity and consistency that was present in the TV series that holds up surprisingly well to today's standards. I don't think I've seen an anime movie with worse production values than the TV series until now.The saving grace of this film is that it's not intended to be an afterword of the series, but instead a side story that takes place in between the final episode. That I don't have to view this as the final canon story of the series is excellent, as I'll forever see episode 96 as the true conclusion. Even so, what I'd hoped would be at least a fun reminder of what made Maison Ikkoku an iconic romantic dramedy was instead a painful reminder of everything that irked me while watching the series. Completely skippable by any fan. The tenets, as per usual, do everything in their power to goad Godai into believing he's not good enough to date Kyoko and perpetuate the misunderstanding.

It keeps in the spirit of the anime with awkward and very natural situations without becoming absurdly impossible to believe.This is set during the time frame of episode 96 but as anyone whos watched the series there is a showing of the future of all the characters in that episode. This is not what the movies about, in the movie godai and kyoko are still not married.The animation is slightly different but still great quality for the series. Sounds and music are equal...are just a bit sharper and higher in quality than the tv series. The show has not lost anything on the production end of quality.It was a enjoyable watch like a much longer finale episode that did not end in a flash forward. It was more like one last laugh before its all over a final act for us to enjoy as it all comes to a end.

You can already see my score, I disliked this movie greatly, I felt it spat in not only my face, but the masterpiece that is the original series. Before I really get into it, I just want to prestate that Maison Ikkoku is my 2nd favorite anime, at times being my favorite anime. I love everything about it from its characters, its realized setting, its heart-touching love story, the comedy, the drama, I love Maison Ikkoku. The series was such a masterpiece...I even wrote a review on it, but that’s besides the point. I’m about to rip this movie to shreds, possibly spoil it rotten, & rage like a bitch boy, you have been warned.Lets start off simple, fuck this artstyle. The original TV series was gorgeous. It’s beautiful backgrounds, amazing character designs, superb shot composition, the TV show was a visual treat & stayed consistently well made from start to finish. For whatever reason, the people who worked on this movie decided to go with a completely unnecessary art-style change. Yuuji Moriyama is the person I have to blame for taking what once were these absolutely beautiful character designs adapted by both himself (eps 1-26) & then later on Takada Akemi (eps 27-96) and absolutely fuck them up. Moriyama tried taking a more realistic approach to designing the characters in this movie, but what Moriyama failed to realize was that the characters already looked about as real as you could believably make anime characters look in the original series, so I don’t understand why he made the characters so ugly in this movie. Remember earlier that I was praising the excellent backgrounds of the TV series? Yeah, those took a hit too. What once where beautiful, lush, involved backgrounds have now become lifeless, dull, devoid of soul, & largely flat. There’s a couple of good looking backgrounds in this movie every once in awhile, but they’re outweighed by the amount of bland backgrounds that are devoid of effort. I will give this movie some slight credit, the animation quality is actually good. I still like the way the TV show animates better, & quite honestly, the best animated moments of the TV series far surpass the best animated moments of this movie by a long-shot.Now we have the story, oh my fucking god the story. A point of criticism that often comes up from Maison Ikkoku detractors is that the misunderstandings of the show are far too frequent, sometimes farfetched, & can easily be solved by Godai taking action. While I can understand these complaints, they aren’t ones I agree with for the most part. Until I watched this movie, & I then saw the complaints about the misunderstandings first hand. First of all, why? Why does Godai have such a lacking trust in Kyoko in this movie? We were treated to scenes in the series that clearly established these two shared a mutual trust betwixt one-another, & Kyoko never did anything particularly sleezy in the series in the first place, & Mitaka had already become married, why does Godai have any reason to believe Kyoko would be cheating on him? Did this idiot fuck-girl writer called Michiru Shimada go & misunderstand Godai’s character entirely? She shouldn’t have, she wrote 8 episodes of the series, some of them being my personal favorite episodes of the series. Let me be clear on one thing, Godai isn’t the brightest person out there, & he’s indecisive, gullible, & weak willed, but he isn’t completely fucking stupid. Now we have Yagamai & oh my god why? Ibuki Yagami was one of my least favorite characters in the series, but I didn’t completely hate her, because Yagami was still a realized character & contributed to the overall narrative at play. Nearing the end of the series, Yagami gives up on Godai coming to the realization that Godai likes Kyoko instead of her, while this admittedly concludes anti-climatically in the series & sort-of plays out in a way to where it feels anti-climatic, it was nevertheless a good conclusion to Yagami’s arc. SO WHY DID THEY BRING HER BACK? On top of that, why did they allow Yagami to be at her absolute worst that she’s ever been at this point in the series. Once Yagami’s arc concludes in the series she only appears infrequently, & never around anybody from Maison Ikkoku. Yagami had absolutely no reason to be in this movie. Her arc was concluded, she moved on with her life in the series, & that was that. It was a nice bittersweet ending to a character arc in the series, yet in Kanketsu-Hen her she is for absolutely no reason other than to stir up some drama because of course. There’s also a subplot going on this movie about the master from Chachamaru trying to propose to Akemi, while this is a somewhat sweet plot, it’s really not explored & is only used for a few scenes that add nothing but padding to an already short movie (coming in at a runtime of 1 hour 6 minutes), what a waste, & I’m sorry you had to be in this terrible movie master. Another disappointing aspect of this movie is that one of the most important characters to Godai’s development Lioka decides to show up, great, I’d love to see Lioka & Godai have a sort-of mini-reunion & see how far Godai has come ever since he stopped working at the cabaret because sakamoto fucked him over & the tenants of Maison Ikkoku are assholes who keep piling up his tab. But oh wait, he gets trapped in a room with Kyoko’s dad for the whole movie, just for 2, 3, maybe 4 gags that, contain some pretty slick transitions, but are otherwise unfunny gags repeating the joke that Mr. Chigusa doesn’t want his daughter to remarry, especially to someone like Godai, a man he finds unworthy of Kyoko’s heart, what a fuck-up. Now we have an absolutely pointless character that you would only need to make one minor plot-change, & he could be entirely useless & not contribute a damn thing to this movie. Nikaidou only contributes showing the letter to Kyoko that started this whole dumbass misunderstanding in the first place on accident. That’s all, he’s barely used for gags, & he has nothing worth contributing to the story. This guy was actually not in the original TV series, but was present in the manga. I’m guessing he was cut from the TV series because he contributed nothing of value to the narrative of the original source material too. This movie was anime original, why would you include a character from the manga that wasn’t even in the fucking anime in the first place? But I digress. All in all, the story of Kanketsu-Hen is all the worst aspects of Maison Ikkoku, that weren’t even that bad in the original series to begin with, amplified by 20K & then had the shit-switch cranked up on top of that, god I hated this movie.You wanna talk sound? Because I’ll do that too. The voice acting isn’t bad, but it’s nothing impressive or special like the original series was. All the voice actors reprise their roles as their respective characters (Sumi Shimamoto as Kyoko), (Issei Futamata as Godai), (Shigeru Chiba as Yotsuya), so on. But the voice actors here all sound like they’re phoning it in and only doing this for a paycheck, I guess because the realized how terrible this movie was while they were recording their dialogue for it. The music is pathetic, not terrible, but an absolutely pathetic effort coming off of Kenji Kawai’s god-like OST from the original series. The movie didn’t even have the decency to open with either a unique OP, or a reused OP from the TV series, what the fuck gives guys? Maison Ikkoku had some of the best OPs out there, why didn’t you flex those in this movie? The sound design is actually a salvageable part out of this mess though, there’s some great SFX used for some actually funny & well timed moments in the movie, footsteps sound good, beer cans sound good, I’ll give the sound design some honest to god credit here, it was by-far the part that had the most effort put into it.So in spite of all the shit-talking I’ve given to this movie, why did I not rate it a 1/10 like I should’ve? Because there were some honest to god really good character moments in this movie. Like the scene between Yagami & Kyoko in the attic of Maison ikkoku, Yagami asks Kyoko, “So the princess has two lovers, one of which being deceased, & the other being a young man, which one does she choose?” Kyoko thinks for a minute & answers back with “I never thought about comparing Godai to my late husband”. The banter between these two, & the structure both surrounding this scene before & after, & during the dialogue, it’s brilliant, & actually reminded me that I was watching something related to one of my all time favorite things for a little bit. Another scene I loved was close to the end of this movie, when Kyoko actually reads the letter to Godai. She tells a story about how Ikari Godai sent her a photo of Yusaku Godai in his childhood, she accidentally ripped the picture & wanted to apologize to Ikari for it. After Ikari writes back & the contents of the letter were revealed, Godai & Kyoko have some beautiful dialogue between them, again, the way this scene & the dialogue are structured is what makes it so good, & once again reminds me that I’m actually watching something that can be related to Maison Ikkoku twice throughout this god-damn movie. Another point of praise is that some moments of storyboarding in this movie are actually pretty slick & seamless, it’s one of the few good directing moments in this movie, as the directing from the TV series that was so insanely awesome in the first place has been stripped & gutted. I’ll also give credit that in the beginning of this movie I received a few laughs. I didn’t have many laughs throughout this movie, but hey, credit where it’s due I guess, I’m already being too easy on this movie as I am.Maison Ikkoku Kanketsu-Hen is absolutely pathetic. Why did this need to exist? What point did this serve to the overall narrative? What value did this add to the series? How much did the people who work on this get paid? Really, there was no reason for this series to exist. The story would be a plot point that absolutely nobody would’ve cared about seeing as this wasn't in the the TV series or even the manga to begin with. The story sucks, the art sucks, the directing sucks, the music sucks, my favorite characters are a shell of their former selves in this movie & devoid of their personality & comedic moments (except for Yotsuya). This movie is a disgrace to the masterpiece that is Maison Ikkoku. If you have any shred of self-respect & love this series, please. Don’t watch this terrible movie. It will bring nothing but disappointment & anger. Final rating for this one is gonna be a 2/10. This was a shameless cash-grab that was made only to capitalize on Maison’s popularity at the time & is an absolute disgrace to this series and any & everyone who is a fan of this series. I even wrote a review on it, but that’s besides the point. I’m about to rip this movie to shreds, possibly spoil it rotten, & rage like a bitch boy, you have been warned.Lets start off simple, fuck this artstyle. The original TV series was gorgeous.

It takes place before Godai and Kyouko get married, which means they have two options: they can fill in some of the year that got skipped before the wedding or they can do something immediately before the wedding. They do the latter; this is about one of the final (well, ""final"") parties at Maison Ikkoku before they tie the knot, and so it\'s a bottle episode with a ton of food porn.

Why did they change Godai\'s face, but the others look close to the TV series.  There were also several scenes where characters were just drawn badly.  Like the scene where Godai and Kyoko talk by the front door - their necks are absurdly long.  And who ever did the shading should be ashamed of themselves. At times, the art reminded me of whoever did Macross DYRL (another movie where I loved the story and characters, but really hated the artwork).I think the thing I disliked the most was the lack of new material.  I kept asking...myself, why did they bother to make this movie?  Seems like a cash grab to me.  Instead, we just revisit what we already know, and this ""mystery letter"" only takes like 5 minutes.  What a wasted opportunity to explore other aspects of their wedding, honeymoon, or early married life. myself, why did they bother to make this movie?  Seems like a cash grab to me.

Kuroshitsuji II,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6707/Kuroshitsuji_II,"['Sequels can be a dangerous territory to tread on. Especially ones for shows that already do not follow the manga but instead, creates its own story. On one hand it has the job of following and wrapping up the previous season’s (to an extent, “original”) storyline and on the other hand, pleasing the fans. To many, Black Butler II has done neither and to others it has done more than that: in other words, there is a clear division between fans.Let’s get the technicalities out of the way. The art and animation is as beautiful and Victorian-Gothic as the first season, though the animation...did slip at times. New pieces of music by Taku Iwasaki (Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Soul Eater) are introduced along with new characters, thus being their character theme songs. And he sure does not disappoint. Again, in keeping with the theme of high class Victorian England classical music (or pieces that are inspired by those roots) are used, violin being the most distinct sound out of the instruments. Animation for the OP is taken up a notch and again we have two sets of animation for the OP song “SHIVER”; both of which were fitting to the song and showed two different styles of art; the first animation being the more unique and visually stimulating one.Now that sound and art is covered, time to sink our teeth into the real meat of it.So how does one solve the problem of concluding the story from season one, especially with the amount of mess it had been put into? Why, just create a couple of new characters, slap ‘em in and you can create all sorts of plot lines and justifications.Enter (or rather waltzes and tap dances in) our scapegoats; Alois Trancy, a bipolar; sadistic; misogynistic and rather scantily clad fourteen year old boy and his poker-faced butler, Claude Faustus. Along with the beautiful dark skinned maid, Hannah Annafellows and the silent triplet servants you have yourself the Trancy Household.Already the anime is set up for a Trancy VS Phantomhive storyline, and it indeed takes that turn, for the better part of the show anyway. Simultaneously it tells us of the involvement of the new master and butler to Ciel’s own past. Easy isn’t it, to just make up characters for the convenience of the story? True, it isn’t the most respectable way to go about wrapping up a storyline but A-1 Pictures does it in a way that doesn’t seem like an obvious convenient plot device but actually attempts to build a relationship between the new characters and the viewers, which I can’t really say the same thing about the first set of master and butler.First things first: No, this season does include ANY material from the manga in any shape or form, but considering how much the first season had flown off on a tangent it does not really matter, as if content from the manga (such as the anticipated circus arc) were to be included it would just be filler and would not relate to the happenings of the season. This does not mean that this season is ‘pure filler’ though as some fans have stated; instead it can be seen as an ‘alternative storyline’.The plot itself is not the best, but neither is it the worst they could have done. The introduction to the new characters was a decent move A-1 Pictures made, even though – as I said before – it was not an entirely respectable twist. Because of the short season (only 12 episodes long) there were fewer opportunities for plot holes, and the frequency ratio of random twists had depleted considerably compared to the first season. Some fans argue that there were more inconsistencies and plot holes than the first season, but quite frankly, I have to disagree. This season is as, or a lot less plot hole filled than the first season. It required people to work things out and guess. Nevertheless, there were some semi-serious plot issues but I appreciated how the story was a lot more consistent and actually seemed planned out.The brilliance of this short season has to derive from the nature of the show however. There’s a reason why the rating has been raised since the previous season from a PG-13 to an R 17. It’s vulgar. Quite disturbing. And very crude. One of the many things I disliked about the first season of Kuroshitsuji was how there would be an awkward transition from serious business to idiotic comic relief, which would just kill the dark atmosphere of the show that was built up. Heavy topics such as prostituting and abuse are brought in, and the entire series was kept mostly enigmatic and dark.But to be honest, the story wasn’t what really shone during the course of the show. It was the characters. Not just the new cast, but also the old familiar faces.For the first time, Sebastian the “perfect” being has met his match, an equal: Claude Faustus. Claude contrasts greatly with Sebastian. Rather than being mischievous and teasing he is straight-faced and serious and very, very undeservingly hated – and mostly for being true to the nature of a demon: sly, cunning and untrustworthy. Demons aren’t known for being the most docile of all mythical creatures, and this is prominent in Kuroshitsuji II. The new butler drove the plot of the season, and I have to commend A-1 Pictures/Square Enix for not merely pampering the fans with what most would have had anticipated: a Claude arse-whooping by Sebastian. Sebastian is repeatedly put in a befuddled state, which did not just add that much more realism to him, but also made the viewers connect with the character a bit.Alois is definitely one interesting kid across any anime. From being happy-go-lucky, to a practicing sadist and cross-dressing (Can anyone say Maria Holic?) Alois displays an array of characteristics which combined, would indicate to your classic psychopath. And as with almost all mentally unstable characters, he did not have the most pleasurable childhood in the world. Thankfully, there was no sob story as there was a disgusting and disturbing past. Truth be told, I found Alois’ nature and antics to be quite entertaining, refreshing and again, a big contrast to Ciel’s personality.Unfortunately, his character had been marred by the suggestive clothing he dons. You can’t take a psycho 100% seriously if he is wearing hot-pants and leather high heel boots, which sadly is the case with Alois Trancy. I wish I could say that the fan service was just limited to this, but it isn’t.Fan service is blown WAY out of proportion. Every episode is gorging with it. Think of the first season. Now times the fanservice in that by 10 and you have a rough idea of what Kuroshitsuji II is like. Depending on the viewer, this can either be a plus or a minus. And weirdly enough, although there is triple the gay in this season, there is also fanservice aimed at men.Re-introducing the maid of the Trancy Household; Hannah Annafellows, the object creating fanservice for the guys. Victim to Alois’ fits of abuse and her clothes ripping as easy as tissue (and always in the area where her cleavage is...I still wonder how her back doesn’t snap holding up a rack that huge), Hannah is, for the first time in the entire Kuroshitsuji franchise, a female character who is a PART of the show; though this does not seem apparent at first.The biggest problem this show has (which, ironically, is the exact opposite of the first season’s problem) is the length of the show – it was too short. Too short to make it as grand an ending it could have been. Kuroshitsuji II had the potential to be great, but then ended up anti-climatic, which was a shame really considering how great the first two-thirds of the anime had been. I just wish Alois could have been expanded on, as such a interesting and unique character as him is ever so rare. Even so, this season presented thrill, suspense and comedy that wasn’t as strong or well carried through in the prequel.And what a great comedy it is at times. Not the obvious and staged comedy the show usually (awkwardly) presents with its idiotic antics or side characters (the Phantomhive servants) but with its UNINTENTIONAL comedy. Some of the fanservice, or scenes were just plain ridiculous; you’d double over from laughing at it.Sequels are dangerous, but nowhere near as dangerous as a demon lusting for your soul. Kuroshitsuji II should be taken with a grain of salt – it most definitely isn’t the best it could have been, but honestly, it could have been a lot worse. If not for the open ended conclusion, which is most likely to lead onto a third season to milk the proverbial “cash cow” I would have rated this higher, but as it stands, it is decent enough.But you can never please all the fans, and this has never been truer when it came to Kuroshitsuji II. did slip at times.

This is merely an opinion, but I found myself hating the storyline behind season 2 entirely.Below are the good, bad and ugly of this series:The goodThe series has amazing artowrk and beautiful sound.The animation was crisp and clear and the music was amazing, especially with songs coming from Yuya Matsushima and Nightmare.The bad, and the ugly.As several reviewers stated before, it does not follow the manga, but I don't consider that bad...because a lot of anime follow this trend.  The storyline had actually stopped following the original manga plot during the Drocell arc in season one.Also, this series started off with a filler episode as the second episode.  That is a big no-no for any anime.  You start off the series by building up the plot, not doing a filler episode that, regardless of whether you watched it or not would still understand the story.Out of character moments.  There are several large out of character moments and things that were brought up and dropped.  In one of the episodes, Viscount Druitt (who has a medical degree and offered to sell off the protagonist, Ciel Phantomhive in pieces on a black market auction) fainted at the sight of blood.  It was rather vague on if he was extremely happy in seeing it, since he had sadistic reactions to the previous battle, or if it was because he was woozy but I found it very out of character.  There are several other moments in Ciel, Sebastian and a few other characters that I found out of character.Unexplained changes to characters.  Several relationships and things about the characters were not explained or elaborated on, which made a very obscure plot and caused general confusion among fans who had been following the series faithfully.Fan service.  To be honest, in my opinion, and don't kill me on this, but this series was written like bad fanfiction and left many answered questions.  There was also a huge amount of fanservice and hardly any of it was presented in a way that I thought was well thought out or tasteful in the slightest.  The setting and time period for this show went from elegant to trashy and it caused the series to lose it's appeal.There were also too many of what I call 'scenes of convenience'. Several characters had the opportunity to be interesting and have a good amount of spotlight but were disposed of in poorly executed ways. Viscount fainting was a poor excuse to get rid of his character during an important scene where he could have taken active role in the plot. He was actually promised a very good storyline with watching over Alois but it was disregarded shortly after wards, which was a let down to me, as a personal fan of the characters.  Also, as good as the first episode was, shoving Ciel and Sebastian in it all too quickly, as if the say 'Look! They're still in this season!' Because the writers were afraid of fans not being interested was a poor decision in execution as well.The show had overall poor execution and a lot of things were unexplained or left off.  The episodes got more and more ridiculous after a moment in time and I couldn't find myself watching it after a while.  It became a chore and not an enjoyment.  As a Kuroshitsuji fan, I'm sorely disappointed in this season. As an anime fan whose critiqued anime for 4 years, this is the worst I've seen in a long time.It's nothing but a case of bad fanfiction turned into an animated series.  I expected a lot more from Kuroshitsuji.  It only got worse as the series ended. If they make a season 3, I might not even give it the time of day.  There are better anime out there, I implore anyone who reads this to stick to season one, or they might end up just getting angry. because a lot of anime follow this trend.

What is it, and what is it not?  (Please, loyal fans, be kind to me, for voicing my opinion.)  And please, all you Black Butler fans under age 18, ask your parents before watching this series.  I\'ll say up front that the content is at an overtly ADULT-ONLY level.Moving on....What this series is not: It\'s not at all related to the manga.  It\'s a continuation from the end of season 1, which had begun to diverge from the manga around halfway through.  Even though the first season apparently painted itself into...a corner, we continue on from that ending.  (And eventually get some questions answered regarding that.)And I hope this isn\'t a spoiler, but Ciel\'s back.  And so is everyone\'s favorite butler, Sebastian.So what IS this series?  It\'s fanfiction.  Pure and simple.  By fans, for fans.  And that means heavy doses of fanservice.  You can imagine that its creators took everything they had fantasized about in regards to the first series, and decided, ""Let\'s put it into an anime!""  And this fanservice isn\'t for youngsters.  Funimation was right about choosing to rate the series MA (equivalent to an ""R"" rating).  The opening scene is a mere sampling.  It shows a naked young boy crawling out of a bed from next to a naked older man.Fanservice is pervasive, with hints of shotacon, and enough boyxboy and butlerxbutler to make yaoi fangirls melt into squeals.Synopsis:**********The first episode introduces a new young master, Alois Trancy (a blonde boy of Ciel\'s age), and his butler, Claude.  The next three episodes are similar to the original series: Ciel goes about with Sebastian, running errands for the queen.  We reunite with a lot of beloved characters from the first season (the Phantomhive servants, Elizabeth, Prince Soma, Lau, Grell).But then Alois and Ciel cross paths.  And that\'s when things start getting sticky.  Secret arrangements between butlers.  Soul transfers.  New contracts.  A new rule was added to the Black Butler world when the creators came up with the idea of keeping souls in rings.  All these ideas and more are pushed to the max, to practically the very final moments of the series.For some reason, Alois and Claude are after Ciel and Sebastian.  It\'s not until halfway through the series that we find out what for.  We also discover why Ciel is still around, despite how the first series ended.  Sebastian also has his own personal bone to pick with Claude. Get ready for a butler showdown....After we get to the middle of the series, we encounter an incredible number of new twists and turns, making things muddier and muddier.  They can come off as brilliant plot twists, or tiresome complications, depending on how you liked the series up to that point.  Personally, I didn\'t have a very good opinion of the series by the 5th or 6th episode, so as each of the final episodes unfolded, I kept asking myself, ""Can things get more screwed up than they already are?""  And yes, they do.To its credit, the ending is not ambiguous like the first series\' was.  Although things are still unclear until the final 60 seconds or so.  I\'m not sure that they could make more series based on an ending like that (or that I would want to see them!).  But it\'s pretty satisfying, and in keeping with the spirit of both series.  You do wonder how it\'s possible within the Black Butler world, since it\'s sprung on us quite suddenly, and we\'ve not seen anything like it before.  Still, it\'s nice and gothic, and a little creepy; makes you feel good, while giving you a bit of a chill.***********I had always thought of Ciel as being a tad cruel, and rough on his servants.  But now he seems a veritable angel compared to Alois. Alois dregs the depths of cruelty, sadism, cunning, and is an utter brat.  And creepy.  ""Ciel,"" he says, ""I want to become One with you.""  Yep, that\'s one messed-up kid.  Later, we see some of Alois\' backstory, and some tragic and difficult things that happened to him.  But it still doesn\'t excuse (or, I think, fully explain) his cruelty and borderline insanity.  Fans of creepy characters might like him.  But he\'s rather pathetic.  I only felt a twinge of pity when I found out what it was he really wanted from Claude.There\'s also one busty maid who\'s always being required to strip or wear revealing clothing; or sometimes she even rips off her own clothes.  If this were a shounen anime, it would be almost ecchi.  There\'s also a character who acts as a sheathe for a demon sword, and gets the sword pulled out of their body in a rather grotesque fashion.Conclusion:Season 2 retains the lovely animation and sense of style from the first one.  And hot butlers.  And, as a bonus, an ending that doesn\'t leave you hanging like before.  However, if you want an intelligent, well-crafted story along the lines of the manga, or even the first season, it\'s really not here.  It\'s a fanfiction series that tries to see how messy you can make the world of soul/demon contracts.   Sure, you need to know the world of season 1 in order to watch this.  But its purpose is no more than to be a pleaser for mature fans and yaoi addicts.Thus, my comparatively low rating. a corner, we continue on from that ending.

It shows a naked young boy crawling out of a bed from next to a naked older man.Fanservice is pervasive, with hints of shotacon, and enough boyxboy and butlerxbutler to make yaoi fangirls melt into squeals.Synopsis:**********The first episode introduces a new young master, Alois Trancy (a blonde boy of Ciel\'s age), and his butler, Claude.  The next three episodes are similar to the original series: Ciel goes about with Sebastian, running errands for the queen.  We reunite with a lot of beloved characters from the first season (the Phantomhive servants, Elizabeth, Prince Soma, Lau, Grell).But then Alois and Ciel cross paths.  And that\'s when things start getting sticky.  Secret arrangements between butlers.  Soul transfers.  New contracts.  A new rule was added to the Black Butler world when the creators came up with the idea of keeping souls in rings.  All these ideas and more are pushed to the max, to practically the very final moments of the series.For some reason, Alois and Claude are after Ciel and Sebastian.  It\'s not until halfway through the series that we find out what for.  We also discover why Ciel is still around, despite how the first series ended.  Sebastian also has his own personal bone to pick with Claude. Get ready for a butler showdown....After we get to the middle of the series, we encounter an incredible number of new twists and turns, making things muddier and muddier.  They can come off as brilliant plot twists, or tiresome complications, depending on how you liked the series up to that point.  Personally, I didn\'t have a very good opinion of the series by the 5th or 6th episode, so as each of the final episodes unfolded, I kept asking myself, ""Can things get more screwed up than they already are?""  And yes, they do.To its credit, the ending is not ambiguous like the first series\' was.  Although things are still unclear until the final 60 seconds or so.  I\'m not sure that they could make more series based on an ending like that (or that I would want to see them!).  But it\'s pretty satisfying, and in keeping with the spirit of both series.  You do wonder how it\'s possible within the Black Butler world, since it\'s sprung on us quite suddenly, and we\'ve not seen anything like it before.  Still, it\'s nice and gothic, and a little creepy; makes you feel good, while giving you a bit of a chill.***********I had always thought of Ciel as being a tad cruel, and rough on his servants.  But now he seems a veritable angel compared to Alois. Alois dregs the depths of cruelty, sadism, cunning, and is an utter brat.  And creepy.  ""Ciel,"" he says, ""I want to become One with you.""  Yep, that\'s one messed-up kid.  Later, we see some of Alois\' backstory, and some tragic and difficult things that happened to him.  But it still doesn\'t excuse (or, I think, fully explain) his cruelty and borderline insanity.  Fans of creepy characters might like him.  But he\'s rather pathetic.  I only felt a twinge of pity when I found out what it was he really wanted from Claude.There\'s also one busty maid who\'s always being required to strip or wear revealing clothing; or sometimes she even rips off her own clothes.  If this were a shounen anime, it would be almost ecchi.  There\'s also a character who acts as a sheathe for a demon sword, and gets the sword pulled out of their body in a rather grotesque fashion.Conclusion:Season 2 retains the lovely animation and sense of style from the first one.  And hot butlers.  And, as a bonus, an ending that doesn\'t leave you hanging like before.  However, if you want an intelligent, well-crafted story along the lines of the manga, or even the first season, it\'s really not here.  It\'s a fanfiction series that tries to see how messy you can make the world of soul/demon contracts.   Sure, you need to know the world of season 1 in order to watch this.  But its purpose is no more than to be a pleaser for mature fans and yaoi addicts.Thus, my comparatively low rating.', 'Kuroshitsuji II (Black Butler II) is not a true sequel to the original, or at least I refuse to hail it as such, but it is still an interesting addition to the series and appears to experiment with several archetypes, something I as a writer and literature major can appreciate.I\'ve heard it called an abortion, a sort of a tragic death to the tragic series about death and mortality, and taken in the aspect of a literal sequel - a direct followup to the Black Butler that received high acclaim - this would indeed be the case. However, what Black Butler II does is not...poor storytelling in any sense, as far as I can tell (at least until the last few minutes of the final episode, but we\'ll get to that) - it is simply such a strong deviation from the anime offered by the original that many I\'ve encountered have trouble accepting its premise. Both offer an interesting, Faustian take on the story of the classical romance, (where the bond between demon and contracted is not platonic, but romantic) but Black Butler II greatly underplays the elements that made Black Butler what it was.This series introduces Alois Trancy and the butler Claude Faustus, along with several other characters who seem to mirror Ciel Phantomhive, Sebastian Michaelis, and the cast who tends to the former\'s mansion. While Ciel is outwardly dark but ultimately benevolent, Alois is (in several cases) outwardly benevolent but ultimately sadistic. The image we get from the beginning of the anime is one where Ciel and Alois are polar opposites, with Alois playing the Moriarty to Ciel\'s Holmes, but that dichotomy is played with in such a way that I would have to consider it unique or innovative at least.Black Butler II has several faults. For one, it does not serve as a tangible vehicle for an intuitive storyline, but uses its allotted run time to dabble in the deconstruction of dichotomies and social mores (at times not as subtly as it should). The relationship between butler and master is questioned, as naturally so is the relationship between demon and contracted. Fictional conceptions of ""the villain,"" who serves as opposite and parallel to the central protagonist, are also challenged. I can\'t get into how without spoiling the ride for you, but if you take a step back, it\'s definitely there. How it goes about this ""deconstruction"" is questionable.For one, it\'s almost not Black Butler anymore. Sebastian is presented on a level plane thanks to Claude Faustus and the presence of several other ""demonic"" characters, meaning he doesn\'t allow the series to shine quite as much. I\'ve heard it said that Black Butler IS Sebastian Michaelis, and people who agree with that notion are likely to face disappointment at the sight of this new, humbled Sebastian.Additionally, it\'s much darker with much less comedy than the original. We see less of the servants, of Elizabeth, and of the main cast, who have been relegated further into the background. At its core, it\'s simply not the same anime anymore.I liked it. I liked that I was able to see where it played with the romance genre and with fiction in general. Ultimately though, its willingness to experiment and dabble in concepts does not save its occasional poor delivery or the eerie ending which doesn\'t fit with the buildup of the series. The conclusion is quite a deus ex machina, to say the least.Another thing I will say is that Black Butler didn\'t need a sequel. If ever it did need one, Black Butler II is certainly not its rightful successor. poor storytelling in any sense, as far as I can tell (at least until the last few minutes of the final episode, but we\'ll get to that) - it is simply such a strong deviation from the anime offered by the original that many I\'ve encountered have trouble accepting its premise.

But from what or whom?The story continues with a new contract formed between a young boy of fourteen: Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus who carries a similar presence as well as punch line ""I want to greedily devour you to the end, my master"" as Sebastian and through a small critique made by Sebastian in the first episode it seems that Claude tries to follow in Sebastian\'s foot steps but...not quite One hell of a butler; just yet...Alois and Claude compliment each other well as Alois is very needy at times and clings to Claude then goes through ridiculous turns of moods which Claude just seems to ignore. (I think Sebastian would not have the patience for this child.) Alois who is also referred to as ""the spider"" (As this is the form in which Claude introduced himself to Alois) is a marvelously radiant child with a charming smile and captivating energy... sometimes. The truth is the kid is like Mr. Jeckle and Hyde. He goes from smiling cheerfully to scornfully screaming or punishing a servant for no rhyme or reason and further more he seems to enjoy this type of behavior wildly. The young boy has basically gone mad. Where as Ciel was ""evil"" because he wanted revenge for the wrongs done to him; before that he was pure. He was stable, had good relationships in his life. He lost everything before he stunk from the mud of the gutter. But Alois was born from gutter mud so to speak. It\'s all he ever knew. His evilness is much more frightening. But this I\'m sure is precisely why the ""Queen"" uses him. He\'s an interesting character who I thought I\'d hate but he\'ll be fun to through into the mix.So with the queen\'s new spider doing her dirty work then what of her loyal dog? Well SPOILER: he comes back. In the first episode Sebastian feigns the guise of a traveler and enters the Trancy mansion to retrieve Ciels ring. Why it\'s in the Trancy mansion, I don\'t know. Why he needs it revive Ciel? Who knows?I didn\'t suspect a character like Alois could actually carry this series as the lead. He\'s too unbalanced and immature to carry out a vendetta successfully no matter who they made as his side kick. At first I didn\'t like the idea of Ciel coming back either after he was so obviously dead. But I assume this new character Alois and Claude will be fighting against Ciel at some point? It implies by the third episode that Claude is the protagonist causing the fires ""a man with yellow eyes"".The series has barely started and there are still so many interesting possibilities. What did he come back as? In the first episode it says that Ciel\'s debt is now paid. How so? Why doesn\'t he remember the Queen was killed or that Madame Red died? Why are his memories altered, I\'m sure it\'s Sebastian\'s doing. I can\'t say yet but with the enjoyably written new characters to add to this twisted soul sucking thriller I certainly am looking forward to enjoying what I\'m sure will be an amazing Kuroshitsugi 2.

At least here\'s hoping.', 'Kuroshitsuji II embarks with the debut of Alois Trancy, the sadistic, erratic, and creepy-as-hell lord of the Trancy estate. Alois’ backstory is disturbing, though in an incredibly enjoyable way. His character is endearing; a classic anime psycho that you can’t help but be immediately drawn to. His character design is one of the best I’ve seen in a while. He was such a complex character that had so much development potential. He really could have held the series up on his own.Until he dissipates into a sniveling excuse of a train wreck along with the rest of the cast. Let’s hope all those fanfics...you read late at night conditioned you to characters acting OOC.Contrary to all the warnings I was given before viewing Kuroshitsuji II, I began with high hopes. It’s Kuroshitsuji, after all. How can it fail? Surely Alois Trancy’s creepy-as-hell demeanor would get the ball rolling. His juxtaposition to his stoic demon butler, Claude, was promising. But despite all the possibilities Kuroshitsuji II could have embellished upon, it fell flat. The character relationships so intrinsically built up in the first season came crashing way, way, down. It seemed as if Sebastian and Ciel were tossed into the plot just to please the fangirls. Character development for the debuting servants of the Trancy household is stagnant to nonexistent. The season begins with shameless fillers—starting in the second episode, no less—and later thrusts itself into a plot woven flimsier than one of Claude’s spider webs. The romantic 1800s London time-setting of the first season seems to disappear from plot significance. Like the rest of the season, you really don’t know what’s going on anymore.By the time the plot weaves into a labyrinth game show you could’ve sworn you were watching Kuroshitsuji and not the Kids’ WB.And don’t even get me started on the amnesia ass-pull.But don’t let me senselessly bash. The art is still great, but not as flawless as the first season’s. Both versions of the OP, set to the song “SHIVER”, were stunning, with dazzling animation. (Especially Alois’ version—oh my god, can you say impressive?) Needless to say, Kuroshitsuji has THE best anime OST I’ve ever come across. Alois Trancy\'s theme, ""The Slightly Chipped Full Moon"", is as beautifully disturbing as he is. But don’t expect to hear the flawless soundtrack of the first season all throughout this sequel. You’ll have to make due with cartoon sound effects tossed behind every “comedic” fast-dash movement.Comedic. Right.Hahaha. Aha.Successful comedy in this season is rare, but its rarities are frequently supplied by Viscount Druitt. His idealistic ravings are hilarious, albeit ill-timed considering they most often arose during what could’ve been considered a more serious fight scene in the anime.The relationship that Ciel and Sebastian built up season one came tumbling down faster than my expectations for this sequel. (On another note, Daisuke Ono’s voice is like God whispering sweet nothings into your ear. Have you heard Sebastian’s character song, “Aru Shitsuji no Nichijou”? Woah baby. On second, thought, go hear Ronald Knox\'s character songs. And the entire Kuroshitsuji OST.)Hinted shotacon is evident, but nothing you can’t endure. Characters you thought were gone are back, characters you thought would show up are nowhere in sight, and the characters present—namely Sebastian, Ciel, Alois, and Claude—surprisingly leave the show unsatisfying.And if you thought Lady Elizabeth couldn’t get any more annoying, think again.I know that it’s biased to compare a second season solely to its former, but the only reason I managed to stick it out until the end was…well, it’s Kuroshitsuji for God’s sake. Especially considering that this season didn’t follow the conclusive events of the first season’s at all. It really felt as if this season was expecting to generate success solely by the loyal fanbase built up from the first. I’m a major fan of the first season, but my loyalty can only take me so far. I really didn’t know it was possible to slaughter a series like this. I really didn’t. Creating a sequel is always a risky process. This risk should’ve been left alone. The season quickly became tedious to watch. Season 1 also had a brilliant ending. This season’s ending left a lot less room for interpretation, but it really doesn’t matter how tight an ending is if it stinks. The characters provided this season with so much potential, but just couldn\'t hold up. But that being said, Alois Trancy is enchanting, and Ronald Knox (though his screen-time is pathetically minuscule) is an epic cutie pie.I never thought I’d be giving anything of Kuroshitsuji a 5. But a 5 is really all this second season deserves.In short, Kuroshitsuji II managed to take everything the first season stood for and drive it into the pits of hell. But don’t worry, at least Sebastian will be waiting. Along with the season’s production staff.Burn, baby.

It is completely original and does not follow the manga. Kuroshitsuji II was born as fanservice and it died as fanservice too. But you know what? A-1 is pro enough to make this fanserivce work with the plot. I call it!! *drum roll* Logical fanservice!! :POk so I'm not talking about boobs and panty fanservice. There's plenty of boobs I assure you but I'm talking about a different kind of fanservice. Notice how Ciel and Seb are in the character section now? They're in there for a reason. So think about it, Seb and Ciel +...fanserive equals what? And you probably got it so I'm not gonna say :DThis season has been dubbed as Toboso-san's personal doujinshi just so you know.Okay so, the story was weird for me. It was dark and everything but it just didn't have that original touch to it, like it was obvious Toboso-san didn't make it. The plot was infuriating if you ask me. It was like a roller coaster I was kinda regretting to ride. Later in the season, maybe because of my biased thinking, the story was just annoying. The comic relief was in the wrong places, everyone's ooc, it was just wrong and I didn't like it.But thinking of it from an unbiased point of view, it was pretty smart. The plot was clever and contains a whole lot of symbolism. It's crack, I have to say but it's crack that just made it into an anime. It was a cool crack and even though watching it annoyed, I'm still glad I 'went on the roller coaster'.Art was beautiful. God I love it!! However, it was lacking. I don't know if the budget was running low or something but some of the faces were really blank, quite literally too. Okay, so they didn't have fully blank faces but it was really under detailed and honestly, I think they could've done better. The art is clean, beautiful, good use of colours, just lacking detail.I LOVE the sound. I love the OP and ED and the little movie that went along with it. They were so beautiful. Kalafina comes back as well with their beautiful voices to give us a really beautiful song. Even Seb's actor for the musical sings the first ED. It's really meaningful once you watch the whole season. It was like a light bulb that went off in my head.The seiyuu is just wonderful!! Ono Daisuke does a wonderful and so does Maaya Sakamoto!! Sakurai and Mizuki-san do wonderful jobs as well!! I love their voices. I jsut find it kinda funny how Ciel and Alois are voiced by girls LOL But it's cool :)Characters is the main section of Kuro II. It's pretty much what drives the story. I love the cast. All of them, even if they are characters you can't help to hate. It's one of them love to hate characters. You get them in this season. But it makes it oh so interesting!! It's because of everyone's weird personalities that Kuro II is just that much better. However, characters -obviously- give out huge spoilers so I cannot continue with this section anymore :( And I love talking about characters the best!! Just some advice, don't judge a book by its cover, ok?I loved the season, even though there were parts when I felt bored or incredibly angry but it's good. The fanservice kinda makes up for it. It's definitely something for fangirls/boys but if you're a serious follower of Kuroshitsuji, then you might not like this season at all. It's sorta a love or hate thing. However, A-1 still gets points for mixing the plot with fanservice!! I pretty much worship them now :P But yeah, if you're serious, this might not be your thing.

And I loved it!Yes, I love season 2 and dislike season 1. Firstly I never found Ciel/Sebastian to be interesting. Sebastian is way too perfect that I don't even care about him.But here comes season 2 where we are introduced to several new characters. Alois is very mean and had some pathefic moments but over all I would better watch...him and his active live instead of Ciel who mostly drinks tea, walks around, gets kidnaped and orders Sebastian around. However, in this season Ciel happened to be more ative and became more interesting.Sebastian had finally faced some seriouse trouble and is not a Marry Sue anymore.And most importatly, characters who seemed to be useless forthe most part, happned to have a big suprise for everyone.It is one of those series where good guys actually lose at some point. I don't want to spoil too much but ending was perfect for me. It was unpredictable.The only people who will be dissapointed are crazy yaoi fangirls, that is if you don't try to look deeper into it. Becaue I think that you also should be happy about the ending.And of course if you are manga obessed, then you also won't like it. him and his active live instead of Ciel who mostly drinks tea, walks around, gets kidnaped and orders Sebastian around.

The series begins with a a new butler/child combo, Alois and Claude. From the summery of the series, one would assume that this isn't so much a second season as it is a successor. However, we quickly learn that the story begins to jump around from the first episode as this pair is introduced alongside the more familiar Ciel and Sebastian.  Not much can be said beyond this point to avoid spoilers, but the basic premise of Kuroshitsuji II revolves around the developed rivalry between Alois and Ciel, as well as the rivalry between...Sebastien and Claude. The story develops at a fantastic pace and mostly avoids the silly fillers and unless episodes that slowed season 1 down so much.And of course, fan service is back with full force. The obvious tension between..oh..every male in the show is amplified ten fold. I would go so far as to say that Kutoshitsuji II almost treads into slight shounen ai territory. Alois and Claude are especially guilty of perpetuating this.As great as the story is (and it is very, very good) a major problem I had with it was that it is sometimes a bit unbelievable. The motivations of the characters sometimes seems slightly unrealistic and forced. I found myself questioning these sometimes over dramatic and silly motives, but ultimately no caring because I was enjoying the show so much.Art::Like the first season, the art in Kuroshitsuji II is top notch and beautiful in every way.Sound::Very catchy opening and ending themes, though what really pleases me about Kuroshitsuji's sound is the background score. It remains elegant and classical; with some jazz and opera numbers thrown in occasionally. At times, it can be over the top, but the flashy and in your face opera tracks really do add quite a bit to the mood of the show.I feel like this series does a good job making highly emotional music that compliments the scenes very well and helps you connect better to them. It was one of the rare OSTs that I hunted for right away on the internet after hearing it.Character::All I can say is that things really get shaken up in this season. Ciel and Sebastian as a team have developed quite a bit from last season, adding a strong emotional flair that may have been lacking before. I much preferred their dynamic in this season, as it seems like they legitimately care for each other beyond using each other for revenge/a meal. Of course, both of them still retain their cynical and sinister natures as well.As for Alois and Claude..they are intense. Alois is by far the shows most emotional character, however borderline he may be. Watching him in action brings chills down my spine. He has some of the most raw and pure emotion I'v seen in any anime character to date.His butler is just the opposite. Claude is a cold, calculative scheme, but that in itself makes him interesting on screen. Both are immensely terrifying, and their interactions between Ciel and Sebastian will have you at the edge of your seat.Enjoyment::Kuroshitsuji II starts off with a bang, gets weak for a few episodes, and then just straight shoots into a wild ride.Overall::This show is very worth watching assuming you have seen the first season. Once you start, you won't be able to take your eyes away from the screen until the very end. The very few flaws it has are completely forgivable and overshadowed by it's amazing characters and rich plot.

Look at them as two possible endings which might\'ve occurred and you will have a choice of choosing the ending which best suits you and by doing so you won\'t have a chance of being disappointed and no ending is then ""forced"" upon you.(I will not compare it to the manga and how...the anime should have been adapted)Sequels and second, third seasons are very dangerous; they can make a mess of things, good and bad. They can satisfy your wish when you don\'t want the anime to end, to go that extra episode or two because it can, they can clear the mistakes of the season I, they can be fun and ok to watch, they can be great and just the perfect thing to end the whole deal, they can even improve the first season!However...Kuroshitsuji II isn\'t one of those sequels.The first season, as far as I am concerned had a superb ending, but seeing the first episode of season II which confused me, few episodes later, they explain perfectly as to why the anime continues and that satisfied me, because to some level they had a point and well, I too wanted to go on for a little while. But the sequel was unnecessary.Now, shall we begin?The Art and Sound (10 - perfect)The art is as good as season I, the same perfect style of drawing and coloring which suits the atmosphere, plus an extra additional touch when it comes to opening and ending themes. Music, great as ever. When it comes to intermission it blends more into it; instead of suddenly playing some happy tune when the mood way on the other side, it is  continuous, the way it should be.Characters (6 - fine)There are a few additional characters as to season I:Aloys Trancy - a bipolar child who dances on the line between thriving to destruction and then towards sadness and needing love to the maximum selfish extent. A sadist, yet a sad boy, jealous and vengeful, yet misplaced, lost and scared. The exact opposite of the young Ciel Phantomhive we\'ve accustomed to and certainly refreshing to a point. He has a past which is not that sad as it is disturbing. Really, really disturbing. You can sit back and take a break from those sad, throbbing and sobbing flashbacks and be assured there are very, very few of those.Claude Faustus - AloysTrancy\'s very own demon butler who\'s perfect in every way as he should be, who can go head to toe with Sebastain. His forks and knives are golden, opposite Sebastians silverware, his eyes are yellow and he wears glasses. He has a few tricks on his own, being the servant of Trancy family, whose crest holds a spider.Hannah Annafellows is a maid at the Trancy household. Aloys takes his insecurity and sadism on her without regret. Toying with her at any given time and given chance as the anime goes on, yet she remains loyal to her master in hope he will be happy...Trio - three identical bulters of the Trancy residence. They too had and have a part to play, though they could have been ignored. They are there for the soul purpose of being the ""new character"", anime could have gone without them just fine.With the Trio exception, characters are very well made and fairly interesting.As opposed to the Trio, Phantomhive trio isn\'t seen much, which means there are zero to One ""unnecessary"" episodes.Onward to the story.I\'ll try my best not to give out and spoilers so I will keep it short.Since there is a new master and a new butler, predictably, they will clash. Sebastian has met his match, a perfect copy of himself, Claude. He basically carries the story. Being sly and cunning he makes twists and turns and thus Sebastian has to work as hard as ever to protect his young master. Sebastian finally shows some ""emotion"" if you can call it that way. His expressions do change from the well accustomed satisfied, eager and hungry to rage, rage and rage and yes, even sometimes concern.Enjoyment of this series is pretty well. It\'s not good, it\'s not bad, it\'s a perfect mediocrity. Exactly what you\'d expect from a sequel. The story had a bellow average, predictable development, an impressive twist none the lessHowever...The ending is idiotic and disappointing. Compared to season I, which had a perfect ending, nothing else was needed, they go ahead and give the ending (thus giving the entire anime) meaninglessness and mediocrity.I know that most of you who will finish season I will immediately go searching for season II, but I feel I have to warn you, the ending Is disappointing and you Will be disappointed. Not because it might not be to your liking, but because it butchered what the first season was all about and thus killed the entire anime.Would I recommend watching it? Yes, ofcourse. But ONLY if one looks at it as a different story that stands by itself, instead of combining it into one anime. Looking at season I and II as two different little anime who have same characters, different stories, different endings.

This week I'm looking at the sequel. What's odd about Kuroshitsuji having a sequel is that the first series is complete. It tells the story of Sebastian and Ciel beginning, middle and end. Going into this, I have no idea how they could make a sequel, unless it's some kind of spiritual successor. Well, let's take a look at the series and find out how they handle it.You can't see it, but I'm face-palming right now. Given the quality of the first series, I gave them credit. I didn't think they would go for a true sequel, but...I was wrong. This series is a direct continuation of the first. With Ciel and Sebastian both making return appearances. Why, just why? The first series may have had an ending that was obvious and kind of rushed, but it was also suitable for the series. Why would you take a series with a pretty satisfying conclusion and add to it? That's actually my biggest issue with the story in this series. It's unnecessary. You have a young man named Alois Trancy with an impossibly talented butler. One evening they're visited by a strange traveler covered in heavy clothes. The man is revealed to be Sebastian and he's brought Ciel along in a briefcase. He steals something from the mansion and makes his getaway. I'm not going to give away the reasons behind all of this, but they're kind of stupid. After that Ciel and Alois gain a lot of animosity for each other so that there can be a plot. Now, let's start with the negatives, aside from it being an unnecessary addition. The first is that the retcon is very poorly handled and the plot that's added in to explain it is weak. Then there's the ending. It's pretty terrible. The story itself is lazy. A lot of it is just devoted to the rivalry between Sebastian and Claude. The series does have some episodes devoted to Ciel, Sebastian and the rest of the characters from the first series that are entertaining. It also has some plot elements that have merit, but they aren't really handled well enough to be as interesting as they could've been.But at least the characters are still good, right? Well, kind of. Sebastian and Ciel are still good characters, although not nearly to the degree that they were in the first series, probably because they retread a lot of the same ground and development that they already covered with less competent writing behind it. Ciel's staff still provides the same comic relief they did before, albeit less of it since they barely show up. On the downside, Grell reappears with the same problematic elements from the first series. Then we have the new characters. Alois, whose an obnoxious and very annoying brat with little personality aside from being a sociopath. We also have Claude whose incredibly dull. we also have Hannah, a maid in the Trancy household. When you learn what her motivations are the sheer stupidity will likely make your head hurt. We also get some triplet servants in the Trancy household. They have no personalities whatsoever.The art is still well done. The character designs are still good, for the most part. The backgrounds are still well done. The action sequences in this one really aren't as good. Part of that is just that they involve a lot of awkward scene transitions.The cast is still really good. Tamura Yukari, Hirano Aya, Sakamoto Maaya, Ono Daisuke and most of the other actors all give strong performances. Fukuyama Jun is still a weakness based solely on the fact that the character he's portraying is ridiculously exaggerated. Mizuki Nana has the same problem, although she does a little better at putting some nuance into the performance in spite of it. Sakurai Takahiro doesn't give his best performance either, largely due to his character having less emotional substance than a tapeworm.The yuri factor is still a 1/10. there's no yuri here.You probably deduced this already, but I didn't care for this one. It has some of the elements that made the first one great, but most of them are either weakened by idiotic contrivances and/or terrible new characters. My final rating is going to be a 4/10. It's a sub-par piece that doesn't stand well either on its own or as a continuation to the Kuroshitsuji. Next week, I'll look at Usagi Drop. Jojo's Bizarre Adventure is next on my request queue, but I'm not going to have time to finish all of it in time. So expect that on the 29th. I was wrong.

What I do know is this anime pissed me off. It introduces a set of new characters, Alios and Clyde, these two domininating the second season.Story: 4The story was mediocre at best. It honestly wasn't in the least bit interesting, and was a waste of time to even watch. The storyline of the first one was great, amazing I'm fact. But this one was appealing, and made me think they should've ended it with...what they had. Alios and Clyde weren't any significance, and seemed like a knock-off of Ciel and Sebestaion. It was long and drawn out, no character whatsoever.Art : 9The art was nice, nothing special and kept the Victorian era true to its name. Alios, Clyde, Ciel, and Sebeastian were all drawn nicely, and we're very original. The scenery in the background was nice, overall it was a solid 9Sound: 10The voice acting was magnificent , and the voices fit the personalities of characters they represented. The opening and closing weren't very memorable, but the pictures were nice, while the second season lacked in story, the sound made up for it.Character: 2The characters pissed me off. Not because they were annoying *cough Alios cough*, But because how two dementional they are. I hate when animators try and use flashbacks as a way to do character development. Some cases it works, others it miserably fails. This of course is the latter. They also love to try to have a depressing past to make us have sympathy for them, using this as an excuse for said character to be a complete asshole to everyone. Alios was an annoying brat, and quite frankly I'm glad what the animators decided to cut his part. Cylde was just overall creepy and delusional, obsessing over Ciel for some odd reason. They are just cookie cutter characters, nothing special.Enjoyment: 3I did not enjoy this anime at all. I loved seeing Ciel and Sebeastian again, but this anime was a train wreck. Alios ruined it for me, and I finished it, hoping that it will have a great ending, but it was a disappointment. I recommend that you watch it for the shits and giggles, but don't expect it to be the best thing since toast was invented.Overall : 5This anime averaged to about a 4.9, after adding each number I gave it then dividing it by the four categories, giving it a almost solid 5. It looks like shit compared to the first Black Butler, but after having an amazing first season, my expectations weren't set to high. I recommend to watch, but don't make my mistake of thinking it will be good, then being disappointed in the end. If you enjoyed my review, feel free to check out my others! Enjoy! what they had.

Enjoy!"", ""(This review is subjected to have one or two spoilers for the first ep)So, I didn't finish watching the first season of Kuroshitsuji, because I didn't want to see the ending, when I know that it was so different from the manga (Yes, I read the manga) but I have to say, giving Kuroshitsuji season ll a shot wasn't a bad idea. As of now, there are only three episodes out and the suspense and the want for answers are already building.STORY:The anime starts out with a new butler and a new master. The starting of the anime wasn't bad, actually it was quite...interesting, I thought that it wouldn't be so bad to watch this anime without the formal characetrs, Sebastian and Ciel, whom everyone deemed gone because of the last ep in season one. But Kuroshitsuji isn't something to be looked upon lightly, because our favorite characters were brought back as the actual main characters for Kuroshitsuji. This land mine was quite a surpise and excitement for me, but with the return of them brought up a very important question. Why has Ciel forgotten the near past events? The death of his aunt, the shinigami Grell, the queen... Why has Ciel forgotten? The answer might be clear to many of us, Sebastian is the puppeteer behind this whole charade. But why, why is this demon still holding on to his 'pure' master? And then the last question is, what does Alois want with Ciel? And the fact that the 2cnd episode doesn't bring back the Trancy household makes you want more information on them. So for now, I give the story a big TEN. Three episodes in and the suspense, the mystery, and the questions are building. But if you don't like a dark mystery revolving around a young boy and sinister characters that bind themselves to demons to get their very wish fufilled, then this anime is not for you.ART:Now as a full on fan of Kuroshitsuji I do indeed read the manga and nothing can compare to Yana Toboso's art skill. She's a great artist, so it's obvious that I will be basing my critique off of her art. The scenery compares well with the artistic talent of Yana-san and feels very much of the victorian age. Though, for a dark plotted anime not everything has a dark feel to it and that gives the anime light. There isn't much of that in the manga but for a change it is good. The objects, houses, carriages, are all well accounted for when it comes to detail. It's a very beautifully animated anime. The characters I must say are also well animated, but it's hard to ignore the fact that the details just seem a bit off. I compare the screencaps to the manga pages and just think, the characters are so much better drawn in the manga. Had I just watched the anime though and cared less for manga, this would have gotten a ten, but yet, it has to suffice with just a nine.SOUND: (I re-watched the first ep for this part xD)Personally, I hate squeaky voices or overrated voice actors voicing anime characters. Bad voices can take away from a very good series. But it's hard to say that I don't like the voices in this series. I don't research on voice actors, but I have to say that the people who voice Sebastian, Ciel, and Claude are very good. They bring out the characters personalities very well. As for the sound effects, it's eh for me. I've yet to find a good anime where they don't have useless sound effects, but there not very apparant in Kuroshitsuji. As for the music? OH MY GOD. The eerieness off the opra music selected for this series if just fantastic. I don't personally like the sort of music play in Kuroshitsuji, but man, it's placed well. Not to mention the opposition of the music and the feel of the moment is perfect. So the only part bringing down the rating of this part is the sound effect of which I don't care for in any anime. So this portion gets a EIGHT.CHARACTER:If you haven't understood yet then let's repeat, this is a dark gothic manga with characters that have either rather depressing pasts, demonic personalities, or messed up lives. And the scarey fect of the matter is, some of the situations are not impossible and most definitely are quite real. Rape, human sacrifices, death, these are things aren't strangers to this series. It isn't talked about in every episode to where you are annoyed with it, but it shows in the characters personality how they were treated in the past. Such as Alois the supposed antagonist of the series and Ciel the main character whoes personalities feed off of their past. Then there's Claude and Sebastian, the butlers whos only desirer is to consume their master. With these dark characters the anime would be a lot more than just plain depressing (It can be) but then you have all your comic relief characters. So as there is lots of dark trends that will most definitely stream through this anime, don't worry, you will most definitely laugh. But keep in mind, this series revolves around the past and goals of the main characters. But I love the characters, so TEN.ENJOYMENT:I remember being completely and crazily crazy with happiness when I watched the first episode. And it's hard to say I didn't enjoy the first episode. It was great and fantastic and completely off the the edge of my seat. But then after the first episode, I asked the computer what happened? Sure, I laugh, but, episode two and three just couldn't compare to the first episode. It's not enough as of now to make me drop the series, because there are answers that I want answered, so I won't let the first few episodes stop me. So as of now, if you want to see a multitude of geners, go ahead and watch this. It can make change your sad mood to happy or your happy mood to sad, but because it's so early in the series, but the last two installments couldn't own up to the first one, this category gets a eight. There is hope yet, hopefully.OVERALL:I hope I didn't mix up the anime and the manga... Which I highly doubt, since the anime is now completely different from what Yana-san has been writing, but I must say, that for so early into the anime, I am SLIGHTLY hooked. I enjoy the characters and the story. The fact that I already have questions without answers is a good thing. I'm happy that I have given this series a chance. And it's more than just a great way to pass time, so overall grade gets a NINE interesting, I thought that it wouldn't be so bad to watch this anime without the formal characetrs, Sebastian and Ciel, whom everyone deemed gone because of the last ep in season one. But Kuroshitsuji isn't something to be looked upon lightly, because our favorite characters were brought back as the actual main characters for Kuroshitsuji. This land mine was quite a surpise and excitement for me, but with the return of them brought up a very important question. Why has Ciel forgotten the near past events? The death of his aunt, the shinigami Grell, the queen... Why has Ciel forgotten? The answer might be clear to many of us, Sebastian is the puppeteer behind this whole charade. But why, why is this demon still holding on to his 'pure' master? And then the last question is, what does Alois want with Ciel? And the fact that the 2cnd episode doesn't bring back the Trancy household makes you want more information on them. So for now, I give the story a big TEN. Three episodes in and the suspense, the mystery, and the questions are building. But if you don't like a dark mystery revolving around a young boy and sinister characters that bind themselves to demons to get their very wish fufilled, then this anime is not for you.ART:Now as a full on fan of Kuroshitsuji I do indeed read the manga and nothing can compare to Yana Toboso's art skill. She's a great artist, so it's obvious that I will be basing my critique off of her art. The scenery compares well with the artistic talent of Yana-san and feels very much of the victorian age. Though, for a dark plotted anime not everything has a dark feel to it and that gives the anime light. There isn't much of that in the manga but for a change it is good. The objects, houses, carriages, are all well accounted for when it comes to detail. It's a very beautifully animated anime. The characters I must say are also well animated, but it's hard to ignore the fact that the details just seem a bit off. I compare the screencaps to the manga pages and just think, the characters are so much better drawn in the manga. Had I just watched the anime though and cared less for manga, this would have gotten a ten, but yet, it has to suffice with just a nine.SOUND: (I re-watched the first ep for this part xD)Personally, I hate squeaky voices or overrated voice actors voicing anime characters. Bad voices can take away from a very good series. But it's hard to say that I don't like the voices in this series. I don't research on voice actors, but I have to say that the people who voice Sebastian, Ciel, and Claude are very good. They bring out the characters personalities very well. As for the sound effects, it's eh for me. I've yet to find a good anime where they don't have useless sound effects, but there not very apparant in Kuroshitsuji. As for the music? OH MY GOD. The eerieness off the opra music selected for this series if just fantastic. I don't personally like the sort of music play in Kuroshitsuji, but man, it's placed well. Not to mention the opposition of the music and the feel of the moment is perfect. So the only part bringing down the rating of this part is the sound effect of which I don't care for in any anime.

The only thing I ever knew about the second season(this was back when I was still watching season one) was the infamous ""tongue boy."" Alois, I thought, would be a little like the Ikuto(Shugo Chara sexy kitty boy) figure. But it turned out that he was a very...Interesting person. Disturbed in terms of society\'s ""moral correctness,"" Alois made for the perfect character to use as support for Kuroshitsuji\'s finale.I\'m not one to like it when an anime series alters it\'s plot just so they can end it ahead of time, but this was a really...well done plot ending. Although there were a lot of new characters, Alois, in particular, was my big surprise. Because I\'m sure anything anyone hears is just about his ""booty-licious shorts.""  For those of you who are turned off by that factor(I wasn\'t but..You know, if you are) there\'s more to him than you\'d imagine.Without giving away any details, he\'s one of those characters that, if you\'re an open mind to different takes on justice, you can really come to love in the short amount of time that he was a lead in this series. Though it was definite that he supported Ciel, he also added a new twisted flair to Kuroshitsuji that I really liked. It was really because of him that Kuroshitsuji had as good an ending to the anime. (After all, by his wishes, did everything that happened come to be reality.)The other new characters such as Hana and Claude are both support for Alois. Because of Alois\'s ""Needy behavior,"" it was very skillful to add such high contrast characters beside him that help support such a boy(otherwise he probably would have fallen apart.) Hana is a passive maid who lets Alois treat her as a rag doll, while Claude is a sort of absent character who is very hard to please. As Alois\'s butler, he says things with empty meaning and often, Alois goes searching for actual emotion in Claude. Though Alois and Claude, as a duo, where never as effective as the Ciel-Sebastian duo, they were still a very successful contrasting pairing(not in the romantic way.)The story begins in a rather rocky start as a lot of information is dumped on you. As the story starts when a big time lapse has occurred between the end of season one and the current events, it takes some time to piece together everything that happened, but the fact that the plot still functions, without the viewers having full knowledge of the previous essential points, is proof enough that the ending to this series was really a piece of work that was woven together beautifully.A lot of people will debate about the yaoi or non-yaoi-ness of season one. But those who cater toward such style of affection will be slightly pleased to know of a fact that they will learn upon the first few episodes of the series; Alois Trancy is an aristocratic boy with a demon butler(like Ciel). But--rather than being an exact copy of the Earl of Phatomhive--he has differences in his past that led him to his current position and the location of his contract seal is different from Ciel\'s.With a detailed past quite similar in cruelty and suffering to Ciel\'s, Alois\'s hardships toughened him into a callus soul that masked his wounds with twisted smiles. In some ways, he ended up less ""complete in mind"" than Ciel in the fact that his consciousness is not completely at peace with itself. By his sporadic behavior, ranging on the bipolar side, we can tell that he is very deeply damaged as a result of his ordeals. And his savior, Claude, is always the person he looks toward for recognition. One can hardly blame such a soul as Alois, though. He clung to what brought him out of the darkness; it could only be cruel to condemn him for not noticing the foolishness in asking for love from a Demon.If we return to the very sensitive topic for this anime: Yaoi(which makes or breaks some people\'s experience with such a series), we will notice the location of Alois\'s demon contract: his tongue. Popularly, he is seen licking people with his tongue, or rather, a single entity. A certain boy for whom also has a demon butler... Ironically, however, Alois does not favor Ciel or seek any romantic relations with him(as I first assumed by all the comments I got on Alois\'s character), he actually wishes torturel Ciel. This becomes evident in the first episode(so don\'t think I spoiled anything for you). And the way for which his past, his demon contract, Ciel, and Sebastian weave together to create the finale to Kuroshitsuji make this a MUST WATCH for any fan of Kuroshitsuji, be it the anime or manga. well done plot ending.

I had my doubts, five minutes in to the first episode. I didn't think Alois was going to live up to the standards Ceil set, nor did I like Claude. He was simply too fussy. I changed my mind in the last few minutes of that same episode. Once I realized Ceil was in fact, still around, and it wasn't going to be about Alois, I was thoroughly delighted.From the standpoint of an animator, I have to say that the animation isn't as great as it maybe could have been, but considering...how hard and quickly they have to work to get an episode out on time, I think they did a brilliant job.I also liked the different entry scenes for the two different characters, both Antagonist and protagonist.I think you're going to come to like Alois, once you get past the fact that he's incredibly creepy at times. He's a bit co-dependent and needy, but he's also devious and clever. He knows how to get what he wants-when flirting fails him, he either acts crazy or incredibly clever. He's quick witted and VERY sharp--if a little sadistic and cruel. I respect character writing that makes me think, and Alois is definitely someone who keeps you on your toes. He's an ASTOUNDINGLY complex character, despite all surface appearances.Hannah, despite  appearing to be incredibly submissive in the first episode, reveals a side of herself you'll find very surprising. Telling more would be spoilers though!Claude I didn't like, but I recognize the importance of having a character like him--His development is actually quite surprising as well.the triplets seemed a little flat for me, but I think their role was just to be pretty and act creepy, points for that. There's really no back story or development behind them. I would have liked to see them explained a little more.Over all the series is a lot of fan service, (I assume as an apology to those who were upset by the final episode of the first season) and some trolling on the part of the maid and Alois. There are also a few Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jojo's bizarre adventures, and Eddy Izzard references(from my point of view at least) Showing that the Creator, Producers, Writers and animators all have BRILLIANT senses of humor, and good skills in subtlety. Indeed there are a few phrases in the middle of the project that you don't understand completely until the last two or three episodes, but it's well worth the wait.My opinion? Props for going out with a bang, keeping me on my toes and waiting, practically begging for more, and for doing a great job in a little window of time. 12 episodes isn't very much to reach the climax of this sort of thing. Kuroshitsuji II has a fantastic storyline, wonderful writing, intelligently crafted characters, for the most part. Because of all of this, I love this series as much as I loved it's predecessor, and the manga it's derived from. I'm sure you'll love it as well!Good watching-Nix how hard and quickly they have to work to get an episode out on time, I think they did a brilliant job.I also liked the different entry scenes for the two different characters, both Antagonist and protagonist.I think you're going to come to like Alois, once you get past the fact that he's incredibly creepy at times.

I'm sure you'll love it as well!Good watching-Nix"", 'As a fan of the first season, I was looking forward to the announcement that the second season got a green lit. I disliked the idea of having a new master and butler but as the updates and airing date were moving close, I felt that the new master is indeed interesting and unique. Aside the new butler of course.The moment I got to watch the first episode of the second season, there were mixed feelings. Confusion, amusement and unsatisfaction. The latter episodes became dull but there were certain ones that just makes me “Okay fine, I’ll finish this. Maybe it would be more interesting...on the next episode.” I was damn wrong. The second season was full of faults in an overall score. The characters took a sudden landslide the moment Alois declared that he wanted Ciel, Claude lusting for Ciel’s soul and Sebastian being a weak demon whenever Ciel’s soul was on the table. Landslide?More of a catastrophe I guess.So I’ll start with the first and second most important part, characters and plot.Ciel Phantomhive is a strong hearted independent noble. Why in the name of the queen of England should he let his emotions of pride and selfishness  just because there is someone working for the queen other than himself? This is clearly a point why Ciel is, most of the times, a spoiled brat, only a million fold richer. Ciel’s reincarnation as a demon made the overall season’s score lower than the others. He is Ciel but at the same time not. It’s not confusing. Just imagine Ciel, being himself, only as a empty hollow. Do you get it now? Great. Now you’ll see why Ciel isn’t interesting anymore. I just don’t know for those Sebastian x Ciel fans though, I’ll just leave their imaginations of pedophility love.Sebastian Michaelis is the famous talk around bishounen town. I’m not a fan of his character but if I could compare his development between the two seasons, I would say that he became more of a lowly and cowardly dog than a humble butler in the present season. He is confident that his possession, Ciel’s soul, wouldn’t be robbed by some other demon. Which lead to a disaster which also lead to another huge failure, particularly the 12th episode. His resistance as declared in the first season was his biggest mistake if I say so myself.Alois Trancy(please do not remind me of his real name, I prefer this instead) is one of the freshest characters I’ve seen. He is an interesting, pathetic, adorable, slutty, pitiful, devastated, attention-seeking male cinderella. But he became the dullest thing I can see in the 12th episode. He has become weak and easily-controlled soul. Leaving his murder behind, his character, wanting to be loved by Claude is just like those romantic movies I’ve seen a hundred times. It’s unrequited love, master and butler special edition. He became a poorly made character by the moment he said that he wanted Claude despite his failure of finishing the contract. Biggest waste. Period.Claude Faustus, fuck this butler very much. He is the biggest mistake. And because he is the biggest mistake he is also the culprit of the biggest downfall and biggest waste of the series. He’s too honest, sneaky and is a monkey dressed in a butler suit with glasses. He’s the type that if he wanted something, he would use anyone just to attain his ‘something’ and this something was none other than Ciel Phantomhive. His death was a failure too. I dislike him so much that I wouldn’t even be able to accept comments about my rant about him.Hannah Anafeloz,with no mistake, has the most development especially in the last two episodes. She has become Alois’ savior and Ciel’s killer. She ignited Alois’ passion of becoming one with Ciel and devoured Alois’ into a new contract after letting him know that she is one with his younger brother, Luca. I’m surprised that she grew feelings with Luca which lead to performing a contract with him which became a bridge to be of service under the Trancy household. Oh, did I say she’s a masochist? Yeah. The hell with it. She rocked the boat herself.The triplets, the highlight of their existence was their failure of killing Sebastian. Other than that, they’re triplets! And triplets are eyecatching. I prefer them cleaning and doing household chores instead of attacking Sebastian just to hide their idiocy and uselessness.And of course, who would forget the Ronald Knox appearance? I didn’t see that coming, I doubt that you did too.The minor characters that were adapted to the second season has a pale presence. The parts where Sebastian was handing over a letter declaring the death date of Ciel were confusing. Their reactions weren’t as lively as before.Second, art.The art of the first season was balanced. The background and character quality was well balanced. The second season wasn’t. The background quality was more of an A+ while the character quality was lower, more of a B minus. Maybe it’s just me, but other than that, it was brilliant. The animation was great too especially when it comes to the fighting scenes.Third, music and character voice.The CV in the first season had a good score coming from most of the watchers, why wouldn’t the second season have too? It’s better and more fine. The music is more than passable. It’s befitting. Except that in some points it sometimes overpowers the characters.Kuroshitsuji or in English, Black Butler, is a finely made series. The thing is, it flunked during the second season in very many points. So many that you will be able to point them out even though you haven’t watched the first season.Third season? No thanks. But if they’ve decided to push another season through, good luck with that. I’ll keep my mouth shut till then. on the next episode.” I was damn wrong.

I’ll keep my mouth shut till then.', 'This is my first review, so I apologize for any mistakes.I watched the 1st season which was awesome and also received 10 from my side. But I was really disapointed upon the 2nd season (I expected that).STORY: starts with the most annoying character(s) in Kuroshitsuji franchise but in the 2nd episode everything was almost the same like in the 1st season. From about 5th or 6th episode the story started to lose it`s sense; the ending didn`t have it anymore so I give it 4.ART: that`s the only thing I enjoyed while watching the anime; it was clear, detailed (especialy in gore moments) and enjoyable...to watch. Score: 10SOUND: I don`t pay too much attention to sound but it was alright and the soundtrack was good to listen. I give it 8.CHARACTERS: They`re the same as in the 1st season + new characters (Alois Trancy and his servants) but some of the old characters didn`t appeared much during the season. Almost all new characters were really annoying, but toward the end their true selves were revealed and I liked that. Score: 5ENJOYMENT: Despite the mistakes and whole sense of this series I still enjoyed in it because of action, development of story along with the characters. Score: 6OVERALL: this season wasn`t necessary because the story was already finished in the 1st one and yet the developers decided to stretch it. I give it 3 because of annoying new characters and story without sense, but also very good action and plot twists. If you watched the 1st season and enjoyed it, I disrecommend watching this one because it`s not worth of your time. Score: 3 to watch. Score: 10SOUND: I don`t pay too much attention to sound but it was alright and the soundtrack was good to listen. I give it 8.CHARACTERS: They`re the same as in the 1st season + new characters (Alois Trancy and his servants) but some of the old characters didn`t appeared much during the season. Almost all new characters were really annoying, but toward the end their true selves were revealed and I liked that. Score: 5ENJOYMENT: Despite the mistakes and whole sense of this series I still enjoyed in it because of action, development of story along with the characters.

Score: 3', ""Kuroshitsuji II(two stars like this \uf0e0** means that there is a spoiler coming up, and you should skip to the next set of stars)And here we come to a sequel. Sequels can be a good thing, if expressed correctly and if it is relevant to the parent story, much like an OVA. And let’s be honest – if a show is THAT good, and it ends in a sort of open ended way, shouldn’t it just stay like that? I mean, I’m pretty sure no one wants to know what happened to Azmaria at the end of Chrono Crusade. And though I used to hope...for it, I like the way the Code Geass series ended. You were left with either believing he was dead or alive in some other world. Quite honestly, I think that’s the best kind of ending – one that you’ll remember long after finishing the story. And this sequel is just passable. I preferred the way the first season ended, because it was just at the cataclysm that Ciel dies. Or, it was assumed so. I just don’t like the way it all took off. And sadly, it doesn’t look like they’re done. (I'm grading this according to the MAL number ruling - a six is fair, meaning its not great but it isn't bad either.Art:The art hasn’t changed much if at all from the first season. If there was a change, then it was so small I couldn’t even notice it. So I’ll give it the same art score I would’ve given the first season.Sounds:Nothing to say about the ending and opening soundtracks. They weren’t overly enjoyable or disappointing, they were just ok. The soundtrack in the show, however, is a different story. The sound track of the second season is just as enjoyable as the soundtrack of the first. Beautiful melodies that mask sorrow or that exempt it all together – that’s the kind of music you can hope to hear from this show.Story:To make it simply and clear: There really is no story at the beginning. The first episode brings Ciel back, and then it’s just…“what?” until episode 6. Don’t get me wrong, you enjoy this arc, as you reminisce with old characters, but it all seems irrelevant to the story – and that’s a problem. This, to me, is always what can make any viewer drop an anime. If the show flies way out with an idea or its arc is too long and irrelevant, you gotta wonder why you’re still watching it. I can’t tell you how many shows I was excited to watch, that I ended up dropping because the arcs got too boring and I began to question its relevance. But this is not the case, it was a little over played, yes, but it was enjoyable, and that makes up for it. In the end, the reconciliation of the characters, though late and not very deep, is strong, albeit a little more confusing than it should have been.Characters:Ciel and Sebastian are old news. Elizabeth has very obviously taken a liking to Ciel, even more so than is noticeable in the first season. And sadly, you don’t get to see much of her after the first few episodes. And then we get to Alois Trancy. A homoerotic, sadistic **(actually gay, as we see in the first scene)** freak. **People may argue that he was forced into it, but he doesn’t seem at all deeply affected by it. Almost like it just doesn’t bother him.**  He is utterly disgusting and despicable to say the least. It’s not because he’s gay, but because of the way he acts and the way he treats others.  His butler, Claude, is another freaky one. When you meet him, you sort of get the feeling he’s like…Sebastian from wal-mart. Like, Sebastian is a nicely polished Lamborghini or BMW, and Claude is just a cheap knock off, like a  90’s era Toyota Corolla, or Dodge Grand Caravan. They just don’t compare. Maybe I’m being a little biased, perhaps because I already know Sebastian from the first season and have seen just how good he is at what he does. And, his humor has upped its ante from the first season – there was one specific part that I couldn’t stop laughing about midway through the series that I had to watch again and again. You also start to wonder what the hell other characters are even doing in the story. And the truth is, you won’t know until you get to episode 5 or whatever, when the story starts to make sense, as they’re all explaining what has happened thus far. In simpler terms, your favorite characters don’t exactly get enough air time this time around. I was honestly hoping for some more bonding with Lizzy. But that was shot.Enjoyment:While I still wouldn’t exactly categorize this show as pure fan service or maybe even partly fan service, it does deliver a lot of what you’re hoping to see. Not because its eye candy, although that is sometimes the case, but because it relates to the story, or helps set up a premise to the next or future setting. I thoroughly enjoyed this series. Even though the first few episodes you’re confused to no end, the last few episodes stick to the main plot and the point it is trying to get across is received clearly. Though, the ending was probably a disappointment simply because it ended, and made you think that the story could honestly have just not even started if it was going to end the way it did.  **With Sebastian being trapped into eternal loyalty.**Faults:I think the series was a great piece of work, but to be perfectly honest, it almost seems like the creators tried to make something out of nothing. I think that they wanted another season, and to make it possible, they brought Ciel back. He was dead at the end of the first season, and it should have just ended there. If the production team had wanted to do more work, they could’ve just chosen to do an entirely new series. I wanted to watch this sequel because I assumed it would ONLY be based on Alois Trancy and his butler.  **Now, however, they’re both dead.** And it only seems like it’ll get worse, as word of a possible 3rd season is going around.Overall:This being a direct sequel, you are obligated to watch the first season in order to get this one. I honestly thought this was going to be a standalone show with just Alois, but that was wrong. Way wrong. Anywho, it was a great watch. I have personally been getting pretty bored with all the new anime coming out this season, as they are either too cliché or they haven’t finished (I had a bad experience waiting for Bakemonogatari to finish, since I started watching it a week before the last episode was supposed to come out, only to find out that the last episode was going to be coming out HALF A DAMN YEAR LATER).

The fact that they made a second season made me leap for joy in a way but I'm utterly disappointed with what I've seen in this season. For the most part it doesn't have anything to do with the manga. The story from the beginning is really confusing and was really hard for me to understand. It was really obvious that the producers were only making a second season to please the fans.

From episode 1 to episode 12 it just makes me wonder what the hell happened.

It\'s like they shredded the plot and characters through an AI and asked it ""write the worst possible thing in existence"", used its script, and animated it while drunk. Strange, abnormal amount of fanservice, weird fujoshi bait (for EVERY pairing you can imagine) and some wildly unnecessary gore. The timeline is so messed up I don\'t even understand how the animators understood what they were doing--it\'s not messed up in a fun, creative way, just in a bad, messy way.So watch it if you want to get an all around experience of Black Butler, but make sure to read...on the correct chronological order of the animated series. You shouldn\'t judge this series as a whole based on this season, as, as you know, it isn\'t manga canon.This was really a one of a kind experience.

I don\'t count this as a \'sequel\'.Plot:With the story, the first five episodes are clearly fillers, except maybe the first when introducing Alois. But we don\'t really get a proper story line until the middle of the season. It\'s a bit disappointing when you reach it and say, ""so what was the purpose of the last few episodes?"" clearly the writers weren\'t thinking when they wrote...it. I do understand this strays far from the manga, but I found many scenes where it...just didn\'t make a whole lot of sense. Having the random episodes and humour is fun, but does it fit? Probably not.Now the themes of death and sacrifice were clearly there. Good. Some symbolism with the rings, marks, etc. But I found it repeated some mistakes from the first season. However, I won\'t hold season II responsible for a cliche plot. They did well to establish something original, creating a darker more gory atmosphere the first one didn\'t have much of.There is one thing that bugged me was how Sebastian felt like a supporting character in this. It was all about the new characters and less about developing the character of Sebastian and Ciel.

Adds to the horror genre this show wanted to come across as.Character:Oh boy...here we go. Let\'s start with Alois, shall we?Can someone please get this kid a psychologist? Clearly he has some major mental issues and even sexual issues. Now we do get a backstory on him, but I don\'t think it went far enough. We never got to see the relationship with his parents. Perhaps his birth father sexually abused him and his brother to make him the way he is. Who knows. But I have a feeling his parents or at least his father are to blame for his behaviour as the Lord and how he comes up with such vile things/ideas. He has no fear, and probably is diagnosed with PTSD or separation anxiety. I can say he is one messed up kid.The good thing about him is he is not a stereotype. That is a relief right there. The writers created a very dark character though. I was shocked what I saw at the beginning. No child should ever be doing that sort or thing, which is probably one of the reasons why this show is rated R.Onto Claude. He is another Sebastian except a spider version of him. He doesn\'t really have a personality of his own. I don\'t have anything else to say other than that...Hannah seems to hold a darker secret, which if you read the synopsis you\'ll know who she is.

There\'s a rather peculiar phenomenon that happens in popular culture with time. It would seem that stuff that was popular ten years ago tends to age poorly, and yet 20 years later, we laud it as a retro classic. Given that, we must ask ourselves whether or not history will vindicate Black Butler II. Indeed, it wasn\'t the most critically acclaimed at the time of its release, and yet there was this rather notable subset of the fandom that tried to find the...good in an extremely controversial second season. Even so, some would argue that this show\'s transgressions are so unforgivable that what little good this season accomplished would never be enough to justify all the nonsense viewers have to endure. I am one of those people.My initial impressions of Black Butler II were not positive when I first watched it. Even if I try my damndest to forgive the show for its many transgressions, I can\'t find myself feeling anything except visceral disgust. Do not be fooled; there is no merit to be found here in Black Butler II. What little good that it manages to accomplish boils down to mere coincidence and aesthetics rather than any sincere attempt at telling a coherent story involving characters who have compelling narratives. I\'d even go so far as to say that this show is the perfect example of a ""cash grab sequel"" considering how much shit the viewer has to wade through before finding anything remotely close to what the first season had to offer.That\'s something I\'d never imagine myself saying, much less in a long-form review. Though the 2008 anime is flawed to high heaven, I can at least respect the fact that it tried to branch out into newer concepts. While its ending wasn\'t satisfying for me, it felt like an airtight conclusion to the Faustian tragedy about a victim of circumstance and his pursuit for revenge. It\'s common knowledge by now that the 2008 anime ended with Sebastian about to devour Ciel\'s soul, how the fuck can anyone make a sequel to that? Unfortunately, I can\'t go into too much detail about that due to spoilers, but I will say this: the explanation feels like it was ripped straight from the depths of some shitty headcanon on Tumblr or FanFiction.net than Yana Toboso\'s mind.While it was challenging to try and find anything about this show\'s marketing, the general assumption that one could make at the time its pilot aired was that this show would be about a new young master and a new demon butler. Of course, we all know that setup was a fake-out as the real story this season has to offer is a battle between old and new. The new young master Alois and his demonic servant in Claude are now locked in a struggle with Ciel and Sebastian as we watch this marvellous chess game unfold in real-time. At least, that\'s the best way that I can try to describe this sad facsimile of a plot positively.The thing is that Black Butler II tries to set itself up as this grand battle of wits between eerily similar nobles where we can see just how far Ciel could have fallen were it not for the way his circumstances played out. It doesn\'t achieve that effect whatsoever and instead plays out more like a sadistic child psychopath bitching about why everyone hates him. Ciel wasn\'t the epitome of characterisation in the 2008 anime. However, it was still relatively easy to root for him considering how Ciel still had his moments of humanity shown (i.e. his affection for Lizzie, his acceptance of Soma and Agni, his bond with the servants of Phantomhive, etc.).I want to give Alois the benefit of the doubt because I get no joy out of hating him. However, I cannot tolerate his presence on the screen for more than mere minutes at a time and no amount of great voice acting from the likes of Her Highness, Luci Christian can ever change that. Alois is quite literally Ciel if he had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and any attempt this show makes to paint Alois in a sympathetic light falls flat on its face when you take his actions during the anime into account. How the fuck can I feel any modicum of sympathy for a child who gouges out his maid\'s eye for a simple mistake?What\'s more, is that the anime tries so… fucking… HARD to make the audience feel sympathy for Alois to the point where it just comes across as fucking stupid rather than compelling. I don\'t give a shit how tragic your character\'s backstory is; sympathy is earned rather than given. Ciel\'s actions in the anime and manga are indeed morally questionable at times. Again - he\'s still got those crucial moments where you can look past his Bruce Wayne facade and see a child who\'s ultimately a victim of circumstance. You want me to see the light in Alois? How about you portray him as something other than a sadistic, psychotic child with the telltale signs of histrionic personality disorder in the present day and present time?I don\'t give a rat\'s ass if Alois was abused and defiled like Ciel nor do I give a shit about his background as some impoverished child; shitty people, in general, don\'t deserve our sympathy. Alois\'s entire motive boils down to an obsession with what Ciel has that he doesn\'t have. Indeed, this feud between Ciel and Alois gets even more ridiculous when Claude decides to take an interest in Ciel after tasting his blood. Get this: Alois is such an irksome shitstain that his demonic servant who is contractually obligated to serve him leaves for the superior protagonist. That\'s how you know you\'re an utter failure as a person.There is an argument that I\'ve seen some people make that Alois was an excellent villain specifically because he got you to hate him and in a vacuum, I can understand that logic. The problem with this train of thought is that merely hating a villain doesn\'t automatically make them compelling. Wrestling heels evoke the ire of the audience on purpose, but there\'s a clear distinction between a heel like Randy Orton and a heel like X-Pac. Hell, I\'d wager that Alois isn\'t even in the same league as X-Pac. He\'s more like Roman Reigns in that the larger audience hates him and yet A-1 Pictures decides to pull a Vince McMahon and continue pushing Alois despite the sheer volume of disapproval.What makes all of this even more disgusting is how far A-1 Pictures tries to go with its pandering. I stated before that I\'m grateful for Yana Toboso deciding against making Black Butler into a BL manga. Now, we get into the part of this review that goes into great lengths about why. The fan service in Black Butler was uncomfortable, but it never got downright nauseating like its cash-grab sequel does. Hell, put the two shows side by side, and you can make an argument that the first season was tasteful with how it handled its fan service. Again, that\'s a statement I never thought I\'d say out loud, but here we are.Alois\'s backstory involves him getting exploited sexually by the former Earl Trancy. If you think that\'s bad enough, we get treated to several flashback scenes where we see Alois seducing him in excruciating detail right down to the ugly bastard sucking his toes. We get treated to countless views of Sebastian pandering to Grell\'s lust for him by striking poses while she takes photos of him beating up the bishonen triplets. Speaking of which, we get treated to many scenes of these mute triplets who exist for two reasons: padding out Alois\'s servant lineup and also fan service for all the fujoshis who couldn\'t get enough BL material from the first season. You know, because why bother telling a compelling story when you can amp up the number of pretty boys in your narrative and have the fujoshis buy the BDs in droves? Don\'t think they\'re the only ones who get in on all the pandering either, because Hannah exists specifically to cater to perverts who lust after a one-eyed maid with huge tits.It gets to a point where Claude is the only character introduced that I can find myself rooting for in some manner. Why? Because he reacts precisely in the way that I would if I got beckoned by a child psychopath. I\'d just put in the bare minimum necessary to get the kid to shut up and ditch him when I get the first chance. Ordinarily, I\'d take umbrage with Claude\'s lack of charm or charisma. However, that would imply that all demons in the Black Butler universe are exactly like Sebastian. Is it that much of a stretch to assume that demons can have different personalities and aesthetics? Plus, Jason Douglas does a fantastic job voicing him, so I can\'t find myself being too hard on him.What baffled me when I was watching this was how I saw so many comments on KissAnime deriding Claude for not caring about Alois, but I feel like we\'re missing out on one crucial detail here: Claude is an expletive demon! His only vested interest is in Alois\'s soul, not Alois himself. That\'s also the reason why Sebastian went through so much trouble to reclaim Ciel after Claude kidnaps him! This utterly stupid fandom seems to forget that demons view humans as food and nothing more. Sebastian and Claude didn\'t fight for Ciel\'s love; they were effectively fighting over who gets the last slice of pizza! The only reason why Sebastian ever act in a remotely paternal manner to Ciel in the first place was due to Sebastian\'s dedication to the butler aesthetic. Claude had no such commitment to any aesthetic, so it makes sense that he\'d act in a vein similar to other demons.I\'ve seen other reviews of this show saying that they liked how it cut back on the gag comedy that plagued the first season. What\'s more, those same reviews praised this season for being darker and taking risks that the first season didn\'t. Like I said in my analysis of the first season: it\'s pretty fucking dangerous to romanticise risk-taking. Why? Because it leads to people accepting abject rubbish as genuine quality when all it\'s doing is being edgy for edginess\'s sake without any care for storytelling or characterisation. To be fair here, it\'s not like the manga was devoid of edge, but there\'s an obvious distinction to be made here.Whenever we get a look back at Ciel\'s time with the cult shortly after Vincent and Rachel Phantomhive get murdered, the manga treats these moments with absolute seriousness. Sebastian even says that Ciel was calling out for help ""in sorrow, in anger, in despair, and terror"" and that ""he spits out curses that fall like flames from his tongue."" We don\'t see Sebastian as a knight in shining armour rescuing his uke like so many awful drawings on DeviantART, Tumblr, and Pixiv make him out to be. Instead, we get a picture of a predator masking his prey drive with a Faustian contract. Sebastian does save Ciel from the cult, but not without reminding him that his soul is forfeit when the time comes. If Ciel ever has a traumatic flashback to the cult, Sebastian comforts him just enough to bring him back to sanity (or he\'ll opt to scare him out of it in the recent chapters). It\'s not because of any vested interest in Ciel beyond the contract. It never was, and it never will be.If Black Butler II were to recreate this type of scene, it would instead feature Alois crying out for Claude never to abandon him while he\'s wearing boa, hot pants, and no shirt. Oh and don\'t forget to throw in some flashbacks of Alois\'s hilariously oppressive past to garner more sympathy and some shots of Hannah staring at him wistfully while the triplets stand there doing nothing. If it still seems a little too sterile for you, why not throw in some shots of the old Earl Trancy and his harem of underage boys along with Alois\'s quest to usurp the Earl? That\'ll surely make the audience root for Alois. You might think I\'m exaggerating here, but that\'s literally how all of these ""dark"" moments play out in the context of the show.Moving away from all that ranting about the story and Alois\'s numerous transgressions, let\'s talk about the other characters. While Ciel and Sebastian make a return in this season, their involvement in this season feels forced beyond all belief. All our beloved Bassy wants to do is eat his dinner in peace, but A-1 Pictures couldn\'t even afford him that luxury. Still, there was a part of me that was happy to hear Brina Palencia say ""This is an order!"" only for J. Michael Tatum to follow it up by saying ""Yes, my lord."" Given that, I guess that\'s one positive point in this show\'s favour.Unfortunately, that positive is immediately followed up by another negative in that the remainder of the returning cast has absolutely no purpose whatsoever. Lau even makes a return despite visibly dying toward the end of the first season, so it\'s not like A-1 Pictures even cared about consistency. Perhaps most insulting is how Fred Abberline now has a twin brother... who looks and behaves precisely as Fred does in the manga, right down to the moustache. Mind you, Episode 20 of the first season explicitly stated that Fred lost his entire family when he was young. Where was the twin all this time? Directly from some coked-up executive\'s anus, perhaps. I think the best part about the twin is that he completely undermines Fred sacrificing his life to save Ciel from impending danger. Thank you, A-1 Pictures for completely ruining one of the few poignant scenes from the first season. We don\'t need compelling narratives involving characters we care about; we want more BL fan service! But, I digress because I\'ve been blathering far too long about this. Let\'s take a look at some of the more superficial aspects of this show. Maybe then, I won\'t have so much venom to spare.Due to the shorter season, there was a much higher animation budget which pays off quite well this time around. There\'s much more action in this season which admittedly is a refreshing change of pace considering how slow the first season was. Even more surprising is how fluid these action scenes are. It was quite a marvellous sight to witness Sebastian throwing tableware at random goons in the first season, but now we get full-on brawls between Sebastian and Claude.Still, there are quite a few inconsistencies with the animation that isn\'t as apparent in the first season. The CG horse carriages returned, as did the CG teapots. What\'s more, they\'ve come back in droves. Let\'s play a drinking game: take a shot every time you see some conspicuous CG in the show. The first one to die of cirrhosis won\'t have to suffer for the rest of the show\'s run. Thankfully, that\'s the worst I have to say about the animation. There aren\'t any instances of the animators going off-model that I could make out while watching the show, so that\'s a plus.Unfortunately, the audio has taken somewhat of a downgrade from the first season. There is no iconic song like ""Si Deus Me Relinquit"" from the first season in Black Butler II. The only iconic track from the OST in this season is the OP, ironically enough. ""Shiver"" by the Gazette is a decent song. It does pop up in my head every so often, but it\'s not the type of song I\'d actively seek. Still, upbeat J-Rock songs are always okay in my book. The dubbing this time around is also much more tolerable, though that could be due to the lack of exaggerated Cockney accents from the likes of the Phantomhive servants. I just wish that Funimation didn\'t waste Her Highness, Luci Christian\'s talents on such an awful character, but that\'s a comparatively minor gripe in the scheme of things.Now we get to my favourite part of this review: enjoyment. It should be apparent that I fucking hated watching this show. Even when I first watched it back in 2014, I didn\'t care too much for it. However, I wasn\'t quite able to vocalise how I felt because my thoughts were far too abstract for me to piece together. Coming back to Black Butler II six years later has given me the capacity to precisely vocalise the sheer contempt that I feel toward this failed abortion of a cash-grab sequel. Unfortunately, this came at the cost of my entertainment. To date, this is the only A-1 Pictures show I\'ve ever watched that I didn\'t enjoy in any capacity whatsoever. Not even in that ironic ""so bad it\'s good"" way.So many people say that this season had potential. Do not be fooled; there was never any potential to be had with this awful show. Its very premise relies on breaking an airtight conclusion from the previous season. Even worse, it amplifies all the worst aspects of the first season from the fan service to the sheer volume of uncomfortable BL subtext between Alois and Claude or Ciel and Sebastian. Hell, there are even some moments where A-1 Pictures tries to shoehorn some subtext between Ciel and Alois too. The only way Black Butler II could\'ve ever been good is if A-1 Pictures decided to adapt the Circus arc of the manga. We didn\'t even get that for a good four years after this travesty aired.The whole time I was watching this, I couldn\'t help but ask myself one question: ""why am I not watching Black Butler: Book of Circus?"" In so many ways, that is the superior sequel. I\'m not even trying to be a manga purist at this rate. I\'m all for a show deviating from its source material if the creators of the programme are willing to put in the effort to develop their stories and characters. However, A-1 Pictures had no intention whatsoever of giving us any of that. This show isn\'t an attempt at genuine quality; this is the finished product that we receive when coked-up executives try to cater to the lowest common denominator. That\'s pretty fucking insulting when you consider just how rich and deep the manga\'s lore is.While all of this drama was going on in the world of the anime, the manga was flourishing. Do you want to see Sebastian challenged in his duties as the Earl of Phantomhive\'s butler? You don\'t have to watch this season to witness Sebastian struggle. We get treated to countless moments where Sebastian isn\'t so peerless after all. He didn\'t even know how to treat Ciel\'s asthma when he had an attack during the Circus arc. Sebastian\'s superhuman endurance also gets pushed to its limits during the Luxury Liner arc as he tries to protect the young master from danger approaching him at all sides. All of this was happening during the time that Black Butler II was airing. Imagine being one of the poor sods who watched this season and came out of it pissed, instead of being one of the people who had the luxury of enjoying a proper story from start to finish.Should you watch this show? Absolutely fucking not. Even if you\'re sceptical of my praise to the manga, there are still other shows in this particular genre that are worth watching. Pandora Hearts started airing the year before Black Butler II came out and while I do have my grievances with the series as a whole, it\'s a far more satisfying experience from start to finish than Black Butler II is. Alternatively, you can turn to Karneval and get a similarly brief show that makes some modicum of sense. In a landscape where shows of genuine quality exist, there is no reason whatsoever as to why you should give this season a chance.Finally, I have a little message I want to give to this incredibly bizarre fandom that I begrudgingly associate with due to my love of the series as a whole. If you thoroughly enjoyed Black Butler II, if you liked Alois, Claude, Hannah, or any of the other characters that this show introduced, or what have you: that is 100% okay. However, you should do us all a favour and not conflate your sense of enjoyment with actual quality. While it is true that anime is an art form, there is a baseline for what does and doesn\'t work within the context of a particular show. Black Butler II has so many holes in its writing that it plugs with fan service to the point where people have gone out of their way to write fan fiction, not to mention the full-on roleplays on websites like Tumblr. I can\'t even begin to fathom why anyone would even bother with that. It\'s not the duty of us as fans to fix the mistakes that the writers made. Your headcanon won\'t change the fact that this show sucked so hard that you had to resort to making headcanons in the first place. Similarly, you may be able to roleplay as Hannah or Alois without making either character insufferable; even so, that won\'t change the fact that their characterisations were so mind-numbingly awful in the show itself.Black Butler II is a blight upon the franchise and isn\'t worthy of the Phantomhive name whatsoever. Not even those admittedly hilarious bloopers or the OVAs can justify this abomination\'s existence. If you don\'t opt to heed my warnings, don\'t be surprised if you come out just as crestfallen as I am. good in an extremely controversial second season. Even so, some would argue that this show\'s transgressions are so unforgivable that what little good this season accomplished would never be enough to justify all the nonsense viewers have to endure. I am one of those people.My initial impressions of Black Butler II were not positive when I first watched it. Even if I try my damndest to forgive the show for its many transgressions, I can\'t find myself feeling anything except visceral disgust. Do not be fooled; there is no merit to be found here in Black Butler II. What little good that it manages to accomplish boils down to mere coincidence and aesthetics rather than any sincere attempt at telling a coherent story involving characters who have compelling narratives. I\'d even go so far as to say that this show is the perfect example of a ""cash grab sequel"" considering how much shit the viewer has to wade through before finding anything remotely close to what the first season had to offer.That\'s something I\'d never imagine myself saying, much less in a long-form review. Though the 2008 anime is flawed to high heaven, I can at least respect the fact that it tried to branch out into newer concepts. While its ending wasn\'t satisfying for me, it felt like an airtight conclusion to the Faustian tragedy about a victim of circumstance and his pursuit for revenge. It\'s common knowledge by now that the 2008 anime ended with Sebastian about to devour Ciel\'s soul, how the fuck can anyone make a sequel to that? Unfortunately, I can\'t go into too much detail about that due to spoilers, but I will say this: the explanation feels like it was ripped straight from the depths of some shitty headcanon on Tumblr or FanFiction.net than Yana Toboso\'s mind.While it was challenging to try and find anything about this show\'s marketing, the general assumption that one could make at the time its pilot aired was that this show would be about a new young master and a new demon butler. Of course, we all know that setup was a fake-out as the real story this season has to offer is a battle between old and new. The new young master Alois and his demonic servant in Claude are now locked in a struggle with Ciel and Sebastian as we watch this marvellous chess game unfold in real-time. At least, that\'s the best way that I can try to describe this sad facsimile of a plot positively.The thing is that Black Butler II tries to set itself up as this grand battle of wits between eerily similar nobles where we can see just how far Ciel could have fallen were it not for the way his circumstances played out. It doesn\'t achieve that effect whatsoever and instead plays out more like a sadistic child psychopath bitching about why everyone hates him. Ciel wasn\'t the epitome of characterisation in the 2008 anime. However, it was still relatively easy to root for him considering how Ciel still had his moments of humanity shown (i.e. his affection for Lizzie, his acceptance of Soma and Agni, his bond with the servants of Phantomhive, etc.).I want to give Alois the benefit of the doubt because I get no joy out of hating him. However, I cannot tolerate his presence on the screen for more than mere minutes at a time and no amount of great voice acting from the likes of Her Highness, Luci Christian can ever change that. Alois is quite literally Ciel if he had no redeeming qualities whatsoever and any attempt this show makes to paint Alois in a sympathetic light falls flat on its face when you take his actions during the anime into account. How the fuck can I feel any modicum of sympathy for a child who gouges out his maid\'s eye for a simple mistake?What\'s more, is that the anime tries so… fucking… HARD to make the audience feel sympathy for Alois to the point where it just comes across as fucking stupid rather than compelling. I don\'t give a shit how tragic your character\'s backstory is; sympathy is earned rather than given. Ciel\'s actions in the anime and manga are indeed morally questionable at times. Again - he\'s still got those crucial moments where you can look past his Bruce Wayne facade and see a child who\'s ultimately a victim of circumstance. You want me to see the light in Alois? How about you portray him as something other than a sadistic, psychotic child with the telltale signs of histrionic personality disorder in the present day and present time?I don\'t give a rat\'s ass if Alois was abused and defiled like Ciel nor do I give a shit about his background as some impoverished child; shitty people, in general, don\'t deserve our sympathy. Alois\'s entire motive boils down to an obsession with what Ciel has that he doesn\'t have. Indeed, this feud between Ciel and Alois gets even more ridiculous when Claude decides to take an interest in Ciel after tasting his blood. Get this: Alois is such an irksome shitstain that his demonic servant who is contractually obligated to serve him leaves for the superior protagonist. That\'s how you know you\'re an utter failure as a person.There is an argument that I\'ve seen some people make that Alois was an excellent villain specifically because he got you to hate him and in a vacuum, I can understand that logic. The problem with this train of thought is that merely hating a villain doesn\'t automatically make them compelling. Wrestling heels evoke the ire of the audience on purpose, but there\'s a clear distinction between a heel like Randy Orton and a heel like X-Pac. Hell, I\'d wager that Alois isn\'t even in the same league as X-Pac. He\'s more like Roman Reigns in that the larger audience hates him and yet A-1 Pictures decides to pull a Vince McMahon and continue pushing Alois despite the sheer volume of disapproval.What makes all of this even more disgusting is how far A-1 Pictures tries to go with its pandering. I stated before that I\'m grateful for Yana Toboso deciding against making Black Butler into a BL manga. Now, we get into the part of this review that goes into great lengths about why. The fan service in Black Butler was uncomfortable, but it never got downright nauseating like its cash-grab sequel does. Hell, put the two shows side by side, and you can make an argument that the first season was tasteful with how it handled its fan service. Again, that\'s a statement I never thought I\'d say out loud, but here we are.Alois\'s backstory involves him getting exploited sexually by the former Earl Trancy. If you think that\'s bad enough, we get treated to several flashback scenes where we see Alois seducing him in excruciating detail right down to the ugly bastard sucking his toes. We get treated to countless views of Sebastian pandering to Grell\'s lust for him by striking poses while she takes photos of him beating up the bishonen triplets.

Why? Because he reacts precisely in the way that I would if I got beckoned by a child psychopath. I\'d just put in the bare minimum necessary to get the kid to shut up and ditch him when I get the first chance. Ordinarily, I\'d take umbrage with Claude\'s lack of charm or charisma. However, that would imply that all demons in the Black Butler universe are exactly like Sebastian. Is it that much of a stretch to assume that demons can have different personalities and aesthetics?

There will be lots of spoilersUnlike the original series, there is ALOT more ambiguous yaoi material. The farther off the anime goes from the manga, the more ambiguous yaoi material. Thankfully, Sebastion and Ciel aren\'t responsible for this, its the two new characters, Alois and Claude.Alois has a pretty dark past, and its much nastier than Ciel\'s. Also, especially after certain incidents, Claude...the best way to say this is that Sebastian...has more honor than Claude will ever have.But the most horrible thing about the second season was the extreme yaoi concerning Alois\'s past as well as Claude himself. It hurt to get past that crap and those scenes were easily the worst I\'ve ever seen. If you don\'t like yaoi, you might need to get used to skipping aheadCharacter-7The household staff and other minor characters don\'t show much at all after episode 6.

The story reason for his reappearances is for Sebastian to use him, but its probably because theres no room for comedy by the main characters, Grell must contain it all.

No logic at all.All the main characters are well-developed, and I have to admit, Ciel and Seb haven\'t changed too much from their original anime counterparts. But if you do anything, do not jump to conclusions.\\. But, as with the predeccessor, I strongly dislike when they try to speak in English. I know, its awesome how they are trying to be authentic and all, but it sounds horrible. I am compelled to throw up every time I hear ""Your highness"" or ""Yes my lord"". I know its unfair to criticize japanese voice actors for their English, but its one of the pet peeves of the show.StoryYou know the feeling of when you see a movie adaption of your favorite book, and its really good until they forgot one major detail or skipped over something that you were looking forward too, and then you get extremely pissed and temporarily detest the movie?  That\'s what happened here.I have to admit, the show has quite a lot of almost-random twists, which is what Kuroshitsuji the anime is known for.Ciel probably wouldn\'t be able to get a better ending, but the problem here is that the ending isn\'t balanced.The protagonists (or anti-heros) are supposed to BOTH have satisfying endings, not just one. I know this isn\'t easy for this show, but this season is cruel towards Sebastian. Sebastian can\'t have Ciel\'s soul, despite all the effort of having protected it from everything thats happened (Seriously think about that for a second), only to find out it was all for nothing, and is stuck in a contract with a another demon FOREVER, and can\'t have the world\'s most delicious soul, let alone any.I I have to admit, the first half of the last episode was spetacularous (made that word up) but I\'m in shock. When I first started the season, I thought there would be no way to get further out of the manga\'s reach. I WAS WRONG. All, I MEAN ALL, of the characters besides Sebby and Ciel are more or less deleted from the anime, because they all think Ciel\'s dead. Even the basic idea of Kuroshitsuji *A kid is in a contract with a demon to do whatever he pleases in exchange for the kid\'s soul* has been erased. Only Sebby and Ciel left, and I have no idea whats in the next season at all.If the Kuroshitsuji 2 ended with Ciel\'s awakening as a demon, and let the beginning of season 3 be the last half, I would have been more satisfied.But despite everything, I still anticipated every week\'s episode, and have rated this a 7.  The first five episodes are more focused on the Sherlock Holmes aspect of the original kuroshitsuji, but only after does the show go wild. But thank god, theres NO FILLER. Maybe because of the fact the season is only 12 episodes, but I digress.And the funny thing is that in the first five episodes, they constantly refer to Claude, but his role in the events of the first five episodes IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND IS NEVER MENTIONED AFTER THOSE EPISODES. Why include him at all then in the beginning?Enjoyment-7This depends if you\'ve got a strong stomach and how much you like the fanservice directed to the girls. Yes, its a lot more present then in the first series, but the plot is amazing. It isn\'t Yona\'s style of story after the first five episodes, but that isn\'t a bad thing concerning how good the story is. There are probably plot holes towards the end, but that was the same as the first season. Its definitely worth watching, but the conclusion is going to slightly spoil your feelings toward it.  I don\'t recommend this to any newcomers to anime. But if you liked the first anime series, go ahead and enjoy. If you loved the manga, don\'t come here hoping for the Circus arc. It isn\'t here, and trying to watch this will probably get you mad.Note: For those reading this, please click ""Helpful"" or ""Not Helpful"" according to your opinion. For those who do, thanks! :) has more honor than Claude will ever have.But the most horrible thing about the second season was the extreme yaoi concerning Alois\'s past as well as Claude himself. It hurt to get past that crap and those scenes were easily the worst I\'ve ever seen. If you don\'t like yaoi, you might need to get used to skipping aheadCharacter-7The household staff and other minor characters don\'t show much at all after episode 6.

That being said, I did enjoy it, but there are definitely problems.Story-3The ending of season one was one of the best endings and needed no continuation. But I would be lying if I said I was not excited for another season. We get more mystery, more demons and just more Black Butler. The plot had an interesting premise even if it seemed like something you could find on fanficiton.net.  But the story was done very poorly, hence the score I gave it. It has too many plot holes and even...more unexplained moments. If you don't mind these things and don't question and look to closely, this shouldn't matter. I did enjoy the parallels between both the demons and their contractors, and it shows how people can react different in similar situations. It was also interesting to see how someone else interacted with a demon and why the made a contract.Art-7The art is the same as season one and looks very nice. The animation is fine, though there are a few mistakes, nothing major, and the new characters' art looks nice. Shout out to the both of the openings, both looking very nice. Nothing else much to say.Sound- 7The opening music is catchy and I didn't skip it once. While the music is all used at the appropriate times, they are for the most part forgettable.Character-6This was actually what carried the show for me, and the character that most fans seem to hate is my favorite this season, Alois. Ciel was a bit of a let down for me- basically all developing he went through was reset, and seems brattier than the first season.  Season 2 Ciel I still enjoyed, and he is the only other character I really cared for. Sebastian is very different from  season 1. In the first Black Butler fans can decide if Sebastian feels more for Ciel than just another meal-be it romantic or in platonic way. This is definitely answered in this season. Characters from season 1 show up for a small amount of time. The other demon butler we meet is Claude, and he is the most unlikable character in the show, that is all I have to say on it. Alois. So much hate. Many times there will be a horrible character, one who you hate, but is given a tragic past which to the writer means they have an excuse and is justified in their evil actions, which really they are not. I did not hate Alois like everyone did. Sure I found him a bit annoying, but actually very entertaining in his sadistic ways. And he doesn't actually do anything especially evil. He is given a sad past, and I thought it explained his actions and motives. This character does go through a bit development, and I don't mind what he does in the end. The rest of the new characters have nothing I particularly liked or disliked.Enjoyment-6Alois I found to be the most enjoying thing in this show, the for many it was the least likeable thing. I can understand why some may not like him, but I feel he gets more hate than deserved. The yaoi (BoyxBoy) undertones that are in the first season is definitely not an undertone in this one. Much of it is fan service, except with Alois.The humor in season 1 is less in season 2, and some of the times it showed up felt unnatural to the scene, but was still good. It was overall enjoyable, but some parts felt like a chore to watch.Should you watch it? If you liked Black Butler than yes. It isn't as good as the first, but if you enjoyed the first season, odds are you will find at least one thing you will like. It is not a must though, only if you really liked Black Butler. If you thought the first was okay, than just out it away for a rainy day to watch. more unexplained moments.

I choose to give it a chance so here is my review of Kuroshitsuji II.At first, we have the story (9) ! The episodes are only 12 so there aren't many fillers. Instead we have the story of Ciel's return and his clash with the house of Trancy. I was interested to see how Ciel escaped from what happened in Season 1 (which...was one of my favourite anime endings) and I liked the explanation. Well , to be honest the whole story had some holes but it has a nice pacing and great twists. It really has nothing to do with the manga, but it's a nice what-if. A big what-if is also the ending of the series, which is so much ambiguous and it has the smell of a fan-fiction. It's an interesting one but I can't accept it as canon to Ciel's story !The art (10) is perfect, as it was in the first season. The whole Victorian scenery returns, with new places, like the Trancy's mansion, as beautiful as the old ones.As for the sound (10) , it's very interesting. They are giving the same operatic vibes with the first season's soundtrack. My favourite tracks were Dance macabre and The butler of Trancy's. The opening , Shiver from the GazettE , is as epic as Monochrome no kiss and it has two versions , much like the first season's , one for Alois and one for Ciel. There are two endings also for each one of these main characters.The characters (9) who had came back , like Ciel and Sebastian , are just as interesting as before. In this season , Sebastian returns with more concern and sympathy for Ciel and this time he has met his match in the face of Claude Faustus , the Trancy's butler , who becomes the antagonist of this series. For the new butler , there is a new master. The notorious Alois Trancy is the most interesting character of the season ... something like the dark alter ego of Ciel. Meanwhile , Ciel Phantomhive struggles to regain his memories and learn his destiny.Finally , it was a fun to watch series , which served good as a sequel and a conclusion to the story. As I said before , I liked the series' ending but I can't say that it's canon.

What it does have however is the plot and villains the first season needed to be great – characters that are truly evil and can truly pose a competition to the Sebastian and Ciel.Alois is possibly the perfect villain for Ciel....Both are two children who have gone through the same harrowing experience and emerging both twisted, but very different in their overall attitude to the people that surround them. While not necessarily the best bad guy ever written, he certainly stands head and shoulders above the underwhelming angelic villains of the first season, and Alois’ backstory is expanded upon so as to provide a convincing justification for the conflict between himself and Ciel, who has not lost his loveable but merciless spark from the first season thankfully. Despite being much less suave, Alois’ butler Claude also acts as the perfect contrast to Sebastian, who like Ciel has not lost any of his mysterious and cheeky personality from season 1. Seeing our main characters being put in an uncomfortable new season is exactly what I would have asked for from the second season. Sebastian in particular is pushed to his limit, and watching him fighting at his best is a very welcome change to the incredibly overpowered position he held in season 1.Plotwise, the frustrating cliffhanger ending to Black Butler 1 is tied up very nicely indeed, and the plot overall is pretty great, with an abundance of twists and turns that does not fail to maintain your interest throughout – the one-off story episodes that were the strength of the first season persist to a degree in the second season, but are now satisfyingly tied into the overarching storyline. It is important to take into account though that this season is much, MUCH darker and noticeably more violent than season 1 – definitely a good or a bad thing depending on your perspective, although I think it was much more fitting for the supernatural theme of the show. If you found yourself enjoying the later episodes of the first season, which took a gradually darker turn than the first half did, you should be giving season 2 a try.This season’s darker tone however means that the first season’s abundance of comic relief is conspicuously absent. While the comedy was placed very well in season 1, it would not have been welcome at all in the shorter and more focused plot of season 2. As a result, perhaps the greatest strength of this season is that it is 12 episodes long compared to 25, reducing the requirement for filler episodes of the first season (curry competition arc anyone?). That is not to say though that this season has no sense of humour at all, far from it. The comedy of the show remains strong when it is included, and at the start the show nearly breaks the fourth wall in some of its more teasing and light-hearted moments - all very enjoyable stuff, and an opportunity to bring back the fun characters from season 1. The ridiculous romance of the master-butler relationships portrayed in the anime forms its own form of comedy as well, if you don’t take it too seriously.Animation for season 2 is, as you would expect, improved, particularly in the fight scenes, which are now beautifully choreographed (thanks largely to the addition of another butler on Sebastian’s level for him to compete with). Sebastian no longer glides through the air repetitively, he weaves and dodges and is pushed to a degree he never was in season 1, making fight scenes a joy rather than a chore to watch. The bloodiness of some fights certainly caught me off guard, season 2 definitely makes the best of its boosted age rating.By contrast with the improved animation, this season’s music is perhaps slightly weaker, largely down simply to the excellent music the first season had. Despite being half the length, the series does has one op and two eds, just as Black Butler did. By no means did I desperately feel the need to skip them, but at the same time they never hyped me up in the same way season 1’s soundtrack did. The use of two different opening animations to indicate whether the episode focuses on Ciel or Alois was a very nice touch though, extra effort that wasn’t necessary but does well to set the theme of an episode.Before I end this review, I want to point out how accompanying the violence, the fan service side has been noticeably toned up as well, in both the yaoi sense Black Butler is known for, and surprisingly the more traditional sense designed to appeal to male viewers. Some of this is easily ignored if not your sort of thing, although it does detract from the plot (there is still a strange insistence on lines such as: ‘I will pierce your soul with my needle’. See this as you see fit…). If anything, some of the ‘fanservice’ doesn’t really deserve the title of fanservice. It’s more vulgar than that, and is often used as a case to put on display just how twisted and exploitative Alois is, reinforcing his position as the antithesis to Ciel’s more refined character.Overall, the show is a much more mature take on the overall Black Butler concept, an attitude which the writers hinted at but overall decided to avoid in the first season of Black Butler (both have their strengths and weakness in this way). This I understand disappointed some fans immensely, including myself at first. However, this take on Black Butler definitely holds its own ground and for that reason I feel it’s fair to give an equal score to this season as I did the last season. Black Butler II uses the themes and characters introduced in season 1, but puts them in a different situation. The enjoyment to be gained out of this season is watching the characters we know and love adapting to the challenges of their new environment, and they perform an admirable job in doing so.Stop here if you don’t want mild spoilers about the ending…As an aside, Black Butler’s ending was certainly not entirely satisfying, I see it though as inevitable that the ending to a story about the relationship between a demon and his prey wouldn’t be very uplifting. If you have seen Madoka Magica’s ending, it’s the same bittersweet disappointment that leaves you not wholly satisfied, but feeling that this was the way the story was meant to end. Both are two children who have gone through the same harrowing experience and emerging both twisted, but very different in their overall attitude to the people that surround them.

Let me tell you it was messed up, at the beginning. Two words for you. No joke. I don\'t even know how they thought of all this plot, but it was so weird and strange and random and unreal and not following the original story at all! They practically turned it into a fanservice giving perverted anime that knows no tomorrow, unless if you\'re...a Ciel x Sebby BL fangirl like me, then you\'ll probably enjoy it. Seriously.Okay, other than the fanservice and BL, it was nothing, nothing that the general audience would probably appreciate. Everything was random, off the charts, total wacko if I do say so myself. Not something you would want to watch unless you\'re an insane madman...who\'s just really perverted...or if you\'re a devoted Kuro fan. Trust me there were lots of those perverted times, enough that you could tag it as ""ecchi.""At least the ending was good. That was probably the best part of Kuroshitsuji! I enjoyed it thoroughly, which is what made me change the score I gave Kuro II.Be warned that Kuroshitsuji season two can be described as a chaos of horror, gore, pain, lust, and whatever is in between, if there is even indeed anything left at all between those cracks of inhumanity. However at the end, they prove to explain some of the plot they\'ve twisted, so it makes matters better.So I won\'t suggest you to watch it. Unless, you are like me, a devoted fan of Kuroshitsuji who just needs to know what happened at the end, when they end it all, or if you are into blood or lust or BL. Watching this has indeed become a pain at the beginning, somewhat, but eventually at the end of the episode you wonder so badly what\'s going to happen next, what twisted adventure they will have, what kind of gruesome ""dance"" they will perform next, and what kind of showdown they will have that will devour everything and all the souls of all the people...Art and sound were definitely out of the ordinary, not in a bad way. The animation was stunning, as was the sound, a very nice quality.Definitely one of the most craziest animes that I\'ve watched, since they\'ve mixed up the plot so much and created random scenarios with random new characters, but of course, we\'re all just watching this for the hot butlers and action scenes between them, speaking of which have very brilliant butlers within themselves, like for example the triplet demons.It blew my mind away, especially in the end, where it ends off nicely, but I won\'t tell you what happened. You\'ll just have to watch it yourself if you\'re interested enough.Conclusion: Okay, to sum it all up, for a BL fan, you\'ll probably enjoy this, as they give lots of ""hints"" of pairings. But if you\'re not and you don\'t like BL, then you probably will find this disgusting, so don\'t watch it. But if you like gore and lust and the like, then you should consider watching this, even more so if you\'re a Kuro fan. The plot is very twisted and weird, but at least they have awesome art and music, and at the end they even explain everything, finishing off with a nice touch of a sort of ""cliff hanger"" kind of ending. a Ciel x Sebby BL fangirl like me, then you\'ll probably enjoy it. Seriously.Okay, other than the fanservice and BL, it was nothing, nothing that the general audience would probably appreciate. Everything was random, off the charts, total wacko if I do say so myself.

Give them a sequel, of course!Kuroshitsuji II introduces new and fairly interesting characters: Alois Trancy, a sadistic and bipolar fourteen-year-old who you will either love or hate, no in between. Claude Faustus, the butler of said boy, who gets a lot of hate from fans through the season for just, you know, being a demon and wanting to eat human souls and such. The triplets, who do not speak a word but still manage...to be cute. And, of course, Hannah, who we will classify as ""just a maid"" in order to avoid spoilers.Well, first things first: the producers present you with an interesting story. We are reminded that Ciel is not the first and certainly not the last boy to have contracted a demon, by introducing us to Alois and his troubled past. Then, we get to see the differences between the two of them and stand by while it slowly morphs into a rivalry, which is what everyone wants to see, of course. It makes you question how much can a simple human change a demon and how much a demon can change a simple human.Art is as beautiful as ever, only failing in one or two episodes, but noticeable enough for fans to care. They manage to get the whole ""18th century"" atmosphere, though in this season we rarely see anyone who\'s not on the main five: Ciel, Sebastian, Alois, Claude and Hannah. Elizabeth and the servants have been relegated to extras and only appear to save/help the plot.The seiyuus do a great job capturing each character\'s personalities and transforming them into a single voice. I specially liked the fact that you could sense Alois\'s constant struggle with himself and his own personality only through his laugh — that was quite creepy, may I add. The Opening got me singing aloud but the Ending was just too slow for me, though I didn\'t ""dislike"" it.Do I even have to talk about characters here? The old ones I still loved. The new ones I learned to like and eventually love some of them. Ah, that\'s a warning: you ARE going to hate at least one character by the time you reach the end of Kuroshitsuji II. Maybe the one you\'ve hated through the whole season or maybe the one you though was going to be your favorite when it all started. Either way, you will have conflicting feelings.""So, you\'re saying Kuroshitsuji II had an interesting story, good art and sound and great characters; why are you rating it with a six?""

After having seen the first season and not read the manga, I wasn't really sure about what they would do since I had heard that it didn't follow the path of the manga (characters like Pluto and the angels were only in the anime). Since the story had sort of gone along the lines of a gothic Scooby-Doo (and I say that in every positive way possible, because I ADORED season one), I was curious about the new material the writers had...come up with.I wasn't even a little disappointed. Kuroshitsuji II was absolutely stunning, just as good as the first season, the addition of Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus helping in that aspect. It was a lot more of a story than season one, instead of various crimes/mysteries for Ciel and his demon-butler Sebastian to solve.As for the opening theme: Shiver by The GazettE is an AMAZING song, one of my favorites, and the two different animations for it, one for a Ciel-centric episode, and one for an Alois-centric one, really had a positive effect on the enjoyment of that first 2 minutes of each episode, something I normally skip.Alois and Claude were quite the characters. I extremely enjoyed their anti-Ciel and Sebastian mannerisms, like Alois' outward sadism and affinity for causing trouble, and Claude's never smiling but flashily getting the job done ways; it was a change I was very open to. As soon as I saw Alois gouge out Hannah's left eye with an insane grin on his face, and Claude do a tap-dance performance and throw the tablecloth into the air as he flawlessly set the table for dinner without batting an eyelash, I knew these weren't just your run-of-the-mill filler characters to mercilessly bash to my hearts content. They were the real deal.I won't say anything further (so as to not accidentally release some spoilers), but I highly recommend this anime to anyone who enjoys amazing visual and audio aesthetics, an excellent story, and deep characters with fantastic histories. come up with.I wasn't even a little disappointed.

After the first few minutes however we finally get to see Sebastian and then eventually Ciel, which leaves us with a thousand and one question….’what the hell happened at the end of Season 1??’However these questions and more are eventually answered.Ending: 8I found the ending of S2 to be a lot better than that of S1, were S1 leaves us asking ‘WHAT THE HELL...JUST HAPPENED!!’ S2 is a solid and conclusive ending yet also has possibilities of opening it up for a Season 3. If they did make a season 3 I reckon it would me majorly epic due to the final events of S2.Solid Plot: 8With 12 episodes only it would be hard if the plot wasn’t solid. Black butler S2 basically follows the 2 ‘Masters’ on the brand new quests for revenge, but Ciel already got his revenge…….or did he? The plot does not waver too much and stays on course for most of the 12 episodes; except for when the mission for the queen except even they are related in some way.. Also in season 2 the plot is a lot more solid as he doesn’t take up that many missions any more from his majesty the Queen.And lastly there are also the plot twists that I don’t think anyone including myself ever saw coming, so that was a good new addition to the plot of Black butler S2.Moral: 0I honestly do find the moral of any anime should be one of its high points; one of the main criteria’s to be essentially ranked any judged after finishing an anime or on the completion of reading a manga. We see how important it was to the Second Season of Black Butler as Black Butler S2 did not have one, they focused too much on action scenes, fighting scenes and comedic scenes that I failed to see any real moral to this story. There were no themes such as forgiveness as the whole anime was basically about deception. Due to this and the fact it clearly did not want to teach its audience anything, it did not want to leave the audience with a scene of ‘enlightenment’ it scores a perfect 0.Sense: 5Oh where do I begin with the sense of this anime, even though our questions are answered and the answers do make sense, the answers also sometimes bring arise to new and more questions which then don’t make any sense. It also stays too much to its clichéd butler choice of weaponry being a knife and fork. And then there’s the fact that getting skewered in the head won’t kill you…..but hey you’re a demon so whatever.And then there are the first 5 episodes which are just in some scenes make absolutely no sense at all, for example one scene where Claud throws a table into the air and is able to set the table with dress cloths plates knifes, spoons and forks etc. whilst the table is still into the air and then when the table hits the floor everything is glistening clean and the table is set……yer I call BS.Music: 8Not a lot changed with the music from Black Butler S1 to S2 except for the opening and endings and I actually liked the opening and ending of S2 better than that of S1. The music was very complimentary to the mood of the scene, the pitch and tone would rise and fall depending on the pace of the scene which was very nice to see.Art: 8Also the same as S1 of Black Butler, that being I really liked it. The characters where drawn exceptionally well and so were all the different types of scenery. Also things like water and fire where drawn really well.Characters: 6For some reason the characters of Season 2 felt duller than that of Season 1, like they were missing their backbone, they just didn’t have that essence that a character needed. Everyone just felt too comedic like everything was a joke; even Ceal has a sense of comedy to him. But the thing I hated most was how much Sebastian and Claud looked alike. In some scenes I didn’t know if it was Sebastian or Claud until somebody addressed them. Also we didn’t get that much of a back story on each of the new characters from season 2 like we did in season 1. There was also no ‘Old’ Tanaka and ‘New’ Tanaka had a screen time of like 30 seconds. (Tanaka was basically my favorite of the servants)And then the uncharacteristically behavior of a demon who fell in a love with a child she knew for like 20 seconds because he said thank you to the demon before she consumed his soul.Boredom/Captivation Scale: 7Due to the fact that the anime was jam packed with both comedic and action scenes I rarely felt bored and for the most part I quite enjoyed watching it.Personal Score: 5The biggest let down of Black Butler Season 2 in my own opinion were the characters, even though there was no moral and that got a 0 the characters just didn’t do it for me. Not only where the uncharacteristic there was also the problem of two butlers looking exactly the same. Then the was the obvious problem with it having no moral and basically saying that it doesn’t want to teach its audience anything, and lastly there was the sense of the anime which was just pure average, because at times it made sense and then and times in made utter nonsense.However I won’t say I hated the anime yet I obviously didn’t love it. I simply enjoyed it, it was 4 hours of my day that I don’t feel I wasted, however if it was 24 episodes then that would be a different story entirely and instead of getting an average of 6 I probably would have given it a 1.Lastly would I recommend this anime: if you watched season 1 then yes watch season 2 to answer the questions who had from season 1, however if you haven’t watched season 1……..then don’t watch this anime, because combining season 1 and 2 then I feel this anime would be a waste of time because season 2 doesn’t completely do season 1 justiceGenresComedy: 8For 12 episodes and only 4 hours I found that were a lot of comedic references in  Season 2 of Black Butler which made it quite enjoying to watch.Action: 8When there where action scenes they were always over the top and exuberant, with maids pulling tommy guns out of dresses and butlers skewering three enemies at the same time, really a nice watch.Mystery: 7Well nobody saw that ending coming that’s for sure and just because of that I gave it a 7. There were also quite a lot of other plot twists and mysteries a lot of which you won’t see coming and other are just clear as day JUST HAPPENED!!’ S2 is a solid and conclusive ending yet also has possibilities of opening it up for a Season 3.

I won\'t judge it based on the fact that it did not follow the manga, therefore you might think I\'m giving it a high score. You should also note that this is one of my first reviews, so please bear with me..)Kuroshitsuji, the first season, is an anime that I always felt, while good, was over-hyped and overrated. Overall it was a good series, but nothing really stuck with me after seeing the last episode. The sequel, Kuroshitsuji II, on the other hand, is a completely different story.The sequel to the borderline BL anime is both...different and similar to the first season; it still follows the contract between Ciel, a 12 year old boy who lost his parents at a young age, and Sebastian, a demon. The characters from the first season are all there, hell even Soma and Agni makes a few appearances. The thing that makes it so different though, is the new pair: Alois and Claude. These two characters are as different as can be; Alois is a sadistic 14 year old boy with a terrible past, Claude is a composed demon who appears to have no feelings at all. Claude is a lot more demon-ish than Sebastian, a lot more evil and plotting. The atmosphere this season is a lot more darker; the rating here on MAL even went up from PG-13 to R-17+.I won\'t say much about the plot as I feel it might spoil the series too much but I think it\'s a really good story although they should have given the season more episodes as it feels a little rushed towards the end.Story: 8/10The characters might just be my favorite part of the entire ""franchise"". It\'s easy to like them, it\'s easy to hate them. They\'re not all two dimensional characters with nothing but fancy hair or huge boobs (although the girls seem to be a little two dimensional). Alois, for one, is one of the most complex characters I\'ve ever seen. Some are in there only for comical relief as the season turn darker and darker (see: Grell and the Phantomhive servants). Still the characters are great. I can\'t tell you how many of them I have had on my ""favorite characters"" list since I watched the first season.Characters: 9/10The music is outstanding. Even if you don\'t like the anime, saying that the OST for this is horrible is just plain ignorance. You have The GazettE, Yuya Matsushita (a personal favorite of mine), and Kalafina. Taku Iwasaki, the guy in charge for the music, really did a good job.The voice actors are great too.Music: 10/10Ah, the animation.. What can I say? It\'s (I\'m getting tired of repeating this word now) great. It\'s not outstanding nor excellent, but it gets the job done and more.Art: 8/10My enjoyment for this series was amazing. True, it might be because it aired during the summer season and there wasn\'t really much good airing back then, but I still found myself counting down the days till the raws were out. And then cursing myself for watching the raws without understanding what was going on. Here\'s a tip: If you don\'t know a lot of Japanese, don\'t be an idiot like me and watch the raws before the subs. It could really ruin the experience. Still, I found myself watching the raws as the subs didn\'t come out for days. And as opposed to some other airing stuff I\'ve watched, it didn\'t ruin my enjoyment.Enjoyment: 10/10So, then, what do we have? A flop or a masterpiece? It\'s defiantly not a flop, anything with the name Kuroshitsuji could not be considered flop (at least for me). It\'s not a masterpiece either, though. The plot is rushed, characters seems to be brought back as fanserivce rather than for a real reason, it\'s terribly depressing if you find yourself loving some of the characters, and the season in general seems to be to either please fans (though it seemed to have the opposite effect for some) or milk the cash cow for all it\'s worth. But.. even so, I can\'t bring myself to hate it.Overall: 9/10Kuroshitsuji II is a big hit or miss. A lot of fans curse it for using no plot elements from the manga at all, other praise it for being original. And some just want nothing to do with it. For me this is one of the best animes of 2010, and I really wished more people would see past the cons and watch it as what it\'s supposed to be; entertainment. different and similar to the first season; it still follows the contract between Ciel, a 12 year old boy who lost his parents at a young age, and Sebastian, a demon.

It\'s defiantly not a flop, anything with the name Kuroshitsuji could not be considered flop (at least for me). It\'s not a masterpiece either, though. The plot is rushed, characters seems to be brought back as fanserivce rather than for a real reason, it\'s terribly depressing if you find yourself loving some of the characters, and the season in general seems to be to either please fans (though it seemed to have the opposite effect for some) or milk the cash cow for all it\'s worth. But.. even so, I can\'t bring myself to hate it.Overall: 9/10Kuroshitsuji II is a big hit or miss. A lot of fans curse it for using no plot elements from the manga at all, other praise it for being original. And some just want nothing to do with it. For me this is one of the best animes of 2010, and I really wished more people would see past the cons and watch it as what it\'s supposed to be; entertainment.', ""I'm going to be honest. I went into this season totally ready to hate it, but did find myself enjoying certain aspects of it. Does that make it actually good though? Not... really.The biggest problem with this season is also the most obvious one: it doesn't have any reason to exist. It follows after the first season of Black Butler, which itself had a very definitive ending, and the excuses they come up with to continue the story are weak and frankly ridiculous at times. They desperately try to bring back old characters that had their character arcs end long ago, and all of that...so they can come up with an ending that isn't nearly as satisfying as the original one.Even with that in mind, though, the story just doesn't make much sense when you get down to it. The narrative has a pretty big ego when it comes to disclosing important plot points, and often doesn't reveal them until a lot later than it should. Heck, there's a piece of information regarding how this story could happen in the first place that isn't revealed until episode 11, (and may I remind you, this season only has 12 episodes). I have a feeling they did this to make the narrative seem more interesting, but if you're going to tell your story like this, it should make more sense the more information you get. Here, it's surprisingly the other way around. This may be especially because the reasonings for a lot of the most important plot points are never properly explained, nor is it ever built up or foreshadowed that they are possible. (This gets especially jarring with the ending.) It also doesn't help that the first episode is immediately followed by two very blatant filler episodes that don't explain the plot at all, (although episode 3 was admittedly the highlight of the season to me).Other than that, this season introduces a new kid and a demon butler, the psychopathic brat Alois Trancy and the cold and uncaring demon Claude Faustus. These two characters are glorified way too much, to the point where they get more control over the plot than the original main characters, Ciel and Sebastian, almost like if this was a fanfiction where the writers inserted their own OCs, (which, in a way, it kind of is, considering that this season has nothing to do with the manga the series was originally based off of). Now, this wouldn't have bothered me if they truly took over the spot as the main characters, but they did not. The story still mostly focuses on Ciel and Sebastian, but neither of them get to be as interesting as in the last season, especially Ciel whose character development from the last season has almost entirely vanished by plot convenience.As for Alois and Claude themselves, I'm a bit conflicted. Alois is definetely a terrible person, but he is a bit interesting regardless, (which, to be fair, is rather similar to Ciel). It's clear he has been through some terrible things, and his motivations do become understandable as the story goes along. The problem, though, is that at no point is he really likable. Even in his backstory he's already a psycopath. I still did get somewhat invested in this character, and even sometimes felt sorry for him, which is more that I can say about Claude, who is definitely the blandest of the main characters. His personality is essentially a cheaper version of Sebastian, but less passionate about what he does, and his motivations are laughably simple. At one point in the story his motivation even changes at the flip of a coin and he breaks the rules simply because he wants to.With all of that said, though, there are a few things I like, as mentioned earlier. In my opinion there are three saving graces in this season.First off is the visuals. The animation and the artwork are a big step up from the previous season. With Book of Circus having come out afterwards, this is no longer the most beautiful Black Butler has ever looked, but it was for a while. All the environments are gorgeous to look at, and the action is more bad-ass than ever.Second is the voice acting. Obviously the voice actors from the first season do just as good of a job now as they did then, and still portray their characters perfectly. Maaya Sakamoto, the voice of Ciel, does an especially good job in the last three episodes, where a rather wide range is required from her, and she still pulls off her acting flawlessly. The new actors also do a very good job. Even though Alois is a psycopathig brat, his voice actress does a very good playing a psycopathic brat, and Claude's voice actor pulls off the demon butler part almost as good as Sebastian's voice actor does.Third is Grell. Just Grell. She is honestly becoming one of my favorite characters, she's just so much fun, and in this season she is being particularly delicious and her voice actor sounds like he is having so much fun doing the part. Even when the series was pissing me off, I couldn't help but smile anytime she showed up.So, in the end, there are a few things to enjoy about this season. If you want my honest recommendation, don't watch it, as it is mostly just a waste of time. But if you've seen everything else from the series and have a Black Butler-shaped hole in your heart you desperately need to fill, I guess this series is a harmless waste of time.The ending is very likely to piss you off, though. so they can come up with an ending that isn't nearly as satisfying as the original one.Even with that in mind, though, the story just doesn't make much sense when you get down to it.

They haven't gained any new character development as the season changed. The sad thing is that it almost appears that Alois is the one with the most character development, and he's not even a likable character through anything but pity over his constant rejections from Claude.The story was definitely...improved from the first season, although I am aware that the second season was an original plot that was not part of the manga. It had more depth (although sadly, as I mentioned, the characters failed to match the depth of the story itself) and was vastly entertaining.However, when problems with the first season were taken away, this season gained new problems.Season two was an explosion of fanservice, from Alois's implied sexual obsession to the obvious Sebastian x Ciel scenes. (I love Sebastian x Ciel, and I am aware it's still kind of obvious later, but this season seems to be something else.)And here's the other problem. Around halfway through the season, things started getting really confusing, and by the end things didn't make sense at all. After thinking things through repeatedly and re-watching a few episodes I understood what was going on, but it was still strange how things slowly began making no sense. Sebastian and Claude's quarrel messed things up because every aspect of it was constantly changing, Claude couldn't seem to decide what (or who) he wanted, and Alois was constantly having dramatically dangerous mood swings and also couldn't decide what or who he wanted.To be honest, season two was still a lot better than season one, and I'm glad I watched it.

But everything has its flaws."", 'I\'m really split after watching Kuroshitsuji/Black Butler II. After watching the first few episodes, I was really pleased with the story, not understanding how anyone could be unhappy with the sequel. But now, after watching all of it, I\'m not so sure...Lets get it straight, the art is just as perfectly beautiful as the original, the sound a little less interesting, yet fitting. All the technical stuff is just as the first season. But I am unhappy with the ending. My first thought after watching the last episode was: ""I wish I hadn\'t watched it"". Because as joyful as it was to get to...watch more of the anime, just as unsatisfied it left me feeling. When I had watched the first season, I was ecstatic. The ending had my heart racing. It was surprisingly creepy, exactly as I wanted it. I felt some kind of pleasant unease. But now, having watched season 2 as well, I don\'t even feel like watching more (In a bad way - I think a good anime should leave you hungering for more, yet without any unanswered questions). So I guess my advise is: If you are satisfied with the ending of the first season, don\'t watch the second. Let the satisfaction settle and be pleased with that ending. You can always watch the second season later. I\'m going to watch the last episode of season one again - maybe I\'ll forget the confusing sequel. watch more of the anime, just as unsatisfied it left me feeling.

I think it would've been a good anime if it wasn't Black Butler they were trying to sequel. They really should have let the series end where it did with season one. Straight forward, sad and LOGICAL. BBII made mad more times than I care to count, mainly because of how much I hated the new characters and how much they altered original characters. Ciel being the main altered personality. In season one he was a little reluctant to kill Queen Victoria. He knows killing isn't right and it bothers him a little. WELL NOT IN SEASON TWO. Now...*SPOILER* he willingly shoots some random guy in the face and stabs Alios. Poor character structure and poor plot line is what made me mad through out. Now, the ending. Oh the ending was... the worst ending ever. It put a bad name on endings and anime both. *SPOILER* I mean, how come the writers cannot just let Ciel die?! He is the one character that from the very begging is supposed to die at the end. But nope. He never does. It was possibly the worst anime I have ever watched. It took 3/4 of the series to get me interested. I wish I had never learned that there was a second season. *SPOILER* he willingly shoots some random guy in the face and stabs Alios.

The only reason I give it a bad review was because of personal reasons. I absolutely hated Alois Trancy who was a sick little kid with an angelic face that smiled when people died and Claude just because Sebastian's better. I personally thought the two of them were cheap imitations of Ciel and Sebastian. To anyone who wants to watch this feel free. The review is purely based off of my own feelings. I have known people who have liked Alois.Though I strongly suggest you read the manga instead. "", 'I watched this right after I watched Black Butler and I was very hyped up and am still pretty hyped up about this anime and so I will try to keep it unbiased as possible.Warning: There might be some Spoilers.First, I wanna say sooobaaaahhhraaahhhhshiiiiyaaa dis anime!I found out about this anime in an anime store in Taipei, Taiwan. I was looking at a small preview of Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus, and I thought it was very interesting and it caught my attention (With the gunfighting and the guy getting owned cuz his men got taken cared of and what not) so I stayed a little...whiles to find out what the anime was called and I found out it was Black Butler.When I returned home I journeyed upon my laptop to watch this Black Butler. What I found was a world of SUBARASHI! So after that I decided to wait for Kuroshitsuji: Book of Circus, which is when I realized, they already made a Black Butler II and that Book of Circus is simple the third series, and so I quickly rushed to anime1 and watched this whole series. This plot will take you on a journey of twists and turns when you least expect it.The Story:As noobie in the mystery industry, this story to me is pretty damn mind blowing and mind fuddling, that I didn\'t even understand what happened in the beginning. Later on as I watched on I came to understand what went on and in my mind all the mini cells that were working hard to understand finally started resting, but not for long. Anyways, unlike Black Butler, Kuroshitsuji II focuses on helping Ciel remember his revenge rather than achieving his revenge. All in all Ciel remembers his revenge and the nemesis dies! That\'s good right? NO! At least not good for Sebastian (Whom i deeply [no homo] love). This series is still pretty dark like Kuroshitsuji, it includes some themes of hope in a hopeless place as you can see with Alois Trancy as he forms the contract with Claude, although he had to go through some painful (ewwww) and sad obstacles to achieve it. In the end he loses his trust from everybody and no one likes him anymore, and in the middle of that hopelessness Hannah reaches out her hand to him reigniting the hope in a dark place theme again. The only people I guess who don\'t get hope in a bad situation are demons...The Art:With the art I find little faults with it, I guess you can hate the artist for Alois Trancy\'s Dad. I loved the opening theme song, especially the way how sebastian was walking towards Ciel in the beginning, that made me want to be a butler. Anyways I felt like the openings and endings were drawn out very well and excellently as I always watch the openings and most of the ending songs.The Sound:I love the theme songs, as well as the animation that goes along with it as I said above. SHIVER is just one of the best opening theme songs I\'ve heard in a while. I feel like the GazettE did a very good job in composing this song, as I feel like it fits with the animation and all. As for the sound effects, I can\'t find much flaws in it, they don\'t have any out of the ordinary awesome sound effects that add to the epic meter but it does it job just fine.The Characters:For the characters, well this series was much more detailed and more ""mixing"" with the characters. This time this series begins to fuddle with psychological trauma, and creepy scientist things. This time they involved much more of the love theme with Alois Trancy and his brother (the things they share in common are not really normal....). To make things brief, the character is very detailed and intricate (especially with Hannah feeling compassion for humans who viewed merely as snacks), I was very impressed when I watched this.My Enjoyment:Really?

Of course this is all unexplained, leaving the viewer in some confusion.As with the first Kuroshitsuji, this series is NOT CANON with the manga. If you read my review for the first Kuroshitsuji, you\'ll know that I gave the first one a lower score because the plot was lacking. Unfortunately, this is also true with the second Kuroshitsuji.Honestly, I didn\'t enjoy the characters or story line very much this time around. Many of the characters lack any development,...making them kind of bland and boring.The story line will keep you entertained just enough to get through the series, but leave you with an unsatisfying and possibly confused feeling.Again though, I may be biased in view because I read the much better quality manga first... making them kind of bland and boring.The story line will keep you entertained just enough to get through the series, but leave you with an unsatisfying and possibly confused feeling.Again though, I may be biased in view because I read the much better quality manga first...', ""This show is completely insane. At no point is it possible to discern why things are happening, what will happen next, or where the story will end up.I actually like it a lot.I am under the understanding that fans of Black Butler hated Black Butler II.

I was expecting the same joy and thrill of enjoyment in the second season as I did the original Black Butler, but oh boy, was I in for a surprise. While the first one was a pleasant watch for all viewers, the events and eye-twitching moments in the second season left me, as I'm sure it did most people, disappointed rather than pleased. To note, I watched Black Butler Season 2 about a year ago.Story (6)Unlike the eye catching first...season of mystery and darkness, the second season is full of events that leave the fans hating the characters that are introduced in the story. New characters Alois Trancy and Demon Butler Claude Faustus take the stage as the season's antagonists, and many times I felt like yelling at the TV screen to change the events of the story. It left me irritated, upset, and sometimes just plain bored. It's simple enough to say - there are many events in this that I wished were NOT canon, and you shouldn't take this season as seriously as the first one.If you're looking for the mystery elements, those are gone as well. Honestly, some things that happen in this anime, just... ughh.Art (10)The character design was just as flawless, the new demon Butler Claude Faustus as beautiful as demon enemy Sebastian Michaelis and Alois Trancy quite a stunning boy for his age. The animation is just as smooth as it was in the first season, despite some times it would fall just a slip out of line. For the most part, the graphics retained a beautiful appearance and wonderful theme, matching the Victorian London as well as it did in the first season.Sound (8)I found there to be a significant drop in the Victorian music in the second season of Black Butler, as well as entertaining sound effects. The quality of the sound dropped so much between the two I begin to wonder if the anime took place in Victorian London anymore (Not really). What had me so captivated in the first season was gone in the next one. Shame.Character (7)I'm not going to focus on Season 1 characters, since they make Black Butler as beautiful as it is. This focuses on Season 2 characters, who are incredibly dull and annoying at times, but often relatable and sympathetic. At specific times. Alois Trancy is the perky and often annoying 14 year who also runs a demon Butler estate, but instead, he has 5 demons instead of 1. He has incredible passion for his Butler, Claude, and mistreats the others because of this passion and obsession. Ok... But Claude Faustus is such an unlikeable character in the end of this anime that I honestly don't see HOW I tolerate him other than those beautiful spectacles on his head. The other characters are pretty minor. It involves the other Demon Butlers that work for Alois Trancy. They're pretty boring and aren't too major.Enjoyment (7)There are many times I enjoyed this, and many times I didn't. Several parts made me want to throw my body off a cliff and wonder why the anime creators went this road. Several parts of this season are going to have you grinding your teeth in frustration, nails digging into your chair with anger, and eyes narrowed with hatred for Claude Faustus and what an absolute douche-bag he is. Then there are the good parts with Sebastian and Ciel, and your life is finally set complete again... until the real ending, and then you're glad you have Book of Circus and Murder to watch to get the bad ending out of your mouth and refresh your view on Black Butler.Overall (7)This anime is good, but if you are a fan of how the original turned out, you probably are going to want to enter this anime with caution, at best. The ending is going to be so rough for the people who want to see it end in a... better shade of light, even if this anime is one of the darker ones when it comes to the story. So go ahead and finish up your next season of Kuroshitsuji, but be weary as it will probably make you see dreams in your sleep about a different ending... a better ending... than what Kuroshitsuji season 2 gave you. season of mystery and darkness, the second season is full of events that leave the fans hating the characters that are introduced in the story.

What had me so captivated in the first season was gone in the next one. Shame.Character (7)I'm not going to focus on Season 1 characters, since they make Black Butler as beautiful as it is. This focuses on Season 2 characters, who are incredibly dull and annoying at times, but often relatable and sympathetic. At specific times. Alois Trancy is the perky and often annoying 14 year who also runs a demon Butler estate, but instead, he has 5 demons instead of 1. He has incredible passion for his Butler, Claude, and mistreats the others because of this passion and obsession. Ok... But Claude Faustus is such an unlikeable character in the end of this anime that I honestly don't see HOW I tolerate him other than those beautiful spectacles on his head. The other characters are pretty minor. It involves the other Demon Butlers that work for Alois Trancy. They're pretty boring and aren't too major.Enjoyment (7)There are many times I enjoyed this, and many times I didn't. Several parts made me want to throw my body off a cliff and wonder why the anime creators went this road. Several parts of this season are going to have you grinding your teeth in frustration, nails digging into your chair with anger, and eyes narrowed with hatred for Claude Faustus and what an absolute douche-bag he is. Then there are the good parts with Sebastian and Ciel, and your life is finally set complete again... until the real ending, and then you're glad you have Book of Circus and Murder to watch to get the bad ending out of your mouth and refresh your view on Black Butler.Overall (7)This anime is good, but if you are a fan of how the original turned out, you probably are going to want to enter this anime with caution, at best. The ending is going to be so rough for the people who want to see it end in a... better shade of light, even if this anime is one of the darker ones when it comes to the story. So go ahead and finish up your next season of Kuroshitsuji, but be weary as it will probably make you see dreams in your sleep about a different ending... a better ending... than what Kuroshitsuji season 2 gave you."", ""-Black Butler II has a LOT going for, but only if you ignore the final few episodes of the previous season. I already had some mixed feelings about the ending of the first season, but that's for a different review somewhere else, and to see a continuation after such a concrete ending is definitely a red flag already for those wondering about seeing the second season.-The story here is an absolute MESS. It feels like a first draft written by a intern than it does something that can be similar to Yana-sensei's original artwork in her manga. There's so many continuity issues, plot holes...and dropped side plots that it's almost pathetic here. A character is alive despite clearly dying in the last season, it is never explained how Sebastian knows Claude, another character gets a random twin brother that looks/acts more like their manga counterpart despite the original character stating they were a lonely orphan, why did Claude pick Sebastian of all people to make Alois think he needed to act revenge on and what happens to the Trancy estate by the end of it. There's so many here i feel like this review would go on forever here. It's just a flat out mess and definitely needed either 12 more episodes (making it 24 like the last season) or maybe even 2 more. 12 episodes were just not enough to fix the issues. For those wondering as well, no OVA fixes any of these plot issues as well.-The art this season is at it's all time low. The first two episodes are really great with their animation but the rest it is extremely inconstant. Look at the style of episode 4 and then to episode 7 where there is a clear change in style and lighting. It almost looks like two different people drew different episodes. Not to mention the awful errors i noticed and pretty poorly drawn faces not even in the background. I noticed a heavier use of CGI this season as well. Last season i didn't notice it but this one was way more prominent especially with the train and horses. You would think with how much they made off the first season that they would actually have a higher budget, but no apparently. The promotional art is a million times better than the art in the actual anime unfortunately.-Music is pretty good this season, a lot of fast paced violins and a few pieces from the first season's soundtrack do make a return occasionally. A enjoyable classical style though i find a few rock-sounding songs don't really fit the tone of Black Butler at all outside of the opening. Speaking of which, the openings (2 for this season) are both pretty good and i enjoy the song quite a lot.-The characters have a LOT of potential. Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus are the most interesting characters this season and are a fascinating pair considering they are almost a opposite/dysfunctional version of Sebastian and Ciel. However their characters never really get a opportunity to shine. We never see Alois and Claude on their own and how Alois' position with the queen really works. I honestly feel that maybe Black Butler II should have focused solely on these two instead of trying to shove in Ciel and Sebastian (Perhaps make this season like Yu Gi Oh GX where the torch is passed to someone else). The other newly introduced characters are the demon triplets, but they don't talk and very underdeveloped so it's hard to properly judge them. I suppose they're alright, but it's hard to judge characters only in the background. There is Luca, who is Alois' brother (though we honestly have no clue if it's biological or adoption) and the reason behind his motivation. He's quite adorable, to some his motivation MAY be a little psychopathic but he is a small child with no sense of right/wrong so...The last character introduced is Hannah Anafelloz - the worst newly introduced character. Sure she had done her job and had faced compelling forces, but her motivations made no sense. She wanted Alois and to attack Claude, it makes no sense for her to go after Sebastian as well when he has done nothing but defend himself (and even said something decently polite to her when they first met). It also makes no sense for her to hide what she knows, all she would have had to do is say the truth when Alois was most vulnerable during a fit and then none of those would have happened! She just feels like a awfully written foil character and while they try to make us feel bad for her, her negatives outweigh her positive ones. Everyone else is the same, except Lau made no sense. He had done some awful things to Ciel yet continues to still work for him? That felt immensely desperate that i almost wonder if he was a Easter egg for a species from the manga (as the atlantic arc was written around the same time i believe). Everyone else's roles were too small to judge but they are from the original cast and i still enjoy them (such as Finny, Lizzy, etc)-Overall Black Butler II is almost a guilty pleasure. It's a mess and completely awful to watch but the characters of Alois and Claude honestly make up for it just a little bit. I still don't recommend this unless you are a major Black Butler fan and just want to see Ciel and Sebastian do anything even just standing and breathing. For regular fans, i don't recommend this. Just skip this and watch the reboot. and dropped side plots that it's almost pathetic here.

I loved Season 1 of Kuroshitsuji, I watched it 8 years ago, but due to busy sched I only got to watch: Book of Circus, Book of Murder, OVA's and FINALLY Season II in that same order, this week, 2015, September!I was aware of the Alois arc 5 years ago but I heard it wasn't part of the manga so I avoided it until 5 hours ago and I fell in freaking-love.So many reviews, so many opinions, so many debates going on. So basically, this Season is about another nobility and...another demon butler. Count Aloise and his Butler, Claude takes on Ciel and Sebastian with a different kind of twist.

At 2015, that kind of delicate, high quality animation can't be seen anymore and even at the time it was made, was an absolute diamond. Okay, so, your mind will experience a roller-coaster ride, from 100% ridiculous, non-logical, crazy humor to 100% sick, twisted, genius- that alone is enough. I understand why the author's editor made her avoid writing it in yaoi- the plot: A demon butler serves a master whose soul he's waiting to devour, in return for his loyalty and  obedience to his master's every whim and desire, that plot is rich at its best. I've got a major pet peeve of manga/japanese works using English in a weird way but I got over it since the story and art, and animation, were all very stellar.All in all, it made me lose sleep, the art is tdf, which makes me rate it a 9! another demon butler.

True, it did not follow the manga. True, it had many cliches. True, it downplayed many elements that most loved from the first.But I still much preferred it. I'm a fan of the darker side of this kind of story, of the tragedy. And while it's always been there in Kuroshitsuji, II was tear-inducing. No matter how narmy it got.The art was different from the first, something I didn't appreciate at the beginning. I had been used, at that point, to the gorgeous and well-animated first...season, from which II came as a slight disappointment.

A lot of people dislike the second season's story because they were just used to the first season's storyline. There are new and interesting characters. The story is a little more morbid than the first season and it doesn't have as much comedy as the first season.Art: As always, the art is beautiful.

As for the voice actors, they all are tolerable and fit the character's personalities. The only problem is Lizzy's voice.

There's plot elements that don't get discussed or explained until well into the season (e.g. episode 6/7) Now I haven't read the manga so all my opinions are purely based on the anime.The setting, the art and the commitment to the victorian gothic feel are just as good as they were in season one.

It would have stood and been just as if not more enjoyable (for me) if there wasn't.Alois Trancy's maid suffers constant abuse from him and is basically just an excuse for thinly veiled extremely disturbing porn.in conclusion, I am so disturbed by this season and I don't even know what to think anymore. wanting to be Ciel? wanting to be like Ciel?

Whilst all of my friends were gushing over animated demons, I was re-watching Free! for the thirteenth time, and now, after four years, I have finally finished the ever so divisive Black Butler. And, though I quite enjoyed season one, season two was definitely not a very enjoyable experience. Most people had told me to avoid it, and continue on the the much better Book of Circus, and I wish I had, for this season very much ruined a lot of my perception of the show and...the fanbase surrounding it.First off I was not opposed to the idea of Black Butler receiving a sequel, even after finishing its predecessor. From a critical standpoint it probably wasn\'t the best choice, but there was still a lot of material to cover from the manga, and I wasn\'t quite satisfied with the ending of season one (for solely emotional reasons, as even though it fit well in with the story, it ripped my heart into pieces). It not following the manga wasn\'t much of an issue for me either since I\'ve never finished it, so overall it didn\'t pose any problem with me.As the story progresses however, you begin to see jarring flaws with pacing and development of the new editions to the cast.  In the first episode you are introduced to Alois Trancy, head of the Trancy household, and survivor of much sexual, emotional, and physical abuse throughout his life. Despite this however, he is entirely unlikable, and an over all tragic character, both in his construction and his actuality. His butler, Claude, is equally as unlikable, but not for any main reason other than him just being like a slightly less appealing Sebastion, lacking in originality down to his design. Their house staff and the entire concept of the Trancy household is designed to be some sort of opposing side to the Phantomhives, and this is where one of it\'s main flaws resides.Black Butler, from my analysis, is about the balance of good and evil, and about the sacrifices you have to make in order to have a balanced world. You cannot have the good without the bad, and sometimes the honest, noble, holy people aren\'t always good-intentioned. This is illustrated plainly throughout the second half of the first season, with the episodes featuring the church and other symbols of purity. You literally root for the devil because, while his motives are selfishly rooted, he is on the right side of the story, advocating for balance as opposed to achieving good through dangerous methods. What Kuroshitsuji II does is more so pit bad against bad. Ciel and Sebastion are, generally speaking, the bad guys. They are the protagonists, but in theory they are connected with darkness. By pitting these two houses against each other, it creates a confusing sense of conflict, to where you don\'t know who is really on the right side. It relies solely on the attachment built up with the original cast to create conflict, which may work for fangirls, but makes the average viewer question their entire perception of the show and it\'s characters, and left me confused and upset at whoever green-lighted the season. This also makes Claude and Sebastion\'s battles quite conflicting, because they both essentially want the same thing, and are basically just two guys fighting over their next meal. Instead of creating a proper counter for the darkness of the Phantomhive Estate, they tried to create a textbook antagonist, which doesn\'t work when the main characters are technically evil within themselves.Characterization is another big issue I had when watching. Part of what makes Ciel such a good character is that his actions are justifiable. He acts the way he does because of his past, but did not lose qualities of basic human decency in the process of coping with his trauma. He is arrogant and troublesome at times, but his behavior is backed up by his willingness to do the right thing and bring people to justice who have wronged him and those he cares about, even if his motives behind it are selfish. Alois is the exact opposite, displaying traits of narcissism even before undergoing years of abuse, and while that isn\'t a problem for an antagonist per-say, it makes him incredibly insufferable for his whole run on the show. He treats his staff as verbal and physical punching bags, and then turns around and starts tap dancing. This, again, wouldn\'t be such an issue if the show didn\'t try to garner sympathy for him, by showing the backstory with his brother and all. It\'s as if the writers couldn\'t decide if they wanted you to love him or wish death upon him, and his character was ultimately created as a big ploy for Claude\'s motives, without giving you time to fully understand his character. And don\'t get me started on Claude. He gets a special spot reserved on my least favorite character list, due to the fact that I literally wanted to kick his teeth in every time he made an appearance.Claude and Alois\'s relationship also left me very unsettled, and was a product of this poor character development. Ciel and Sebastion\'s relationship is one of mutual understanding, beyond that of their contract. Sebastion understands Ciel\'s need for revenge and helps him achieve so, while serving and protecting him in the process, and eventually caring about him as much as his demonic intentions allow. Ciel knows this and is fully accepting off the fact his soul will be taken in exchange for his service, as he has been broken to the point of no return. It is an exchange, whereas Alois and Claude\'s is an unhealthy desire for protection. Claude enables Alois\'s toxic behavior, and uses him as a stepping stone for his goals, whereas Sebastion and Ciel have a mutual understanding of each-other and their true intentions. This makes sense, as they are designed to be polar opposites, but is done in a rushed and very shallow way, caked with fan service and dancing metaphors. It also helps perpetuate the fandom\'s very toxic view of Alois\'s character, treating him as some damaged baby, when he\'s more of a sadist brat then anything else.The show has a plethora of other flaws, particularly the ending, which I will not go into for spoilers sake. The ending was incredibly disappointing for a number of reasons, and left me very, very sad for just about every character in the show, leaving a bad taste in my mouth. On the plus side, however, the artwork is stunning as usual, with the quality improving even more so from the already gorgeous first season. The designs for the newer characters are okay, though I particularly enjoyed Alois\'s attire with his shorts and fancy boots. The OP was quite forgettable, which saddened me as The Gazette is a band which I know and enjoy from time to time. The ED and music throughout the show, however, were both very high in quality, with this ED being my favorite next to ""I\'m Alive"" from season one.Overall, Kuroshitsuji II was quite disappointing. The show had flaws to begin with, and then it was completely blown out of the water with the incredibly upsetting ending, leaving viewers with an abundance of negative emotions. I regret watching it, as it has tainted my impression of the show, and while it was fun to watch given its stunning animation and decent soundtrack, in the end it left me feeling less to be desired. Though I don\'t think this season needs to be completely ignored, I like to consider it a poor spinoff of a very strong show and manga. Whether to watch it is up to your discretion (and whether you like it or not is your opinion!), but I wouldn\'t recommend it if you have any sort of respect or enjoyment for the original Black Butler, because you will just be let down and disappointed. the fanbase surrounding it.First off I was not opposed to the idea of Black Butler receiving a sequel, even after finishing its predecessor.

His butler, Claude, is equally as unlikable, but not for any main reason other than him just being like a slightly less appealing Sebastion, lacking in originality down to his design. Their house staff and the entire concept of the Trancy household is designed to be some sort of opposing side to the Phantomhives, and this is where one of it\'s main flaws resides.Black Butler, from my analysis, is about the balance of good and evil, and about the sacrifices you have to make in order to have a balanced world. You cannot have the good without the bad, and sometimes the honest, noble, holy people aren\'t always good-intentioned. This is illustrated plainly throughout the second half of the first season, with the episodes featuring the church and other symbols of purity. You literally root for the devil because, while his motives are selfishly rooted, he is on the right side of the story, advocating for balance as opposed to achieving good through dangerous methods. What Kuroshitsuji II does is more so pit bad against bad. Ciel and Sebastion are, generally speaking, the bad guys. They are the protagonists, but in theory they are connected with darkness. By pitting these two houses against each other, it creates a confusing sense of conflict, to where you don\'t know who is really on the right side. It relies solely on the attachment built up with the original cast to create conflict, which may work for fangirls, but makes the average viewer question their entire perception of the show and it\'s characters, and left me confused and upset at whoever green-lighted the season. This also makes Claude and Sebastion\'s battles quite conflicting, because they both essentially want the same thing, and are basically just two guys fighting over their next meal. Instead of creating a proper counter for the darkness of the Phantomhive Estate, they tried to create a textbook antagonist, which doesn\'t work when the main characters are technically evil within themselves.Characterization is another big issue I had when watching. Part of what makes Ciel such a good character is that his actions are justifiable. He acts the way he does because of his past, but did not lose qualities of basic human decency in the process of coping with his trauma. He is arrogant and troublesome at times, but his behavior is backed up by his willingness to do the right thing and bring people to justice who have wronged him and those he cares about, even if his motives behind it are selfish. Alois is the exact opposite, displaying traits of narcissism even before undergoing years of abuse, and while that isn\'t a problem for an antagonist per-say, it makes him incredibly insufferable for his whole run on the show. He treats his staff as verbal and physical punching bags, and then turns around and starts tap dancing. This, again, wouldn\'t be such an issue if the show didn\'t try to garner sympathy for him, by showing the backstory with his brother and all. It\'s as if the writers couldn\'t decide if they wanted you to love him or wish death upon him, and his character was ultimately created as a big ploy for Claude\'s motives, without giving you time to fully understand his character. And don\'t get me started on Claude. He gets a special spot reserved on my least favorite character list, due to the fact that I literally wanted to kick his teeth in every time he made an appearance.Claude and Alois\'s relationship also left me very unsettled, and was a product of this poor character development. Ciel and Sebastion\'s relationship is one of mutual understanding, beyond that of their contract. Sebastion understands Ciel\'s need for revenge and helps him achieve so, while serving and protecting him in the process, and eventually caring about him as much as his demonic intentions allow. Ciel knows this and is fully accepting off the fact his soul will be taken in exchange for his service, as he has been broken to the point of no return. It is an exchange, whereas Alois and Claude\'s is an unhealthy desire for protection. Claude enables Alois\'s toxic behavior, and uses him as a stepping stone for his goals, whereas Sebastion and Ciel have a mutual understanding of each-other and their true intentions. This makes sense, as they are designed to be polar opposites, but is done in a rushed and very shallow way, caked with fan service and dancing metaphors. It also helps perpetuate the fandom\'s very toxic view of Alois\'s character, treating him as some damaged baby, when he\'s more of a sadist brat then anything else.The show has a plethora of other flaws, particularly the ending, which I will not go into for spoilers sake. The ending was incredibly disappointing for a number of reasons, and left me very, very sad for just about every character in the show, leaving a bad taste in my mouth. On the plus side, however, the artwork is stunning as usual, with the quality improving even more so from the already gorgeous first season. The designs for the newer characters are okay, though I particularly enjoyed Alois\'s attire with his shorts and fancy boots. The OP was quite forgettable, which saddened me as The Gazette is a band which I know and enjoy from time to time. The ED and music throughout the show, however, were both very high in quality, with this ED being my favorite next to ""I\'m Alive"" from season one.Overall, Kuroshitsuji II was quite disappointing. The show had flaws to begin with, and then it was completely blown out of the water with the incredibly upsetting ending, leaving viewers with an abundance of negative emotions. I regret watching it, as it has tainted my impression of the show, and while it was fun to watch given its stunning animation and decent soundtrack, in the end it left me feeling less to be desired. Though I don\'t think this season needs to be completely ignored, I like to consider it a poor spinoff of a very strong show and manga. Whether to watch it is up to your discretion (and whether you like it or not is your opinion!), but I wouldn\'t recommend it if you have any sort of respect or enjoyment for the original Black Butler, because you will just be let down and disappointed.', ""Do not watch this season. Do your research on Black Butler, maybe read the manga, and only watch the canon episodes of the anime. The rest is simply a waste of your time. The storyline made no sense at all, and all it will do is confuse you.The reason I haven't rated this season as a 1 is because I do still love Sebastian and Ciel as characters, Alois and Claude were interesting for a while, and the ending was poetic in a way. Had Claude and Alois been a part of the manga, I think their addition to the anime would've been stunning....For people thinking that these two are just a rewrite of Sebastian and Ciel's characters, that is not the case. They have a completely different relationship, and each of the characters have their own, interesting backstories. That is one of the few things I enjoyed about this season.Besides those few things, this season just made me sour towards the whole series. The plot didn't make sense, to me. The ending of the previous season, in my opinion, was not adequately explained in this season. Even if it was explained properly, that still wouldn't make sense of the plot for this season. Alois's motives for entering Ciel's life just didn't feel thought through to me, as is the case many times with anime and that diverge from the manga.Of course, the third season will probably change my opinion (or so I hope) since it is canon material, unlike this second season. For now, though, I'm quite unhappy with the direction this anime took.My final advice for you would be: stick with the canon. It'll save you a lot of headaches.

They have some new characters? Alois Trancy and Claude Faustus?OK. They may not seem so bad. A good change of characters could help the show.*after watching a few episodes*Or not.In late-nineteenth century England, one year and three months after the dramatic conclusion of the original series, Kuroshitsuji II introduces a new butler and young master. The sadistic yet cheerful Alois Trancy has faced some harsh times. He was kidnapped as a baby, and was forced to work in...a village as a slave. Gradually, he lost his parents, his best friend, and everyone he knew. Alois eventually returned home and became the head of his mansion, but seemed to exhibit some strange behavior ever since. Even more curiously, he returned with Claude Faustus, an enigmatic, emotionless butler with unfathomable talent….OK…..I want to get this out of the way as soon as possible. I hate Alois Trancy. I hate him and his guts. If I was in that show, I’d be the first one to kill him because he is that insufferable of a character, he’s basically who I thought Ciel would’ve been in the first season: A spoiled, sadistic, bratty, creepy-ass little boy and while they explain his backstory and how messed up he is, it doesn’t excuse the bullshit insanity he causes throughout the series. Hell, in the first episode, he gauges Hannah’s (his demon maid) eye out and he keeps torturing her throughout the series. I really felt bad for that character (Yes, I felt bad for the demon maid!!) yet she stills shows compassion for the little shit. Oh, and Claude…..I take him as ‘meh’. I’m not calling him the proto-Sebastian but they are sometimes I think they are match evenly, even though Claude can be a bit creepy sometimes (and that’s toward Ciel). Also, I felt like the chemistry between Ciel and Sebastian lessened here than the first season, saying “he’s nothing more than a butler”. That could be him masking his true feelings but I thought we were over that already when Season 1 concluded.As for the story, not really that interesting but it does stick to one narrative being that Alois and Claude wants Ciel’s soul and to kill Sebastian and I couldn’t really care less about the story as into the 2nd episode, I was mostly like, “What the hell happened? I thought you two weren’t around anymore?” but then again, after seeing Alois in the first episode, I was relieved that those two were back again and the plot doesn’t linger on to those other two.I haven’t got much to say about animation except that it is quite the same as the first season, which isn’t a bad thing because the animation and art A-1 Pictures provided was stunning but I will say for character design, did they even try to not make Claude look like a clone of Sebastian? I would sometimes get confused with those two when they are on screen together or even separate.Musically, the only opening theme for the show, “Shiver” by The Gazette was actually quite good once going into the show and I never once skipped the theme or opening sequence. The ending song, “Bird” by Yuya Matsushita was also just okay, too and if you want to know if the Kalafina song was my favorite, then you’re right because it actually was my favorite. Yes, I happen to like the group Kalafina. The music score overall was fine.As for the dub performances, they were quite the same as the first season as J. Michael Tatum does shine again as Sebastian and Brina Palencia as Ciel but enter the two new players, Luci Christian as Alois Trancy and she does play the role of a despicable little brat very well and Jason Douglas as Claude was also very decent in his part. It does remind me of Tatum’s performance but everything about Claude reminds me of Sebastian.FINAL VERDICT: Black Butler II is……very much of a step down from the first season. I can see why some people did not like this season but I don’t completely hate it. The writing just seems more fan fiction-like while some of the rest did stay the same and that could be for the best. It also seems for fans, this season is quite 50/50 for some of them. Some like it, others don’t. Would I recommend it though? Well….maybe as a standalone or alternate universe of Black Butler maybe but not a continuation from Season 1. a village as a slave.

The characters lack the characteristics that made the first season so good.  In the first season Ciel (the main character of the first season) was a smart, strong minded and loveable kid that strived for revenge with a passion.  This season we have a kid that is arrogant and despicable and with no sense or strive for anything but for the love and acceptance of the butler.  The first episode leaves you with a lot of questions and for me...at least hate for the new characters.

I was so surprised that I replayed the scene about 3/4 times.Up to episode 3, people have been theorizing and asking questions about this season's storyline. I really can't wait how this story will grow and further surprise us.IMO, I give...the season  a 7, because there are still plotholes; if they decide to give a bearable resolve to these plotholes, I'll score higher.

I’d have much rather preferred the ending of the 1st season to have been the ultimate finale. It would have left a better impression. This second season is more for very loyal fans than the odd viewer. The plot puts an unexpected twist to the 1st season’s ending, and has an unexpected ending itself!

This was sort of a remake of the first season with almost the same characters, but different personalities."", 'This show is somewhat different from Kuroshitsuju I: it has a more continuous plot than the previous installment, and it offers a conflict that is almost internal instead of introducing a ""global"" supervillain that everybody fights. I can see why some people might dislike the second installment, and likewise why some might like it more. They\'re different enough.It must be noted that despite Kuroshitsuji II not following the manga at all, the plot was written by the original mangaka. As well as new characters, which were created by her. So if you get an instant turn-off when you hear about some anime not following the...manga, don\'t get discouraged about this one: a spin-off it may be, but it was created by the same mangaka.PLOT:The structure of the show consists of a few disjointed episodes at first, followed by the rest of the episodes neatly linked to each other by a continuous plot. The very first episode introduce us to new characters, and the goal of the second and third ones are to confuse the viewer, I believe (in the best meaning of the word, as in presenting a mystery). I\'m not sure if it was a great idea, as some members of the audience might lose their patience and decide that ""mystery"" is no mystery but simply a lazily thought out occurence with many unexplained holes. However, the mystery unravels gradually, and by the 5th or 6th episode the confusion dissipates.After that the story focuses on what makes a soul tasty to a demon, the question that gets explored during a row of adventures (or should I say misfortunes?) that feature quite a few unexpected plot twists along the way. We get to see a little about how demons think and what they really want, although demons in this story can have different preferences and even switch between them. I liked the part about preferences: after all, otherwise the story would be teaching everybody to be a certain way and calling it ""right"". Yes, it would be ""right"" only to demons, however, the admiration shown by them to certain character traits isn\'t alien to us human beings at all. It\'s easy to agree with the demons, and I think it would be unfair and wrong in many ways. In the end, you\'re the one to decide what you like and whether the demons had a weird taste or were right.Conveniences that help the plot move along that I complained about in Kuroshitsuji I are gone in this series, now everything is quite logical, if logical is a word that can be applied to such an anime :) The only thing I could issue a very minor complaint about is some pointless fanservice introduced. I don\'t mean beautiful clothes or poses, it\'s all right, but there\'s some heavier fanservice involved and it goes nowhere. I would love such things to death if they actually went somewhere and got woven into the plot, but total pointlessness of them was killing me. However, I believe that many viewers will love them for being present. And let\'s face it, the show features underage characters, it would be unlawful if anything clearly went anywhere :)Another notable thing is that this time there\'s some fanservice included for a male part of the audience, too, however it\'s even more pointless than that included for a female one, and for me personally it horribly stood out because of that. At least you can think of fanservice-for-females as playing a part in the story (in some way it serves as a ""red herring""), but the typical ""let\'s show huge boobs at random moments"" thing comes off as clearly pointless from the start, ruining the atmosphere at some moments.And how should I put it... I LOVED the ending! So nice, I can\'t stop giggling triumphantly over what I saw. A very unexpected and nice ending, although whether it\'s nice or cruel depends on your perspective and which character you were rooting for.CHARACTERS:It\'s hard to write about characters without spoilers, because even mentioning some of the characters is a spoiler already. So I\'ll start without them and make a huge announcement before moving on to something spoilerish, so that anybody who haven\'t watched yet can comfortably stop reading at that moment without getting spoiled. Or not stop, if she is too curious. :) That said, those spoilerish characters are freely mentioned in many reviews, so you\'ve probably already been spoiled about them anyway.As can be seen from the cover, there are two new characters in this anime, a new boy and a new butler. They can look like bad copies at first, but just you wait. The boy is a strange one, I\'d say a high-speed yandere who switches from being annoying or cruel to childishly weak at the drop of a hat. It looks a little shocking, because believe it or not, it\'s extremely realistic! Unlike the yanderes I\'ve seen before, his nature is well-explored in the anime, and even in the very first episode you can see something interesting if you squint, namely, one of the motives for cruelty. That motive surprised me a lot, to be honest, there\'s much more to that character than merely the ""tragic past"" excuse. I would even argue that the past merely helped to shape him into being as he was instead of ""forcing"" him to be like that. But the best part of it is that he\'s so easy to relate to.The new butler has a face of a professional poker player, however, some of his emotions are shown, too. Just enough to make things interesting and... again, confusing! It\'s intentional, believe me. You\'ll find yourself wondering what the real nature of the relationship between the two is, and that will turn out to be a very important thing in this anime. Unlike the previous installment, this one focuses on the relationship between the butler and his owner a lot, and it\'s not static, either, you will see it changing more than once. I personally preferred Kuroshitsuji II over I for this very reason, because I love to see characters and relationships get shown well and how they change or develop.MINOR SPOILERS FOLLOW NEXT (characters only)A few characters make a comeback in this series, or should I rather say all of them. Especially Ciel and Sebastian stand out :). They\'re the ones who create a mystery I was talking about in a spoiler-free beginning of the review, the mystery that you\'re going to be solving called ""How come Ciel isn\'t dead?"". Ciel\'s character is a little different now from the ending of the Kuroshitsuji I, or at least from my take on his character at its ending. It\'s sort of static now, which didn\'t exactly delight me, but tastes differ. On another hand Sebastian becomes more interesting in this anime than before: we get to see some of his traits that couldn\'t be shown earlier, his wishes and thoughts about Ciel are much more defined. And as I said, this show focuses on the relationship between the butler and his owner, that goes for Ciel and Sebastian just as much as another pair.ART: Great as ever, although I can\'t help but think that Hannah could be prettier, any man in the anime is prettier than her, after all. But I won\'t complain much, because I care for men more anyway. :)SOUND: I didn\'t pay attention, as always. But I guess it means that it was neither bad nor outstanding.OVERALL:It\'s impossible to predict whether you\'ll like it or not, but I\'d say if you like characters more thoroughly explored than usual (especially villains), it\'s definitely your thing.

Even if it\'s not your thing, you could like it for many other reasons.', 'In my very opinion Kuroshitsuji did not need a sequel. What happens here is not related to the the first season at all. In the first episode I was was like, ""What the heck, this does not include the original characters in the beginning."" As I went on watching the story progressed Sebastian and Ciel are back into the story, not like as it started in the first episode.CharactersThe story starts out with new characters you have know idea about. Unless you read summaries and heard from your friends, you already know about the different characters. They introduce Alois Trancy and his butler Claude. Just...like Sebastian and Ciel, Claude is a demon, Alois he\'s also the ""son"" of a rich father. It hints that he may have been adopted. Not like I\'m sure about it. Alois is like a spoiled brat. I know his only family was killed and all, but he doesn\'t need to act like that. Ciel had the same thing happen to him, he\'s not like that. Sebastian shows his protectiveness of Ciel toward the end of the series, which is a bit cute, in my opinion. Claude....he creeped me out man!! Personally I do not like the new characters. I\'ll give it a 6StoryThe story wasn\'t bad, nor was it good. It basically was leisure time spent. The story does not drag you in as the first one. It basically revolves around the fight between Claude and Sebastian over Ciel\'s soul. With Alois in between. I don\'t want to give any spoilers so I\'ll keep it at that. I give it a 7. I didn\'t enjoy it as much as the first one.ArtAs usual the art is really good. Detailed and all that stuff. I give it a 10. Not much to say here.SoundThe OP I really like, just I can\'t find it without the sound being blocked. Geez Youtube. The ending kind of ruins the mood of the seriousness of the episode. It\'s like calm and I just couldn\'t get used to it. I\'ll give it a 7.EnjoymentTell you the truth it wasn\'t bad, but since they made a 2nd season, I\'d prefer it to have different plot, or just follow the manga with some filler episodes from the start of the entire anime series, 1st and 2nd season. But we are stuck with what we have. I enjoyed bits and pieces. It had its small humor. The dark tone of the series. It spent my leisure time (most of it) and sometimes I was like ""Awww"" or ""WTF!!!"" or ""Eh."" Lots of mixed emotions. I give it a 7.OverallIt continues from the 1st season, but some may not like the story line. I\'m in the middle. If you are satisfied with the 1st season\'s ending, I recommend that you don\'t watch the ending of the 2nd one. The ending just made me like ""WTF JUST HAPPENED!!!"" So if you are the one to on a rage on a ending that you don\'t like. Don\'t watch this during the night when everyone in your house is asleep, because you are going to wake them up, and possibly the neighborhood. Go on and watch if you are curious, but if you aren\'t then just skip it. All I give it overall is a 7. like Sebastian and Ciel, Claude is a demon, Alois he\'s also the ""son"" of a rich father.

Pardon me if this review is a little messy.This season was like a fanfiction brought to animation. One of the moments I enjoyed was the sword fight scene between Ciel and Alois, Ciel defending himself and not needing nor allowing Sebastian to intervene.The season doesn\'t fit in to S1 nor does it even have a connection to it. Ciel\'s amnesia is confusing, as if an excuse to fit the ""continued"" story, something to somehow fit in between somewhere in S1. But it doesn\'t.Alois could\'ve been a better character. There are parts...of him that should\'ve been better explained like the assumption he doesn\'t like women and why he treated Hannah poorly. There\'s no explanation as to why he treats her that way. It\'s more of a fill in the gaps; he treated her poorly because he probably saw women treated poorly when he was taken in as a slave. There isn\'t any proof to that.It\'s also perplexing why Hannah was treated poorly until towards the end, like someone to be abused in all different ways. Why was she scared of Alois if she was an apathetic demon? She was shown to be strong and powerful, not someone that could easily be taken advantage of.Heck, even Sebastian\'s poor treatment to Grell was uncalled for.Another problem is how Grell being a transwoman wasn\'t addressed, ever. Her gender expression was treated like an awful gag.This season was too fanservicey, a big reason it took me years to get back into the series and complete the seasons before getting to Book of Circus. Claude grew infatuated in Ciel, and Alois knew that both Claude and Sebastian loved him.Claude\'s obsession to Ciel was creepy and those fanservice moments between Ciel and Sebastian was creepy too. Sebastian\'s appearance is based on Ciel\'s dad, making that even worse.It could have played better if Claude had little to no involvement. It could apply to Sebastian as well. If Alois had known sooner how much Hannah loved and cared for him rather than finding out in the end.One of the elements of the series in general that captures my interest is the traumatic experiences the characters had gone and went through.If they were going for a whole new thing, it would have been nice if the story focused on not only Ciel and Alois, but with Mey-Rin, Finnian, and Baldroy. Ciel and Alois had potential to become friends, giving a little taste of how they could\'ve gotten along as seen at the final episodes. Even Finnian could\'ve been friends with them as all three had some similar experiences.This season could\'ve done so much better. of him that should\'ve been better explained like the assumption he doesn\'t like women and why he treated Hannah poorly.

I can name 2 bad ones for every good one. I can name far fewer great ones. Being a huge fan of the first season of ""Black Butler"" I was more than curious to see what was in store next. After finishing, I now ask why did I- and more importantly- the creators even bother?We are introduced to two new characters. The new demon butler Claude Faustus and his young master, Alois Trancy. Had the series been entirely about them and their story, I think I would have enjoyed it more. But when the cast of the first season shows...up, not only does it take away from this second season, but the first as well. A double play of disappointment!That\'s not to say this season is terrible- it\'s not. It dives into the nature of the demon butler and the contracts they make. Alois is an interesting and despicable little *bleep*. But, watching his story arch and motivations was the most interesting thing about this season. All the rest just needlessly complicated things and took away what was a great ending to Season 1.The art and music are just as nice as Season 1, the other characters that are introduced are pretty forgettable minus Alois. The biggest fail is Claude, the new butler, who should have been the draw of the show. He is boring. Predictable. And just dull as dishwater. Sub vs. Dub is a win for Sub. J. Michael Tatum was the loan bright spot for the English cast. Alois\' English actor, Luci Christian, seemed to be imitating Jack Wild in the film ""Oliver!"". It was effective however, the voice was like nails on a chalkboard!I was really, really disappointed in this season. It was unnecessary to drag in the cast from the first season and they really missed a chance to tell a new story with new characters and take a different road. The only reason I can recommend to watch this season is if you\'re really hungry for more ""Black Butler"" and don\'t care how you get it. I really wish I could make a deal with a demon to make Season 1 stand alone... Actually, after watching this season, scratch that idea. Cheers! up, not only does it take away from this second season, but the first as well. A double play of disappointment!That\'s not to say this season is terrible- it\'s not.

The anime bring in new characters and put the old main characters in the background there still there just less present. Alois is a new character and with him is Claud his demon butler they have struck a contract much like ceil and sebastian an are for the most part polar opposites. The anime took a new approach for its sequal and have been penalized  by alot of there fans and even though i enjoyed it...i still would have liked to have seen option 2. Black butler II is an action packed anime with more fights and Drama then the last. I recommend you to watch it i still would have liked to have seen option 2. Black butler II is an action packed anime with more fights and Drama then the last. I recommend you to watch it', ""I don't know what the deal is with sequels.There is just this weird habit of making a continuation of a story that was fine by itself with no request of it whatsoever. It may not be the case with this show,but like most other sequels,it taints the actual resolution and continues with a story that comes out of nowhere and doesn't live up at all to the original.This is the case with Kuroshitsuji II or Black Butler IIThe first season of Black Butler was actually one of the first works of anime that I have watched and it was a fun journey overall. I liked...seeing the Queen's loyal guard dog walking around with his Butler solving crimes and doing jobs.The show was epic, dramatic,funny,and chaotic at times.And then this huge scale ending comes along in which almost all of London is destroyed thus wrapping up everything and ending the story there...UNTIL season II came along reopening a wound that should've stayed closed.This story follows around a bunch of Kuroshitsuji wannabes called Elois Trancy and his butler, Claude who is also a demon and for most of the story when the Phantomhives and Trancys collide, you can't help but wonder why is this happening anyway.You can tell that this second season really did not need to happen since they put in this whole thing about Ciel losing his memory instead of ...something happening to him if you watched the end of Season one.Also, this show will definitely go down for having one of the most insufferable antagonists I have ever seen in anime,PERIOD.I didn't pay attention to the art style too much because there was nothing to pay attention to.This was made by the same studio who did the first one so their styles and animation are similar.There are times when things are colorful and pretty much the rest of the show is really grey or just plain black(get it?).The animation is good though but its not the best that A1-Pictures had to offer.I'm kinda torn between the two opening themes.The first season had a really good opening theme with visuals that fit with the whole gothic aspect of the show, and the second doesn't do that but still has nice visuals and a really catchy opening.But when it came to enjoyment , I think the first opening trumped over the second manly because I looked forward to watching the episode after the opening played, but there were many times in this season where the opening was the only thing I looked forward to.The OST wasn't bad either since it sounded the same in both seasons.Holy Crap,okay so remember when I said that this show to me had one of the most insufferable characters in an anime PERIOD?Well, I meant it! Elois Trancy is such an ass of a person.He is such a spoiled brat who thinks the whole world revolves around him.It's like he was born just to be a tribute act to Ciel.He has tragic backstory that is nothing compared to what Ciel faced as a child and somehow Ciel is more wise and clever than Elois would ever be. He is so cruel for no reason at all and takes his anger out on things when they don't go his way.There is like this duel scene between him and Ciel at a part in the show that proves he is all talk and absolutely no walk at all.When he is on the verge of death he acts like such a baby that deserves to die and it doesn't make up for all the crap that he has done.In the whole Trancy household, the only character that I like was his butler ,Claude. Claude is cool and all but he is just an offbrand version of the Sebastian that we all know in love.I mean, that will be the day when a man with glasses who can tap dance like crazy will surpass that guy who introduced Curry bread and broke up a fight with a literal deer head on him.There are also the other servants in the show,BUT they are not as interesting as the servants of the Phantomhive manor,Not by a long shot.I liked the characters from the first season though, but when these two different groups clash , things get way too unnecessary and confusing.And then the ending came along and sotomized the story so hard that my mind tried to reject that such an ending happened and I came to a conclusion that this story DOES NOT EXIST.I feel like someone would like this show only if they want more Kuroshitsuji, but thats what Book of Circus, Book of Murder, and that other movie I haven't seen yet are there for.These extra seasons/OVA's are exactly what you need if you can't get enough of Black Butler.These stories have other stories but they don't interfere with the core story of the Phantomhives at all.They're kind of just parts in the show that did not appear in the first season because they're wasn't enough room i think.But really there is no point in watching this show since it screws up everything that was planned in the first season(as in its ending) and just adds extra screen time to the characters just to put them in the spotlight when their story was supposed to already be finished.Overall-5THIS SHOW DOESN'T EXIST! seeing the Queen's loyal guard dog walking around with his Butler solving crimes and doing jobs.The show was epic, dramatic,funny,and chaotic at times.And then this huge scale ending comes along in which almost all of London is destroyed thus wrapping up everything and ending the story there...UNTIL season II came along reopening a wound that should've stayed closed.This story follows around a bunch of Kuroshitsuji wannabes called Elois Trancy and his butler, Claude who is also a demon and for most of the story when the Phantomhives and Trancys collide, you can't help but wonder why is this happening anyway.You can tell that this second season really did not need to happen since they put in this whole thing about Ciel losing his memory instead of ...something happening to him if you watched the end of Season one.Also, this show will definitely go down for having one of the most insufferable antagonists I have ever seen in anime,PERIOD.I didn't pay attention to the art style too much because there was nothing to pay attention to.This was made by the same studio who did the first one so their styles and animation are similar.There are times when things are colorful and pretty much the rest of the show is really grey or just plain black(get it?).The animation is good though but its not the best that A1-Pictures had to offer.I'm kinda torn between the two opening themes.The first season had a really good opening theme with visuals that fit with the whole gothic aspect of the show, and the second doesn't do that but still has nice visuals and a really catchy opening.But when it came to enjoyment , I think the first opening trumped over the second manly because I looked forward to watching the episode after the opening played, but there were many times in this season where the opening was the only thing I looked forward to.The OST wasn't bad either since it sounded the same in both seasons.Holy Crap,okay so remember when I said that this show to me had one of the most insufferable characters in an anime PERIOD?Well, I meant it!

Not only does it completely fall flat as a sequel, it's also just poorly crafted. The story's pace all over the place, moving from intense developments to nothing happening for episodes on end. In that respect, it almost feels like 2 different shows: one is a half-assed and really boring sequel, while the other is a disturbing but kind of interesting story that is constantly interrupted by plot contrivances. Really the only strength it has is an interesting antagonist, but I feel like he would have thrived much better in a different show with...a much more adult tone (something more along the lines of Berserk than a Kuro sequel). The writing is pretty abysmal, and the story's conclusion is an absolute unsatisfying mess. In my opinion, it's not worth watching. Go read the manga or watch Book of Circus. a much more adult tone (something more along the lines of Berserk than a Kuro sequel).

Hell, even I was, I love Ciel and Sebby and didnt want to see them replaced.However as I started watching it, I grew to love it. Alois surpassed my love for Ciel and became my favourite character, even if he is a bit gone.This review may contain very light spoilers.Story: 8/10The story begins with a new butler and a new ""insane"" master. Alois Trancy hurts his maid badly and Claude...does nothing. It starts dark and kind of confusing but as it progresses, questions are answers...and ideas are explained.However, the second episode--which shows more of Sebastian and Ciel-- is mostly filler, but it also gives more background, sort of, of what happened at the end of Season One.Alois and Ciel meet and there\'s an instant rivalry between both the butlers and the masters. Alois wants Ciel, and Ciel doesn\'t want Alois alive. Claude and Sebastian do their best to protect their masters from each other, but things get a bit..hairy when they form a contract with each other. As this is a huge spoiler, I will not say the reason or description of the contract.Art: 9/10Kuroshitsuji 2\'s art is a bit lighter than K1\'s, but it still holds the dark Victorian-era style that we all loved. A few minor things-- that, depending on how much you paid attention, you may or may not notice-- were done to the characters, such as Sebastian\'s eyes being a darker red and Ciel\'s eyes being a different shade of blue. That is really the only difference though.Sound: 8/10I can\'t really say much about the OPs and EDs as I skip them in every anime, but from what I heard the first time, I did enjoy them. They gave the right mood for the series and allowed people to set into the feeling  faster.Alois\'s voice had the perfect insanity level that was needed to portray a character like him, and Claude\'s had the right amount of monotone that held  just a bit of sadism. Ciel\'s and Sebastian\'s were up to par too, and even Grell, who is still only a minor character, had a good ""I\'m afraid T_T"" voice when he needed it.Character: 10/10Alois has to be one of the most believably emotional anime characters I\'ve ever come across, if not THE most. I felt so sorry for him, and just wanted to hug him and tell him everything would be okay when I learned about his past.Claude.. Gah I hated him, but he did have his good [aka humourous] moments that made him almost likeable. Especially when he got into childish fights with Sebastian.Sebby turned a bit more childish in this series, as he had to prove he was better than Claude, but his protection over Ciel increased tenfold. He unleashes his anger/jealousy pretty rapidly in this season, but he\'s still got a slight hold.Ciel..the little bitch boy XD he does nothing, really, still, except get kidnapped and become something useful for Alois. But his awesomeness/bitchiness increases at the end of the series, which is good.Most of the original characters-- the three Phantomhive servents, the old man, Elizabeth and her maid and a few others-- have returned but once again, they dont\'t do much. In fact, I think you see Elizabeth for one and a half episodes at most.Enjoyment: 9/10I enjoyed this a lot. It was fast-paced enough, gave a bit of fanservice, and a bunch of emotion that I wish other anime would have. It did have it\'s bad points, but what anime doesn\'t?Overall: 8/10I would have liked a bit more but as it was, it was still highly enjoyable  and one of my favourite animes that I\'ve seen.I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a bit of humour, doesn\'t mind some obvious shounen-ai hints, and enjoyed Kuroshitsuji 1 so theyre not completely confused xD. and ideas are explained.However, the second episode--which shows more of Sebastian and Ciel-- is mostly filler, but it also gives more background, sort of, of what happened at the end of Season One.Alois and Ciel meet and there\'s an instant rivalry between both the butlers and the masters.

At first, it feels as thought the show has reached the end of the story and the rest is just lengthened to make the story continue longer as seen in many other shounen anime/manga(with the cliche ****sia). But as you keep on watching the continuation finally gives some meaning with an unprecended ending that will surely surprise you.For those of you craving to see more of the 'ikemen' Sebastian, you'll be surprised to find yet another butler added to the crew called Claude(Just do not droll) with his annoying Master, Alois Trancy.

But my curiosity got the best of me, and so I decided to watch season 2.Honestly, I was extremely disappointed with the outcome as the plot was mainly too convoluted and the characters were just cringe-worthy. I was hoping to see how Alois and Claude would turn out as they seemed kind of promising in the first episode, but all they managed to do was to get on my nerves.It was rather interesting at first to see...how Claude was willing to break his contract with Alois to fight Sebastian for Ciel's soul, but what annoyed me to no end was how Alois still seemed to revere him? And don't get me started on his relationship with Hannah. Alois was very abusive to Hannah, which is evident when he gouged her eye out in the first episode, leaving me to wonder why she still tolerates his abysmal behaviour. In the end, it was because of her love for Luka that left her at the mercy of wanting to make Alois happy, just like what Luka aspired to do. But then Alois formed a contract with her, and then shit just got even more messier.When Sebastian won the duel with Claude, Alois' soul was consumed by Hannah and Ciel was brought back to life. But as a demon. Yes, a demon. Like why would you do that? It is understandable that that was done so that Sebastian can no longer consume Ciel's soul, but it also means that you sat through about 300 minutes of complete plot wastage. Lots of characters and events were underdeveloped (Abberline's brother, Lau still being alive etc) for the sake of having more screen time for Sebastian and Claude's battle for Ciel's soul, only to have neither of them consume it in the end.That managed to make me pity Sebastian in the end, as you can see how hard he worked (though his intentions were purely on consuming Ciel's soul rightfully as bound by his contract with Ciel) to have been roped in as his eternal slave. His misery was clearly evident and I too felt the same discontentment at how the story turned out.Another thing worth mentioning was how Ciel's amnesia was hardly developed throughout the story. It was enjoyable seeing how the people around Ciel had to put on a facade and pretend the events from season 1 didn't happen, but all this was only really mentioned in 1-2+ episodes, and that was it. The rest of the time, it felt like his amnesia was only a convenience for the plot to continue.I implore anyone who has read this to only watch it if you want to see two attractive demon butlers fight over the soul of a very muddled boy or if you just want to waste a lot of time that would be much better spent re-watching the first season or reading the manga itself. how Claude was willing to break his contract with Alois to fight Sebastian for Ciel's soul, but what annoyed me to no end was how Alois still seemed to revere him?

A must watch for otakus!!"", ""Kuroshitsuji II is unfortunate - the best way to describe it. Stellar animation and sound can't make up for the poor plot line and bad characters. I won't address this as a sequel to the first season, but as it's own because I still want to make this fair.Unfortunately, it falls very flat for me. Much like the second half of the first season, the second season features no manga material, but putting that aside, it lacks everywhere. We're introduced to a new demon/master pair, Alois Trancy, and Claude Faustus. Immediately, we see Alois has had a not so great past featuring some pedophilia,...which could have set him up to be a good, fleshed out character, but his cruelness and selfishness outshine what sympathy I could have had for him as a viewer.Unlike its predecessor, the second season features much more violence and blood, not that the first didn't have any, but it's different in its usage.A rivalry is set up between Ciel and Sebastian (the returning master/butler duo) and Alois and Claude, for a very poor reason and tries to escape the inevitable end of the series (i.e Ciel's death at the hands of Sebastian) by using a cheap fanservice tactic that could be read in a bad fanfiction.The storyline is just sad - and not in the way it intends to be. The writing fell flat where it should have and the entire storyline feels ridiculous in the latter half and drags out too long. It's twelve episodes but each episode feels like a drag to get through. There was no comic relief in this season at all, making it a depressing, disturbing and sad anime.When I say disturbing, I mean a scantily clad fourteen-year-old teasing and making sexual advances on his butler. The entire thing just feels like such ill taste, considering the past this character has seen.Overrall, as Kuroshitsuji fan, I won't be going back to this season. If you like darker anime then you might like this season, but if you're looking for a sequel with the feel and atmosphere of Kuroshitsuji, I'd say give this one a pass. which could have set him up to be a good, fleshed out character, but his cruelness and selfishness outshine what sympathy I could have had for him as a viewer.Unlike its predecessor, the second season features much more violence and blood, not that the first didn't have any, but it's different in its usage.A rivalry is set up between Ciel and Sebastian (the returning master/butler duo) and Alois and Claude, for a very poor reason and tries to escape the inevitable end of the series (i.e Ciel's death at the hands of Sebastian) by using a cheap fanservice tactic that could be read in a bad fanfiction.The storyline is just sad - and not in the way it intends to be.

To say it quickly, I was expecting crap and I got a carefully planned series, with an interesting story and captivating characters. Where season 1 made me think ""an original story could never be as good as the manga"", season 2 changed my mind to ""well, after all an original story can still be a good idea, if well made"".Kuroshitsuji II is -- guess what -- the sequel of the anime Kuroshitsuji. Unlike the first season, this one is a completely original story, featuring 3 important original characters. It has nothing to do with the manga, since it...starts where the previous series ended. If you\'ve watched Kuroshitsuji I you probably know that it\'s no easy feat to create a story from *that* ending. Yet they managed to do it.I think it\'s impossible to write a review without spoiling at least the second half of the first episode, but if you\'re a fan of Kuroshitsuji you will probably already know it, and if you aren\'t you won\'t even care. I won\'t spoil anything else, though.The creators of this anime majorly trolled the fans 6 months before it aired. About half a year after announcing the production, they showed the first trailer of the new season at a special event (the ""Red Valentine"" event, it\'s available on DVD). The trailer only showed the two main original characters, Claude Faustus and Alois Trancy, and so did all the pictures and interviews that came out in the following months. All of this led the majority of the fans to believe that they would be the new main characters, substituting Sebastian and Ciel. Needless to say, the production staff and even the author of the manga received loads of harsh criticism for leaving out the fans\' beloved characters from the show.Eventually, that was not the case.As everybody realized after watching the first episode, Sebastian and Ciel (together with the rest of the cast) were still there and were still the main characters. Claude and Alois are still essential to the plot (I wouldn\'t call them ""villains"" though), but knowing that the characters you know and love are still there makes the new additions appear a lot less offensive. You can actually get to like them.I used to think that they were just stupid clones created to reuse the ""demon butler + young master"" setting, but watching the anime you can clearly see that they have very different personalities (definitely better planned that the lame characters of season 1 if you ask me) and totally deserve to have a part in the story.Compared to the previous series, season 2 is half the size, being only 12 episodes. The first few episodes apparently look like fillers and you are left wondering why they are losing time even though the series is so short, but then you realize that everything -- or almost everything, at least -- has a purpose and is leading to something. Or it\'s just there to troll you, but that\'s a purpose too I guess. After these few episodes, though, you finally learn ""the truth"", which also solves most of the doubts you were having, and from that point on the series becomes fast-paced, with lots of story packed into each episode, all bringing to the final, quite shocking climax.I followed this series ""live"", week after week, and I must say it was extremely enjoyable. Every time you were left craving for the next episode, with the previews (the ""next episode"" previews) only serving to deceive you, since the scenes where always mounted so as to make you misunderstand what would happen.The art is outstanding, the animation is nice and smooth, the music is maybe even better than in the previous season (a special mention goes to the insert song ""Kagayaku Sora no Shijima ni wa"" by Kalafina, beautifully sad and perfect for the scenes they used it for). The seiyuu are of course the same as in season 1, with the addition of a few quite popular names to play the original characters (well-known seiyuu as Takahiro Sakurai, Nana Mizuki and Aya Hirano). The author of the manga, Yana Toboso, once again took part in the production by designing all of the clothes, original characters and even objects that appear in the series (she asked herself to do it, by the way). She also had a say in some of the decisions regarding the plot, though of course it was written by different people. It\'s quite obvious that they put lots of efforts into this anime, and I personally think that it shows. I realized that, as much as I love the Kuroshitsuji manga and think that it\'s better than the anime (story-wise), I can still appreciate a Kuroshitsuji original anime if the story and the characters are good enough.Of course, this series is not 100% perfect (otherwise I would have given it 10). The plot holes are to blame for it. The story that we actually see is carefully planned, so the ""present"" is mostly OK. The past of some characters, however, ranges from vague to outright unknown. Some characters are there but we don\'t really know how they managed to be there, some characters\' motives are never explained yet you would think that it\'s important to show why they act like they do, even though it\'s not necessary to bring forward the plot that we see. The series composer, Mari Okada, said in an interview that sometimes it\'s nice to leave some ""gaps"" that the viewers can fill in how they want, but I still would have liked to be showed a bit more of the characters\' past. Also, since the anime is only 12 episodes long and many of them are very fast-paced, you have the impression that the series ended right away and it\'s a pity that for once that we have interesting original characters we get to see them so little.Nevertheless, despite the flaws, I\'ve really enjoyed watching this anime and I missed it after it ended. The original characters, that I used to dislike because of the creators\' trolling, grew on me very quickly, to the point that I\'m somewhat sad that we won\'t see them anymore (well, probably) and that I was disappointed at them barely showing up in the OVAs that were included with the DVDs.If you liked Kuroshitsuji I, then I recommend Kuroshitsuji II. If you disliked the anime but like the manga, I still recommend Kuroshitsuji II. I personally think that if you adapt the manga into an anime then you have to make it faithful to it. If you don\'t want to make it faithful, I\'d rather see something completely different than a bad adaptation of the manga. Kuroshitsuji II managed to be the latter. Do not let the original characters turn you off. Give a chance to this series, because in my opinion it\'s very much worth it. starts where the previous series ended. If you\'ve watched Kuroshitsuji I you probably know that it\'s no easy feat to create a story from *that* ending. Yet they managed to do it.I think it\'s impossible to write a review without spoiling at least the second half of the first episode, but if you\'re a fan of Kuroshitsuji you will probably already know it, and if you aren\'t you won\'t even care. I won\'t spoil anything else, though.The creators of this anime majorly trolled the fans 6 months before it aired. About half a year after announcing the production, they showed the first trailer of the new season at a special event (the ""Red Valentine"" event, it\'s available on DVD). The trailer only showed the two main original characters, Claude Faustus and Alois Trancy, and so did all the pictures and interviews that came out in the following months. All of this led the majority of the fans to believe that they would be the new main characters, substituting Sebastian and Ciel. Needless to say, the production staff and even the author of the manga received loads of harsh criticism for leaving out the fans\' beloved characters from the show.Eventually, that was not the case.As everybody realized after watching the first episode, Sebastian and Ciel (together with the rest of the cast) were still there and were still the main characters. Claude and Alois are still essential to the plot (I wouldn\'t call them ""villains"" though), but knowing that the characters you know and love are still there makes the new additions appear a lot less offensive. You can actually get to like them.I used to think that they were just stupid clones created to reuse the ""demon butler + young master"" setting, but watching the anime you can clearly see that they have very different personalities (definitely better planned that the lame characters of season 1 if you ask me) and totally deserve to have a part in the story.Compared to the previous series, season 2 is half the size, being only 12 episodes. The first few episodes apparently look like fillers and you are left wondering why they are losing time even though the series is so short, but then you realize that everything -- or almost everything, at least -- has a purpose and is leading to something. Or it\'s just there to troll you, but that\'s a purpose too I guess. After these few episodes, though, you finally learn ""the truth"", which also solves most of the doubts you were having, and from that point on the series becomes fast-paced, with lots of story packed into each episode, all bringing to the final, quite shocking climax.I followed this series ""live"", week after week, and I must say it was extremely enjoyable. Every time you were left craving for the next episode, with the previews (the ""next episode"" previews) only serving to deceive you, since the scenes where always mounted so as to make you misunderstand what would happen.The art is outstanding, the animation is nice and smooth, the music is maybe even better than in the previous season (a special mention goes to the insert song ""Kagayaku Sora no Shijima ni wa"" by Kalafina, beautifully sad and perfect for the scenes they used it for). The seiyuu are of course the same as in season 1, with the addition of a few quite popular names to play the original characters (well-known seiyuu as Takahiro Sakurai, Nana Mizuki and Aya Hirano). The author of the manga, Yana Toboso, once again took part in the production by designing all of the clothes, original characters and even objects that appear in the series (she asked herself to do it, by the way). She also had a say in some of the decisions regarding the plot, though of course it was written by different people. It\'s quite obvious that they put lots of efforts into this anime, and I personally think that it shows. I realized that, as much as I love the Kuroshitsuji manga and think that it\'s better than the anime (story-wise), I can still appreciate a Kuroshitsuji original anime if the story and the characters are good enough.Of course, this series is not 100% perfect (otherwise I would have given it 10). The plot holes are to blame for it. The story that we actually see is carefully planned, so the ""present"" is mostly OK. The past of some characters, however, ranges from vague to outright unknown. Some characters are there but we don\'t really know how they managed to be there, some characters\' motives are never explained yet you would think that it\'s important to show why they act like they do, even though it\'s not necessary to bring forward the plot that we see. The series composer, Mari Okada, said in an interview that sometimes it\'s nice to leave some ""gaps"" that the viewers can fill in how they want, but I still would have liked to be showed a bit more of the characters\' past. Also, since the anime is only 12 episodes long and many of them are very fast-paced, you have the impression that the series ended right away and it\'s a pity that for once that we have interesting original characters we get to see them so little.Nevertheless, despite the flaws, I\'ve really enjoyed watching this anime and I missed it after it ended. The original characters, that I used to dislike because of the creators\' trolling, grew on me very quickly, to the point that I\'m somewhat sad that we won\'t see them anymore (well, probably) and that I was disappointed at them barely showing up in the OVAs that were included with the DVDs.If you liked Kuroshitsuji I, then I recommend Kuroshitsuji II. If you disliked the anime but like the manga, I still recommend Kuroshitsuji II. I personally think that if you adapt the manga into an anime then you have to make it faithful to it.

It was on TV every day after school, and it is probably one of the first anime I’ve ever seen with FMA, One Piece and Bleach… I’ve seen so many anime since, still I had very clear memory about this one. A few days ago, I decided to watch it again.I like Kuroshitsuji. I like the characters, the butler, the shinigamis (especially the red one), I like the story, I like (love) the OST, and most of all I like the 1880s London’s context. Historical references are various, and as...a civil engineer I was so pleased to see the Crystal Palace in this anime (it burned tragically in 1936).And I guess there is nothing more to say… If it wasn’t for S2. Seriously, what happened? What is this? The ending in S1 was perfect, why did you need to do this? Ok you get that. I hated this season and I’m gonna tell you why in three points.###### FIRST: INSIPID NEW CHARACTERSTake Ciel. Make him taller. Make his character the exact opposite (i.e., a psycho, an evil piece of *). Call him Alois.Take Sebastian. Call him Claude (Pronounce “C-L-O-D-O”, as a French person, this makes me laugh so much).The way they interact together: you have probably seen S1, so you’re familiar with the “Yes, my Lord” (nice though sometimes a bit repetitive)? OK OK “Hey bro it seems the fans loved that so let’s do the same in S2 with a new pair Earl/Butler!” How the hell did they come with this stupid idea… I mentally vomited every time I heard “Yes your Highness”.I don’t want to mention this lame blue woman with huge breast. She is pure garbage.###### SECONDLY: APPALLING PACINGBad timing, bad rhythm… Even the battle scenes look fake, either too long or too short, nothing is at its place… I have friends who write fanfic infinitely better than this… I’m sure that even the seyuus have been hating this season.###### THIRDLY: damaging the original story and characters.Hahaha. Maybe I wouldn’t be so mad if this wasn’t a sequel. This season has slaughtered Kuroshitsuji, its story and its characters. It has made Sebastian unconfident and flawful, completely destroying his character, and it has made Ciel an annoying spoiled child you want to smash in the face. Other characters have been mysteriously revived (no spoil here, it’s just in the beginning of ep1), and perversity has reached summits (well Kuroshitsuji has always been somehow borderline, but in S2 the limit is largely exceeded).Voilà, I don’t mind anime that don’t follow the original material, I also like original anime without material, but honestly this one seems to have been made by some random drunkard in the street at 4am. I wouldn’t say everything in the concept is bad though, eg I liked the introducing of another demon willing to steal Ciel from Sebastian, and I like the final image of this season.

But in S2, the fetishization of violence against women and sexual abuse of minors brought down a season already plagued by a convoluted plot and continuity problems. This season takes the show too deep into the realm of distaste.It is disturbing to think that after ditching the manga's storyline, this is the original story the creators wanted to tell. One female character is maimed, repeatedly beaten, stripped and humiliated over the course of the story in ways that seem to be used as fan service. Later revelations in the story cannot justify or undo these kinds of...actions.

Alois seemed really messed up, proven by his drastic mood swings and the fact he had gauged his maid's eye out within the first half of the episode. Claude is yet another demon butler who really wants to eat his bipolar master's soul, but (spoiler) ends up unsuccessfully going after Ciel's, who shows up in the show with memory loss. Due to the at-first unexplained reappearance of Ciel and Sebastian, things get a bit confusing. Basically, what I've come to believe, is that Ciel's memory is set back to whatever it was...like at the very beginning of the first season. Therefore, Madam Red is 'alive' and he still needs his revenge and works loyally under the Queen.But everything is okay, because it is all explained gradually.(spoiler) Due to fanservice, Ciel is not eaten by poor Sebastian, who worked so-very-hard for his soul. Instead, Ciel was turned into a demon. So there we have a master demon, with a suffering Sebastian who did no deserve what he got. If you were a really hungry demon and worked for years for a kid's soul, how would you like for it to be snatched from your hands, and then have to remain his butler for the rest of eternity?I still don't understand WHY everything turned out the way it did. Thanks to the ending of this anime, there is really no point for any after-story or season 3.However, the animation itself really is beautiful, in the whole victorian-gothic setting. It's hard to find something with the same qualities as this one, so it is, in a sense, still worth watching, just as long you don't hold high expectations. like at the very beginning of the first season.

When I did watch the first episode of the second season I was a bit pissed and disappointed because they made it seem like this would not be about Sebastian & Ciel. They totally tricked me! I devoured these 12 episodes within one day. If you liked the first season, you will absolutely love the second.I feel like I liked the second season a lot more. They made it way more entertaining by adding in another master/butler pair. By the time I finished the 12 episodes, I wanted more. The way...it ended for Ciel & Sebastian in requards to his soul, I didn't like. But the way it eneded, like the first season made me want more. That may be wishful thinking, but a girl can dream.Kuroshitsuji II is definitely darker than the first season, but that works out good.

Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39972/Mayonaka_no_Occult_Koumuin_OVA,"['Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin has been one of the real hidden gems of 2019, a well-written and interesting mix of fantasy and police mystery.  Anime does seem to be overrun with that shows using that basic template at the moment and most get far more attention than Mayonaka,The subject this time around is vampires, after a corpse turns up in Shinjuku drained of all its blood with a neck wound only those with the sight can see without help.  Theo as it turns out is a vampire expert specifically, so the detectives assigned to the case  from “Unit Zero“, the ones who...get the cases that don’t make sense to muggles turn to him for help.Theo has already planned to drag Arata with him to Senda’s place for New Year’s because of an Another he’s been observing there for 15 years that he’s been dying to communicate with and it turns out that Another is Japan’s last surviving vampire.That vampire is the perp as it turns out but not by choice. Someone from Theo’s past named Saejima is using him as a means to strike out at Theo, who he apparently loathes for reasons that at first are not entirely clear.As we’ve seen before in Mayonaka, when too many parties get involved things tend to get much messier between the humans and Anothers.  And in this case that means not just Unit Zero but a sort of Another hitman named Tamao, whose job it is to take out Anothers who are targeting humans.There’s a lot of interesting background in this story stuff like the special tattoo Saejima uses to prevent Anothers from seeing him.  As it happens he’s more or less a psychopath with a special grudge against Theo, And the unfortunate vampire, whose name is Sakura as it turns out, is just a pawn in Saejima’s revenge scheme.All in all this would rank as one of Mayonaka’s better serials, I’d say.

I say this because of the lack of real character development he had in the main show, he was always just... there; as the main brain/researcher of the team, which is great and all, but it left very little to love about his character (other than the fact that he's comedically pretty). In this OVA, we get to see his main love for Anothers, and where his love...for them possibly stemmed from. We get to see so much more emotion out of him compared to the main show, and when I say emotion, I mean EMOTION. Really, this OVA WILL make you cry, and will make you absolutely fall in love with Theo's character.I guess my only complaint would be though, that there isn't enough Kohaku, at all. Sorry, I needed to see my pretty boy.I also loved that the OVA was centered around vampires, a much appreciated surprise after finishing the main show. Although, I'd like to complain and ask why this OVA isn't tagged with the 'vampires' genre? It literally has vampire in the name...Anyway, watch the main show!

Together with his co-workers and friends, he solves problems related to Anothers, or cryptids, which the average human cannot see. The overall theme of ""understanding"" is a little overplayed in media today, but if you don\'t mind that aspect, then you\'ll find the story line is very good.Art is really lackluster and is down right bad at times. Motions are mostly fluid,...but at times the head or bodies of characters can seem slightly distorted when they move.Sound is great in my opinion, with a jazzy BGM and good opening and closing songs. Acting (English) is well done and on par of most anime. The BGM errs by using some of the original scores\' worse pieces and at some points can be distracting.Characters are well developed and thought out. I do think there is a lack of use in the overall story though. In other words, Huehuecoyotl and Yuki are both funny and energetic characters that seem to be under utilized within the story line. In my opinion, it\'s just a missed opportunity.Overall, if you enjoy the occult and cryptids, don\'t mind a bit of an overplayed theme and can look past the mediocre art, you\'ll find awesome BGM, great character interaction, good character development and an overall enjoyable piece of work, especially if you liked the main series. but at times the head or bodies of characters can seem slightly distorted when they move.Sound is great in my opinion, with a jazzy BGM and good opening and closing songs.

The story is executed well to portray the characters and their association clearly (and charmingly).Since this is an OVA sequel, I will keep my review to the main points. I have already reviewed extensively under Season 1. Basically, Art and Sound are more or less the same as Season 1, there were no major differences or improvements, just lesser scenes for minor issues to stand out. So all is satisfactory with the Art...and Sound.Story is good for this OVA, considering it focuses on my favourite character, Theo (Seo). The story is not confusing, and executed rather well. As the story introduces new characters and try to give the audience more insight into Theo, doing it in merely 2 episodes and have it not feel rushed is pretty noteworthy. From this OVA, there were several side characters being introduced mainly to expand more on Theo\'s background. The troupe here is pretty basic with a nonsensical antagonist with reasonable motives and an endearing sacrifice that the story surround itself with but yet doesn\'t rely on. There will probably be side characters that will never appear in the series anymore, and their actions in this OVA may not connect to any future plots either. But they definitely do play their part well in this story. After completing an anime that introduced new characters but yet not have them blend into the story, I can say that I am more than satisfy about the way this story uses its characters. No characters were wasted, and all their actions and storylines come together really well (albeit is just 2 OVAs, but I am especially keen on such details).CharacterAs how a person is defined by their personality, actions, and past. The new characters that were introduced here have some basic persona, but their backgrounds and their actions are interesting. The backgrounds, especially, are a little more than interesting, they are also kind of fun or amusing (Can\'t really describe this). There were characters that are shrouded in mystery as nothing more was shown about them other than some interesting scenes. But you can tell, it is laying the groundwork for them to make their appearance again in the future story (This is just  a sneak preview of those characters, hahhaha~). And the story does complement the characters well that leaves the audience a little bit more curious about the new characters but not cutting off with a ""cliffhanger"" and induce some sort of hunger for more. The existing main cast does\'t have much to show, except for Theo, and as mentioned above, the story aims to expand more on him, so of course we got more understanding of Theo, and probably a minor development of his views on the supernaturals. and Sound.Story is good for this OVA, considering it focuses on my favourite character, Theo (Seo).

Then they be like fuck this isn\'t enough and decide to become astronauts.That\'s pretty much it.They do bang a lot and there is no censored version available. It\'s nipples or GTFO.

I recommend this series to everyone who likes bro and manly or alternatively manly and bro.', 'Moonlight Mile is focused on two mountain climbers who meet one another during a climb up Mount Everest and make a challenge to one another to see who can make it onto the moon first. The series then focuses on the different journeys both men make to accomplish their goal of trying to land upon the moon first with Gorou being a Japanese engineer and Woodbridge being among the ranks of the American military. The biggest gripe I have with this series as a whole is that I could care less for both Gorou and Woodbridge as characters. Gorou gets quite a bit of focus...in this series as he is portrayed as a womanizing and easygoing Neanderthal-appearing man who is quite impulsive in his actions which are usually reckless and don\'t land him in any sort of trouble. Woodbridge suffers from a flat personality and is just as prone to womanizing as Gorou is.But main characters I could care less about aren\'t the only gripes I have with Moonlight Mile. The series attempts to spin a realistic and mature take on the journeys faced by Gorou and Woodbridge in their journeys to venture into space. However, these takes don\'t spin too well with how this series sets up its story. The ""realistic"" elements rely fairly heavily on coincidences to advance events and in Gorou\'s case, his knack for committing reckless acts that don\'t land him in any sort of trouble despite any collateral damage they would cause, such as his use of a mecha to cause damage to a facility in his chase of a saboteur. The ""mature"" storytelling is also questionable with the title\'s habit of featuring a number of sex scenes with Gorou and Woodbridge\'s habits of hooking up with random women at different points in the series and Gorou\'s knack of being quite impulsive with his behavior at a number of points in the series whenever he gets focus.It also seems this series was aiming to have much more to tell with its story with Woodbridge\'s involvement in the American military with some shady developments taking shape as can be seen from the opening minutes of Moonlight Mile\'s first episode and the final few episodes of the series. While making for the better developments of the series, these developments and the journey of our two male leads are left unresolved for the anime\'s second season.The major highlight for this series would be the visuals. Scenery shots sport vivid color and plenty of detail, as well as excellent integration of CG-rendered objects like mecha and spaceships that fit in almost perfectly with the regular animation. Animation is quite fluid in many instances, especially in flight sequences involving space shuttles and jets. The only sour spot with the visuals were character designs. It looked like the series was attempting to implement a realistic approach to their designs, but it made the facial features of their characters look rather crude in their details and they are occasionally off-model during distant shots.Overall, Moonlight Mile appeared to be an attempt at creating a seinen title, but the immaturity and lack of believability in its plot and characters made it feel more like a shounen title. While the final episodes seemed to hint at interesting developments to come with its plot, I don\'t feel invested enough in the characters of Gorou and Woonbridge to even want to attempt watching the second season of Moonlight Mile. in this series as he is portrayed as a womanizing and easygoing Neanderthal-appearing man who is quite impulsive in his actions which are usually reckless and don\'t land him in any sort of trouble.

Woodbridge a.k.a. Lostman as they try to get into space after both conquer Mount Everest.The show is very mature and uses persistent strong language as well as some really unnecessary sex scenes, although considering the manga it's based on, there was definitely going to be some sex scenes.Story: I don't find the story very original this is a show that generally follows the format of Best friends climb mountain together, and then best friends make a pact to go into space. How many times has that been done, at times it feels as...if this show has no continuing story.Art: I won't lie, the animation is outstanding, the C.G.I. and character designs are top-notch, but good animation does not always make a good story. But it does help.Sound: Now I watched the dub version, but I take into account how the show sounds, like the effects. The dub is generally well-done effort, in his first lead role Andrew Love is cast in the role of Goro and he fits the character perfectly as he seems to be able to capture Goro's frat boy mentality. John Gremillion playing Lostman generally seems to be able to pull off the military man stereotype very well. There isn't many other major characters in this show except Monica Rial playing Riyoko Ikeuchi but she soon fades into the background after episode four.Character: I don't like these characters, I especially have a problem with Goro, sure he can be really likeable some times, but about 75% of the time the guy is acting like a jackass, although to be honest this certain trait goes dramatically down starting with episode five. Goro, is perfectly well named considering he certainly looks like a &quot;Gorilla&quot;, he does come off as a neanderthal and there are times in this show where I just have to throw up my arms and ask why they included completely unnecessary scenes of Goro taking off his clothes and getting a little wild (do not worry there is no frontal male nudity for the faint of heart).As for Lostman he's a little more tolerable, he generally seems to have his hormones much more under control then Goro and I feel generally he seems to be very straightforward and he knows what he wants in life.Enjoyment: I did enjoy this title, although it does have it's flaws it's still much better then most of the stuff that has come out of Japan in the last while.Overall: I gave it a seven, which generally is where this series is, it's lead characters are not the most likeable and while it does suffer from some cliches. This is one of the few Space Exploration based animes out there, A lot of people will come into this show expecting Planetes. If you are, you will be sorely dissapointed. I admit I came into this show expecting it to be somewhat like Planetes and while the first four episodes aren't like Planetes, the next couple of episodes after that come out definitely feel more like Planetes. For people offended by in your face sex scenes of which there are about 5 brief scenes (with only one of them having any audio) from my count from the eight episodes. I found them to be utterly unnecessary and something I just didn't want to see. Anyway give this one a try if you want. if this show has no continuing story.Art: I won't lie, the animation is outstanding, the C.G.I. and character designs are top-notch, but good animation does not always make a good story. But it does help.Sound: Now I watched the dub version, but I take into account how the show sounds, like the effects. The dub is generally well-done effort, in his first lead role Andrew Love is cast in the role of Goro and he fits the character perfectly as he seems to be able to capture Goro's frat boy mentality. John Gremillion playing Lostman generally seems to be able to pull off the military man stereotype very well. There isn't many other major characters in this show except Monica Rial playing Riyoko Ikeuchi but she soon fades into the background after episode four.Character: I don't like these characters, I especially have a problem with Goro, sure he can be really likeable some times, but about 75% of the time the guy is acting like a jackass, although to be honest this certain trait goes dramatically down starting with episode five.

Woodbridge aka ""Lostman"" Two talented individuals that have their own unique personality and identity traits, both enthusiastic mountain climbing partners, they want to try and hit the highest mountain peek in the world but are unsatisfied until one day they want to explore the heavens, the vast ocean of the stars, they both want to each pursue their dreams of one day entering outer space and be the first man to walk on the moon.  While the story takes place in a slightly more technologically advanced future, the rigors of space flight are...every bit as insurmountable as they would be today.What makes the core of the tale work so well is that the interaction between the two lead characters is anything but direct for the vast majority of the season. Rather than lump them together in their competitive race to be the first to the moon, the show\'s creative staff pays careful attention to crafting two very separate and unique stories. Sure their paths cross on more than one occasion along the way but the overall feel is almost that of a competition from opposite sides of the globe.The viewer is transported along to several locales around the planet including a snowy Russia, sunny coastal Japan, scorching Middle Eastern desert and even the mystical Area 51 all under the near-flawless portrayal of the technological space race taking place between nations. It turns out that the future spawns a sort of United Nations banner (the International Space Agency or ISA for short) specifically catered to space travel and the common goal of using material within the moon\'s core as a near limitless global energy source.In case you haven\'t noticed, the show takes a very tangible approach to the sciences contained within.The acting is simply flawless in both the original Japanese version and the English dub. Moonlight Mile manages to impress. The voice work is emotional and passionate throughout without crossing the delicate line between acting and overacting. Casting choices of the lead and secondary roles are spot on (especially with Goro and Lost Man themselves as the actors simply nail the unique yet similar traits of their respective personalities). I especially found myself appreciating the rare moments when the two lead characters interacted. It was almost as if there was a sense of their underlying friendship even though each acted as though he cared little whether the other lived or not.The animation quality in this show is absolutely splendid, blending CG and animation so seamlessly together is not something easy to do but yet this show really seems to pull it off so perfectly.The sound tracks at least in the first half of the show could of been a bit suited towards the theme of the show, but towards the 2nd half, it picks up with music that is really inspiring for the typical setting and space exploration or science.As i said before this show strives on the realization of inquiring one\'s own dream\'s even though some of the actors like goro see\'s things very differently and acts like he does not care half the time or jokes around, his ideal beliefs and philosophies are still a very prominent attraction to his character. As is the case with Lostman.The first half of this show really focuses mostly on developing the characters in other parts of the world, showing what kind of situations they are in, what kind of lives they live. The 2nd half of the series involves more of a subplot involving mysteries and touches base on the more rivalry between the two characters, and also other theme\'s like governmental secrecy and conflicts between nations.I felt that some of the characters in the first season should not have been introduced, because some of them never really got their spot light they deserved. This is think is one of the flaws of this season. We are barely touched based on these side actors of the story and they become more and more insignificant as the story progress. This is the first season and i expect them to fully be explored in season 2 hopefully. This show is really bout the two main leads and the ISA\'s experimental projects to entering space, as well as the US military and the Javanese government\'s involvement. Mankind has reached for this type of technology for thousands of years. The show also explore\'s lots of politics, mystery, and conspiracy theories.This series kinds of breaks the boundaries of what is considered a ""perfect"" anime world. Where everything is always in some sort of order like out of a story book or novel and characters are to strong in certain scenario\'s and the fan service is always their.  This show\'s core theme is really centered around dreams and how far you are willing to go to achieve those dreams and make them a reality.It kind of really portrays a much more visual approach to realism. Even the sex is shown in a very natural manner. The series is not afraid to show different racial types as is the case in this world today, so many African Americans marrying other races. I could swear it feels like i am watching an actual movie like ""Armeggedon"" on screen. Some people are just so stuck so attached to a perfect anime world, they don\'t realize how a story can be portrayed in a more realistic fashion by not following the general and most notable mainstream anime trends. Its just a rarity amongst anime so its nice to see a show like this come along every now and then.I highly recommend this series if you want to watch something with a more complex, but intricate plot with interesting characters that explore their own dreams in very different way\'s and use their wits and skills to undertake any tasks, each having their own ideal philosophies on how to achieve their goal. every bit as insurmountable as they would be today.What makes the core of the tale work so well is that the interaction between the two lead characters is anything but direct for the vast majority of the season.

Nanatsu no Taizai Movie 2: Hikari ni Norowareshi Mono-tachi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/46420/Nanatsu_no_Taizai_Movie_2__Hikari_ni_Norowareshi_Mono-tachi,"['""Goodbye, Seven Deadly Sins""(Spoilers ahead btw)Seven Deadly Sins: Cursed by Light is the final instalment into the NNT series. I was hesitant at first because it was completed during the production of the final season of SDS(I\'m looking at you MHA and your mediocre Season 5), but after watching the film. I am proud to say it was pretty good. Though the final season did have to suffer for the second half. The story starts six months after the Demon King\'s battle. We get to see many things shown, like Diane, King, Meliodas and Elizabeth\'s Marriage. What happens to Arthur and Merlin(Not a lot though),...Zeldris and Gelda\'s relationship, basically most of the cast from the previous seasons had some updates on their whereabouts(Mostly because this movie really ""shocked"" the world).Let\'s begin with the story of the anime.Story: 5/10It had a pretty generic storyline if I were, to be honest, big baddies show up and heroes go serious. As a set-up for a sequel, it did do a pretty good job. This is just starting to the age of chaos after all(hehe sequel time). It had barely anything special but maybe simple is the best, after all this movie was a culmination of all the previous season\'s. I\'m not defending it because it\'s a set-up, I\'m defending it because I liked how simple it was. Although I gave it a pretty low rating, I still liked the story(Still barely anything as a story)Art/Animation: 7/10I loved the animation for the movie, it was a middle ground between Season 2 and Season 3. Some part\'s had very nice animation, while some parts were wonky(Looking at you CGI Supreme Deity). Overall nice animation, not too many wonky faces and some nice backgrounds. Though, I\'m sure it could be better if it was handled by a better studio(No offence Deen)Sound: 8/10I loved the soundtrack for this movie(Series as a whole). Hiroyuki never disappoints with their soundtrack, it fits perfectly with each moment (I love this man no cap). The final rendition of perfect time made me pretty hyped, I love the soundtrack :D. ""Sono Saki no Hikari e"" by Akihito Okano was a bop, a fitting song for a final movie.Character: 6/10The development between Meliodas and Zeldris is the main focus here. Although I wished for some development between Supreme and Elizabeth, I\'m happy that we got to see Meliodas and Zeldris\'s brotherly bond grow even more. I can\'t say for the rest sadly. King, Diane, Gowther and Ban already had theirs done long ago. I loved that they showed us Hawk and Mild\'s bond grow as well as they live in Purgatory. Meliodas and Elizabeth\'s only development was killing mommy goddess sadly. Seeing Gelda and Zeldris\'s relationship does put a smile on my face.(P.S The villains in the movie kinda sucks doe(what happened to them lmao), The Supreme Deity also had small screentime too sus)Enjoyment: 9/10Can\'t say I didn\'t enjoy the bonds between brothers grow. I enjoyed it full-heartfully has a fan of SDS. I\'m not being biased just because I am a fan it\'s just that I did have fun watching this finale and riding to the end with the sins. I loved the comedy, the teasing and all of it till the end(I can\'t say the same for the animation for Season 3). I\'m happy that the final movie was good.Overall: 7/10I can say many good things about SDS but I can\'t neglect that this movie still lacked many things. The overall pacing was haywire, the stiffness of the animation(Sometimes), that horrible CGI Supreme Deity. Still, the overall product was pretty good I wished I could have seen this type of animation for Season 3 and 4(No CGI Supreme doe).Thank\'s for reading my review!

Still, the overall product was pretty good I wished I could have seen this type of animation for Season 3 and 4(No CGI Supreme doe).Thank\'s for reading my review!', ""After finally getting to watch The Seven Deadly Sins: Cursed by Light on Netflix today I can at last put an end to the utter boredom which comes with seeing each new instalment of the Seven Deadly Sins. This film once again reaffirmed my stance that this series is complete and utter trash, with this specific films' entire existence being extremely unclear to me. Why, after the admittedly satisfying ending to the anime, did we need another film to continue the story? As far as I can tell, the only answer is that Studio Deen wanted to squeeze as much money out of this series...as possible, as the entire film from beginning to end felt completely unnecessary plot-wise. Everything that happened during this film has been done to death throughout this series already, leaving me feeling a continuous sense of repetition and boredom during the duration of the film. Warning: there will be major spoilers to follow, though spoilers regarding a film like this really don't mean all that much to one's enjoyment of it. I would instead suggest that the majority of enjoyment that anyone could obtain from this film would come merely from the mindless battles at its center.STORY: (2)Starting from the beginning, the movie clearly feels the need to remind all the viewers of who the Sins are, giving two different recaps of the characters in the opening ten minutes despite the last season having only just finished. This repetition and filler content from the outset sets the film off on an already sour note, one which is only to be exacerbated later on. While it is nice that it follows this up with Diane and King's wedding, a fun bit of service for fans of the series, it quickly speeds it's way through to the core of the film's purpose - the action. How does it transition to this you may ask? Well it really doesn't matter, because the film seems to give barely a moments notice for you to care about why the fighting is taking place, choosing to instead race forward into the action. While it does technically explain that Dahlia, some other important fairy person is there to get revenge on the Sins for ending the holy war, this explanation is basically never elaborated on and merely serves as an instigator for the action to follow. This following fight proceeds to take up the majority of the runtime, leaving little room for the plot to take center stage again - that is until we have the extreme, dramatic, totally shocking twist near the end that the TRUE villain the whole time was actually Elizabeth's mother, the Supreme Goddess. Though it is somewhat poetic for both main characters to have an evil parent, this reveal is relatively anti-climactic and serves little purpose in furthering the lore of the world. She also fails to offer any further explanation as to why she decided to attack, giving the ridiculous response that the Holy War existed to create 'balance', a sentiment which Meliodas immediately dismisses as being a lie. He instead suggests that she had 'no reason' behind her motives, once again making me wonder further as to what her reason was for attacking other than just being evil. After the heroes obviously take her down, we cut forward to Meliodas and Elizabeth's wedding which, as with the wedding at the start of the film, is a nice and fun addition which any fan is sure to enjoy watching, though its necessity in existing is once again questionable given we already got the same experience from the ending to the last season. Finally, the film features one post credits scene hinting at what I assume is the currently serializing sequel manga, 'Four Knights of the Apocalypse'. Though I personally am not interested in this, I am sure that diehard fans of this series will be pleased at the hint as to what is to come. Overall, the plot of this film felt completely superfluous, barely existing with the simple goal of giving at least some excuse for just a few more fights with these characters.ART/ANIMATION: (4)As already mentioned so far, Cursed by Light is a film primarily focused on delivering nonstop, blood pumping action. This certainly isn't a bad thing, with many popular and fun movies also keeping their focus on the fights, however Studio Deen continues to fulfill their reputation in this movie with more slideshow level animation. On the positive side, it is still a large improvement over some of the low points of the TV series. There are moments of genuinely good animation scattered throughout the film, however these are vastly outweighed by the simple, barely moving pictures which they are notorious for using. For those that despise CGI being used in 2D anime, there are also some subpar appearances of the technique being used in this film. Both a handful of fairies early on, as well as the main villain of the film are made of a slightly off-putting CG which, while not being a total deal breaker, do somewhat take you out of the experience. To put it simply, this film is nowhere near the level of the Demon Slayer movie from last year (not that I was expecting it to be) and was far more in line with other similar films like the Fairy Tail ones. Though the animation isn't necessarily as dreadful as it could be, it still underperforms given the presumably greater budget of a theatrical release.SOUND: (7)The sound and music of the Seven Deadly Sins which I must admit is undeniably good. As with the series, this film has some seriously grand orchestral tunes which perfectly add to the intensity of the action. As always, the song Perfect Time makes a reappearance in the final battle and is a delight to listen to again. It somehow seems to always make me more excited about whatever it happening on screen, even if the animation itself disappoints. The ending theme during the credits is also a nice song which remains in line with the other themes of the series, offering an upbeat, poppy feel to the credits. With some of the most talented voice actors in the industry, I am also unable to critique the voice acting in the movie as well.CHARACTER: (4)The Seven Deadly Sins: Cursed by Light offers absolutely nothing new to the characters of the series, with there being zero development to any of the heroes during the film. While nothing about them is inherently wrong during the movie, it is unfortunate that we don't get to see any new side of these characters who we have already seen go through so much. In many ways it is perfectly understandable that there would be little to no development of the characters given that their arcs were completely concluded in the last season, it still would have been nice for something to have happened to have given meaning to the film. The new characters introduced in Cursed by Light are mainly relegated to the role of generic villains, with none of them having any real motivation to their actions or defining elements as a whole. They are essentially there to get beat up with nothing unique to them individually, making their characters extremely uninteresting and hard to care for. All up, the characters in this film are bland to the extreme, with the existing characters staying stagnant and the new ones offering, ironically, nothing new.ENJOYMENT: (3)As I have already mentioned, this film was utterly boring. Though I didn't hate every second of it, I did find myself getting frequently distracted and wishing for it to end. This is a sensation which I have felt numerous times while watching all of the Seven Deadly Sin and maybe its just a problem with me, but I do feel that this series needs more moments of interest to keep me from zoning out of the story. On the positive side, the film is only around an hour and ten minutes long excluding the opening recap and credits making it relatively fast to get through. If only it felt that way while watching...OVERALL: (3)The Seven Deadly Sins: Cursed by Light is a short yet completely boring cash grab of a film with little enjoyment to be derived from. There is not a single element present within this film which hasn't been done a million times before, making it feel entirely pointless to watch. It also adds almost nothing to the lore or story of the Seven Deadly Sins, leaving it an entirely worthless movie which should never have been made in the first place. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the series and feel that you absolutely must watch anything related to it, or simply a completionist like me, I would not recommend watching this movie whatsoever. as possible, as the entire film from beginning to end felt completely unnecessary plot-wise. Everything that happened during this film has been done to death throughout this series already, leaving me feeling a continuous sense of repetition and boredom during the duration of the film. Warning: there will be major spoilers to follow, though spoilers regarding a film like this really don't mean all that much to one's enjoyment of it.

All up, the characters in this film are bland to the extreme, with the existing characters staying stagnant and the new ones offering, ironically, nothing new.ENJOYMENT: (3)As I have already mentioned, this film was utterly boring. Though I didn't hate every second of it, I did find myself getting frequently distracted and wishing for it to end. This is a sensation which I have felt numerous times while watching all of the Seven Deadly Sin and maybe its just a problem with me, but I do feel that this series needs more moments of interest to keep me from zoning out of the story. On the positive side, the film is only around an hour and ten minutes long excluding the opening recap and credits making it relatively fast to get through. If only it felt that way while watching...OVERALL: (3)The Seven Deadly Sins: Cursed by Light is a short yet completely boring cash grab of a film with little enjoyment to be derived from. There is not a single element present within this film which hasn't been done a million times before, making it feel entirely pointless to watch. It also adds almost nothing to the lore or story of the Seven Deadly Sins, leaving it an entirely worthless movie which should never have been made in the first place. Unless you are a die-hard fan of the series and feel that you absolutely must watch anything related to it, or simply a completionist like me, I would not recommend watching this movie whatsoever."", 'For me I found this movie far better than the first one but by the same token it had some problems in my mindStory:For the story I found it good for mainly explaining and exploring the supreme deiaty and the 2nd fairy king and the giant craftsman bc although they were mentioned in the main story they weren’t really told anything else about them but also for the story I find the speed alright it had some amazing fights and some sort of fan service in a way like melidus and Elizabeth king and dian ban and Elaine zeldris and Glenda and also showed...meliodus and zeldris brother hood evolve and showed some character development for them and they story was alround good but could of been better such as more character development and a bit slower pace so a longer movie in my opinionArt:It was better way better than season 3 and 4 but still could of been a lot better some parts felt rushed and just not good while the fights were good the rest wasn’t really compared to other animeSound:Let’s be honest if sds excells at one thing it’s the music and sound no matter what season it was Fantastic no matter what anyone saysCharacters:As I said in the story it was good but could of been better I think the movie needed to be longer to help with not only the story but the characters aswell and developing them mabey on hour longer it really dependsEnjoyment:Yea I enjoyed it loved the fights and most of it kept me watching some parts tho were boring and had me lose interest but overall kept me watchingOverall:I think a lot of people are still annoyed at season 3 and 4 with how they were handled and it’s rubbing off on the movie I’ve seen loads of people say it’s rubbish and that and that sds is rubbish now witch is just stupid yes the animation was shocking to say the least but the story is amazing and one of the best and that’s what people like to see the story side not just the animation tbh yes it annoyed me and I was frustrated but that still dosnt change that the story is good we go back to season 1 and 2 people weren’t just praising it for the animation bc there were many anime that had good or even better animation people liked the story and how it was told but when the animation dropped to seasons 3 and 4 all you could here was people complaining about it and nothing really about the story and the same is with this movie I find it’s a great way to explain the supream deiati and all in between people 23 and 24 of season 4 and helps wrap up some plot holes for the spin off series so overall it was good but it definitely could of been better meliodus and zeldris brother hood evolve and showed some character development for them and they story was alround good but could of been better such as more character development and a bit slower pace so a longer movie in my opinionArt:It was better way better than season 3 and 4 but still could of been a lot better some parts felt rushed and just not good while the fights were good the rest wasn’t really compared to other animeSound:Let’s be honest if sds excells at one thing it’s the music and sound no matter what season it was Fantastic no matter what anyone saysCharacters:As I said in the story it was good but could of been better I think the movie needed to be longer to help with not only the story but the characters aswell and developing them mabey on hour longer it really dependsEnjoyment:Yea I enjoyed it loved the fights and most of it kept me watching some parts tho were boring and had me lose interest but overall kept me watchingOverall:I think a lot of people are still annoyed at season 3 and 4 with how they were handled and it’s rubbing off on the movie I’ve seen loads of people say it’s rubbish and that and that sds is rubbish now witch is just stupid yes the animation was shocking to say the least but the story is amazing and one of the best and that’s what people like to see the story side not just the animation tbh yes it annoyed me and I was frustrated but that still dosnt change that the story is good we go back to season 1 and 2 people weren’t just praising it for the animation bc there were many anime that had good or even better animation people liked the story and how it was told but when the animation dropped to seasons 3 and 4 all you could here was people complaining about it and nothing really about the story and the same is with this movie I find it’s a great way to explain the supream deiati and all in between people 23 and 24 of season 4 and helps wrap up some plot holes for the spin off series so overall it was good but it definitely could of been better', ""Normally don't write reviews but for what I've just watched I think I can spare a few minutes of my time. Firstly the pace of the story was too fast within 20 minutes the final enemy was defeated which is just shocking as it took a whole season to defeat the demon king. Meliodas and Zeldris were just cringe, I get they were trying to mend their relationship however it came off just sh.t. It was a real shame Escanor couldn't be there because at least he could of made it exciting to watch, he was literally the only reason I watched the final season....They also just messed up the theme song( perfect time) which was so disturbing to hear, one of the biggest disappoints in the movie. 7ds never fails to surprise me.

In terms of its production quality, it looks absolutely no better than the TV show. Oh, how I miss the time when theatrical productions looked dramatically better than their TV series counterparts.

They were cute moments but nothing more than that. It took about 20 minutes before anything really happened. And even then, not really something happens. Besides, we get to see an Attack on Titan scene - giants (titans) destroy tall wall, enter and cause destruction.The power levels of the characters are...completely distorted for convenience. For example, there is no way that Meliodas and Zeldris should have lost the first fight. And how in the world is Mael struggling versus common goddess clan members?!I wish Elizabeth would have done more, at least a little bit. This was the fight against the Supreme Deity after all. But that was not to be.Also, where did the second fairy king and the giant craftsman dude come from? Admittingly, I don't remember all details from the anime but the world-building also seems changed. I don't think there were these demons in the demon realm before and where the hell do the goddesses come from?The animation - while undoubtedly better than the last few anime seasons (that's not so difficult though...) - seems off. I mean the attack from Zeldris binding the Supreme Deity and turning the tide of the battle was a powerpoint slide.Family is one theme in the story.

This movie has the same problem as all of them.While the story was pretty normal and a good ending, since the supreme deity wasn't even ever really shown in the manga, this was pretty satisfying.However, the fights scenes were once again bland, the 3D animation (which was never used in Seven Deadly Sins originally) ruined the final fight and the whole scene with the Supreme Deity. The voice acting on her was pretty bad as well and her powers were lacking a whole...lot.Obviously, the first movie wasn't canon either, but it was the last time we had good animation, which just by that makes it better than this one.The movie pacing was very bad as well. The start was too slow, while it just rushed through everything after half of the movie. Escaping the prison stuff and the whole Demon Realm part was just too rushed and had the same feeling as in the first movie. At the start of the fight, they didn't stand a chance, while afterward, they beat the 2nd Fairy King and Dubs instantly without breaking a sweat.Merlin and Arthur were shown in one scene and one last time in the end, yet they didn't have any actual interactions in the movie. Completely wasted screen time.Even though it's a short movie, it feels long to watch because it sucked hard enough and the rushed parts felt like they took more time to watch than the build-up of the movie, because it was just so bad and boring.Verdict: The movie is ok if you're a Sins fan but is pretty bad overall. The first half was actually pretty enjoyable but it started turning to garbage in the Demon Realm fight and when the 3D fairies entered the fray. The sound effects were meh and the voice acting + effects of the supreme deity were garbage, which is a real shame.Art was ok but also started going to shit when the 3D fairies came over.Sad to say this was a 5 and the only reason it's a 5 because I like Seven Deadly Sins and wondered where the Supreme Deity was in the manga.

It reminds me to the kind of music videos I used to watch when I was a kid. Whatever, enojy the short music episode,...have a nice day, and three, two, JANGO! have a nice day, and three, two, JANGO!', 'an absolute masterpiece everything comes together perfectly like the music, the animation, the humor and the fact that you can feel a hundred emotions in just 5 minutes.during this shows watching i felt like i had reached a higher plane off existence and it cured me of my illness of not having seen this show.i know im kinda just ranting here but this show is just so goddamn good definitely the best dancing and comedy i have seen in my life.all in all its just what you want to see from a show and you should definitely go and watch it i would say it...goes above any other show in existence! goes above any other show in existence!']"

Saint Seiya Recap,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6153/Saint_Seiya_Recap,"[""Esta review también está en español.This page's synopsis says it all: this is a summary of the series (except for the Asgard/filler saga), that will inform all the newcomers what the hell happened before the (for that time) recently released Hades saga. There's no new animation nor music: everything is recycled from the classic series (except for the narrator voice, obviously).This OVA (tries to) inform (at the speed of light) the facts of the series, at the same time it shows a few battle scenes. Come on, there's no way you can sum a 100 episodes series in 24 damn minutes!One of the stuff that...bother me the most about this OVA is that the narrator imply that Seiya did all the work, and the other saints only assisted him. That's a lot of crap. Come on, a lot of people hate Seiya already (not me, I like his determinator/hot blooded personality), this will only piss off the people who already doesn't like him!I just can recommend this to someone who's dying to watch the Hades saga, and don't want to see the original series. But who want to see the third saga of a series, without watching the first two? Don't watch this. Give the original series a chance. If you like it, great, if you don't, then you probably will not like the Hades saga!--------La sinopsis lo dice todo: esto es un resumen de la serie (dejando de lado la saga de Asgard, que es filler), para preparar a la gente a la (por ese entonces) nueva saga de Hades. Nada de animación o música nueva, todo es rehusado de la serie clásica (excepto la vos del narrador que nos informa que pasa).La OVA informa de los hechos, al tiempo que muestra alguna que otra escena de alguna pelea. Vamos, no hay forma de  hacer un resumen eficiente de 100 capítulos en solo 24 minutos.Una de las cosas que me molesta de este resumen es que el narrador insinúa que Seiya hizo todo, y sus compañeros solo lo asistieron. Señores, ya mucha gente odia a Seiya (yo no, es uno de mis favoritos), esto solo irrita más a las personas que no lo quieren!.Solo puedo recomendar esto a alguien que está desesperado por ver la saga de Hades, pero que no quiere comerse la serie original. ¿Pero quién querría ver la tercera saga de una serie, salteándose las dos primeras? No vean esto, gente, vean la serie original. Vale la pena. bother me the most about this OVA is that the narrator imply that Seiya did all the work, and the other saints only assisted him.

Kaginado,https://myanimelist.net/anime/48775/Kaginado,"[""Kaginado. The series that covers many stories, the story of those who can fly in the sky, the stories of fake worlds, even the story of forgotten memories.A series that brings all of Key's works together and does it fabulously. These 12 weeks of Kaginado airing had been brilliant. A quick reminder though, you will need to have watched/played the following visual novels Key has created, Kanon, Air, Clannad, Planetarian, Little Busters!, Rewrite and Angel Beats.STORY: Kaginado doesn't have a true set story or anything like that. It's simply a hilarious comedy show based in a high school setting that brings many of Key's works...together. All these universes come together into a show of true comedy. I really enjoyed the way they utilized the fact all these stories came together. 10/10ART: The characters are all chibi so if you don't like chibi art then this might not be the anime for you. The backgrounds are all pretty colourful and in my opinion, beautiful. Of course, the art isn't perfect. In my opinion, the art isn't perfect however, it's still really good. 9/10SOUND: All the voice actors are the same as they were in the original anime... With the exception of Misuzu Kamio's original voice actor Kawakami Tomoko, may you rest in peace. The other sounds fit the theme of the little bright comedy show. 10/10CHARACTER: The characters are exactly the same as I remember them from the other series, still fabulous. Maybe these characters were not their best in the original shows but, when they come together with other Key characters, they become truly fabulous. Especially Sunohara in my opinion.ENJOYMENT: As someone who adores Key and all their works, I have had many incredible memories with each of their series. When I first heard of this, I was so excited. And once it began airing, me and my friend are always messaging each other every week. A series like this means a lot, not just to me but every fan that Key has. I'm incredibly excited for season 2 and thus I give my enjoyment rating also a 10/10.OVERALL: 10/10. Fabulous. together.

One major example of this is Misuzu\'s voice actress. Her past VA is no longer with us so she had big shoes to fill in the girl in the sky.

Yes that is the full title of the genre.Was it worth watching about half a dozen visual novel adaptations of varying lengths to get here? Well let me answer that question with a question: Would you rather have played all of the original visual novels instead, totally around 300 hours worth of content? The answer...to both is no, it\'s not worth it. Only a masochist like me would watch both versions of Kanon in the same month to prepare for watching this.In all seriousness, intimate knowledge of EVERY visual novel by Key is pretty much a hard requirement for any of this show to make sense. Humor is derived directly from referencing important moments in whatever franchise and subverting them in some way. Watching this without prior knowledge is sort of like watching those How It Should Have Ended videos on youtube without having seen the movie it\'s about. Maybe you\'ll find some humor, but if you are laughing it\'s not because you get the joke it\'s because you want to pretend you do. Maybe it sounds like gatekeeping that this show requires you to watching hours and hours of content before coming here. Yes.

It is basically answering the question of ""What would happen if you clump all of Key\'s visual novel characters together in one setting?"" where I am sure some of you have seen a similar anime to this. (Another anime is Isekai Quartet where it wants to show what would happen if you clump a bunch of isekai genre story characters into the mix). Therefore, the anime will highlight all the moments and/or similarities that all the characters experience in their respective stories whilst comedically contrasting their different reactions/behaviours to the situation (one example is where all...the main characters, of their respective stories, have a conference meeting discussing their own experiences and judging each other about said experiences). It is very simple and short and direct to the point so if you know the references then it makes the jokes all the funnier.Characters: There is nothing much to say about the characters since they are portrayed exactly the same from their own games (visual novels and anime). Therefore, the interaction between each character makes the anime all the more fun to watch since the whole point was to see which characters will befriend each other and who will antagonise each other. In addition, to seeing the difference/ similarities between characters that have similar dispositions.Art and Sound: Art is fine considering they are all in Chibi-format (though in one episode they take advantage between Chibi forms and normal human proportions to illustrate a particular point). Whereas the sound is pretty much the music you can find in all the previous visual novels/ animes. In other words, faithful to the original material makes the whole series nostalgic and fun to watch.Overall: In the end, this anime is basically a tribute to all the people that have been following Key\'s Visual novel (or anime) series from the beginning. Strictly speaking, you can watch this without any foreknowledge of the other series, but then (in my humble opinion) the jokes become less impactful and make watching it feel redundant. I would recommend people (that have no ideas about Key visual novel series) who will watch this (or did watch it) to go through the other Key visual novel (or anime adaptations of the visual novels) first to get a good idea of why the jokes were inserted there in the first place. However, it is not (strictly) necessary since the anime does not really delve too much into their own storylines so you can argue that if you understand why the joke is there you can just enjoy it that way. This recommendation is mainly for those who are genuinely curious about the characters presented in the story and want to know why and how they are necessary for their own respective storylines. the main characters, of their respective stories, have a conference meeting discussing their own experiences and judging each other about said experiences).

It takes characters from 6 different series: Kanon, Air, Planetarian, Clannad, Little Busters, and Rewrite, and puts them in the same school while making lots of jokes and callouts to the character personalities and development.I quite like...the overall presentation of the show. It uses a chibi style that works well with the characters' designs and the overall goofy parody nature of the show. Every major characters from the above mentioned series get at least 1 speaking part, and most of them get their original Japanese VA back (minus a few who had VAs pass away since their anime or VN).The idea of getting characters from different series interacting with each other was a nice treat. Whether it was the Marine Life Alliance of Fuuko, Ayu, and Shizuru, the main protagonists having a secret meeting with bags over their heads, a Kotori vs Yukito duel, or many heroines interacting at a school swimming pool. I quite enjoyed seeing the interactions of characters who would otherwise never interact.Unfortunately Kaginado has 3 major flaws for me:1) The overall length of the series. Each episode is only 3-ish minutes each. With this many characters to cover, many only get maybe 1-3 lines at most. And with this season only being 12 episodes, it seems like a gigantic waste and unfairly balanced.  A few characters appear in almost every episode like Sunohara or Shizuru while characters like Komari get 3 speaking lines in only 1 late episode despite being one of the more popular and important heroines of Little Busters.2) This one is up for debate but I thought the parody comedy was... hit or miss. If you watched Carnival Phantasm, a parody of Tsukihime and Fate/Stay Night, I'd say the comedy style is similar to that. Some jokes were funny and clever, but others... I just thought were very cringe. Basically a lot of the humor was exaggerating parts of characters' personality or story to use for comedic purposes. That can be good in theory, but many times in this show, it was maybe... too exaggerated? It had that anime parody style of characters YELLING THEIR JOKES. I don't know how else to explain it.3) Modern KEY series past Rewrite are not referenced at all. Kaginado is supposed to be a celebration of KEY's main works, with its parody jokes and whatnot. However, only the main series mentioned above get any speaking lines. If you were hoping for major appearances from Angel Beats, Charlotte, Harmonia, Summer Pockets, or The Day I Became God, you're SoL. It's possible we may get a season 2 with these series, but I thought the fact these series weren't even directly referenced at all was a big waste.In conclusion, Kaginado is a tough one to recommend. You have to be a pre-existing KEY fan of all their earlier works, you have to be OK with a parody comedy style that exaggerates character personalities, and you have to be OK with a series that essentially adds up to just a little under 40 minutes total. If these criteria are fine with you, definitely at least give it a try. If not, I'd check out something else. the overall presentation of the show.

It puts the characters in the same school and we see them interact with each other, mostly, with comedic results. If you need an idea, it reminds me of Isekai Quartet.ART:Their art is drawn simply, and it works really well for this kind of anime.SOUND:They use sounds from the VNs/anime they made. And KEY's music is something that makes their game very memorable.CHARACTER:...Their personalities are more/less the same as their original versions but with added comedy.ENJOYMENT:Key's works are something that I enjoy, so my enjoyment will be a bit biased. Part of the enjoyment came from seeing these familiar characters with the added bonus of seeing them interact with each other - something you won't see on their source VNs/anime. But even if you're not biased, I think you will enjoy the comedy, even for a little.OVERALL:I am thankful this was made. It might have been tailored for fans, but it won't hurt to try.

You have single handedly made me cry in one way or another for 12 episodes straight.From Rewrite to Clannad, Little Busters to Angel Beats and Planetarian, and all the incredible ones in-between, Kaginado has ALL the characters from Key's best works.Story: 9Imagine if you will a show that has literally every character from some of the most heart warming and soul wrenching visual novels turned into anime, in one show. That is Kaginado. So it's a 9. There's no way it can be a 10 only because it's simply a crossover show like Isekai Quartet or Carnival Phantasm. Not...too terribly original but who really cares about originality in a crossover? Especially when it's a crossover with Key characters?Art-8The art is chibi but it's Key's chibi, so it always gets a pass. Key doesn't make bad visual novels or anime. It just doesn't happen.Sound:10The sound gets a 10 for the ending songs and the music playing in every episode and the little cues for longtime Key fans. Key doesn't make bad sounds in their shows either.Character:10. Always a 10.Most of us know these characters already so I'm not gonna get into the explanations, but if this is your first time watching something made by Key, you're probably gonna be really confused and lost. In order to understand the context behind every character I really suggest you watch Key's other works before this. If you're not patient enough to sit through all of Key's shows however, I will tell you that everything in the Key universe is connected in some facet. The characters always have depth and they never leave you feeling disgusted. Only chipper or intensely sad.Enjoyment:10Like I said. Key doesn't make bad Visual Novels and they definitely don't make bad anime adaptations of their own VN's. If you have seen Key's works before, you're not gonna have a bad time. You're gonna laugh, you're gonna cry (A LOT, because Key will always make you cry one way or the other, it's just a law of anime) but most of all, you're never gonna regret the experience. You don't regret watching things Key makes, you regret not watching them sooner.Overall, it's a 10 out of 10. I've never given any Key show that I've watched anything less than a 10 out of 10. Key always knows just how to tug on our heartstrings. They've been doing it since 99 and they aren't stopping any time soon. They love their audience and we vehemently love them. A match made in heaven.

I understood that the show was a collection of Key's works like Clannad, Air, Kanon and Little Busters!, and I'll admit: I haven't seen any of them and just know the projects by their name and reputation. As of this writing the only Key products I've watched have been Angel Beats, Charlotte and The Day I Became A God. Which I'll admit...I'm surprised Charlotte's and The Day I Became A God's characters didn't make an appearance or get a mention, but I suppose they were just going for their visual novel works(?).Even though I didn't really get any of the references they were making and I couldn't really follow who was who, it was still an overall cute and fun show to watch. All of the characters are in chibi form which is always cute to see. There's no intro, but the outro song is pretty pleasant to listen to and the outro sequence itself is nice. There's really no set plotline or anything like that. It's just fun, cute, comedic bonus content and another chance to see the characters again in a happy setting. The episodes were pretty short so it was easy to breeze through the season in an hour. My personal favorite was Ep 6 when there's this whole debate over who has the best little sister. To try to determine this, they play some baseball, and the little sisters are just brutal to their older counterparts which was hilarious to see. I gathered that there's some serious beef between those characters in their original universes.If you're a fan of Key's works and are familiar them, then this should be a show you'd enjoy. If you're not, well, you might be a little lost like I was. Maybe one day when I have the chance to check out the other Key works, I'll come back to Kaginado and re-watch it so I can properly appreciate the show.

Kidou Senshi Gundam SEED C.E. 73: Stargazer,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1215/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_SEED_CE_73__Stargazer,"[""I usually don't care for spin-offs, but I seem to be on a Gundam kick again, and I'd heard pretty decent things about Stargazer, so...STORY - Stargazer is a side story that takes place around episode 7 and 8 of Gundam SEED Destiny. I have nothing but contempt for Destiny in general, including its story, but thankfully, Stargazer manages to leave behind most of the nonsense and only utilizes a few key plot elements, namely, the drop of Junius Seven onto Earth. And as colony drop plots are kind of common in the Gundamverse, it's pretty easy to forget about Stargazer's parent series. (Well, Stargazer...does mention a few prominent political names that tie it into Destiny, but that's pretty nice because continuity and relevancy is always good, even if the parent story isn't.)As a three-episode OAV, Stargazer has an appropriately narrow focus. It gives the colony drop's resulting devastation an impressively realistic treatment and follows its effects on the lives of two characters, an Earth Alliance soldier and a neutral (Coordinator) researcher. Short and simple. The storytelling mostly relies on the actual events to develop the characters, which are pretty subtle, but it's effective in its own way. I realy, really loved the ending of this series too. Some of the best dialogue is right there at the end. It's ambiguous, but you get a little bit of extra footage after the credits are over. If you do some math and assume certain assertions are true, you could get a definite conclusion. I thought that was pretty damn neat.CHARACTER - Considering the series' length, the characters felt pretty whole to me. Sven's past was only addressed in a few short flashbacks, but they were broken up enough that it didn't feel like they were circumventing anything major by portraying it that way. Or at least, the holes in his past were the holes in his personality that both he and the audience had to grapple with. Selene didn't get much of a flashback treatment, but her personality and history was revealed discreetly through conversations, which is one of my favorite ways to trump overt exposition. Both characters' place in the world was very clear; their emotions regarding the coming war were subtle, and their hopes for the future similarly so, but that made their actions feel more poignant. There was a lot open to interpretation, which is important when there's so little time to tell the story, and it made the OAV more thoughtful, a quality I think is absent in a lot of Gundam titles because there's so much focus on the fights and action.ARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - As expected, the art was consistent with the style in SEED and SEED Destiny, but I did feel the animation was a bit slicker and more put-together. It was actually pretty neat seeing familiar uniforms on new characters, and even though all the Earth Alliance Gundams were just recolored versions of the suits in SEED, it was appropriate and didn't feel like it was cheap or too much of a cop-out (I think I prefer the Strike Noir's colors to the Strike's, really). There was also a scene in here that reawakened by love of BuCUEs -- they're just damn badass. As for the Stargazer, I love the concept, and the resulting design is pretty unique; I feel like they could have pushed it a little further still, but it worked well enough.MUSIC - I was pretty surprised that most, if not all, of the familiar tracks from the SEED and SEED Destiny repertoire were missing in this OAV. I don't know if any new music was composed for Stargazer, but I'm very well acquainted with all... eight soundtracks for SEED/Destiny, and I'm fairly certain that none of the leitmotifs showed up here. And regardless of that, the music for Stargazer is pretty top notch. I'm especially fond of the slower tracks that played during thoughtful scenes. I'm not familiar with the artist (Satori Negishi), but the ending insert song was also very beautiful and fitting.VOICE ACTING - Kind of generic, but still appropriate. I liked Selene's voice in particular.OVERALL - All things considered, I found Stargazer to be pretty enjoyable. Honestly, you could place it inside of any number of Gundam continuities, and it would have functioned well enough, so it doesn't have to be treated as a SEED Destiny-specific title. The story and characters were pretty simple, but the storytelling was solid. There's a lot left up to the viewer, so if you're not a fan of having to interpret things for yourself, then maybe it's not worth the trouble, but considering it's less than an hour long, it doesn't take much out of your life to give this OAV a chance. does mention a few prominent political names that tie it into Destiny, but that's pretty nice because continuity and relevancy is always good, even if the parent story isn't.)As a three-episode OAV, Stargazer has an appropriately narrow focus.

After adding animes to my list, I came upon Gundam Seed Stargazer, and the first thing I thought was disappointment. Gundam Seed was a horrible attempt to revive the original Mobile Suit Gundam seires, but what caught me off gaurd was that this was a really good one (Amazingly). Thought I'm a hatter of Gundam Seed, and all you Kira and Lacus followers might get a bitch on because of it, this seires was a true turn around with me. It had a strong motive, good story line, great characters, and...(of course) the Mobile Suit design.When watching this I learned more about the Seed universe. From reading Gundam Seed Astray manga, I thought I already knew everything that there was needed to know of the Cosmic Era world. I was wrong. This explained the Earth Alliance deep hatered of ZAFT and the Coordinators, the hardships of war, and the brutality of the human mind. I didn't think that Gundam Seed was capable of this kind of monster of a show, but they were able to change little complaintive kids to something serious.The story goes with the beging of Junis 7 being dropped on Earth by the renagade ZAFT forces that were fighting for Patrick Zala's ideals. We see the devastation of the impact of the colony in many countries. Then a scientist named Selen McGriff launches into space while this conflict happens. She is helping to create a Mobile Suit capable of space travel called the Stargazer. Meanwhile, an Earth Alliance pilot Sven Cal Bayan battles against Coordinator Terrorists that are attacking Earth Alliance forces. Soon these two meet in a battle and they soon learn that there is no difference between Coordinators and Naturals.I was disappointed that this Gundam seires was only 3 episodes long. I was expecting much more to happen, but I am satisfied by what I have seen. Hopefully the creators of the Seed Universe might actually get better and not create a disappointment like Seed Destiny. My conclusions, Seed and Seed Destiny are underpar while it's side stories such as Astray or Stargazer are way better. Believe me, I like Gundam and I've done alot of Gundam reviews.

However I honestly did not expect for Stargazer, such a short OVA, to have the emotional impact that it did.The story transpires across the events of the Gundam Seed Destiny series. This means that if you have seen Gundam Seed Destiny you will be able to identify and recognize different events that take place, which helps in establishing the approx. passing of time (which is very cool). The main characters from Gundam Seed Destiny don't play a role in this OVA, and...they aren't needed in this side story. The story follows Sven, an Earth Alliance soldier, and Selene, a Coordinator researcher.(MINOR SPOILERS IN THIS PARAGRAPH) I really like how despite the short amount of time given, the writers really make you connect with Sven by showing his happy childhood and how he eventually became brainwashed into a soldier. Selene's background is meshed out nicely too, detailing her relationships with her follow researchers. There are scenes which detail the horrific worldwide destruction of the Junius 7 Drop (as seen in Seed Destiny), which really helps remind the viewer how horrible of a global disaster it was and how it impacted peoples' lives. I of course will not spoil the ending, but I have to say I very pleased with it. The ending felt realistic, appropriate, and was quite touching.If you have any attachment to Gundam Seed or especially Gundam Seed Destiny you should absolutely check this out. It's three 15 minute episodes, so it is very easy to watch in one sitting. It makes for a stunning companion to the Cosmic Era timeline. they aren't needed in this side story.

There\'s lots of sad character death, brutal war scenes, and tragic backstories, but there\'s little to no depth to anything, and it\'s mostly told with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the face.  I mean they might as well have called the second episode ""Crawling in my Gundam, These Wounds They Will Not Heal.""  The direction was decent, and it felt like everyone involved was really trying, but the short runtime really killed most of the potential this had.  Sadly, the last half of the final...episode finally does seem to come together into something surprisingly well done (and it\'s really the only reason I\'m not scoring this lower), but by then it was too little too late to save the series. episode finally does seem to come together into something surprisingly well done (and it\'s really the only reason I\'m not scoring this lower), but by then it was too little too late to save the series.', ""Set the same time as Gundam Seed destiny, Stargazer tells the story of Selen Mcgriff, a scientist and Sven Ca Bayan, a member of Earth Alliance's Phantom Pain.

I liked the characters especially Selene, Sven, and that guy who died fighting the Jinn (forgot his name...)The mobile suit designs are good too. Stargazer looks great, plus there's Blu Duel and Verde Buster, throwbacks to Duel and Buster from the earlier Gundam SEED.The battles were of course good, but since each ep is limited to 15 minutes, it feels like you...want to see more.That's my opinion on this series in fact. It's good, but there's way too much happening which results in everything getting condensed to fit the time limit. Because of that, it leaves you wanting more. If ever they make a longer version, I sure will be watching. want to see more.That's my opinion on this series in fact. It's good, but there's way too much happening which results in everything getting condensed to fit the time limit. Because of that, it leaves you wanting more. If ever they make a longer version, I sure will be watching."", ""Gundam Seed Stargazers is set after Gundam Seed, and takes into consideration crucial events of Seed Destiny, thus, only see this if you saw both series until the end, otherwise, you will lose way too much of the events and explanations, and the OVA will not be enjoyable. That being said, I can assure that Gundam Seed Stargazers is an amazing OVA, with the most perfect portrait of a war I ever saw on Gundam. Let me explain why.Story: It's absolutely dark. Damn, you think Gundam Thunderbolt is dark? Or maybe Iron-Blooded Orphans? Nope, Gundam Seed Stargazers takes the cake. It does not have the...amount of bloodshed like IBO, but its the darkest Gundam-related anime I watched so far. Nevertheless, the story, grim as it is, is great. There are moments that they throw you right on a civilian point of view, and it is terrifying. This is an artistic and writing choice that few Gundam made so far.  There are moments you really see how terrifying must be for a civilian to see a Mobile Suit. In addition, they expand on essential concepts you see on Seed and Seed Destiny that enrich the whole world of Seed. The story, overall, is brief and with only a few shots of the action, and it was meant to be more of a storytelling event. Still, it is great... I mean, GREAT, war story. Some scenes are even hard, with a perfect portrait of how war truly is. We are used to seeing Mobile Suits exploding each other by the hundreds, thus, we actually don`t think too much of how it would be more perfectly portraited to see these same scenes, but more realistic. In Gundam Seed Stargazers, you will see how it actually is. Like a bunch of Mobile Suits stabbing another, like it was a person, as the pilot screams in terror. That's war, and Gundam Seed Stargazers brings you this reality like no other.Art & Sound: Superb art, 500% better than Seed. The sound is good, but with no OST that you will remember.Characters: You will follow a few characters and for only a limited time, hence, you will not get attached to anyone, and no one will become important to you. Nevertheless, they are nicely done, and I have no complaints here... But I have no highlights also. They exist. They fight. They do their stuff. The end. Gundam Seed Stargazers is about the whole storytelling, more than the characters.Mechas: Strike Noir Gundam is a black version of Freedom, with slight modifications. The others have no memorable feature also, nothing you haven't seen on Seed, or Seed Destiny. However, it brings you Gundam Stargazer, one of the most beautiful Gundam in my list. Gundam Stargazer is also the first to have lighting that remembers the Psyko Frame of Gundam Unicorn, thus Gundam Stargazer did it first. I hope I can find a Stargazer Gunpla!Overall, Gundam Seed Stargazers is a must see OVA for Seed fans, as well as any Gundam fan. If you are into mechas, you won't see them much, but it is still for you. If you don`t like the mecha genre, but like war stories, Gundam Seed Stargazers is a must-see for you too. It is dark, portraits a war perfectly, and it brings you a good story for the Seed universe and Gundam in general. amount of bloodshed like IBO, but its the darkest Gundam-related anime I watched so far.

Kakumeiki Valvrave,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16668/Kakumeiki_Valvrave,"['Contrary to what MAL and other sources may say, Kakumeiki Valvrave (or Valvrave the Liberator - whichever tickles your fancy more) is in fact a parody anime. You might be confused as to why I am asserting this given how this anime isn\'t classed as such and actually appears to make an attempt at some more mature themes, but let us take a closer look at the story. And before you deem this review unhelpful based on the low score I\'ve given the show, I might as well you right now that while I do in fact enjoy the anime, it is no discernable way...good whatsoever outside of animation. Anyway, on with the review.Valvrave the Liberator revolves around our main character: Haruto, a socially awkward, withdrawn teenager who attends high school in a colony in space. Haruto likes Shoko, the closest thing we have to a heroine in the anime, and in the first episode tries to work up the courage to confess his love for her only to be interrupted by... SPACE NAZIS.I wish I was kidding.Perhaps ""space Nazis"" isn\'t the correct term, but I\'m hard pressed to find anything better to describe the all white wearing (storm troopers!), fascist war-mongering state of Dorssia - they\'re pretty much the evil empire in the series and they all speak German, sorta.Following the interruption one thing leads to another and before we know it our young hero is piloting a state of the art mecha capable of singlehandedly rebuffing an entire Dorssia fleet invasion. Haruto saved the day - but at a cost! To pay the price for piloting the mecha Valvrave Haruto had to give up his humanity. Essentially, he had to die. And what happened next? Well, I was confused as you probably are as you are reading this; Haruto becomes a vampire! Hilarity ensues!Not really. It just depends on perspective on whether you find the anime hilarious or not. Personally, I think Valvrave the Liberator is just comedic gold, and let me tell you why. It takes a special kind of thinking to put vampires, space Nazis, mechas, romance and slice of life all in school setting. Did I mention there was a brief Valvrave the Musical? Not kidding. Wait for episode 5. Just wait.All these elements in the anime inevitably result in a sense you are watching a parody and what makes it even better is the fact that the show takes itself way too seriously thus making it all the more funnier. Just think of Guilty Crown meets space, only a billion times funnier. For realsies, I do genuinely enjoy this anime. Not because it\'s good, not because the animation or the music is great (neither are noteworthy to be honest) but because it tickles my funny bone.I wish I could write more in this review, but honestly, aside from delving into the characters there\'s not much else to say, and I\'d rather do the former because I want you to genuinely enjoy the series. So here\'s my advice for watching Valvrave the Liberator - TURN OFF YOUR BRAIN. Seriously. Don\'t even think of thinking anything because neither the plot nor the characters will make much sense to you if any at all. The anime is just so much more enjoyable that way.Story - 1Art - 8Sound - 5Characters - 1Enjoyment - 10Overall - 3 good whatsoever outside of animation.

The anime is just so much more enjoyable that way.Story - 1Art - 8Sound - 5Characters - 1Enjoyment - 10Overall - 3', 'They told me I could become anything so I became a vampiric mecha pilot.Well, the idea of high school kids becoming pilots while getting their own personal mecha gadgets isn\'t new to the anime industry. Series such as Macross Frontier, Code Geass, and Aquarion Evol all have this theme. It involves normal students who attends a normal school like any normal day. Then, boom. Something abnormal happens and their lives are changed forever. The catch here for Valvrave the Liberator? It also deals with a supernatural twist...with some blood spilled to add to the mix.That\'s right. It\'s not a  bird, it\'s not a...plane, it\'s a Valvrave!To be honest, I wasn\'t sure whether to check this series out or not at first. However, I am a fan of the mecha genre so I decided to give this a shot. What I got out though was a rather strange surprise from Sunrise\'s latest evolution of works. Kakumeiki Valvrave, also known by its English name as Valvrave the Liberator, is a mecha series that debuted as an original title in the year of 2013. The series is produced and handled by the animation studio known as Sunrise. And oh boy, does that spell out some controversy...In essence, the series doesn\'t make much sense at various points. There\'s a lot going on even from the beginning. From its basis, we do know that about 70% of the current human population lives in space thanks to this development known as the \'Dyson Sphere\' that is located in space. It\'s a city that has advanced technology above our own and holds many secrets. Then on the opposite side, there\'s the superpower known as the Dorssia Military Pact Federation and Atlantic Rim United States. They are an alliance that has mass amount of powers and resources. Oh and what do you know, they are picking a fight. Being a superpower and all, the Dorssia are a powerhouse with their military, technology, and elite forces. Among its members of that elite force is a powerful soldier known as L-elf Karlstein. (ERU ERUFUUUUUUU)L-Elf is a young man who is considered many things in this anime. He has the intellectual of a military genius, the experience of an elite soldier earning him the title \'One-Man-Army\', but most importantly is also labeled by Dorssia as a traitor. After a certain event in the beginning of the series, he is forced to defect from his home as he is now seen as someone who betrayed their comrades. Well, that\'s all thanks to a certain young boy by the name of Haruto of course. The young boy is your typical high school student with a normal life, a love interest, and friends who he can trust. But hey, what happens when you reject humanity and become someone totally different...say a vampire pilot? Sounds weird right but that\'s Sunrise for you. Welcome to your new life, Haruto.Among other people in Haruto\'s life are his love interest, the adorable Shouko. The twist comes though when the very first episode spells out her a certain event that seemingly writes her off the series. But then, the series decides to be cheesy and return the favor. Honestly, that\'s just face palm worthy. So as it goes, there is also some other drama involving an idol superstar by the name of Saki. She seems to have her own issues and spells out drama for Haruto and his friends. The humor she brings into this show is hard to take seriously at all. But like I mentioned before, it\'s hard to take this series seriously at many occasions since it hardly makes sense in the beginning.Valvrave the Liberator is handled by Sunrise. Fans who are familiar with the studio should know their themes and ideas that are poured into a mecha show like this. The themes of vengeance, struggle for dominance among nations, tragic romances, and mecha warfare are just a few in the series. Among other things, Sunrise decides to put all of this into a single package and tries to give entertainment to the fans. Oh it achieved that alright with some of its other absurd ideas like a little dose of high school musical and death flags seemingly triggered everywhere. Then of course, there\'s vampiric space pilots who are both feared and respected. It\'s funny in the sense that they reject humanity for absurd reasons that hardly makes any sense at all. Well, that\'s just the tips of the iceberg.Among other absurd ideas is having students run an entire country. By this standard, it means that students who haven\'t even ventured out in the real world market are now in charge of their own destinies. It completely annihilates any sense of realism by going through its ridiculous elements.Despite the absurdity of the series, it does maintain its premise. There is a lot of action here and there in space and on its homeland. The majority of this involves the Dorssia\'s military against its opposing factions and Haruto\'s school. Furthermore, L-Elf\'s “betrayal” seemingly gets one of his former colleagues\' blood boiling as he views him now as a rival. The rivalry itself seems to be one sided though as L-Elf is constantly one step ahead thanks to his genius mind. It is in fact because of his tactics which resulted in several of Dorissa Army\'s humiliating defeats. It\'s no surprise how L-Elf earned his nickname. However, now the young man wants to lead a revolution. Sunrise is known for themes like this in their other works such as Code Geass and Gundam Seed. A revolution exists between different factions and each side wants to gain the advantage over the other. The catch here is that there\'s this mysterious Valvrave that becomes a turning tide in the struggling conflict.The Valvrave themselves seems to have a rather strange design that fuses between machine and humanoid. Furthermore, their system makes their functions to be overpowered at many occasions. What\'s even more strange is the question it asks once a pilot enters its cockpit. The million dollar question is:Do you wish to resign as a human being?As strange as it sounds, that question and depending on the answer, will change someone\'s life forever.Among other strange factors in the series is the usage of its pacing. The episode shifts between seriousness and ridiculous. It\'s nearly impossible to take some of the ridiculous as entertainment even with its cheesy execution. It tries to mix in way too much ideas into a little package at once. Also, some factors of the show barely makes any sense such as how Haruto is able to pilot such an advanced piece of technology given his previous zero experience in handling a mecha. Then, there\'s the cheesy dialogues used here and there; some related to school, some related to \'monster\', and then some that makes no sense. In the more seriousness field though, there are some controversial scenes later on. Be prepared.There\'s quite a lot of humor though in this series. I actually find it hilariously fun if you don\'t think about the plot so much. The way some of the characters behave makes them look amusing in a state of war. Then, there\'s the various jokes such as the Valvrave AI with a keen interest in human ideas. There\'s also funny gags here and there such as the humor of the \'666\' that symbolizes the Number of the Beast. The characters\' names of the Dorissa\'s elite force also are based off of German origins. Additionally, we can tell that there is a lot of foreshadowing. The questions of who will pilot which Valvrave and what\'s to come in the upcoming struggles are just a few questions for anticipating fans.The artwork of the series has its Sunrise production values. The way the Valvrave are structured and the characters are designed gives them that fresh look. The students\' uniforms are a bit generic with nothing outstanding. However, the Valvrave machines tells a different story. The way they are designed gives off them a dangerous look and one that is very noticeable compared to some of the other mecha in this series. Among other factors, L-Elf\'s character makes him noticeable with his flash of silver hair. The Dyson Sphere itself also is noticeable of being out there in space with its technology to make its function while the same time giving it a futuristic look.If there\'s delivery, Valvrave the Liberator nailed with its music score. Akira Senju (Full Metal Alchemest: Brotherhood, Red Garden) provides an effective OST that is quick and fits within the themes of the series. There are many times when battles are orchestrated through its nimble soundtrack to provide feedback of the action. The OP song, ""Preserved Roses"" by T.M.Revolution x Nana Mizuki also has a quick rhythm that provides montage of the main and supporting characters. It also creates foreshadowing through the backgrounds of the Valvraves as well as some symbolism. Finally, amongst vocal performances, the stand-out is Kimura Ryouhei who is able to maintain his calm and calculating tone of voice as L-Elf. By a measure of its soundtrack, this series does deserve some praise. Boku Ja Nai, Boku Ja Nai, Boku Jai Nai.If you\'ve already started watching this show, then by all means enjoy the entertainment but don\'t expect too much for engaging plots or characters. Rather, watch it for a way to kill time. At the same time, be sure to put those headphones on for its soundtrack. It\'s a \'fun\' show to watch but its merits in terms of story presentation and character development is sour. Among other factors, think of this series as a hybrid of supernatural/mecha/school life/comedy/drama/romance/crazy all the same time.

I mean, if you put a bunch of kids in charge of a country, there\'s nothing more than a eccentric ride, right?', 'I\'m sure everyone has heard the term \'so bad, it\'s good\'. There is something inexplicably enticing about the amusingly bad, as the cult success of cinematic embarrassments such as \'The Room"" and ""Troll 2"" will substantiate. This applies just as much to anime as it does to movies, take this piece of space mecha action  sci-fi junk, for example.Valvrave the Liberator is the latest from the once great studio Sunrise; an amalgam of the studio\'s worst tendencies and deteriorating quality. It\'s a show that is so wildly unfocused and possessing plot twists so ridiculous that it transcends being merely bad; it\'s entertainingly awful.On the...surface, Valvrave is blatantly generic. It has a well intentioned but soft-headed and somewhat wimpy boy as its protagonist, whom in a moment of desperation gets super-powers (this time vampire powers) and a giant robot, which gives him the power to defend himself and what he holds precious. He then finds himself in the middle of a galactic power struggle; at odds with a militaristic menace. Original, right!? Well, to layer on the cliches, the story involves a high school and revolution of the youth, things series composer Ichiro Okouchi can\'t seem to pull himself away from; having already used them in two of his major works, Code Geass and Guilty Crown. That\'s not the end of it, as the show is rife with overused tropes: the clueless love interest, the jealous secondary love interest who is a pop idol, the angst the hero has over his inhuman powers, and so on.Of course, it isn\'t this saturation of stock plot elements that makes this show memorably bad, if anything they would make it forgettable. No, it\'s all in the writing and execution. The show loves to be extravagant and dramatic though its material is often too thin or silly to give any weight, and sometimes just downright misleading. For example, when Haruto\'s (our milquetoast hero) crush Shoko seemingly dies in the first episode, the show ramps up the drama so much it almost seems certain that she\'s dead. But of course, all this drama is ultimately wasted because (and I\'m sorry for spoiling anyone who hasn\'t watched past the first episode) she is in fact alive, with nary a scratch. That\'s right, the blast not 10 feet away from her that blew a crater into the earth didn\'t kill her, it just buried her and the car she was running to under some rubble. This is just the first of the many poorly conceived plot twists in Valvrave. Haruto comes close to confessing his feelings to Shoko, but stops midway because he is ""no longer human"", a contrivance clearly put there to make room for some love-triangle dramatics. One of the characters is apparently such a strong strategist that he can predict events as if he is clairvoyant; a rather laughable attempt to make him look like a genius. Not to mention the contrived rape scene late in the season, and the marriage proposal it leads to. The plot has almost no focus and barrages twist after twist, with little thought of how these twists flow together or if they even make sense. The show plays all these plot twists straight, making them inadvertently hilarious. It doesn\'t help that the actual comedic moments in the show are not particularly funny.Valvrave has a humongous cast of named characters, and absolutely no idea how to use them. Most of the characters just wonder around living their normal high school lives, and occasionally converge to make a collective decision. Majority of these characters are stereotypes in terms of personality and contribute very little to the plot, and yet the show inexplicably follows them around and gives them a decent amount of screen time. The main cast is also lax in characterization and fit into retreaded archetypes. Haruto is the average male lead seen over and over again in anime. Shoko is the genki girl with a good heart, and Haruto\'s childhood friend/love-interest. Saki is the stuck-up and guarded pop idol, who also harbors feelings for Haruto. L-elf is the unbelievable military genius, who serves as Haruto\'s rival and/or ally. Pretty much all the characters can be summed up in a sentence or two. The major factions are barely defined outside of their initial descriptions: Dorssia are the militarists, ARUS are greedy capitalists, JOIR are neutralists. Despite the initial promise of some political play, there is virtually none. There is only silly high school drama pretending to be political. It\'s every bit the farce it sounds.There is at least one thing Valvrave gets right, the eye-candy. In all respects, this is a very pretty show. The color schemes are vivid and colorful, as are the character designs and backgrounds. The character designs by D. Gray-man mangaka Katsura Hoshino are not exactly unconventional, but they are distinctive and attractive, especially their eyes. The mech designs are sleek yet fantastical, with striking features such as multicolored wings, wheel-blade weapons, and laser swords. They are some of the coolest mech designs anime has recently produced; even the bulky Dorssian mechs look pretty awesome. The space battles and various other action set-pieces are exciting and feature good cinematography; there is a lot going on, but it never gets cluttered to the point of being indecipherable. There are some short-cuts and quality drops, but they are taken in the right places. The soundtrack is also very good, though not outstanding or out of the norm for the genre. The action tracks are the high point of the music, but conversely there are a few obnoxious insert songs. In all honestly, it is well directed on purely technical merits; which makes the poor direction in all other aspects a little less noticeable.In truth, Valvrave the Liberator can\'t really be put on the same level as things like ""The Room"" and ""Trolls 2"" because it actually succeeds on a technical level, which is more than can be said for those two movies. Plus, it has better voice acting than the acting in those movies as well. Not for lack of trying, though, because the writing in Vlavrave is bad enough to rival those atrocities. It\'s not just bad, it is comically bad. If not for the strong technical merits and voice acting, Valvrave could have very well reached that next level of badness. While the loose plot threads can be remedied by the upcoming squeal, the question arises: with this season being so bad, what chance does season 2 have? Well, chances are it will be just as much of a trainwreck. Am I wrong for kind of looking forward to it? surface, Valvrave is blatantly generic. It has a well intentioned but soft-headed and somewhat wimpy boy as its protagonist, whom in a moment of desperation gets super-powers (this time vampire powers) and a giant robot, which gives him the power to defend himself and what he holds precious. He then finds himself in the middle of a galactic power struggle; at odds with a militaristic menace. Original, right!? Well, to layer on the cliches, the story involves a high school and revolution of the youth, things series composer Ichiro Okouchi can\'t seem to pull himself away from; having already used them in two of his major works, Code Geass and Guilty Crown. That\'s not the end of it, as the show is rife with overused tropes: the clueless love interest, the jealous secondary love interest who is a pop idol, the angst the hero has over his inhuman powers, and so on.Of course, it isn\'t this saturation of stock plot elements that makes this show memorably bad, if anything they would make it forgettable. No, it\'s all in the writing and execution. The show loves to be extravagant and dramatic though its material is often too thin or silly to give any weight, and sometimes just downright misleading. For example, when Haruto\'s (our milquetoast hero) crush Shoko seemingly dies in the first episode, the show ramps up the drama so much it almost seems certain that she\'s dead.

If you can watch it and enjoy it, to me that is a good anime. Not a work of art like Rahxephon, Eureka Seven, or others, but a good just something to watch anime.Out of all of the anime I am watching this season, this is one of the ones I am enjoying the most. Valvrave is like an abomination of things that should not have been mixed together, much like Hellsing was, but this mix is actually making a decent product to watch.

It’s not like Majestic Prince where that is just a rinse and repeat mecha anime.

You’ll be surprised at what you get."", '*sigh* Boy, where do I begin with this one?If you\'re familiar with Sunrise, expect the unexpected. Seriously.So in America, vampires sparkle like Tinkerbell while vampires in Japan pilot awesome-looking mechs? Sounds about right.The story is pretty outrageous to begin with. Only requirement to pilot a specialized war machine created by a ""pacifist"", ""anti-war"" nation is to become a vampire. Along with an entire school of high school students who don\'t know life beyond luxury and peace to run an entire nation by themselves to compete against possibly a futuristic America and space Nazis. To this day, I don\'t understand how were they able to last...this long since they treat munitions like dirt and ready to turn on each other from every incident they encounter. All in all, giving the story a 5 is generous of me.The art is amazing as the mechs are beautifully drawn. Every little detail on each mech looks like it took a lot of effort to get right. The characters are also drawn pretty well, as usual mostly pretty boys and girls with fluid animation.The sound is another redeeming quality. I very much enjoyed the openings and endings of this show and would like to see more.The characters... let me liquor up before I continue. One moment.Okay, the characters. I\'m quite surprised the male lead was even able to stand in the beginning. Maybe after the future, scientists discovered to attach an artificial spine to this guy. Luckily, Haruto does develop into a stern and decisive young man as season 1 nears it\'s end and that\'s a good thing. The female lead, Shoko, is your typical Jane Doe. Miss Perfect who you get tired of watching. Saki, lord knows what\'s in her head since I seriously think she\'s just bi-polar. L-Elf needs to change his damn name so that I won\'t hear ""ERUERUFU"" 15 times in 20 seconds in 1 episode by his ""lover"" who has a giant man-crush on him or something. Other than that, he\'s the cool, tactical genius with a back story that hasn\'t been fully shown yet. Here\'s to hoping, Season 2.Even with the absurd plot and like\'em-or-hate\'em cast, I can\'t seem to stop watching this show. Another thing that Sunrise is very good at doing. So if they\'re able to keep my attention for that long, I\'ll at least give it a decent score.Final thoughts: ERUEFURU this long since they treat munitions like dirt and ready to turn on each other from every incident they encounter.

But it will be a pity not to get more people to know about this show because… well, some jewels are just meant to be shared with others. If you are familiar with mecha anime like Soukyuu no Fafner, or Gundam SEED (or for the handful of you that knows Blue Destiny), or Code Geass, or Macross Frontier, heck even Guilty Crown, then you should consider giving Valvrave the Liberator a try. As for others who are...not familiar with those mecha series, don't worry because you will not be at a disadvantage. In fact, there may be less expectations or comparisons instinctively, so it is not bad, right? What one can expect, however, from Valvrave the Liberator are lots of intense actions, eye-popping WTF moments, and tons of character dramas!First let me reiterate that this show was pre-planned for two seasons so expect LOTS of unresolved questions for now (which is why I said there is no justice in writing a review on it now). Given the script and series composition is by Okouchi Ichiro (best known as the creator for Code Geass), there are certainly high hopes out there among some people. Despite all the mysterious and unresolved lose ends, I can say that I have no regret watching it and the time was well spent. The story is very fluid and captivating, which resulted in me marathoning a large chuck of it. Set in a futuristic space setting with 70% of the human population already living in space, war broke out in an academic city and our protagonist unfortunately found himself staring at the face of a humanoid robot! The synopsis sound like a rip off of many other mecha series I know, but please trust me when I say this show is unique. On a side note, I must confess that I was not very impressed with the technological gadgets shown – or I am just being picky. When it comes to character, there are plenty to like about this show. While the character development and growth may not be apparent on them all, and at times may make you scratch for head at their decisions. But as the events unfold, the viewers will get a sense of maturity developing in them. Fighting for love, fighting for survival, fighting for revenge, fighting for independence. There are no shortage of themes and reasons for the students to engage in the ugly adult affairs of war and politics.Even if you are not sold by the plot or character, I still suggest you look up the OP and indulge in it. Yes, it is that damn good. Performed by T.M. Revolution and Nana Mizuki, it is like instant orgasm for fans, like yours truly. Or if you prefer angela or ELISA's music, you will also not be disappointed. Simply put, all the theme songs are top notch! As the latest mech series by Sunrise, one can expect superb animation quality as well as character and mech designs. At least I believe so. Therefore, whether you are looking for a short 12 episodes series with intense actions or excellent animation or plot twists or character dramas or what-have-you, Valvrave the Liberator should be on your list as one of the potential to-watch series. Don't let the lack of closure in the series misguide you, while it is true that there will be more questions than answer (for now), this show is certainly worth keeping an eye on for the Fall 2013 term. not familiar with those mecha series, don't worry because you will not be at a disadvantage.

Valvrave the Liberator did well in bringing the individual elements of action and mecha, they did well in the enjoyment of the series.And then the negative point, many mecha series that did a successful job to bring a well-oriented plot. While Valvrave the Liberator did a different thing, they put more action to the plot and abandoned the complexity of the plot which created a lousy storytelling. The other points we must know is a typical story opening that makes Valvrave lack...of originality. It really makes this anime into a replica of the Gundam franchise.Well, we know Sunrise is a rich company. Therefore, it\'s not strange that Valvrave got the animation that needed to make this anime beautifully standing in top of the world. It has a detail and pretty animation. Talk about high budget show...And the sound settings is another good thing in this show, the opening song ""Preserved Rose"" sung by Nana Mizuki and T.M Revolution really got the beat. The seiyuu did a fairly well job.Okay, if you expect a deep character in this anime, it means you choose the wrong door. First, we have our typical male hero, Haruto. He is a type of a heroic character that surrounded by two girls and one man (sorry). There is minor development that discovered within him (poor hero...). To make matter worse, he is stupid when it comes to romance. Next is the infinity number of the supporting cast that makes the entire cast too flat and flaw.The enjoyment of the series has just saved this anime from catastrophe, it is recommended for Mecha fans. If you look for deep character and a decent storytelling you come to the wrong place but if you interested in 24 minutes filled with action and a little fan service, give it a try.

It's the kind of different that may turn people away simply because it doesn't follow the normal conventions one expects of the sci-fi or mecha genres, but goes outside of the box. Whether this is a good thing or not depends on the person, but to me its what hooked me to the show. Particularly since you don't expect mecha and vampires to coexist with each other. It makes sense though with the vampire theory some writers use where vampires aren't the living dead but simply humans infected by a virus that makes them abnormally strong.One of the nice aspects...of the story is the nice twists there are to the plots so you don't know what to expect from the particular plot line. The art is well done, particularly when it comes to the mecha and fight sequences. The sound is beautiful and my enjoyment was high. What really stands out for me is the interesting characters the series happens to have.My favorite happens to be the hacker. Her characterization is spot on for someone with a form of autism or social anxiety. She's also a major savant and she ends up being a very believable character. Even her brother is unique and lovable despite his narcissism due to the fact he puts his sister before himself every single time. Other characters are also unique and there is a complex dynamic when it comes to the relationships of said students. Said relationships follow too the rules of logic one expects from their particular character type as well.That also said, I'm looking forward very much to the second season even if second season is a flop, I like the characters that much. of the story is the nice twists there are to the plots so you don't know what to expect from the particular plot line.

I can\'t think of a better series that exemplifies EVERYTHING wrong with the anime industry today.marketing produced, fan pandering, cash in: 11/10""What if we ripped off Code Geass, but inserted sparkling bishounen vampires like Twilight?! ""We would make a fortune!"" This is what the team of marketers said that pitched this bullshit series to Sunrise Studio executives. One thing I really despise in Hollywood movies and anime is when a team of marketing executives try to ""cash in"" on a recent pop culture phenomenon. For example, the fucking awful...Chipmunk movies made some money off of idiots, so executives now want to reboot every 1980s  kids franchise into shitty movies like The Smurfs movies and the upcoming Gnomes movie. I like to watch a product where at least one person on board gave a shit and actually tried to produce something of quality. Valvrave, much like the Smurfs, is pure capitalism that just wants to make a quick dollar and cares NOTHING about the quality of the finished product. I don\'t go crazy if a series has a small bit of ""fan pandering"" or ""fan service"" but the entire series can\'t JUST be fan pandering bullshit! The result of more and more purely ""for otaku only"" series is limiting the target audience of anime to a smaller and smaller group of Hikikomori and super Otaku. This is because Japanese studios don\'t really give a shit about foreign fans and want to produce series that will sell the maximum amount of merchandise (like figurines and echhi mousepads) to the aforementioned uber-geeks. As a result, the average quality appears to be dropping and the industry is starting to strangle itself.Plot: 1/10Spoilers!!!Just like Code Geass, the world is divided into 3 major powers: The evil Americans (Britannians) renamed ARUS in this series, the space Nazis, and Japan (of course). This time Japan is invaded not by those dastardly Americans, but by the space Nazis instead. Japan is a peaceful, economic power with no real military (besides secret robots obviously), so the Space Nazis take over quickly. However, a group of young students manage to use super robots to defeat the space Nazis that invaded their orbiting space school and declare the orbiting school an independent country run by the highschool student council. The only drawback of piloting these robots is that you must become a vampire! Of course, vampires in this series operate by their own rules so the writers can make up bullshit on the fly! The real enemy are the Magius, who are aliens that came to Earth hundreds of years ago. They were at first discriminated against, so they decided they must protect themselves by taking over the world and secretly controlling every government. The Magius profit by starting wars between the government factions that they control. However, once the Magius are uncovered and wiped out via a massive genocide (to our heroes indignant horror of course), mankind is able to live in peace. Well, at least Ichiro Okouchi is making progress in his subtlety. At least he didn\'t name the Magius the Elders of Zion, so if you were a complete moron you might actually miss the fact that he\'s actually talking about the Jews. Did I mention Ichiro is a far right Japanese ultra-nationalist? The only redeeming factor if one could possibly be found, is that at least halfway through even Ichiro realizes how fucking stupid this series is and it stops trying to be serious.Characters: 1/10As much as I hated Ichiro Okouchi\'s previous work Code Geass, at least some of the characters were interesting and I could see why people might like them. Here the characters absolutely suck. The main character Haruto is presented as a paragon of virtue, yet after the evil Lolicon AI that runs his gundam (just go with it) possesses him and forces him to rape a co-worker, he doesn\'t express any more guilt than if he had accidentally spilled a drink on her. She only seems mildly annoyed by it and has his baby with no complaints. This sub-plot is never even brought up again, except at the end where you see Haruto\'s kid. That\'s right TUMBLR feminists, Ichiro Okouchi is basically pro-rape. Of course, how could a man that keeps telling young otaku at Japanese conventions that the Japanese Empire were the ""good guys"" in WW2 and the Americans are evil, NOT be pro-rape? The Imperial Japanese Army beloved by Okouchi were the absolute worst bunch of rapists in military history. Their actions in China and Korea made the Red Army in Germany look like a bunch of angelic choir boys. The only other character of note is L-Elf, who is just a German clone of Lelouch. I\'m pretty sure the L even stands for Lelouch, because the series never indicates anything else it might stand for.There are some other characters, but they aren\'t even worth talking about.Art: 7/10The giant robot designs are beautiful and look exactly like a Gundam series. Of course the reason is that Studio Sunrise also animates all the Gundam series. Is shitty as this series is, at least the art is decent.Ichiro fucking Okouchi:Dear GOD do I hate this guy! Way back in the 1960s, a Japanese far right author named Yukio Mishima felt that Japan was weak without a military and will inevitably be invaded by evil Westerners. The old generation of Japanese are weak for accepting pacifism and all hope lies with the young Japanese that must rise up and re-establish the military might of the Japanese Empire as well as Japanese rule over lesser Asians, who weren\'t descended from the Sun Goddess. Although far right politics and ultra nationalism declined in the prosperous 70s, 80s, and 90s, now it is making a huge comeback. This is fueled largely by the economic rise of Japan\'s hated neighbor China and Japan\'s declining economic strength and rapidly shrinking population. I mention all of this because Mishima\'s political message is today reaching Japanese youth that feel powerless and angry, and this is now alarmingly reflected in Japanese pop culture like the horrendous sequel to Battle Royale. What Okouchi does is take Mishima\'s message and Shintaro Ishihara\'s politics and mix them with just enough cool battles, fan service for boys and girls, and forced plot twists that people are willing to ignore the absolute poison that he is spoon feeding new anime fans. I don\'t care how much sugar he puts in it, it is still fucking poison and I\'m not drinking it! To paraphrase an old video game, ""Japan ill needs a savior such as you Mr. Okoushi!""Overall: 3/10Although this is one of the worst series in recent memory in terms of plot, characters, themes, execution, and most factors I consider important. Although, the art and music were pretty good. In order to be objective, I must look at the whole picture and  at least recognize the few things the series does well. Thanks entirely to its massive budget, Valvrave is spared a 1/10 and given a very generous 3/10. Chipmunk movies made some money off of idiots, so executives now want to reboot every 1980s  kids franchise into shitty movies like The Smurfs movies and the upcoming Gnomes movie. I like to watch a product where at least one person on board gave a shit and actually tried to produce something of quality. Valvrave, much like the Smurfs, is pure capitalism that just wants to make a quick dollar and cares NOTHING about the quality of the finished product. I don\'t go crazy if a series has a small bit of ""fan pandering"" or ""fan service"" but the entire series can\'t JUST be fan pandering bullshit! The result of more and more purely ""for otaku only"" series is limiting the target audience of anime to a smaller and smaller group of Hikikomori and super Otaku. This is because Japanese studios don\'t really give a shit about foreign fans and want to produce series that will sell the maximum amount of merchandise (like figurines and echhi mousepads) to the aforementioned uber-geeks. As a result, the average quality appears to be dropping and the industry is starting to strangle itself.Plot: 1/10Spoilers!!!Just like Code Geass, the world is divided into 3 major powers: The evil Americans (Britannians) renamed ARUS in this series, the space Nazis, and Japan (of course). This time Japan is invaded not by those dastardly Americans, but by the space Nazis instead. Japan is a peaceful, economic power with no real military (besides secret robots obviously), so the Space Nazis take over quickly. However, a group of young students manage to use super robots to defeat the space Nazis that invaded their orbiting space school and declare the orbiting school an independent country run by the highschool student council. The only drawback of piloting these robots is that you must become a vampire! Of course, vampires in this series operate by their own rules so the writers can make up bullshit on the fly! The real enemy are the Magius, who are aliens that came to Earth hundreds of years ago. They were at first discriminated against, so they decided they must protect themselves by taking over the world and secretly controlling every government. The Magius profit by starting wars between the government factions that they control. However, once the Magius are uncovered and wiped out via a massive genocide (to our heroes indignant horror of course), mankind is able to live in peace. Well, at least Ichiro Okouchi is making progress in his subtlety. At least he didn\'t name the Magius the Elders of Zion, so if you were a complete moron you might actually miss the fact that he\'s actually talking about the Jews. Did I mention Ichiro is a far right Japanese ultra-nationalist? The only redeeming factor if one could possibly be found, is that at least halfway through even Ichiro realizes how fucking stupid this series is and it stops trying to be serious.Characters: 1/10As much as I hated Ichiro Okouchi\'s previous work Code Geass, at least some of the characters were interesting and I could see why people might like them.

Teenagers become super bad asses by piloting OP mechs and blowing up countless enemy grunts. This is the standard Mecha anime formula.Being produced by Sunrise, one can\'t help...but think that Valvrave is just another Gundam anime knock off trying to gain fame which at first this series appears to be. A gundam anime knock off. Hell, it even uses the same 5 mecha formula that Gundam Wing, Gundam 00 and Gundam Seed used.The Characters of this show are as generic as can be. At least most of them. The main Character,Haruto, is basically another Shinji with a bit more balls. He\'s weak, timid, and tries to avoid being noticed by others. Many of the other characters seem to be flat and boring as well. One of the main love interests, Shouko, is the classic ditsy, cute and always making a fool out of herself girl that everyone likes while the other, Saki, is the cold, lonely former idol who separates herself from the class but strangely likes the main character for no other reason than being the main character cause why not.Now while the show in my opinion suffers from this, it actually makes up for it with character development and interesting complex character relationships. Because our characters are so bland and tasteless, we can see them grow as the story progresses which thank god, they actually do. But more importantly, the character relationships that develop alongside the storyline are the key thing that i see driving this anime. You will see former enemies become allies, friends that will betray one another for their own personal goals and of course new budding romances which do not all center around the main character like a trashy harem anime.The Story of Valvrave the Liberator i will admit will be stiff, boring and confusing. I was even ready to call it quits by episode 6 or 7 because like most 12 episode animes, that\'s where the climax of the story is except nothing really big had happened.  Little did i know, that Sunrise was actually making this series a 25 episode series and by the time i found myself at what i thought i was the last episode (episode 12) all i could say was, ""...Holy ****...Wtf...Gimme my season 2 sunrise...NOW!""I was so confused by what was happening through the series and nothing seemed to make sense. The only thing driving the story seemed to be these mech battles and who would be the pilots of the 5 mysterious mechs called Valvraves. But Sunrise, the sneaky bastards that they are, give you clues all over the course of season 1 to the bigger plot that is at hand. No longer is this show about teenagers in a high school scenario kicking butt with mechs.Now the musical scores of Valvrave are great. The Opening is fast paced andmakes you feel like its back in the days of Gundam Seed. The Ending is very symbolic in its lyrics. It especially represents the main character which i think Sunrise did a very good job sneaking in.Overall, if you are willing to put the time and effort in watching this show, you will be rewarded for your efforts with a deep intricate plot that will have you twisting and turning crying out for the next episode. but think that Valvrave is just another Gundam anime knock off trying to gain fame which at first this series appears to be.

I don\'t think there\'s a formula I can pin down that explains why I find anime like Guilty Crown enduring in their blatant mindlessness, and why I find the subject of today\'s review: Valvrave the Liberator, just sort of stupid, boring and not worth watching. So let\'s use this opportunity to set up a test case shall we? Let\'s compare and contrast and hopefully at the end of it all, I can give a solid thesis on why this show is crap, but also why there\'s other anime...much like it that you all need to watch right now. Somewhere along the way, we\'ll find the problem, so let\'s get started.Hello people of ""The Wired"", my name is Quan, and I\'m back from my rather long hiatus to bring you a new anime review. Today it\'s Valvrave the Liberator, a recent entry in the mecha genre that looks to ride on the coat-tails of the genre\'s bombastic youth, but ends being a large firework show that neither had a point or a payoff. Let\'s begin then.Talking technical for a minute, I first need to mention that this is a review of exclusively the first season of Valvrave and I have neither the seen or plan to in the near future the franchise-concluding second season. As I said in my Railgun review, first seasons or spin-offs must stand on their own, and thus I can judge them as such. This first season aired in the year of 2013 and was 12 episodes long. Valvrave was brought to us by the lads over at Sunrise, mecha-nerds in their own right who have given us anime like Code Geass and many entries in the Gundam franchise. The director was Kou Matsuo, who hasn\'t done a lot, but directed Natsuyuki Rendezvous and did some work on Rozen Maiden. The script was handled in majority by Ichiro Okouchi, which is weird seeing that he\'s written some pretty good stuff: namely Code Geass. Hell, they even have structurally similar premises; many factions fighting for world control using giant robots, seen through the eyes of a protagonist that has been recently infected by a power that can give him the ability to turn the tides of war but he doesn\'t really understand and slowly eats away at his humanity. The major difference of course though between Code Geass and Valvrave is that one is crap and one is not. Guess which one is which.It is the year 71 of the ""True Calender"". As it typically is in mecha shows, since humanity took to living in space since the development of a technology known as ""Dyson Spheres""(basically floating climate bubbles in space), the world has been divided into two warring superpowers: The Dorssia Military Pact Federation and ARUS. In between these two factions is the Switzerland of this world: JIOR, a tiny neutral nation that favors neither side of the conflict. Our main character is a young man named Haruto, a typical member of a high-school in JIOR, who lives out his daily life in peace, in between hanging out with his friends and trying to muster the courage to ask his long-time crush Shoko how he feels. One day, when he takes Shoko out to a local shrine to finally confess his feeling towards her, and, in what is quite possibly the worst timing imaginable, Dorssia attacks JIOR out of the blue, with the intent of conjuring the tiny nation. In the chaos, Haruto discovers the Valvrave: a mysteriously powerful humanoid mecha that for some reason, the widely regarded peaceful government of JIOR was developing. After accepting the Valvrave\'s very ominous request to ""forfeit his humanity"" to be able to pilot it, Haruto uses the strangely powerful mecha to save his high-school. To escape the now conquered nation of JIOR, the students detach their Dyson Sphere from the burning nation of JIOR and float out into space, declaring themselves a new country... which I\'m sure is the best possible idea that they could have come up with. This, for the most part, is where the plot begins, as now Haruto must use the Valvrave to defend the nation of high-school students against the repeated attacks of Dorssia, and attempt to retain his humanity as the effects of piloting the Valvrave are felt, namely slowly turning him into a freakin\' vampire, acquired with the abilities to regenerate his wounds and take control of other people\'s bodies by biting them on the neck. Yeah, it doesn\'t really make any sense. And so, from there, stuff happens, more pilots for the other Valvraves are found, and you\'re left with a cliffhanger ending that raises more questions without answering any of your previous ones.Okay, so maybe I\'ve been unfair. I\'m not saying that this is at all a bad premise, while it isn\'t exactly anything revolutionary with the basic mecha cliches all there on the checklist, you can still make a good show out of this. I already mentioned how the premise of Code Geass is basically cut from the same cloth as Valvrave, but what Code Geass has that Valvrave doesn\'t is interesting politics between factions, complex characters and clever tactics. ""So,"" you might ask, ""what then, does Valvrave have to offer?"" Well that\'s part of the problem.You could say entertainment, and I wouldn\'t stop you. Valvrave definitely has lots of actions sequences, bright lights and high-school shenanigans in spades, but the problem it fails to give anything else to really offer. The characters aren\'t particularly likable, and hell, even though Valvrave would pride itself on being crazy unpredictable fun, the pace of the show kind of becomes stale once you realize the same thing starts happening over and over again throughout episodes: Dorssians attack the country, Haruto defends them with help from the various characters, maybe a new-color-of-the-rainbow Valvrave is introduced, and then we get to do the same thing next episode. Without clever character moments or even good comedy in between these action sequences, it just becomes sort of boring. I\'m pretty sure the anime itself realized it, and to compensate, it throws in ridiculous plot-twists nearly every episode in an effort to keep you entertained, no matter how juvenile or stupid these twists actually are. But this doesn\'t even work, probably because the show has no sense of narrative integrity, or in layman\'s terms, these twists wind down to little more than trolls so that the you will watch the next episode, and then the anime will jumps backwards, hands held up, and shout ""Nope, just joking!"" and then revert everything back to the status quot. I remember this particular occasion when a heavy weight was dropped directly before start of the final episode, and suddenly I was a little excited; my mind was racing about how this could change the dynamics between characters and further their development. But when I turned on the final episode this morning, I found that the first five minutes of it would be dedicated to complete undoing what had just occurred. And then it\'s just not brought up again for the entire episode, apparently forgotten by every single character involved. Like seriously, what the hell? And when something significant actually does happen, say a character dies, there\'s little reason to care, because when Valvrave isn\'t throwing giant robots fighting one another at you, or some ludicrous twist, it\'s just sort of... nothing. No development, or interesting character relations, just filler with stupid characters. Valvrave hasn\'t had an original thought in its life, nothing will intrigue you, nothing will make you think about to any length after the fact. I guess it could be entertaining at the best of times, but I stress at the best of times. You could do worse I suppose if you wanted to turn your brain off and watch some stupid, random anime on a Sunday afternoon, but hell, I got a list of shows right here that fill that prerequisite better. Okay, let me take a breath and... Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill, Nisekoi, Guilty Crown, Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199, Black Lagoon, Jormungand, even Sword Art Online did this ""dumb fun"" thing better than Valvrave. And you have no idea how much it burns my tongue to give Sword Art Online a compliment.The closest the anime comes to anything interesting is brought up when the genesis of the Valvraves are hinted at. I\'m pretty sure this will be more closely explored in the second season, especially after all the bait the ending of this season left. Possibly the secrets that are unraveling about the Valvrave and the entire nature of the JIOR high-school can add some much needed spice to this universe, and if they turn out to be dramatic or clever or interesting, that might possibly make this season a little better in my eyes, at least for setting the groundwork. That, of course, it a lot of assumption. There is a lot of unanswered questions, and I wish I could trust season 2 to fill me in, but considering the show we\'re talking about.... I\'m not even sure if I have enough emotional investment in these characters to care.There\'s also this quite bizarre side story that takes place in the distant future, involving what I presume are a mother and child in a post-Dorssia/ARUS-war world, and it raises some interesting implications for what could take place in the future of the anime, but assuming it actually is what I suspect it is, it does little more than just unnecessarily spoil huge parts of the story, and by extension, the second season. There are only about two of these segments in the entire show, so unless it somehow brilliantly ties into events in the second season, I fail to see the point of them.The characters don\'t exactly redeem anything either. Haruto, A.K.A our main character is as boring as they come. He is another one of those ""insert-main-protagonists"", by which I mean he has absolutely no defining features whatever. The anime wants you to get all involved with his struggle to retain humanity as he turns into a vampire-thing-whatever, but that struggle is highlighted so rarely that I don\'t even know if it\'s worthy of mention. It doesn\'t exactly come up in the terms of the plot, in fact, I think the biggest factor his transformation played in the role of the story was so he could have an excuse not to tell Shoko he liked her. And I think that\'s literally it. I can\'t bring myself to hate Haruto I suppose, but he\'s another one of those characters you could literally replace with any run-of-the-mill protagonist who was a ""nice guy"" and I\'m relatively sure nothing would have changed whatsoever. So, I guess I don\'t really like him much either.Shoko I think, is the one character I like in this entire anime. She\'s a bubbly piece of inspiration that helped to entertain me with her quirky antics when the show had run out of ideas of what to do in between robot battles, but unlike all the other characters, her quirkiness isn\'t her one singular trait. She can get serious when the situation calls for it, but still can remain stubbornly positive when things look dire. It\'s this optimism that lets her get along with everybody, and even form a friendship with Akira, an extremely anti-social hacker that lives in a hovel of cardboard boxes in the corner of the school, which ends up playing a huge part later on in the series, and was one of the only relationships which I felt was built up well. However, Shoko also has her flaws, typically trying to bear pain all by herself without showing it(sort of like Minori from Toradora), which eventually reaches a boiling point at the anime\'s climax. She\'s not a great character by any means, but comparing her to the rest of the cast, my positive viewpoint on her stands.I\'m surprised I haven\'t mentioned him yet, but L-Elf is the last main character you need to remember here. A fugitive of the Dorssia military who is forced to cooperate with Haruto after Haruto takes over his body and uses it to escape, L-Elf is forced to change his mission from changing the Dorssia empire from the inside and instead work with the Valvraves. L-Elf is the cold calculating type, he doesn\'t concern himself with relationships with the other characters or saving their lives, only what is the most efficient method to complete the mission. His reasons for working against Dorssia are kept very secretive, and by secretive I mean we only get one flashback that hints the reason might be rooted in his meeting with the princess of Dorssia when he was a child. I mean, I trust myself to fill in the blanks from there, but I\'d still say L-Elf still has the most potential development out of the entire cast, though I can\'t say it won\'t be handled in a sloppy and half-asked way. The way he interacts with Haruto, who basically has completely opposite ideals than him could be interesting, but that dynamic wasn\'t explored in any detail in this season, nor do I really expect it to be explored in the second. So yes, just like the rest of the cast, he\'s boring in the end.This anime actually has a fairly large cast, with various members of the student council and body, the Dorssia and ARUS military, as well as those in between, but it\'s actually really hard to say anything significant about any one of them. They are all one-dimensional; all the usual stereotypes populate this show, from the obsessive idol, the nerd, the NEET, the girl who dies so we can all feel sorry for her, the bad guys who are bad because they\'re bad, and all the blandness in between. It\'s quite remarkable really that such a huge cast can have no real variety or stand-outs, and I ended up not really caring about any of them. They\'re all just a really unlikable bunch of people, and that\'s probably one of the key reasons why Valvrave isn\'t able to stand on the same ground as the shows it\'s trying to emulate.Done by Sunrise, the animation quality of Valvrave the Liberator isn\'t really something I can get all that excited about. There\'s no lovely backgrounds, or cool aesthetic choices, everything typical; so the animation is there and does its job. The only thing that\'s worthy of note is the character designs, which besides from being a little eccentric with hair-styles, sport these very unique eyes of varying shades of blue and green. It\'s not so much of a problem as just something I noticed. The many, many fight scenes are alright; they are at least somewhat exhilarating, and will keep you entertained while they last. However, and I think this sums up my whole experience with Valvrave\'s animation, looking back, while I never had a problem with the animation, unlike some other shows with typical animation, there was never one standout moment where I thought ""wow"", or ""they really put a lot of effort into this scene"". That\'s not good, not really.Same for sound too. The OST for Valvrave was done Akira Senju, who like the writer, actually does have a couple of decent works under his belt. Most notably, he was responsible for the OST of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which while I haven\'t seen(and before anybody starts questioning my credibility I did see the original anime), I know for a fact it has some brilliant music, and the same can not be said for Valvrave. There\'s a couple orchestras and the such in there, and while it sounds okay for battle music, it\'s nothing you haven\'t before; and the rest of the OST mostly consists of those typical slice-of-life jingles you\'ve heard in absolutely every other anime ever. But finally, here\'s something good to talk about. In stark contrast to the lackluster soundtrack, the OP and ED of the anime are actually quite superb. The OP ""Preserved Roses"" is probably one of better openings of last year, with exciting music(if basic visuals), and the ED ""Bokujanai"" is quite unique, pairing high paced Japanese rap with a catchy-as-hell chorus, and marries them together wonderfully.So, I think we can label Valvrave a failure in the end, a failure to provide good characters, memorable scenes, or even to entertain. I asked a question in the beginning of this review, and that was, roughly ""why does Valvrave fail at being dumb fun?"" and why should you not watch Valvrave as opposed to an anime very much like it, or an anime whose sole purpose is to provide easy brain candy. Well, I think I\'ve got an answer now, after looking at the lack-luster characters, the stupid plot-twists and all that other wonderful bullshit. For all its eccentricities, Valvrave is a show that\'s missing a lot of soul. When you watch a show that tries to achieve that same feeling that Valvrave attempts, I at least feel, it\'s a show born because the creators wanted the audience to have a little fun. Valvrave feels like it\'s engineered for the sole purpose of keeping the audience around long enough so they feel obligated to buy merchandise, and all the craziness that it contains: those stupid plot-twists and ludicrous situations, are born from that. And yes, you could argue that\'s the purpose of every anime that\'s ever existed, but still, you\'re not supposed to be so obvious about it. As I said in the beginning of the review, Valvrave is an empty fireworks show; an hollow mess that\'s devoid of passion, creativity and soul, that feels like its very blue-prints was built to pander to the biggest demographic possible. So, I guess what I\'m trying to say in my very long-winded way, Valvrave is a bad anime. Not self-aware. Not ""so-bad-it\'s-good"". Not clever in any way. It\'s the inevitable result of putting together as many typical tropes of the mecha genre as possible, mashing them together, and hoping that it will be eaten up by the masses. So yes, just... plain... bad.Final Verdict: 4/10P.S: Not that I want her to be dead, but didn\'t she get hit by a missile? People typically don\'t survive that.For this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile) much like it that you all need to watch right now. Somewhere along the way, we\'ll find the problem, so let\'s get started.Hello people of ""The Wired"", my name is Quan, and I\'m back from my rather long hiatus to bring you a new anime review.

Valvrave was brought to us by the lads over at Sunrise, mecha-nerds in their own right who have given us anime like Code Geass and many entries in the Gundam franchise. The director was Kou Matsuo, who hasn\'t done a lot, but directed Natsuyuki Rendezvous and did some work on Rozen Maiden. The script was handled in majority by Ichiro Okouchi, which is weird seeing that he\'s written some pretty good stuff: namely Code Geass. Hell, they even have structurally similar premises; many factions fighting for world control using giant robots, seen through the eyes of a protagonist that has been recently infected by a power that can give him the ability to turn the tides of war but he doesn\'t really understand and slowly eats away at his humanity. The major difference of course though between Code Geass and Valvrave is that one is crap and one is not. Guess which one is which.It is the year 71 of the ""True Calender"". As it typically is in mecha shows, since humanity took to living in space since the development of a technology known as ""Dyson Spheres""(basically floating climate bubbles in space), the world has been divided into two warring superpowers: The Dorssia Military Pact Federation and ARUS. In between these two factions is the Switzerland of this world: JIOR, a tiny neutral nation that favors neither side of the conflict. Our main character is a young man named Haruto, a typical member of a high-school in JIOR, who lives out his daily life in peace, in between hanging out with his friends and trying to muster the courage to ask his long-time crush Shoko how he feels. One day, when he takes Shoko out to a local shrine to finally confess his feeling towards her, and, in what is quite possibly the worst timing imaginable, Dorssia attacks JIOR out of the blue, with the intent of conjuring the tiny nation. In the chaos, Haruto discovers the Valvrave: a mysteriously powerful humanoid mecha that for some reason, the widely regarded peaceful government of JIOR was developing. After accepting the Valvrave\'s very ominous request to ""forfeit his humanity"" to be able to pilot it, Haruto uses the strangely powerful mecha to save his high-school. To escape the now conquered nation of JIOR, the students detach their Dyson Sphere from the burning nation of JIOR and float out into space, declaring themselves a new country... which I\'m sure is the best possible idea that they could have come up with. This, for the most part, is where the plot begins, as now Haruto must use the Valvrave to defend the nation of high-school students against the repeated attacks of Dorssia, and attempt to retain his humanity as the effects of piloting the Valvrave are felt, namely slowly turning him into a freakin\' vampire, acquired with the abilities to regenerate his wounds and take control of other people\'s bodies by biting them on the neck. Yeah, it doesn\'t really make any sense. And so, from there, stuff happens, more pilots for the other Valvraves are found, and you\'re left with a cliffhanger ending that raises more questions without answering any of your previous ones.Okay, so maybe I\'ve been unfair. I\'m not saying that this is at all a bad premise, while it isn\'t exactly anything revolutionary with the basic mecha cliches all there on the checklist, you can still make a good show out of this. I already mentioned how the premise of Code Geass is basically cut from the same cloth as Valvrave, but what Code Geass has that Valvrave doesn\'t is interesting politics between factions, complex characters and clever tactics. ""So,"" you might ask, ""what then, does Valvrave have to offer?"" Well that\'s part of the problem.You could say entertainment, and I wouldn\'t stop you. Valvrave definitely has lots of actions sequences, bright lights and high-school shenanigans in spades, but the problem it fails to give anything else to really offer. The characters aren\'t particularly likable, and hell, even though Valvrave would pride itself on being crazy unpredictable fun, the pace of the show kind of becomes stale once you realize the same thing starts happening over and over again throughout episodes: Dorssians attack the country, Haruto defends them with help from the various characters, maybe a new-color-of-the-rainbow Valvrave is introduced, and then we get to do the same thing next episode. Without clever character moments or even good comedy in between these action sequences, it just becomes sort of boring. I\'m pretty sure the anime itself realized it, and to compensate, it throws in ridiculous plot-twists nearly every episode in an effort to keep you entertained, no matter how juvenile or stupid these twists actually are. But this doesn\'t even work, probably because the show has no sense of narrative integrity, or in layman\'s terms, these twists wind down to little more than trolls so that the you will watch the next episode, and then the anime will jumps backwards, hands held up, and shout ""Nope, just joking!"" and then revert everything back to the status quot. I remember this particular occasion when a heavy weight was dropped directly before start of the final episode, and suddenly I was a little excited; my mind was racing about how this could change the dynamics between characters and further their development. But when I turned on the final episode this morning, I found that the first five minutes of it would be dedicated to complete undoing what had just occurred. And then it\'s just not brought up again for the entire episode, apparently forgotten by every single character involved. Like seriously, what the hell? And when something significant actually does happen, say a character dies, there\'s little reason to care, because when Valvrave isn\'t throwing giant robots fighting one another at you, or some ludicrous twist, it\'s just sort of... nothing. No development, or interesting character relations, just filler with stupid characters. Valvrave hasn\'t had an original thought in its life, nothing will intrigue you, nothing will make you think about to any length after the fact. I guess it could be entertaining at the best of times, but I stress at the best of times. You could do worse I suppose if you wanted to turn your brain off and watch some stupid, random anime on a Sunday afternoon, but hell, I got a list of shows right here that fill that prerequisite better. Okay, let me take a breath and... Gurren Lagann, Kill la Kill, Nisekoi, Guilty Crown, Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2199, Black Lagoon, Jormungand, even Sword Art Online did this ""dumb fun"" thing better than Valvrave. And you have no idea how much it burns my tongue to give Sword Art Online a compliment.The closest the anime comes to anything interesting is brought up when the genesis of the Valvraves are hinted at. I\'m pretty sure this will be more closely explored in the second season, especially after all the bait the ending of this season left. Possibly the secrets that are unraveling about the Valvrave and the entire nature of the JIOR high-school can add some much needed spice to this universe, and if they turn out to be dramatic or clever or interesting, that might possibly make this season a little better in my eyes, at least for setting the groundwork. That, of course, it a lot of assumption. There is a lot of unanswered questions, and I wish I could trust season 2 to fill me in, but considering the show we\'re talking about.... I\'m not even sure if I have enough emotional investment in these characters to care.There\'s also this quite bizarre side story that takes place in the distant future, involving what I presume are a mother and child in a post-Dorssia/ARUS-war world, and it raises some interesting implications for what could take place in the future of the anime, but assuming it actually is what I suspect it is, it does little more than just unnecessarily spoil huge parts of the story, and by extension, the second season. There are only about two of these segments in the entire show, so unless it somehow brilliantly ties into events in the second season, I fail to see the point of them.The characters don\'t exactly redeem anything either. Haruto, A.K.A our main character is as boring as they come. He is another one of those ""insert-main-protagonists"", by which I mean he has absolutely no defining features whatever. The anime wants you to get all involved with his struggle to retain humanity as he turns into a vampire-thing-whatever, but that struggle is highlighted so rarely that I don\'t even know if it\'s worthy of mention. It doesn\'t exactly come up in the terms of the plot, in fact, I think the biggest factor his transformation played in the role of the story was so he could have an excuse not to tell Shoko he liked her. And I think that\'s literally it. I can\'t bring myself to hate Haruto I suppose, but he\'s another one of those characters you could literally replace with any run-of-the-mill protagonist who was a ""nice guy"" and I\'m relatively sure nothing would have changed whatsoever. So, I guess I don\'t really like him much either.Shoko I think, is the one character I like in this entire anime. She\'s a bubbly piece of inspiration that helped to entertain me with her quirky antics when the show had run out of ideas of what to do in between robot battles, but unlike all the other characters, her quirkiness isn\'t her one singular trait. She can get serious when the situation calls for it, but still can remain stubbornly positive when things look dire. It\'s this optimism that lets her get along with everybody, and even form a friendship with Akira, an extremely anti-social hacker that lives in a hovel of cardboard boxes in the corner of the school, which ends up playing a huge part later on in the series, and was one of the only relationships which I felt was built up well. However, Shoko also has her flaws, typically trying to bear pain all by herself without showing it(sort of like Minori from Toradora), which eventually reaches a boiling point at the anime\'s climax. She\'s not a great character by any means, but comparing her to the rest of the cast, my positive viewpoint on her stands.I\'m surprised I haven\'t mentioned him yet, but L-Elf is the last main character you need to remember here. A fugitive of the Dorssia military who is forced to cooperate with Haruto after Haruto takes over his body and uses it to escape, L-Elf is forced to change his mission from changing the Dorssia empire from the inside and instead work with the Valvraves. L-Elf is the cold calculating type, he doesn\'t concern himself with relationships with the other characters or saving their lives, only what is the most efficient method to complete the mission. His reasons for working against Dorssia are kept very secretive, and by secretive I mean we only get one flashback that hints the reason might be rooted in his meeting with the princess of Dorssia when he was a child. I mean, I trust myself to fill in the blanks from there, but I\'d still say L-Elf still has the most potential development out of the entire cast, though I can\'t say it won\'t be handled in a sloppy and half-asked way. The way he interacts with Haruto, who basically has completely opposite ideals than him could be interesting, but that dynamic wasn\'t explored in any detail in this season, nor do I really expect it to be explored in the second. So yes, just like the rest of the cast, he\'s boring in the end.This anime actually has a fairly large cast, with various members of the student council and body, the Dorssia and ARUS military, as well as those in between, but it\'s actually really hard to say anything significant about any one of them. They are all one-dimensional; all the usual stereotypes populate this show, from the obsessive idol, the nerd, the NEET, the girl who dies so we can all feel sorry for her, the bad guys who are bad because they\'re bad, and all the blandness in between. It\'s quite remarkable really that such a huge cast can have no real variety or stand-outs, and I ended up not really caring about any of them. They\'re all just a really unlikable bunch of people, and that\'s probably one of the key reasons why Valvrave isn\'t able to stand on the same ground as the shows it\'s trying to emulate.Done by Sunrise, the animation quality of Valvrave the Liberator isn\'t really something I can get all that excited about. There\'s no lovely backgrounds, or cool aesthetic choices, everything typical; so the animation is there and does its job. The only thing that\'s worthy of note is the character designs, which besides from being a little eccentric with hair-styles, sport these very unique eyes of varying shades of blue and green. It\'s not so much of a problem as just something I noticed. The many, many fight scenes are alright; they are at least somewhat exhilarating, and will keep you entertained while they last. However, and I think this sums up my whole experience with Valvrave\'s animation, looking back, while I never had a problem with the animation, unlike some other shows with typical animation, there was never one standout moment where I thought ""wow"", or ""they really put a lot of effort into this scene"". That\'s not good, not really.Same for sound too. The OST for Valvrave was done Akira Senju, who like the writer, actually does have a couple of decent works under his belt. Most notably, he was responsible for the OST of Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood, which while I haven\'t seen(and before anybody starts questioning my credibility I did see the original anime), I know for a fact it has some brilliant music, and the same can not be said for Valvrave. There\'s a couple orchestras and the such in there, and while it sounds okay for battle music, it\'s nothing you haven\'t before; and the rest of the OST mostly consists of those typical slice-of-life jingles you\'ve heard in absolutely every other anime ever. But finally, here\'s something good to talk about. In stark contrast to the lackluster soundtrack, the OP and ED of the anime are actually quite superb. The OP ""Preserved Roses"" is probably one of better openings of last year, with exciting music(if basic visuals), and the ED ""Bokujanai"" is quite unique, pairing high paced Japanese rap with a catchy-as-hell chorus, and marries them together wonderfully.So, I think we can label Valvrave a failure in the end, a failure to provide good characters, memorable scenes, or even to entertain. I asked a question in the beginning of this review, and that was, roughly ""why does Valvrave fail at being dumb fun?"" and why should you not watch Valvrave as opposed to an anime very much like it, or an anime whose sole purpose is to provide easy brain candy. Well, I think I\'ve got an answer now, after looking at the lack-luster characters, the stupid plot-twists and all that other wonderful bullshit. For all its eccentricities, Valvrave is a show that\'s missing a lot of soul. When you watch a show that tries to achieve that same feeling that Valvrave attempts, I at least feel, it\'s a show born because the creators wanted the audience to have a little fun. Valvrave feels like it\'s engineered for the sole purpose of keeping the audience around long enough so they feel obligated to buy merchandise, and all the craziness that it contains: those stupid plot-twists and ludicrous situations, are born from that. And yes, you could argue that\'s the purpose of every anime that\'s ever existed, but still, you\'re not supposed to be so obvious about it. As I said in the beginning of the review, Valvrave is an empty fireworks show; an hollow mess that\'s devoid of passion, creativity and soul, that feels like its very blue-prints was built to pander to the biggest demographic possible. So, I guess what I\'m trying to say in my very long-winded way, Valvrave is a bad anime. Not self-aware. Not ""so-bad-it\'s-good"". Not clever in any way. It\'s the inevitable result of putting together as many typical tropes of the mecha genre as possible, mashing them together, and hoping that it will be eaten up by the masses. So yes, just... plain... bad.Final Verdict: 4/10P.S: Not that I want her to be dead, but didn\'t she get hit by a missile? People typically don\'t survive that.For this review and others, feel free to check out my blog! (Link on profile)', 'Kakumeiki Valvrave: A Liberating Viewing ExperienceOkay, I\'m going to take off my reviewer hat for this one. While I usually base an anime off of its overall plot, characters, and production elements, I\'m going to have to break the mold with this one. This series, I dare say, is so bad, it\'s good. It\'s like watching a Michael Bay movie. You know it\'s bad, but you just can\'t take your eyes off it.Kakumeiki Valvrave is perhaps one of, if not, the most cliche mecha anime I\'ve ever seen. You name a mecha anime trope and this series has got it. I\'d even call it...the love child of Code Geass and Gundam Seed because it steals so many elements from both. Military members sneak into a neutral country to obtain overpowering weapons? Check. High schoolers learn how to use a mecha on a whim? Check. High schoolers obtain a mysterious power that gives them an advantage? Check. An uprising takes place in the middle of a war to create a 3rd party consisting of the protagonists? Check. Overpowering lead character? Half-check. Love triangle? Check. I could seriously go on-and-on, but I\'ll just leave it at this. What makes this series so great despite it\'s cliche as hell story? The fact that the writing and production staff give us the impression that this series is self-aware. It\'s supposed to be aesthetically pleasing and cliche and for some reason, it made this series a fun watch. I\'ll be honest, this was probably the most fun I\'ve had watching a bad anime in a long time.The story is about as Gundam Seed as it gets. L-Elf and a special ops group from Dorssia sneaks into Module 77 to obtain secret weapons known as Valvraves. However, their plan is thwarted when our series lead, Haruto Tokishima becomes enraged by Dorssia\'s invasion and the assumed death of his high school crush, Shouko Sashinami and as a result of it causes him to crawl inside the Valvrave and use it against Dorssia. It seems he is successful, but he learns that the Valvraves are not ordinary machines, granting him a power that even gets him to question his own humanity. Generally speaking, it\'s an okay story...but it\'s been beaten to death by prior mecha anime. The only new element this series introduces is the element of immortal, vampire-like abilities for these would-be mecha pilots. An interesting element to say the least, but I would argue that vampire stories and mecha anime are two subjects in the media right now that are beaten to death and are getting old.I will say that the characters for this series are pretty damn likable. In fact, I\'d even go so far as to say that Haruto is actually one of the least likable characters in the series and he\'s not even that bad of a character. I really enjoy L-Elf\'s calm and scheming demeanor, Shouko\'s quirkiness, Saki\'s downright celebrity craze, Akira\'s adorable as hell NEET-like personality, Raizou\'s ""It\'s Thunder!"" badass personality...and that\'s only a few of the characters. It\'s an interesting mix and even while some are lacking development, their personalities shine through to make for an interesting watch.The production elements (animation and music) I would say are solid, but not breathtaking. I will admit though it is nice to see T.M. Revolution back doing anime theme songs again. He\'s really damn good at it and his song Preserved Roses, the OP song for this series duet style with Nana Mizuki gives this series the upbeat start that gets me looking forward to each new episode.Overall, Kakumeiki Valvrave is a downright enjoyable series. Sure, it\'s story is extremely cliche, but this is one instance where I can somewhat overlook it due to how fun this series is with its cliches. I\'m almost willing to say this series is self-aware of this and takes advantage of it. I also have to give this series some credit, it had an event in a later episode that ended up sparking one of the funniest anime memes I\'ve ever seen. I\'d highly recommend this series to anyone that enjoys Sunrise\'s mecha anime like Gundam and Code Geass. I\'d also recommend it if you can enjoy a series that doesn\'t take itself too seriously. However, if you\'re looking for an original mecha anime with a heavy story like Neon Genesis Evangelion, I\'d say give this a pass. All-in-all, while I will say I\'ve seen better anime this year, I don\'t think I\'ll see an anime that is as fun as this one to watch. the love child of Code Geass and Gundam Seed because it steals so many elements from both.

Valvrave deals with a lot of demonic attributes with not only the creepy music but how the protagonist (Haruto) is always trying to bite the sh*t out of someone. While watching this anime, it\'s got me thing what it would be like if my high school became a country. Every episode somehow the story progresses. At first when my brother...started watching it, all i did was look at it and I thought it was stupid, but I decided to go back an watch it my self and I couldn\'t wait to know what happened in the next episode. Valvrave can defiantly be an anime you judge at first site, but since every episode ends with a cliff hanger...you desperately want to know what happens next.Art and Music:The art is very crisp and I can see the artist of this anime really focuses on colors, because it really brings out and brightens everything on the characters. Watch Valvrave in HD(shout out to nwanime), your eyes will bleed because of the brightness(joking, but HD Valvrave is the best). I like both the OP and ED 1, but the second ED is ok but not great.Characters:Valvrave, like most animes, makes you hate the main character(Haruto)...because he\'s a b*tch. But because he\'s the main dude I guess you can accept him(but, Haruto did gain some extra points to me in episode 10). I hate the main love interest of Haruto, Shoko. I love the second sort of kinda of love interest of Haruto(she likes him more than he like her), Saki. Saki is a little annoying in the begging, but after finding out why she\'s that way...you love her. The other main dude, L-elf is awesome. And the other characters you either love, like, hate, or don\'t really have an opinion on.Romance Aspect:I had to add this as its separate category, since I\'m a girl who loves her romance. Valvrave has actually more romance then you think(which I like oh so much), but it pisses you off a little , cuz the anime writers have to be cliché some times and do the ""right"" thing(although I want to see I guess you could say the ""wrong"" thing)...you\'ll get what I\'m talking about if you watch it. To say the least, Valvrave\'s romance parts kinda of get you excited.Overall, I give Valvrave a 9/10. The anime is well thought through, it has great art, music, romance, but that anime all together has to involve a little more to the next level. Because, it\'s a time of anime that if they don\'t throw in new curve balls into the second season...it can become sort of redundant. started watching it, all i did was look at it and I thought it was stupid, but I decided to go back an watch it my self and I couldn\'t wait to know what happened in the next episode.

Especially after episode 10 like really? Funny thing is I expect something like this from Sunrise and I love em for it. Can't wait for the second season.Honestly I've really enjoyed this Anime so far, I'd say its the best of the Season if I didn't like Giant titan smashing. For overall enjoyment this Anime has been outstanding, it reminds of a parody, something like tru blood in space with mecha. I thought something was missing in this show and I found it in episode 10 which is why...I decided to write my review now. This Anime is full of random ass things but for some reason its just great. The Art is top notch and that is to be expected of Sunrise but I think this is the first time I have seen CG Mecha actually on equall terms with drawn Mecha fights. The sound isn't anything special but its not horrible so it works out. I originally thought the story was just awful but as more episodes have come out the story is beginning to unravel a bit and I think it's safe to say that story is fair since I really just overall enjoy the anime. The characters is where any of my disappointment lies. None of them strike my mind as different then any other anime except maybe Saki. There is not a lot of story behind the characters so you can't really attach to any of them. And I mean cmon who wants the hero boy to be their favorite character? But its great because some of the characters happen to give up their humanity and be Vampires :DAnyways don't sit here reading this go enjoy the Anime and be mind boggled like I am.

That remains to be seen, but the show is at least on the way to achieving its intended outcome of providing entertainment at any cost.As the first collaboration between Aniplex and the Sunrise animation studio, Valvrave is a series that relies on spectacle as the main source of its inherent value. This is a show where going beyond the limits of reasonable storytelling is the entire point, not accidental or unintentional. While the series may not stand up to highly critical scrutiny, it is self-aware of its own preposterous nature and feeds on incredulous reactions.Of course, this sort of...shameless approach can easily backfire on the creators. The precarious artificiality of its construction carries the risk of making the preponderance of absurd or funny elements too much for the average viewer to bear, but for the time being I feel Valvrave seems to be worth at least one watch, as long as the spectator is willing to both completely relax and dismiss any expectations of common sense or virtue being the guiding principles of the viewing experience.Story:It is difficult to avoid noticing that past Sunrise projects such as Gundam SEED, the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Code Geass or Infinite Ryvius, among other shows, are all being used as partial sources of real or perceived inspiration and imitation here. Within that general context, the basic premise of Valvrave seems fairly predictable at first glance and surely won\'t earn a lot of points for originality. However, even the most obvious comparisons can be misleading.Many of those similarities fulfill the role of giving the audience a false sense of security. In this case, the Valvrave equation also includes a few surprises which were conspicuously missing from the initial pre-airing promotional videos and advertisements. For instance, the first episode felt like a slightly reworked interpretation of the typical Gundam premiere, when a boy named Haruto from Module 77 accidentally finds the Valvrave mecha and defeats an invading Dorssian force, but then the creators pull out the rug below our feet with a last minute plot twist which nobody in their right mind could possibly see coming. The ultimate ramifications of this supernatural turn haven\'t been fully explored so far, but it does make for several entertaining and amusing scenarios.Is this as juvenile as it sounds? Definitely, considering that a more serious show would try to slow down or retroactively justify itself for a considerable amount of time after taking such a sudden left turn. Instead, Valvrave prefers to keep going. This production usually only pays little or no lip service to such concerns before quickly preparing and dropping the next crazy twist. By design, excess and exaggeration are the norm. The character of L-elf, whose over-the-top plans are rarely explained and whose ridiculously impossible predictions are openly called ""prophecies"" by both himself and those around him, actually serves to highlight this fact. Even the mecha action, while also competent in the traditional sense, has a rather whimsical edge and includes several goofy elements.To the writer\'s credit, somehow the series does occasionally get to have it both ways. Certain scenes manage to break away from sheer ridiculousness by engaging in perfunctory foreshadowing for intriguing future events or at least adequately lining up a few of the pins before taking them down again. Nevertheless, all too often the show is just as willing to make fun of its own attempts at drama or seriousness, even at the expense of the poor characters themselves. Where other series would try to desperately hide their silliness at the first opportunity and concentrate on making the dramatics always feel genuine, generally Valvrave can\'t play itself straight for too long without otherwise shifting the tone and even winking at the audience from time to time, especially given the bizarre behavior of a certain AI entity that seems eager to slightly break the fourth wall.Unfortunately, in light of a controversial event that happens towards the end of the broadcast, I imagine that good taste must have been in short supply in the staff room. Which isn\'t the only problem: the basic structure of the season isn\'t particularly innovative as a whole, in spite of all these entertaining maneuvers. After an extended introductory arc, the second half treats us to several episodes where the main focus fleetingly goes from one new Valvrave pilot to the next and most of the enemy forces prove to be at best creatively incompetent during their weekly attacks on the students. The formula seemed to be gradually getting close to exhaustion, before the season finale spiced things up again with a technically interesting yet not entirely satisfactory spin on the current course of events. Where we go from there is anyone\'s guess.Art and Animation:By the usual standards of modern Japanese animation for non-theatrical productions, the series regularly manages to look decent with only a modest amount of obvious budget shortcuts. The color palette tends to find a happy medium between darkness and light that works well with the material. The character designs of the various students and Dorssians aren\'t particularly original on paper yet still manage to come across as very distinct in practice, and the 3D computer graphics used for the various mecha and space action scenes are generally above average.Sound:The music composed by Akira Senju is surprisingly effective, managing to properly set the varying moods of this story and successfully accompany the major battle sequences without any glaring issues. In addition, the opening by Nana Mizuki and T.M.Revolution as well as the two ending themes by angela and ELISA are good performances by popular industry artists. There\'s no accounting for musical preferences, but I feel this particular technical aspect of the show\'s production is perhaps its single strongest point.Character:The protagonist, Haruto, is currently the weakest link among an admittedly typical cast of characters. He is another peace-loving boy whose life changes after jumping into a giant robot and who often finds himself being the center of attention against his wishes. That said, one notable element which saves Haruto from being as annoying as other similar or worse protagonists is his considerable willingness to fight, in spite of his personal worries. Curiously, after the first episode he rarely ever hesitates and is quite prepared to kill in battle when necessary. There\'s really only one scene where he experienced actual angst and, while it seems hard to truly sympathize with him, at the very least I didn\'t find Haruto unbearable. Just mostly boring and in need of development.Frankly, the external circumstances surrounding Haruto sound more interesting than the guy himself. Surprisingly enough, the series benefits from unexpectedly making a couple of the other regulars who interact with him either mildly compelling or simply entertaining enough to pick up the slack.L-elf may lack the usual charisma of other mastermind-type characters and his personal background has only been partially addressed, but he still provides a clear contrast to Haruto\'s inherently kind nature and even has an oddly socially handicapped yet still amusing personality despite his cold exterior. Perhaps more importantly for a series of this nature, he is a frequent source of unrealistic actions that can be appreciated for their audacity if you do not demand any sort of credible explanations for them.Two characters which are especially divisive are Shoko and Saki. They\'re both very flawed individuals who can attract or repel due to their childish attitudes and impulsiveness. In fact, that\'s part of why I\'d dare to argue they also displayed a slightly more nuanced form of characterization than what was obvious at first, in addition to the various exaggerated shenanigans they directly carried out.Shoko isn\'t too smart and comes up with ridiculous ideas that somehow work even if other characters explicitly point out their silliness, which is good for more than a few laughs and a couple of face-palms, but in truth she\'s more of an idealistic leader than merely a buffoon. Saki combines a cynical edge, a selfish attention-seeking attitude and a manipulative yet honest loneliness, while also seemingly destined to play a larger role in the future. Of course, you could simply call them a ""good girl"" and a ""bad girl"" at heart, period, which is undeniably true. Still, even if neither of them may fully escape from their constituent archetypes, since the show isn\'t aiming high enough to accomplish anything truly new, the fact is they contributed to making Valvrave more enjoyable than its own protagonist did. Well, at least for those who didn\'t react negatively to either of them.The rest of the cast has its ups and downs, since the other Valvrave pilots received some fleeting time in the spotlight yet the main villains usually lacked even that much until the last episode, but as a whole they can be considered underdeveloped and thus not worth discussing in further detail for now. Frankly, Valvrave could be rightfully accused of having several unnecessary secondary or tertiary characters who competed for screen time with the main cast and with each other. They couldn\'t all be properly portrayed -or, for that matter, even used as effective sources of superficial entertainment- within twelve episodes. Will another set be enough to address this? Probably not.Enjoyment:When you go past the previous considerations, it all comes down to the fact that Valvrave is often just a lot of dumb fun.You might not always care for the isolated moments of drama and melodrama, or you might even find how the series deals with certain issues to be morally or intellectually questionable, but I\'d be lying if I said it wasn\'t entertaining to see what crazy twist or unexpectedly interesting event happens from week to week, or what new mecha action scene will come next, or how the creators will explicitly or implicitly highlight the absurdity of a major or minor development.In the end, for me it\'s clear this show knows it is an artificial, messy construct made with the intention of entertaining its audience through bold spectacle and twisted humor that borders on the farcical. I can\'t consider it particularly ""good"" in a general sense, but I also won\'t call it truly ""bad"" at this point in time. Even at the expense of the entire edifice potentially crashing down once and for all next season, I enjoyed watching the first season of Valvrave. shameless approach can easily backfire on the creators. The precarious artificiality of its construction carries the risk of making the preponderance of absurd or funny elements too much for the average viewer to bear, but for the time being I feel Valvrave seems to be worth at least one watch, as long as the spectator is willing to both completely relax and dismiss any expectations of common sense or virtue being the guiding principles of the viewing experience.Story:It is difficult to avoid noticing that past Sunrise projects such as Gundam SEED, the original Mobile Suit Gundam, Code Geass or Infinite Ryvius, among other shows, are all being used as partial sources of real or perceived inspiration and imitation here. Within that general context, the basic premise of Valvrave seems fairly predictable at first glance and surely won\'t earn a lot of points for originality. However, even the most obvious comparisons can be misleading.Many of those similarities fulfill the role of giving the audience a false sense of security. In this case, the Valvrave equation also includes a few surprises which were conspicuously missing from the initial pre-airing promotional videos and advertisements. For instance, the first episode felt like a slightly reworked interpretation of the typical Gundam premiere, when a boy named Haruto from Module 77 accidentally finds the Valvrave mecha and defeats an invading Dorssian force, but then the creators pull out the rug below our feet with a last minute plot twist which nobody in their right mind could possibly see coming.

Even at the expense of the entire edifice potentially crashing down once and for all next season, I enjoyed watching the first season of Valvrave.', 'If you want to see an anime about space Nazis, body swapping vampires, high school students who create their own country and vampires raping these high school students: this show is for you. If you want to see a show with the whiniest main character since Mirai Nikki: look no further. If you want to hear the characters try to pronounce German names (e.g. ""ERU-ERUFU"", ""KOE-VIERU"", ""HAA-NOINU"", ""RIEYSEHROTTEH""): look no further. This review will cover 5 aspects of our opinion about this trainwreck.~Story~ 1/10Starting off, our ultraheroic, and super manly protagonist tries to confess his love to his tsundere crush. This is definitely not a...cliche. Then, out of nowhere, his school gets attacked by space nazis and he dramatically watches his beloved tsundere crush die. The shock! After that, he pilots a robot, gives up his humanity and becomes a whinybodyswappingrapistvampire. ""Is this a word?"" you ask? As of now it is. This is the actual plot of the first episode, ladies and gentlemen. We\'re not making this up. But in episode 2, his beloved tsundere crush is alive and well! Why? Because plot convenience. Great writing there. The school then decides to create their own country: which consists of their school (again: we\'re not making this up). From here on, everything goes downhill. Our favorite high school student citizens (or whatever they are) start singing a crappy J-Pop song, and our awesome whiny protagonist teams up with a space nazi who can predict the future and that the other space nazis are going to attack the school, and where. Again: why? Because plot convenience. Also, apparently our favorite protagonists has to rape high school girls because of the fact that he\'s a body swapping vampire thing. Once again, we\'re not joking. Of course we can\'t cover the entire story here, but what we can promise you: it only gets worse from here on.[CONCLUSION]The story is inconsistent, cliche and plain stupid. Also, using rape in an anime for no good reason is just a no-go. It\'s simply disgusting.~Art~ 6/10The art in this anime is colorful and bright: it was our favorite aspect of this show. One of our few problems with the art is that whenever the story gets dramatic (or at least when it tries to be), the art ruins the mood. When the story is facing reality, and it\'s being what it is (some sort of happy high school drama) then the art is fitting.[CONCLUSION]The art was pretty much the best thing from this crappy show, in our opinion.~Sound~ 5/10J-Pop. Why is there J-Pop in the middle of an episode? It makes as much sense to us as it probably does to you right now. The opening however, was a Japanese (mixed with some beautiful Engrish) duet. It\'s loud, bombastic and it kind of fits the show. The ending wasn\'t anything special, but it was decent. As for the background music... more J-Pop. Seriously, it\'s everywhere in this anime, especially in scenes that really do not need a crappy J-Pop song playing in the background. Because which dramatic mecha battle doesn\'t need a happy, upbeat J-Pop song playing in the background?[CONCLUSION]We actually liked the opening, and we thought the ending was okay. The background music however was questionable at times. The music wasn\'t that good, but it certainly wasn\'t the worst part of this show.~Character~ 1/10Heroic main character-kun, Tsundere-chan and a random guy who can predict enemy attacks without having done any logical research are the main characters of this show. The directors did a great job creating the best and the most original anime cast ever, right? They even added a shy girl, an antisocial girl, a best friend and an arrogant girl. The antagonists in this anime were even worse. Their motives basically came down to ""I love killing"". We all know these kind of antagonists.Every imaginable trope in anime is used in this cast. Congratulations creators, on creating the most extraordinary cast ever![CONCLUSION]There is close to no character development (except for the fact that Heroic main character-kun turns into a body swapping space vampire rapist thing), our protagonist is whiny and unlikable and everyone else was unoriginal. It is not very likely that you\'ll care about the characters\' lives and bringing them back to life (Tsundere-chan) was a stupid move that prevented any possible character development for our favorite body swapping space vampire rapist. Also, the antagonists are plain and boring.~Enjoyment~ 2/10Watching this was just as enjoyable as being crushed by an elephant and then being forced to watch Mars of Destruction on repeat. It was fun to laugh at some stupid parts in the anime, but we don\'t believe that this was the goal that this show was pursuing. We have no idea how we worked up the courage to finish watching this.[CONCLUSION]Please save yourself and skip this one. We regret watching this and would much rather have spent our precious time on something useful (or at least a better anime).Over all, we certainly did not like this show. Please stay away from it and spend your time on a show that doesn\'t involve space Nazi\'s or bodyswappingspacevampirerapists.

It is almost as if some of the possibilities of Code Geass that were cut short in that series are explored here. What if Lelouche and Euphemia had succeeded in building their little state? They would be be in a very similar position as the students from Sakimori High.It has a very similar character setup: the kind Mecha pilot and the ""evil"" genius tactician fightingagainst domineering powers for their own way to the future. Also there is the student council and the child of the prime minister.And there is a supernatural element...milked for story potential (shaking up relationships and giving the underdog an distinctive edge), this time it has a vampiric theme.Last, but not least for this preliminary review let me add that the contrast of school life versus high politics is also similar to Code Geass.However, Ōkouchi takes the elements and tries to make more out of it than a carbon copy of Code Geass. The more the the story progresses it plays out differently from Code Geass. Familiar elements enter in different constellations and go to different ends. I am anxious to see how the season ends.First I started watching this anime as a filler for Gargantia, then I was fascinated by the similarities to Code Geass, and now I see it as a new work from an author grappling with themes that he is not finished with yet from his last one. milked for story potential (shaking up relationships and giving the underdog an distinctive edge), this time it has a vampiric theme.Last, but not least for this preliminary review let me add that the contrast of school life versus high politics is also similar to Code Geass.However, Ōkouchi takes the elements and tries to make more out of it than a carbon copy of Code Geass.

Rather than being ""the system that exposes the world"", this first season instead seems to demonstrate what happens when teenage fantasies go horribly wrong.Set in a high school -- yes, it\'s one of these shows -- on a space colony in Earth orbit, the mostly adolescent characters find their world turned upside down when the love child of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, Dorssia, invades their country JIOR, which being based on perceptions...of today\'s Japan, is run by pusillanimous wimps who are determined not to fight back. However, they have a secret ultimate weapon underneath the school, the Valvrave, which the otherwise passive Haruto Tokishima is the first of several students to take over and fight back against the Dorssian onslaught. As you might guess, the story has a rather camp feel to it, and sometimes goes into weird slice of life territory, reminiscent of screenwriter Ichiro Okouchi\'s previous work Code Geass. And similarly, it does take some rather dark turns later on, and has its unexpected moments. It\'s not brilliant, but it\'s captivating, to say the least. A warning for some people: there is a mostly off-screen rape, as well as some gore in this series.Characters are, well -- if you\'ve seen other anime series, you probably know these characters, since they mostly follow established archetypes. And with so many of them vying for screen time, their backgrounds aren\'t explored much during this first season, though some complexity is hinted at. I found myself developing favourites, and loving to hate some of the others.The art is fantastic, with character designs by D.Gray-man creator Katsura Hoshino, and cool mechanical designs for each of the robots. The attention to little details in many scenes, the crisp and clear animation, and exciting action sequences make this show a pleasure to watch.Sound is excellent as well, with great voice acting performances from Yuichi Nakamura (Yamada ""Thunder"" Raizou), giving the character a sense of badassery; Aoi Yuuki (Akira), giving a true sense of her character\'s crippling anxiety; and Daisuke Ono (Cain), capturing the evil menace of this character. The music is great, too, with the first ending theme, ""Boku ja nai"" by Angela, as a ear worm that left me feeling especially emotional after the show, along with the exciting opening theme ""Preserved Roses"", the haunting second ending theme ""Soba ni Iruyo"", and great background music during some of the darker sequences.Overall, while the story feels a bit like a slow start of something potentially great, the first half of Kakumeiki Valvrave has still been for me the most enjoyable anime of the Spring 2013 season. Even though some of the lines are often silly or melodramatic, making this show a bit of a guilty pleasure to talk about, it drew me in and became the one anime I was certain not to miss each and every week. of today\'s Japan, is run by pusillanimous wimps who are determined not to fight back.

I\'m fairly easy to please, some good action, cool characters, and a passable story and I\'ll likely be held over.When I started to think about the series I realised why I, someone who has generally low expectations for things and will let blatant flaws slide, was so bored. This series just fails to deliver on pretty much every level.Now I did not go into this series expecting an epic space opera. When I read about it...on TVtropes I just thought ""well from the tropes described it seems like a campy super robot ride so I thought okay i\'ll turn my brain off and just let the show take me for a ride. But then when I started watching we got things like tactical espionage, a neutral nation being suddenly attacks people dying and it was starting to look like the opening to a gundam show. So is it trying to tell a drama filled war story about the horrors of war? It seemed more like a quirky slice of life romance 5 minutes ago. What the hell Valvrave?Therein lies the first problem: Random out of nowhere mood whiplashes.Okay so a bunch of child solders just killed two people and are sneaking into the colony disguised as students to find some sort of millitary secret. Fine okay so what are they looking for? Oh hey let\'s jump cut to an eating contest between two students and completely ruin the series mood. What follows is about 10 minutes of awkward slice of life hijinks about the guy and girl competing earlier trying to work up the courage to confess to each other. Then literally right as they are about to say it Giant robots with crotch lasers get launched out and start blowing shit up. Again, what? I\'m glad you went back to the millitary side of things but that was kinda random. Also why are your crotch laser robots attacking anyways it\'s not like your child soldiers have been found yet so wouldnt starting a large scale millitary attack raise alarms and make it HARDER to their jobs. This action leads directly to the main character Haruto getting the Valvrave is you just left it alone you would have gotten the damn thing. From this point things seem to stay consistantly in the war aspect of things. The federation opposing the empire comes to help the colony and focus is given to trying to evacuate civilians okay fine they\'re taking a logical course of action and trying to evacuate people before the enemy returns and the area becomes a combat zone. But nope suddenly teh enemy comes back and attacks earlier than planned so Arus (the federation) decides to pussy out and abandon the innocent students, taking the valvrave so they can get a leg up. How does this resolve? The students use the Valvrave as a bargaining chip to declare themselves an independent nation. Again WHAT?! so everything becomes hunky dory they\'re all happy and safe in their new amazing nation. Then the power goes out and they go into winter mode running the risk of freezing everyone to death. Gee, it\'s almost like a nation run entirely by teenagers is a bad thing. So you see the anime has a tendancy to suddenly jump between a millitary show about a super robot and a slice of life romantic comedy.This leads into the next problem: The slows fails to deliver expections for both a Super Robot and a Real Robot anime. Now lately these two terms have been used to seperate shows based on overall tone and presentation, at least in my opinion. Super Robot connotes more hammy over the top GAR charm. It\'s like the anime equivilent of dumb action flicks, to me at least. Filled with screaming, over the top action, and quirky charming characters who supply us these things. Real Robots tend to focus on more realistic applications of these weapons. The horrors of war and what happens to one because of it are usually present themes. Battles take more realistic bents as actual war strategies are used and things tend to be overall darker and grittier. These are generally my personal guildlines of how I judge series and when evaluating Valvrave it falls flat on either of these appeals. The Valvrave seems almost underpowered sometimes. It relies on it\'s flashy pink lights to be able to get close and hit someone with a sword. The fight scenes didn\'t really scream AWESOME it was just like okay Valvrave deflects lasers then slashes things, BORING! It\'s one flashy over the top attack is honestly really stupid and shows many design flaws in the eponymous robot that should have gotten it turned into space dust. So it\'s focus on close quarters means that it\'ll be mostly focusing it\'s attention in front of it. So if the Dorssian army has the brains to try a pincer attack, a forward force drawing it\'s attention while a second force attacks from a vulnerable angle, you could probably destroy or capture it REALLY easily. The thing apparently overheats if you do ANYTHING meaning you literally can\'t even MOVE without running the rish of shutting yourself down. But it\'s okay let the heat build up and you can STAB YOUSELF and fire a massive heat ray. So how exactly does the reactor work with a giant sword hole in it then? Any super robot worth it\'s salt could pound this thing flat.Real Robot aspects are even worse. The constant mood whiplash leaves everything jumbled and messy. If you, the viewer, can\'t even register the consequences of their actions, how do you expect the characters to?Speaking of characters third problem, they\'re all idiots all of them no exceptions.Okay so you have Haruto the whiney, probably not out of shape, socially inept joke of a main character who finds a way to ruin the entertainment value in EVERY damn scene he\'s in. Dude can\'t win an eating conest, dude can\'t throw a punch, dude can\'t work up the courage to confess to his love interest the list goes on. So looking past that why is he the main character, what\'s his stake in all this? His love interest gets blown up in the first episode (spoilers she\'s fine) and that suddenly turns him from a spinless pussy to revenge seeking genocide machine. *smack* another point for the mood whiplash. Also apparently piloting a giant death machine for revenge does NOT include reading the goddamn CONSOLE DISPLAY!!!! People seem to justify that one as him being panicked and not thinking, claiming anyone would be disoriented in that situation. That would have been passible IF THERE WERE ANY CONTROLS BESIDES THE JOYSTICK AND CONSOLE. He turns the thing on and then proceeds to just keep wiggling the joystick expecting it to work. Okay I understand your in a panic but if it doesnt move try checking what is literally the ONLY OTHER DISPLAY YOU FUCKING IDIOT!!! From then on the boy continues to show absolutely no form of sense, endlessly angsting about his ""cursed"" existance, doing what everyone else wants to, and basically being a carboard cutout used to resolve the plot whenever it rears it\'s ugly head.The love interest Shoko is a walking plot hole because i\'m pretty sure particles beams can\'t be dodged by moving 20 feet forward. It clearly has some form of impact blowing the site away and seemingly destroying the entire area she was in. Then she somehow spontaneously becomes a politcal leader instigating the whole independent high school nation and being the de facto leader of the cast. Her character is strange jarring and makes no sense.L-elf is a giant god mode sue. His crazy almost prophetic predictions run on so many assumptions that SHOULD go wrong but don\'t because he has plot convenience on his side. That and everyone in the show is a brainless idiot who\'s never heard of actual millitary strategy.Rest of the characters arent even worth mentioning because they\'re so bland I can\'t connect names to faces.The Dorssian Empire feels like a cheap ripoff of Season 1 Britannia from code geass, made even less subtle who destroy nations and forcibly deport it\'s citizens because....because.Arus is a spineless nation with a worthless millitary who run away screaming at one Dorssian fleet, despite their previous appearance showing them capable of fighting back. (But of course L-Elf wrecks their army because he can see the goddamned future)Some people may think it\'s worth a watch for the camp value, I say it\'s boring, forgettable and the only good things about it are the Valvrave designs, which are admittedly interesting and the opening (collab. of Nana Mizuki and TM revolution? yes please). The series fails to deliver what is expected of it\'s premise, and the rather interesting plot ideas are bogged down by vapid idiot main characters, and sudden random mood whiplash that\'ll leave your brain sore after watching. on TVtropes I just thought ""well from the tropes described it seems like a campy super robot ride so I thought okay i\'ll turn my brain off and just let the show take me for a ride. But then when I started watching we got things like tactical espionage, a neutral nation being suddenly attacks people dying and it was starting to look like the opening to a gundam show.

Should I start with how the pacing of this show is as consistent as a drunk driver? The shallow characters? The terribly executed plot twists? The pointless shock value? The stereotypical meccha fights? Does it even matter where I start? It IS Valvrave that I’m reviewing.So how about we start off with talking about the dialogue? Normally I don’t focus too much on the dialogue unless it stands out as being really good or just really bad and Valvrave, you guessed it, falls in the latter. The dialogue was honestly the first thing I noticed when I started this...show because of just how generically delivered it was. Sometimes the dialogue was trying to way hard to be inspirational and it made for a lot of cringe-worthy moments.  But then again, I actually laughed at how outlandish the dialogue could be some time so I will cut the dialogue some slack as the writers probably did try to make it as stupid and inexplicable as possible.Now as for the characters actually delivering the bad/good dialogue, I wouldn’t categorize the cast as dull, but they’re far from compelling. Our male lead, Haruto, is definitely the worst characterized out of the bunch. He goes from being your incredibly typical meccha lead, to suddenly becoming Liam Neeson (except not as well-acted or energetic) then back to the boring typical male lead… but this time as a vampire. In a nutshell, Haruto is one bland inconsistent character. Even when he’s angry, he’s boring to watch and there’s really no passion put into him.It’s rest of the cast that’s a bit more interesting. As characters, they’re shallow and nothing we’ve seen before; I could have cared less for them. It’s really the outlandish antics that made them entertaining throughout, especially Saki.Now while I’ve criticized the dialogue and the characters, neither of those elements are what really set me off.It’s the plot and what an absolute trainwreck it is.Yeah, I get that the show is suppose to be ridiculous and over the top and I’m glad that the writers recognized that fact. But since does that make it okay for a show to do whatever the Hell it wants? The direction is way too over the place, the pacing is botched, plot twists are poorly executed, and it’s full of stupid plot points that never amount to anything in the end and the sad thing is, Valvrave actually tries to bring some of its themes together. It’s so fundamentally and structurally sloppy that it just becomes an ugly mess.Even with all that said people still try to push the argument that “Yeah, but it’s suppose to be structured that way. That’s what makes Valvrave over the top and fun!”No, no, no.First let me make this clear that Valvrave is not special or unique or groundbreaking. This  “over top” formula has already been done countless times and much, much better in fact. Look at Jojo’s Bizzare Adventure and FLCL. They have compelling characters and though their plot is completely absurd, it’s still well executed. There’s actually thought and great timing put into when plot points and twists are brought up and that’s why those two shows are brilliant and why Valvrave isn’t.Finally, how could I not finish up without talking about the shock value in this show? I already wrote a whole spiel on the sexual assault, but I’m going to briefly go over the matter again. The shock value in Valvrave is just played out for senseless shock value. That’s it. Does it add to the characters or the plot? Nope. Like I said, the shock value is just there for shock and I HATE senseless shock value. It's distasteful.This is suppose to be a stupid over the top show, right? Then why do we have a completely pointless scene of Haruto sexually assaulting Saki? I just don’t understand why Valvrave threw in pointless shock value, oh wait I do… to try and take itself seriously.Why, just why? Did the writers honestly think I was going to take this show SERIOUSLY?! Don’t make me laugh, just stop it.I’m done talking about this show. There are probably a bunch of other flaws about the plot that I didn’t cover, but I think I’ve trashed it enough. I will admit, even with all the hate I’ve given it, that I was mildly entertained by what a train wreck this show was and just how sappy and energetic the show could be at times. The show does pack a punch and at least it knows how to have fun with itself… some of the time…Do I recommend?:  At times, Valvrave mildly entertained  me with it’s absurd antics, but in the end the plot was a complete mess. If you’re looking for some outlandish, over the top entertainment, there are much better shows. I’d suggest FLCL, Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure, Aquarion Evol and even Highschool of the Dead. Though, I suppose if you completely, and I mean completely, turn your brain off, then Valvrave will satisfy your outlandish needs. show because of just how generically delivered it was.

The story was not original , the characters were typical , the MC who cares about everyone and wants to save everyone , the heroine who is a damsel in distress from the start till the end and lets not forget about the bad guys that were taken from pokemon : ' Team Rocket blast of again ' ...Story 6.5As...i said earlier not the most original thing you will ever see , but at the same time not that bad .

I really liked how she was in the beggining of the show though ...Other characters are what i hate the most , Haruto is the biggest wuss you will ever see with some kind of messiah complex , the ' childhood friend ' that has the same complex but she is so useless that makes me want to puke , the self nicknamed ' Thunder ' a loud mouth idiot who is there but didn't do anything just scream his lungs out for nothing and the rest of the cast that is not even worth talking about .Some will wonder why i gave the characters a 7 after i said a lot of ' good things ' about them , even more so because i didn't say  a thing about the Elf guy , well that guy i didn't find him interesting , just useless , he can predict what the enemy will do , so what ? After that he is useless ... Anyway , to why i gave it a 7 is beacause of how Rukino was in the beggining , if she were like that till the end that would've been a lot better , maybe the ending would've been different .Sound 8The OST was nice , better said i liked the OP / ED songs , but the ' in-anime ' music was so-so , not the thing you can call a masterpiece .Animation/Art  9If the story and characters were not that special , here we have a winner .

Don\'t raise your eye. It\'s only teenage wasteland.""-""Baba O\'Riley""The WhoWe have all seen shows that focus on one facet of the human experience; be it fear, hopelessness, sadness, romance, boredom... any one of the myriad of emotions or facts of life that we go through. Appropriately, those shows that have a more singular focus tend to keep one tone. A romance keeps a romantic feel. It\'s situations and the conversations that drive the dialogue are usually romantically flavored. A show about betrayal keeps a darker tone, one where every action and word is drenched with a kind of paranoia and suspicion.However,...most writers realize that human life is not composed of just one emotion or tone. We all experience sadness and betrayal, sure, but we also experience humor and friendship. Thus, most shows, even those with a singular focus, will tend to implement multiple themes and tones along with their main focus. This can both deepen the characters and the overall storyline, as it more accurately portrays the human experience, and allows a contrast between the darkness and the light, the sadness and the joy, the romance and the heartbreak.There is another type of show, however. Shows that don\'t focus on any one facet of life or any one emotion, but rather attempt to show the entirety of human existence. They can\'t be said to be about betrayal, despite having betrayals, or about romance despite having romantic themes. Those stories are about showing all the experiences and emotions that we go through. Some people prefer more singular focus, some people prefer broader strokes; but most people agree that one is not inherently superior to the other. Comedies are not worse for not bringing any sadness or break from the hilarity. And epics are not worse for having both comedy and sadness in one story. They are different, but equal.It would be wrong to say that executing one type correctly is more difficult than executing the other type. To keep a single tonal show from becoming hyper-focused and flat is just as difficult as melding all the elements together into one cohesive story-line. However, one problem that the single-focus shows usually do not run into is that of inconsistent tone. And that, in my opinion, is the biggest flaw of Kakumeiki Valvrave. It suffers from inconsistent tone and thus negatively affects both the immersion of the viewer and the communication of the themes.One driving theme that stands out more than any other in Valverave is that of growing up. This is where the quote that begins my review comes into play. Being a teenager is hard. It is a time where hormones run wild; and serving as the separation between childhood and adulthood, it often breeds a kind of confusion and despair. What is my place in the world? What kind of man or woman will I become? Are the dreams of my younger days consistent with the reality that surrounds me? What are my responsibilities, and what are the consequences of failing to fulfill them? These kinds of questions plague almost every teenager at some point. And they are not bad questions to ask. In fact, asking them is a natural process of learning about ourselves and the questioning itself helps lead us toward satisfactory answers.In some ways, Valverave explores these questions and themes in a mature, solid manner. The characters deal with death, isolation, responsibility, and new-found power and freedom in realistic ways, and their reactions are both informative and entertaining. In other ways, the show seems to be a farce, giving foolish answers and unrealistic portrayals. Things occur which simultaneously contradict each other, not in the manner of continuity, but in the manner of tone and message. An exploration of meeting the basic needs (food, water, shelter, etc.) of ones-self and ones companions without the help of ""adults"" is undertaken, but then the answer is handed to the characters with seemingly no effort or loss on their part. A death occurs which serves as a catalyst for coming together and of recognizing the importance of discipline, but the message is weakened by the fact that no other consequences seem to occur when the characters fail to follow through with their new realizations. Most importantly, in a show with heavy themes of sacrifice, there seems to be little sacrificing occurring other than the obvious: ""Do you resign as a human?"" question which is posed at the beginning of the show by the Valverave\'s.This causes a break in both realism and tone. When I am despairing of how the teenagers will survive without money or industry, the problem is solved almost as simply as with a push of a button. When I wonder if a lack of discipline and authority will bring assaults or chaos, the resulting assaults and chaos are so weak and short as to have no real affect as plot-devices. Most surprisingly is one scene where an extraordinary act of sexual violence occurs, only to be glossed over as something that just happened. No consequences or hidden triggers are released or unveiled. The complete ease with which one main character predicts his enemies movements and plans is reflected by the complete ease with which the cast as a whole is able to survive, seemingly with no thought given to how they are surviving. Challenges that appear are neatly wrapped up with little to no lasting effect other than a lesson learned. Failures result in momentary set-backs, only to unleash a new and unforeseen power which reverses the set-back so that the failure has no consequence, but rather could be seen as a kind of success of it\'s own. It is fine to have such events, if they are done correctly. Characters should learn from their mistakes, they should overcome challenges. But they should also be scarred. When a character experiences no pain or loss from challenges or failures, the challenges begin to lose any emotional weight, and the character loses emotional depth.This is not to say that the show is all bad. In fact, some parts are very well done. The aforementioned scene of sexual violence is very interestingly juxtaposed with a speech about fulfilling selfish desires, a speech that gains high approval among it\'s listeners. A scene where one character must watch the death of a very close family member is juxtaposed with joyous cheering from other characters over a victory achieved. These are examples of using inconsistent tone correctly. Where the existence of unrestrained joy in one area only heightens the anguish in another, or when the contrast between openly cheering the irresponsible fulfillment of selfish desires serves to heighten the horror of the form mindless self-fulfillment can sometimes take. These examples are moments of surprising flavor in an otherwise bland story. They are the exception, not the rule. If the show could keep the quality it expresses in those moments than it would certainly be a success, if a flawed one. But the quality is not kept, and those successes serve only to highlight the magnitude of the failures, rather than the other way around. Our characters become less than they should be and our story is neutered by the ease with which some essential challenges are overcome, and the lack of consequences to essential failures.It is hard to determine exactly how to rate this show. Do the redeeming qualities outweigh the failures? Are the failures so overpowering that they lessen the value of those moments of brilliance? I can\'t tell whether the show is, at it\'s heart, bad or good. The execution is certainly flawed, but at the core the story has potential. Part of the problem with the show is how difficult it is for the viewer to pin down it\'s intentions. Is it simple teenage escapism? Is it a kind of self-aware parody? Is it an earnest attempt to portray the reality of growing up? If I could answer these questions, I feel like I would be much more comfortable in making a complete determination about the show\'s quality. Maybe I just haven\'t watched carefully enough. Perhaps I\'ve missed some essential theme, and it is my own failing that I am incapable of appreciating the show. However, it is my opinion that any medium involving story-telling is primarily an art of communication. I hold, perhaps incorrectly, that it is not my failure of understanding, but theirs of being incoherent. If their goal was to tell us about ""teenage wasteland"" than they failed to do so in any meaningful way. They would have been better served just throwing in Who\'s Next and listening to Baba O\'Riley.Story: 4/10Art: 9/10Sound: 8/10Character: 3/10Enjoyment: 4/10Overall: 4/10 most writers realize that human life is not composed of just one emotion or tone. We all experience sadness and betrayal, sure, but we also experience humor and friendship. Thus, most shows, even those with a singular focus, will tend to implement multiple themes and tones along with their main focus. This can both deepen the characters and the overall storyline, as it more accurately portrays the human experience, and allows a contrast between the darkness and the light, the sadness and the joy, the romance and the heartbreak.There is another type of show, however. Shows that don\'t focus on any one facet of life or any one emotion, but rather attempt to show the entirety of human existence. They can\'t be said to be about betrayal, despite having betrayals, or about romance despite having romantic themes. Those stories are about showing all the experiences and emotions that we go through. Some people prefer more singular focus, some people prefer broader strokes; but most people agree that one is not inherently superior to the other. Comedies are not worse for not bringing any sadness or break from the hilarity. And epics are not worse for having both comedy and sadness in one story. They are different, but equal.It would be wrong to say that executing one type correctly is more difficult than executing the other type. To keep a single tonal show from becoming hyper-focused and flat is just as difficult as melding all the elements together into one cohesive story-line. However, one problem that the single-focus shows usually do not run into is that of inconsistent tone. And that, in my opinion, is the biggest flaw of Kakumeiki Valvrave. It suffers from inconsistent tone and thus negatively affects both the immersion of the viewer and the communication of the themes.One driving theme that stands out more than any other in Valverave is that of growing up. This is where the quote that begins my review comes into play. Being a teenager is hard. It is a time where hormones run wild; and serving as the separation between childhood and adulthood, it often breeds a kind of confusion and despair. What is my place in the world? What kind of man or woman will I become? Are the dreams of my younger days consistent with the reality that surrounds me?

Great characters, story, action, drama..everything! Not to mention a Killer soundtrack! The only thing that might be frustrating and probably why it got the rating it had, was because the anime episodes ran in a pattern of ""sequel, prequel, sequel""( if that makes sense, it\'s kinda like Lord of rings, Hobbit, Lord of rings) for each episode. Which you really had to pay attention and use your brain to catch on. I actually would have classified the anime as mystery as well because of...the pattern. I highly recommend it if you like that sort of stuff where you have to figure things out, or just in general. The story kept building/stacking as well making it climax every episode which I really enjoyed!-The only thing I didn\'t like though if, I had to say that some may not like, was it\'s sexual situations(typical anime women stuff). It was kinda out of place for that anime lol. Other than that it was great!I hope there\'s a season 3 or OVA! I\'m definitely voting for it lol oh and I hope Shoko Gets stabbed so many times she never comes back to life (excuse my language, but watch anime to understand)!

However the treatment of...my favourite Saki was too harsh and we come to the famous scene in episode 10. A plot twist that was not needed and just seemed to be a cry for attention which is why my rating for both story and character dropped to a 7 and 6 respectively especially due to the lack of respect the main character, Haruto, shows to Saki after the act.I will simply continue to watch this anime in hopes the second season find the pacing the anime had at the beginning and does not involve any more of these creepy plot twists, or at least to some extent a reasonable plot twist like the one in episode 12 brought us. My enjoyment may have been slightly spoiled but this anime should be given a fair chance even though a lot of patience may be required while wathing it. my favourite Saki was too harsh and we come to the famous scene in episode 10.

The genres presented by MAL aren\'t accurate. They forgot to add Military, Romance, School, Slice-of-Life, Vampires. And possibly all of this jumbled up in its midst makes it a parody too. I did find it hilarious, myself. I mean, space, military, vampire, slice-of-life? Gotta love that.First I\'ll start because I wanna...get to the good stuff faster by saying that the art and sound of the anime is nothing impressive in of itself, it\'s completely generic. The soundtrack is nothing which I\'d listen to outside of the anime, so it probably wouldn\'t bother you or impress you.Let me tell you what the good stuff is. The good stuff is how hilariously bad the anime was so far. No, no, wait, I mean. It\'s so bad, it\'s actually entertaining. Like, with a couple more self referencing jokes added to it, it could\'ve been a bitching parody. Now let me tell you about the story.So you have this country that is attacked by another country because, well, they have no army. Now, call me stupid, but isn\'t the whole reason we, humans, stopped warring each other, is because we have mass destructive weapons that could wipe as out and we have devastating tragedies due to shit like this? Shouldn\'t Japan out of everyone on the planet know the consequences of that? Like, it\'s not peace everywhere because we grew into being peaceful and loving and we did it for the sake of love and peace. We did it to protect our fucking selves. So, this country in space, we should believe, that there can be a country so incompetent that they won\'t even build themselves some army or any sort of defense? Yes, because they are incredibly incompetent. I\'ll get on that later.So what\'s the first thing you think of when you see the tags, action, mecha, space? Is it a school slice-of-life setting? Yeah, me too. So the story follows the life of a school student Horuto which I have to mention because the character is absolutely appaling. I\'m gonna give some details about his arc a bit further than the synopsis, so spoiler alert, but they won\'t ruin the story for you, at least I don\'t see how, so if you wanna avoid them, continue reading after I finish this paragraph and write SPOILERS OVER. Horuto is basically a shy high school pussy whipped kid who, listen to this, finally decided to tell his love interest, which is pretty much another clutzy sorta tomboyish tropy girl, that he\'s been in love with her. He almost tells her but everything changed when the Space Nazi attacked. (I forgot the name of the nation and I\'m gonna call them that because their salute is Blitzendegen and they love war) Then Horuto was interrupted and then Girl dies. Horuto sees a giant fucking mech. Horuto goes inside giant mech who has him give up his humanity and then starts killing Space Nazis. The people of his country go nuts on Spacebook. Then he gets out of his mech and is killed by a character called Rrgh-Rrghffffu. BUT NO WAIT PLOT TWIST HE BECOMES A BODY SWITCHING VAMPIRE AND THEN STEALS RRGH-RRGHFFFFU\'s BODY NO WAY! (His name is L-Elf, sometimes the characters rush its spelling and that\'s how it ends up sounding) More things happen, he gets his body back. He finds out that Girl is still alive. He meets with Girl again. He\'s been through a war where he could\'ve lost his life, he thought he lost her, he\'s probably filled with hormones and adrenaline due to being through a life threatening situation and going through a rollercoaster of emotions. Now\'s the chance, he asked to continue THAT discussion with her. THEN HE DOESN\'T DO IT. Then cries. 10/10 character. Then also he comments on Spacebook that he\'s safe and the spacenews channel is like ""BREAKING NEWS, THIS JUST IN, THE HIGH SCHOOL BOY COMMENTED ON SPACE BOOK"".  And I\'m not exaggerating, that is literally what happens.SPOILERS OVERSo to sum up everything I said in a non-spoilery way, the story goes in a bunch of ridiculously bad turns, but still somehow remains impressive due to how actually ridiculously and silly it ends up due to it. The characters are completely illogical, the story\'s logic is also illogical. As an example, there will be characters who get harmed badly by someone, they fucking go ape shit hating them for that, then out of fucking nowhere they will be like. ""ugh, I\'m sure they had a good reason. They\'re a decent person."" Or there will be security unable to stop a guy while he\'s freefalling, somehow, space buildings can\'t have automated weapons or anything like that because reasons. Like, you don\'t have an army, you could at least have some automated security in your goddamned buildings. I could go all day with stuff like this, but I really don\'t want to spoil the anime for you.So the only people I could actually suggest this series too, is someone looking for some series that takes itself somewhat seriously but ends up as incredibly ridiculous, this is what you want. This would be exactly what you want. The reason I dropped it is because I got bored, I didn\'t see how this could improve, but maybe someday I\'ll continue this if I\'ll have someone to watch this with so we would experience this ridiculousness together. Watch it with a friend (Read my edit), it could end up as a good time. But watch it fully knowing that the series will make no sense, most of it will be illogical, none of the characters will actually be appealing and it just will feel as a ""cash money cash dolla\' dolla\' look at this pile of money we threw in this anime ain\'t it beautiful this is what you wanted right, IS IT?"" and everything will be ridiculous. If you take this anime seriously, you will fail to enjoy it, so just kick back and prepare for laughter. I\'m kinda dissapointed it wasn\'t satirical, because if it would\'ve been, it would\'ve been really good.Slight edit: I\'ve watched more of this series and I don\'t have a lot to add. The series will have an episode in which it will become a musical. It seems to be getting worse. Pretty much everything I\'ve said stays unchanged, but things seem to be getting progressively worse. I don\'t plan to continue it and at the time I first wrote this I expected this to be good for a laugh due to how bad it is, but it actually becomes annoyingly bad after a while. I pretty much got forced by a friend to watch it because I forced them to watch it too. Then I couldn\'t handle it anymore. I can\'t detail exactly what happens that makes what\'s bad even worse, but I\'ll give you a hint which is ""school."" If you think that the school setting for this is already bad, it gets worse. Trust me. If you can\'t handle worse than what\'s in the first 3 episodes, then you can\'t handle this at all. So after you watch the first 3 episodes and you still dislike it, you should abandon ship right then and there. get to the good stuff faster by saying that the art and sound of the anime is nothing impressive in of itself, it\'s completely generic. The soundtrack is nothing which I\'d listen to outside of the anime, so it probably wouldn\'t bother you or impress you.Let me tell you what the good stuff is. The good stuff is how hilariously bad the anime was so far. No, no, wait, I mean. It\'s so bad, it\'s actually entertaining. Like, with a couple more self referencing jokes added to it, it could\'ve been a bitching parody. Now let me tell you about the story.So you have this country that is attacked by another country because, well, they have no army. Now, call me stupid, but isn\'t the whole reason we, humans, stopped warring each other, is because we have mass destructive weapons that could wipe as out and we have devastating tragedies due to shit like this? Shouldn\'t Japan out of everyone on the planet know the consequences of that? Like, it\'s not peace everywhere because we grew into being peaceful and loving and we did it for the sake of love and peace. We did it to protect our fucking selves. So, this country in space, we should believe, that there can be a country so incompetent that they won\'t even build themselves some army or any sort of defense? Yes, because they are incredibly incompetent. I\'ll get on that later.So what\'s the first thing you think of when you see the tags, action, mecha, space? Is it a school slice-of-life setting? Yeah, me too. So the story follows the life of a school student Horuto which I have to mention because the character is absolutely appaling. I\'m gonna give some details about his arc a bit further than the synopsis, so spoiler alert, but they won\'t ruin the story for you, at least I don\'t see how, so if you wanna avoid them, continue reading after I finish this paragraph and write SPOILERS OVER. Horuto is basically a shy high school pussy whipped kid who, listen to this, finally decided to tell his love interest, which is pretty much another clutzy sorta tomboyish tropy girl, that he\'s been in love with her. He almost tells her but everything changed when the Space Nazi attacked. (I forgot the name of the nation and I\'m gonna call them that because their salute is Blitzendegen and they love war) Then Horuto was interrupted and then Girl dies. Horuto sees a giant fucking mech. Horuto goes inside giant mech who has him give up his humanity and then starts killing Space Nazis. The people of his country go nuts on Spacebook. Then he gets out of his mech and is killed by a character called Rrgh-Rrghffffu. BUT NO WAIT PLOT TWIST HE BECOMES A BODY SWITCHING VAMPIRE AND THEN STEALS RRGH-RRGHFFFFU\'s BODY NO WAY! (His name is L-Elf, sometimes the characters rush its spelling and that\'s how it ends up sounding) More things happen, he gets his body back. He finds out that Girl is still alive. He meets with Girl again. He\'s been through a war where he could\'ve lost his life, he thought he lost her, he\'s probably filled with hormones and adrenaline due to being through a life threatening situation and going through a rollercoaster of emotions. Now\'s the chance, he asked to continue THAT discussion with her. THEN HE DOESN\'T DO IT. Then cries. 10/10 character. Then also he comments on Spacebook that he\'s safe and the spacenews channel is like ""BREAKING NEWS, THIS JUST IN, THE HIGH SCHOOL BOY COMMENTED ON SPACE BOOK"".  And I\'m not exaggerating, that is literally what happens.SPOILERS OVERSo to sum up everything I said in a non-spoilery way, the story goes in a bunch of ridiculously bad turns, but still somehow remains impressive due to how actually ridiculously and silly it ends up due to it. The characters are completely illogical, the story\'s logic is also illogical. As an example, there will be characters who get harmed badly by someone, they fucking go ape shit hating them for that, then out of fucking nowhere they will be like. ""ugh, I\'m sure they had a good reason. They\'re a decent person."" Or there will be security unable to stop a guy while he\'s freefalling, somehow, space buildings can\'t have automated weapons or anything like that because reasons. Like, you don\'t have an army, you could at least have some automated security in your goddamned buildings. I could go all day with stuff like this, but I really don\'t want to spoil the anime for you.So the only people I could actually suggest this series too, is someone looking for some series that takes itself somewhat seriously but ends up as incredibly ridiculous, this is what you want. This would be exactly what you want. The reason I dropped it is because I got bored, I didn\'t see how this could improve, but maybe someday I\'ll continue this if I\'ll have someone to watch this with so we would experience this ridiculousness together. Watch it with a friend (Read my edit), it could end up as a good time. But watch it fully knowing that the series will make no sense, most of it will be illogical, none of the characters will actually be appealing and it just will feel as a ""cash money cash dolla\' dolla\' look at this pile of money we threw in this anime ain\'t it beautiful this is what you wanted right, IS IT?"" and everything will be ridiculous. If you take this anime seriously, you will fail to enjoy it, so just kick back and prepare for laughter. I\'m kinda dissapointed it wasn\'t satirical, because if it would\'ve been, it would\'ve been really good.Slight edit: I\'ve watched more of this series and I don\'t have a lot to add. The series will have an episode in which it will become a musical. It seems to be getting worse. Pretty much everything I\'ve said stays unchanged, but things seem to be getting progressively worse. I don\'t plan to continue it and at the time I first wrote this I expected this to be good for a laugh due to how bad it is, but it actually becomes annoyingly bad after a while. I pretty much got forced by a friend to watch it because I forced them to watch it too. Then I couldn\'t handle it anymore. I can\'t detail exactly what happens that makes what\'s bad even worse, but I\'ll give you a hint which is ""school."" If you think that the school setting for this is already bad, it gets worse. Trust me. If you can\'t handle worse than what\'s in the first 3 episodes, then you can\'t handle this at all. So after you watch the first 3 episodes and you still dislike it, you should abandon ship right then and there.', 'Reposting because I remembered that I once wrote a Valvrave review that was deleted for no reason.Alright people, I\'ve completed my viewing of the Spring \'13 Mecha Trifecta. This trifecta is made up of Valvrave the Liberator, Majestic Prince and Gargantia. It\'s been over a year since I\'ve found anything watchable, so I have high hopes.The other two are great. Will they remain great? Who knows, but I can assure you that this show is awful and only makes the other two look much better by comparison, and it will stay that way.Valvrave is a mecha anime that follows the formula in all...the laziest ways possible, and is bogged down with Sunrise\'s astounding incompetence. You can pretty much use shows like this and Sacred Seven next to things like 08th MS Team and Scryed and say with a definite that this studio has no goddamn clue what they\'re doing anymore.The show is about a teenage betamale who gets caught up in a war between space factions on his little neutral colony. He goes to school, has a crush on some genki girl, and is generally as uninteresting aesthetically and personality-wise as every peripheral character around him. When some albino walks up to him out of nowhere and calls him out on this, he later decides to jump in a big, ugly robot and resign his humanity to blow some shit up. And then he\'s a vampire, I guess.Valvrave has ""please let me be mass market"" all over it. Everyone is moe as fuck, the robots are over-designed, and it\'s following in the footsteps of shows like Geass and Guilty Crown by taking something that\'s been done dozens of times, and then making the main character a macguffin-powered wizard/vampire/molester. This dark twist that risks this two-dimensional goon\'s humanity will undoubtedly lead simpletons to think his character is deep, but I can only hope that after Guilty Crown people are getting sick of this garbage.The other characters range between a large spectrum of tropes that we\'ve all seen before. Jock guy, otaku girl, energetic moron girl, group of psychotic, two-dimensional villainous teens, girl whose entire character is defined by her gigantic breasts, et cetera. None of them are introduced or delivered well. No one in this show acts like a normal human being, but are rather just ""anime characters"". They don\'t have any original or interesting quirks, either. Everyone\'s played pretty straight, and it\'s really easy to tell by the quality of writing this early that none of this will get better. So yes, if you like your anime with characters you don\'t have to think at all about or relate to, and just want a bunch of colorful 2-D cutouts spouting recycled lines and exceptionally dumb bullshit at each other, this is the show for you. If you like your anime casts completely identical to one another, this is the show for you. If your definition of good character interaction is making noises and spouting childish philosophies at each other within 10 seconds of meeting, this is the show for you. Otherwise, watch MJP or Gargantia.The directing, cinematography and animation in Valvrave are all incredibly ""meh"". There are tiny bits of good animation in completely inconsequential parts, like the hot dog eating contest at the very beginning, and the CGI moves around pretty okay, but the laser and explosion effects look terrible and there\'s a lot of ""still thing panning on a flat background"". There aren\'t any good or visually memorable shots in the whole affair, either, so it\'s not like the laziness can be forgiven like in Eva. Valvrave as a whole is just not really anything to look at.The music sucks. There\'s generic opera-ish stuff while the main character is blowing things up at the end of episode 1, and I can\'t even remember any other tracks being present. I hate the OP, because it\'s just TM Revolution but worse. The opening animation is just as boring and lazy as the rest of the show, too.I think that just about covers it. I\'m not being presumptuous at all, because with the studio\'s recent track record and how everything was displayed in the first episode, it\'s not going to get any better. There\'s a very high chance it\'ll get hilariously stupid and entertaining in an ironic way, but if you\'re looking for any kind of legitimate quality in your show, skip this. Skip it, and go right into Majestic Prince. That show fucking rocks. the laziest ways possible, and is bogged down with Sunrise\'s astounding incompetence.

There are scenes that will make you feel uncomfortable, but I think that adds excitement to the series. At every single episode, something will happen you don\'t expect. I\'ve tried to predict what will happen in episodes, but they always turn it around and around.The story in this anime is amazing, dramatic, and will surely rile you up.Art 9/10:The art is very bright and sharp in this anime. The valvraves are outlined with bright lights and the lasers are a splurge of neon colors. There are even almost-rainbow mechs.The mechs aren\'t my favorite designs from what I\'ve seen of the other Bandai series, but they are still powerful and sleek.The art is very fun to look at. Space is more of a dark blue rather than black in here and the stars and galaxies in the background make such an impact on the setting. The mechas stand out against space and everything adds drama and bolder effects to the screen.Sound 9/10:Nana Mizuki and T.M. Revolution in one song. How much better could it get?This anime plays music at perfect times and does and phenomenal job at changing the mood quickly and drastically.You will get chills, you\'ll scream, maybe even cry.The music will even change the mood after someone has died. I thought I\'d be devastated for the rest of an episode after someone died, but the music changed my mood so much , I didn\'t continuing mourning until after the episode.Character 10/10:You will have a character you love. There are so many different types of personalities in this anime and they work so well with each other.You have your heroes, meganes, shotas, crazies, jocks, introverts, idols, ideal boyfriends and girlfriends, schemers, and so much more.Even if you may not like a character, if something happens to them you\'ll probably be screaming from joy or grief. You\'ll be shipping pairs you didn\'t think you\'d be shipping.Enjoyment 10/10:As seen above, I fully enjoy this anime.I thought an episode was boring...but then I got to the last 2 minutes and I was raving so much. Everything just changes so quickly!I have never been so excited for an episode of an anime to be released until this anime. Be prepared to yell over cliff hangers every episode and have raging thoughts while watching.Overall 10/10:This anime moves quickly and has controversial scenes. The art and sound are fantastic, and every character will be dear to you. I could re-watch this over and over again and not be bored.Everything is just mixed in so well - You can see the Code Geass and the Gundam in here, but at the same time you can\'t.You will never be bored and you will not be able to predict anything.This is the anime Bandai said was going to be over the top.Bandai went more than over the top, they went above and beyond. watch thisThe rating is NC-17+ rightly so.

I rewatched it recently with some friends and it was an absolute blast.The plot is utterly nonsensical.  There are multiple seasons worth of plot points and content, the most ridiculous is the first episode feeling like an entire season of a regular anime condensed down.  While it\'s going through the plot like a fire through a sawmill it\'s missing significant amounts of character arcs and development.  Except, the show acts as if these arcs and development happened so you get baffling changes and laughable emotional beats.  Most egregiously a character dies...and the show nothing short of milks it for all it\'s worth, this character that died couldn\'t have had more than 25 lines of dialogue at this point and there is an actual ""press F to pay respects"" equivalent.  Animation budget is saved by having characters just float around because ""zero gravity"" yet gravity mysteriously functions normally when needed, the actual art is pretty good though.  Valvrave also is utterly tone deaf and seems to change it\'s genre at a flick of a switch.  Slice of life, Mecha, Psychological, Thriller, Supernatural, Rom Com, even a little harem baiting.  This train-wreck\'s got it all!Speaking of harem baiting, I am shocked this show didn\'t stoop to being a harem.  Any such points are contrasted with some of the ""antics"" Saki gets up to in the middle of the season.  Then a certain scene near the end of the show that happens during a speech blows any points gained straight to the bottom of the sea, but hey at least it ain\'t a harem.Valvrave has a single genuinely interesting character; Akira.  She has a noticeable character arc that ended with her having a crisis of faith.  This was the only time I was engaged with the show as anything more than trash.  L-Elf is some Light ripoff that is a literal prophet, Haruto is boring and can\'t decide on what his character is supposed to be, Saki is kind of an absolute bitch that keeps pulling ""just kidding""s everytime she almost has a character moment, and Shouko really doesn\'t have a character to even comment on as much as a collection of traits to groan at.The plot is light speed and nonsensical, most of the characters are at best boring, there\'s a bunch of cringe, and the show is tone deaf and tasteless if not legitimately offensive.  Still was an absolute joy to watch with a couple of friends.  I initially watched this as it aired and apparently rated it at an 8.  I have no clue why but I can at least see a slew of interesting ideas in this garbage pile, far FAR more than you\'d get in other bad shows.  Solid 3/10 for an actual anime, 9/10 if you\'re looking for bad anime.Oh and the show has some pretty significant yaoi baiting and some yuri baiting for... some reason. and the show nothing short of milks it for all it\'s worth, this character that died couldn\'t have had more than 25 lines of dialogue at this point and there is an actual ""press F to pay respects"" equivalent.

', ""Alright, so this will be my first review, so bear with me, if you would.It is very likely that you've seen the other reviews on this particular anime, and how they might mention that the show is 'so bad it is good'. I would like to confirm this statement. The show is literally potato, and had I attempted to watch this and take it seriously, I'd have dropped it right off the bat.Lets start with the plot. The very shorted summary of the plot is that people developed a way to live in space and now a majority of the human population lives...in cities built in space. There are two major factions, and one smaller one that is neutral. Suddenly, neutral-kun is attacked! Now, our MC-kun happened to be living his typical anime protag life inside neutral-kun's territory, so he gets involved.Now, this may seem like your average plot, but it's only after MC-kun signs away his humanity and obliterates a handful of canon-fodder that things get interesting. And when I say interesting, I mean that INTERESTING.Like, forming your own nation out of a space city by literally tearing it from the rest of the space station interesting.Like, becoming a space vampire interesting.Like, space Lelouch interesting.Like, Mecha space rape vampires interesting.Like, Mecha space rape vampires with Lelouch interesting.And that's not all, folks. You even get to watch as the antagonistic larger nation can't figure out how to beat one student with a mech that overheats and eats memories. (Granted, he gets allies later).If you like great art style, consensual space vampire rape, and a really really spineless MC-kun who doesn't get much better even into the second season, well, here's the perfect anime for you! But, you know, if you want a story that makes sense and characters you'll remember for good reasons, I'd honestly suggest you watch something else. in cities built in space.

There is a lot of good uses of tropes, and it makes great use of high-quality animations.The fights are really great and so is how the students try to manage themselves (very interesting and kind of hilarious) but it falls short in delivering elements that can stand alone as great parts of the anime. It all works together well but it doesn't have any exceptional parts.If you like fights against authority or powers, this is for you. A love or tolerance of mechs...is also required if you hope to enjoy this. is also required if you hope to enjoy this."", 'My overall experience with the series was a five. Kakumeiki Valvrave was an actually interesting show and a unique difference from the mecha series with only the vampire like mecha with runes to generate on from the humans. My personal opinion about the series that it could\'ve added more flavor but, there was plenty of subjects and non-developed character associations that didn\'t went as planned for the series.I\'ve really enjoyed the entire sound-track that matched each scene that gave me the emotions for each episode. I love the fact that every ending starts off with a beautiful angelic song that sounds so good. My...only problem with them were the signalling at the end of the episode but the dramatic entry did it so well. The sound effects were a problem because of it\'s high frequencies but, they sounded okay but were merely over used in the entire series. Most of the sound-track was overly used and repetitive depending on the emotion per scene. You will be hearing them frequently a lot and it will get irritated quickly.I didn\'t partially liked the scenery choose and the characters development. Each character had a specific avenge plot to characterize who they are as a character but, most didn\'t really got the completion of their avenge and it went to destruction near the finale end of the entire series. I wish there was more for the ""One Hundred and One guild"" but, they\'re wasn\'t and so for the Dorrissian. They\'re wasn\'t enough memories or messages put for the main characters like H-Huen or Q-Vier. The term, ""Blitzendegen"" appears a lot after their salute to their superiors and the term doesn\'t make sense. I\'m very fond by the mass use of the ""Adults hatred"" from the children in the first season that wasn\'t placed properly in the second season. I thought there was going to be a running gag along with that to prove a point. For the beginning of the series, the just spend their time in high-school like any other ordinary Japanese\' animation. There could\'ve been more on the JIOR scientist and why they created the mecha\'s that fused with the OS. That could\'ve brought some attention to the series. Even though it\'s a dramatic starting point but, still bring some missing clarity to the series. I really did like Haruto\'s growth of a character but some character\'s death in the series are promising but never outstanding. The other is the runes and how their memory is fading while they\'re not following any instructions or understanding who the OS truly is. They\'re really power creatures but I know the scientists just want weaponized creatures to control the mecha in large amount of energy but, how did they actually aligned in the first place?! Was that they\'re secret of having a neutrality between humans but why did they wanted to fight in a war again to get out of associating with the humans? Was it actually the Magius fault for connecting with the human\'s in the first place to blame it on others. Was Haruto\'s character really displaying how the Magius was acting and the ""A Hundred and One guild"" was behaving? Why didn\'t they captured the Valvraves which they knew about them to explain the situation more carefully? I love the series so much when it comes to viewing the world and the term ""Unveiling to the world"" that\'s the best conclusion for the series. ""Avenging, Unveiling, Promising, Protecting"" were a few main words that the series wanted the audience to know. I cried at many deaths but besides (Liesettotes/Marie) they weren\'t that interesting. only problem with them were the signalling at the end of the episode but the dramatic entry did it so well. The sound effects were a problem because of it\'s high frequencies but, they sounded okay but were merely over used in the entire series. Most of the sound-track was overly used and repetitive depending on the emotion per scene. You will be hearing them frequently a lot and it will get irritated quickly.I didn\'t partially liked the scenery choose and the characters development. Each character had a specific avenge plot to characterize who they are as a character but, most didn\'t really got the completion of their avenge and it went to destruction near the finale end of the entire series. I wish there was more for the ""One Hundred and One guild"" but, they\'re wasn\'t and so for the Dorrissian. They\'re wasn\'t enough memories or messages put for the main characters like H-Huen or Q-Vier. The term, ""Blitzendegen"" appears a lot after their salute to their superiors and the term doesn\'t make sense.

Or at least what I imagine went on in those studios.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Producer: Okay, we need to make a new mecha anime that is not a Gundam or Code Geass spin-off. It must become the new big thing, so we must attract as many people as we can. What do those pesky teenagers like nowadays?- Writer: Hmm, didn\'t those vampire Hollywood movies make a lot of money? Vampires are...definitely trendy right now, we need one of those. But not one of those old, scary vampires mind you, but a sparkly, gay one. And lets have the vampire pilot the mecha, why not?- Producer: Sold! Any other pitches?- Writer: Girls! We need to introduce a bunch of girls who like our main character. We need several types of those: one has to be caring and lovable, another has to be strong and determined. We need to make those otaku waifufags happy. Oh, and one of them has to be an idol too. So, there\'s a harem of girls who all fantasize about our vampire. Also, everything needs to happen in a school. Kids love school. Let\'s have the characters declare their school and independent country and start a war or some shit! Kids will love it!- Producer: Yes, yes, I can see this becoming very popular definitely. I would definitely invest in this project. What about villains though? Who should these vampires fight?- Writer: NAZIS!- Producer: Nazis?- Writer: Yes, Nazis. Space Nazis. People love to hate Nazis. It\'s impossible to make a military anime unless one of the factions is Germanic. But that\'s not all. We also need a Char Aznable-like character with a hidden agenda who can think 10 episodes ahead. People definitely love this type of characters, I\'m sure of it.- Producer: Great job! Now please write a detailed script of each episode so we can start production immediately.- Write: Nah, it\'s okay, we can start right now. We can make shit up as we go along with each episode.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------And that\'s it. I can\'t understand how a bunch of people got together and decided to make Kakumeiki Valvrave. It is a trainwreck of bad writing and bad ideas that actually got worse and worse as it went on. At first I started watching this because I hoped it would become some kind of ""so bad that it\'s good"" anime, but the bad writing became cringeworthy. It\'s as if the writers decided to take every possible cliché from every popular anime and mix them together to create this. Valvrave has every possible genre in it: it\'s a space harem vampire mecha war anime set in a school, with tints of horror and mystery every here and there. The only thing that saves this anime from being a 1/10 is the decent animation, since some studio heads decided to splash their budgets on this polished piece of turd. I can\'t wait for the inevitable fidget spinner mecha anime that Sunrise will probably decide to make a couple of years from now. definitely trendy right now, we need one of those.

I wasn't surprised but I was hoping for some character improvement. Long story short: I didn't get what I wanted. Most characters are flat and when they start killing some people off, the music and everything makes you want to feel sad but in reality, you're left trying to remember who that character even was.

Valvrave is an expy of Gundam Seed in which the main premise revolves around a cast of teenage characters from a neutral state who are suddenly invaded due to being engulfed in an ongoing conflict between two...far larger nations,  both occuring during the year 71 of a newly-formed futuristic calendar. Valvrave is an idol show which provides commentary on the toxic dependency an idol can have on their fanbase if they define their identity solely by social media reception rather than interpersonal relationships. Valvrave is a story of a group of teenage highschool students\' attempts to form an independent state government from adults, in which the central running points of the head campaignwoman is to hold a student festival during wartime. Valvrave is a Christmas commercial. Valvrave is a show in which a politician calls himself Moses before he decides to gun down a sea of students and thus part them in a red sea - yet fails to kill any single one of them despite unloading the magazine of an entire automatic. Valvrave is a show which features an extremely disparate duo of central male main characters, balancing a fairly archetypically generic, yuuji everylead protagonist and a deurotagonist who\'s essentially Lelouch vi Britannia mixed with Suzaku Kururugi.But more than all of these things - or perhaps one might argue, *because* of these things, Valvrave is most of all a show that\'s fucking awesome. Valvrave does not care for logic. Valvrave does not care for narrative consistency. Valvrave does not care (almost) period. In every episode, particularly in this first season that\'s being reviewed, there will be some narrative spin or twist that either completely upends the throughline of the story, is wholly irrelevant and a full detractor of time, often more than not both occurring at several intervals across a 21-minute timespan (openings and endings not included), and yet will be fully entertaining regardless. Yet despite all the bullshit that compromises Valvrave\'s narrative, it should be noted that not all of it is simply made to baffle the viewer. Behind the ludicrous and often-times contrived and illogical storybeats and developments, there is a strong thematic and character core to the story. It is true that characters will often engage in ridiculous behaviour that could only ever be reasoned from a meta perspective to be intended to push forth the narrative, but it is simultaneously true that there is a genuinely compelling cast behind this which have admittedly one-note traits, but are fun to follow regardless of this (again, arguably because of this?). L-Elf, the aforementioned Lelouch-Suzaku brain-cum-brawn child is the most evident and emblematic of this, but even the relatively archetypical characters who never get much nuance, like Yamada ""NOBU THUNDA"" Raizou and A-drei ""ERUERUFU"" Kirschbaum work well in coordination with the situations and environments they are given. This holds especially true as the second season begins, bodies begin dropping, and there is an actual emotional weight to deaths which occur (I sobbed a little for the last one, rip my [indiscriminate non-spoiling pronoun]), although admittedly the latter cour faces its own slew of problems with compressed storybeats and a rushed finale.Overall, Valvrave is a hell of a show. Its main appeal is obviously the plain ludicrousness that is its storyline and the contrived developments which occur to make it happen (or in many cases, for it not to happen), but even underneath that there is a genuinely gripping, if often \'forced,\' from a logical sense, emotional core and narrative that make for a strong show.My ultimate conclusion?

Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records,https://myanimelist.net/anime/32951/Rokudenashi_Majutsu_Koushi_to_Akashic_Records,"['Open up a light novel with a school setting with pretty girls and a protagonist standing in the middle. Then in the background, watch for signs of magical content like sparkles, circles, etc. I swear, almost every light novel adaptation these days has something similar in nature and it doesn’t take a creative mind to write a story about them. Given the way Rokudenashi is written, there’s no treasure you’ll find in this series. Instead, you’ll spend endless hours wondering why the characters’ school uniforms look so ridiculous.Also known as Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor, the series takes off in an academy life setting....From the first few episodes, the series doesn’t hide the personality of the main protagonist, Glenn Radars. To put it straightforward, he is a bastard. His personality is very sarcastic, lazy, and seems to never be able to stand still. However, Glenn has shown that he is a capable instructor with a decent knowledge of magic. And in essence, he has a good heart to help his students. So I guess in a way, he is able to walk between the line of a lazy bastard and as a guy his students can rely on. Unfortunately, my early impression of Glenn is that he is very difficult to take seriously and is someone that can barely act his age.Given the context of the series, the girls doesn’t present a good impression of themselves either. The first time when Glenn interacts with Sistine, a promising student at school, he is literally blasted away by his awkward introduction. Her best friend Rumia seems to be more understanding although she seems to fit into the category of the classic damsel in distress. She is pretty, kind, has blonde hair with a cute smile but unfortunately never able to save herself. You ever see a horror movie where an innocent blonde girl is running for her life and desperately needs to be saved? That’s how I picture Rumia throughout the show as many episodes seems to put her into such position. At some point, I wouldn’t be surprised if viewers label her as a hostage simulator.On terms of character relationships, the series seems to jump from one to another although the core focus is still Glenn. I have to admit, his relationships with his students is pretty uninspiring. On paper, Glenn and Sistine has a rocky relationship ever since from their first encounter. Their relationship seems to warm up a bit although can hardly be memorable given their contrasting personalities. Let’s face it, Sistine is a serious working student hoping to make her dreams come true while Glenn is a lazy bastard who seems to be taking life like a game. There’s hardly any connection between the two except we learn that Sistine does remind him of another character in the past. Given the length of this adaptation, that territory is hardly explored which is pretty disheartening to be honest. In the meantime, there’s Rumia and Glenn. They get along better and if I had to guess, she might have developed a girly crush on Glenn just because of how much times he’s saved her. Beyond that, it’s nothing home to write about. Oh and of course, there are some other characters we’ll encounter like Re=L, Albert, and Celica. Between Glenn and them, it just feels like these characters are there and hardly stand out with their role. The only character on that list worth mentioning may be Re=L but she has the personality of a doll and a peculiar background story. And trust me, with a character like Re=L in this show, it feels like they are trying to bring in every type of generic character personality they can into one place.By expectations, the series probably excels most when it takes a more serious approach at magic. Understandably, this show surprisingly does a neat job at explaining magic, or at least on a level that makes sense. Antagonists are able to utilize magic at a level that looks threatening while Glenn establishes himself as a capable instructor with his knowledge of magic. By storytelling standards, magic is also a core motivation for Sistine as she wishes to discover the secrets of the Flying Castle. So if any positive stands out about this show, I can safely say that magic adamantly stands out. It’s even part of a tournament although the storytelling itself in that field is pretty underwhelming.If I was to talk about the art of the show, the first thing that pops to my head is the school uniforms. Somehow, the female characters finds no troubling wearing them despite their ridiculous design. Attached to a string and exposing the bellies, it makes me curious if this school even has a damn written dress code. Character designs look somewhat noticeable such as Sistine’s cat ears, Re=L’s blueish hair, or Celica’s black dress. Character expressions for the main cast are somewhat entertaining to watch at times when the timing is appropriate. However, the antagonists in this show are very disappointing to look at. I mean, an evil maid? A guy that dresses like he works as a stagecoach driver? Can this show get any more awkward? On the other hand, I guess the academy itself looks normal or fits within the category of acceptable. The action sequences on most parts flows well. But again, it’s mostly the magic doing the work.I don’t have much to say for the soundtrack or music as it feels rather blend. The OP and ED theme songs are pretty generic while the battle soundtrack is hardly original. My impressions of the voice acting also remains so-so. Glenn sounds too sarcastic for a guy of his age while Re=L is devoid of emotions. Sistine and her friend Rumia doesn’t bring in any memorable lines and often makes comedic scenes look shameful.In retrospect, I can’t say this is a good show. Or in fact, it’s not even half decent. It fits more into the category of academy story with characters molded by the most generic personalities possible. The storytelling itself borders into the realm of gobbledygook as hardly any episodes are memorable. With cheesy character dialogues, weakly developed relationships, and attempts at crafting humor, the show doesn’t do well at it selling whatever it intends to. Oh and school uniforms…Just, why?

Oh and school uniforms…Just, why?', ""Highly underrated show that exeeded my expectations imo. I think some ppl need to be more open-minded. Some of the MAL reviews that quickly judge shows with a bad score just by looking at the 'genres:\xa0Action,\xa0Magic,\xa0Fantasy,\xa0School' and the 'LN adaptation' tag. Don't get me wrong, I have watched a lot of these type of light novel adaptation shows and I did not have high expectations at all when I started the show. And I was right, episode 1 was really bad, full of the usual clichés and tropes. But if you look past that first episode, this show actually gets better exponentially. This show is...surprisingly extremely entertaining, with intriguing characters. Though it still has some of the usual tropes and clichés, there was something different about the plot and characters,  which are very welk done,  that kept me hooked throughout. It IS without a doubt one of the BETTER light novel adaptations of these past few months. The plot is not really predictable, abd characters are not shallow in the least. Actual lovable characters that are quite different from the usual clichéd ones. Great music, art and action overall. And the ending was satisfying and made me want to know more. I am honestly gonna be a little lenient and give this a 9/10 ^^Just watch past episode 1 and you'll love this I think.  It's actually rare to see an okay light novel adaptation and LINDENFILMS did a great job at their second attempt.I HAD to write this because I felt that this show definitely deserves more positive reviews.I know not everyone does this, but imo, when it comes to mindsets when going into a show, I don't think one should judge shows completely before even finishing it, or giving it a fair chance. Because that's something I did and it really made me miss out on a lot of enjoyment and ruined my experience.Don't EXPECT it to be bad, give everything a chance, at least that's my philosophy.Thanks for reading.(My first review.. Might do more of this. This is fun) surprisingly extremely entertaining, with intriguing characters.

It's actually rare to see an okay light novel adaptation and LINDENFILMS did a great job at their second attempt.I HAD to write this because I felt that this show definitely deserves more positive reviews.I know not everyone does this, but imo, when it comes to mindsets when going into a show, I don't think one should judge shows completely before even finishing it, or giving it a fair chance. Because that's something I did and it really made me miss out on a lot of enjoyment and ruined my experience.Don't EXPECT it to be bad, give everything a chance, at least that's my philosophy.Thanks for reading.(My first review.. Might do more of this. This is fun)"", ""Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is in my opinion the greatest disappointment of the spring season. Don't misunderstand me, I really enjoyed the show but after watching the first episodes my expectations were really high, this anime had a lot of potential and it got wasted, so this is why I feel let down.The story, which seemed really good at the beginning, went to nowhere, there's no plot overall, the anime consists in Glenn (the MC) saving continuously the girls he's bound to because everyone of them is important for some reason or another and the storytelling towards the end was very rushed: I...felt like it was lacking something so I read the manga (I know the LN is the original but I couldn't find it anywhere) and noticed that some details were left out of the anime adaptation. So, if you liked the show I recommend you to read the Light Novel or the manga.I liked the characters and the comedy but I grew a bit annoyed at them with each passing episode because they lost their initial impact, I think the show needed to renew some gags, but it was funny nonetheless and I didn't get bored.Speaking of the characters, the girls' chara design was beautiful, Rumia, Sistine and Re=l were extraordinarly cute. And I found the voice acting really good, I was most impressed by Sistine's VA,  it was perfect and I loved it.So, long story short: if you like the magic/school genre this is a piece of cake, it's entertaining and I had fun watching it, but don't make the same mistake as me, don't raise your expectations, because the anime starts off pretty well, but it becomes somewhat predictable afterwards. felt like it was lacking something so I read the manga (I know the LN is the original but I couldn't find it anywhere) and noticed that some details were left out of the anime adaptation.

Now, of course, to clarify, I don\'t believe that just because an anime is adapted from a light novel, it is inherently bad. There have been plenty of light novel adaptations in the past that have actually been pretty good, but what I am referring to, in this case, are the light novel adaptations that feature some boring male protagonist with spiky hair that acts as a self insert for all of the filthy otaku, who goes to some random...high school that is usually one in which the students have superpowers (and for some reason it\'s always magic) as he becomes stronger and stronger while all of the female cast gets wet at his complete awesomeness! Most of these light novel adaptations follow the same basic elements, character archetypes and plot threads, and, if you\'ve seen as many as I have, all begin to blend into one gigantic, horrible mess. I hate these types of light novel adaptations, because they\'re so lazy and so god damn unoriginal, yet, they still become widely popular; undeservingly so!  While I have seen a couple of them done decently well, such as Chivalry of a Failed Knight, which plays around and subverts some of the troupes found in these typical shows, Akashic Records is not decent... it\'s not even mediocre! It\'s terrible! Every one of these elements I have listed in this opening paragraph is present in this travesty, and the writing, characters, narrative and the world presented to us are so boring, generic and cookie-cutter that I feel like throwing up just thinking about them! While this is not the worst light novel adaptation I have ever seen (that honour would go to Absolute Duo or The Asterisk War) it baffles me why this show is receiving such praise from some people and why it has sat at a score of around seven on this website. As soon as I saw the words ""light novel"" and ""LIDENFILMS"" in the seasonal charts before the show started up, I think I died a little inside and, to this day, this studio still hasn\'t produced a single anime I would actually consider to be noteworthy with this being their minimus opus, if you will. With all that said and done, let\'s jump into the narrative (if you could even call it that) of this absolute train wreck!To say that the story of Akashic Records is generic would be the understatement of the year. If anything, this narrative is incredibly linear and predictable every step of the way with glaring pacing issues while shoving down your throat as many stereotypically dull speeches about life as it can possibly muster in each episode. It\'s set in a world in which magic is a viable tool and is used often for war against other nations, and, of course, as typical of light novel stories, the teenagers in this world are able to use said magic and attend special high schools. Enter the Light Novel guy for this series; a lazy man with an indifferent attitude who also happens to be a shut-in, takes up a job teaching magic at some random magic high school after being forced to by the woman he lives with. This, however, is greeted by disdain by the students in the class he has to teach, in particular, by two female students, called Tsundere-chan (Sistine Febel) and Basic Bitch (Rumia Tingel). While this first greeting is met with hostility, this new teacher eventually warms up to the rest of the class and they begin to develop more of a bond with him over the course of the series! And that\'s it for a plot! If it sounds like I\'m being incredibly vague with this plot synopsis, that\'s because nothing really happens in this show from a narrative standpoint. It feels like a sequence of events that just happen because the writer needed to fill in some time and they connect so loosely with each other and have no overall bearing or impact on the plot that the narrative feels weak and lacking emotion. None of the characters has any motivation or any clearly defined goals in this series and thus it is hard to actually get invested or engaged into this world at all, or to care for any of the characters. The narrative has no sense of direction, and a weak narrative isn\'t exactly a game breaker for me as long as the characters are good (which they\'re not, but I\'ll get into that in a bit) but I\'d like to have some kind of story actually happening! There is an evil magic organisation of some sort but they barely play any part in the narrative and feel so tacked on and vague that half of the time I forget that they\'re even present or playing any part in this story. They do introduce a new villain in the show but it\'s WAY too late into the narrative in order to flesh him out and instead, they rush this character\'s introduction, his involvement and his back-story within only an episode or so.Speaking of the pacing, holy crap is this broken! The show tries to squeeze so much into its short twelve episode frame that it feels like a chore to watch since they\'re constantly throwing more and more things at you at every passing episode. It\'s also another kick to the nuts to realise that everything that does happen in the show is so inconsequential and boring to boot as well, which is also present in the setting for the show. The world of Akashic Records is one of the laziest thought out worlds I have ever seen. It\'s a world in which magic, goddamn MAGIC, is a part of everyday life but we barely have seen any examples of how people coexist with magic in the narrative in their daily lives outside of high school nor is the magic they use themselves all too great either. The great thing about setting your world in which features magic is that it allows you to be as creative as you could possibly want in regards to how the world operates and how its people live, while excusing it with the pretence that magic is an in-depth and intricate system that makes sense to the characters that live in this world, but, instead, they do nothing with it. For the sake of argument, let\'s compare it to the series Little Witch Academia, which aired alongside this show. Aside from doing everything better than Akashic Records, the world of Little Witch Academia is built around this idea of magic and is used in creative ways which bring the world to life. The world is interesting and alluring. Not only that but each of the characters have clearly defined goals which help to push the story forward and keep the audience immersed in the story; two things that Akashic Records doesn\'t have.A lot of the time the narrative is just simply tasteless, making light jokes and comedy from molestation and rape of all things, especially from the second episode. The tonal shifts from watching a girl almost get raped to then making a stupid joke is painful and is almost as bad as the tonal shifts from Drifters. Speaking of the comedy, it feels so damn forced and trite as well as predictable that every attempt at a joke falls flat on its face and isn\'t funny in the slightest! The show also throws an insane amount of blood at the audience in a petty, pathetic attempt at seeming hardcore and edgy since the writing isn\'t strong enough to hold up by itself. Not only that, but the insane amount of blood half the time just feels silly, such as in episode nine, where Basic is lying unconscious in the floor with an insane amount of blood plastered on the bed, floor and curtains (enough that would kill a person), but her only wound is a slight wound on her stomach! How? Why? Who knows!There actually is a tournament arc in the show, but just like everything else, it is terrible. Again, since this is a world full of magic, the writer could have written some very interesting fight scenes or competitions around the use of magic but all of them are just so boring and the show glosses over this arc so quickly that it feels entirely pointless. Some may argue that the true meat of this arc was, in fact, Basic\'s relationship with the queen and everything surrounding that, but, again, it feels so boring to watch, this is never brought up later again in the series and this scene is one of the worst cases of melodrama and bad writing I have seen in a very long time. And much of the show is forced with melodrama too, which, doesn\'t feel emotional since I don\'t care for a single one of these characters and all of these situations I\'ve seen to much better effect somewhere else before. There is even a beach scene, thrown in just for some silly fan service, scenes that could have been used for character development and growth instead, but, nope, CLEARLY, the most important thing to do is show the audience what each girl would look like if they were in bloody swimsuits! The narrative is just so boring, predictable and unfocused that it\'s hard not to fall asleep whilst watching it and every single element in the story has been done elsewhere before in a better capacity. Even for Light Novels this story is generic and they use every cheap writing technique in the book to try and make you feel sorry and sympathetic for these characters when they have not been built from the ground up from victimisation, to the loss of a loved one in the past; this crap has it all!The characters are just as bad and are essentially just all archetypes of previous anime character personality traits. Not a single one is interesting and none develop at all during the entire duration of the show; they\'re all stagnant. Glenn, as the main character of a light novel series, is a little bit more interesting than what I am accustomed to, however, not only in physical appearance but also in personality. He is an adult character, makes fun of people, is lazy and is just all around a twat. He doesn\'t get flustered when he sees girls naked (instead he actively tries to) like most light novel main guys either. Does this make his character good? No... not really. The main problem with Glenn as a character is that he is inconsistent and his back-story is both generic as hell and is very heavily underdeveloped to boot. He is made to be, at first, to be an incompetent idiot with no speciality for magic, but after episode three, he pretty much can do anything the plot demands from him because B U L L S H I T. While, at times, I did enjoy his random hijinks and ass-hole nature, I found him to be extremely boring and lacking when compared to the series Great Teacher Onozuka. The other main characters include Tsundere-chan, who begins to develop a crush on Glenn as the series goes along and GOD I wanted to smack this character in the face. She is constantly complaining, whining and nagging at every little thing and her character design, and personality has been done so much at this point, that every time I see a Tsundere character I want to slam my face into a wall. Basic Bitch, otherwise known as Rumia, is the only character with some emotional weight to her as her back-story is decently explored but is nothing to write home about. I refer to her as Basic Bitch because that is exactly what she is: basic. She acts as the good morale, angel type character which sickens me to death with how boring she is. The only other character who is given somewhat of a back-story is a character called Re-L, who assumes the deadpan loli archetype that has been done so many times up to this point, that every time she was on screen my mind sort of hazed out and lost interest straight away. While, sure, we do learn things about her character, it\'s, again, nothing all too great, boring and after her mini-arc is completed she is pretty much pushed to the sidelines afterwards and plays hardly any factor in the rest of the show.The rest of the cast is equally as generic, boring and underdeveloped, and it\'s giving me a migraine trying to refresh my memory of them. The only character who is SOMEWHAT likeable, and I stress that ""somewhat"" greatly is Celica, mainly because of her personality but this character is given so little screen time that I forgot about her entirely. When she is on screen, she is fairly interesting but is not enough to save the anime.The overall aesthetic and quality of the artwork were just fine, but the animation was just pretty lazy since they reuse the same shot of Tsundere-chan punching Glenn into the sky about twenty times, three within one episode sometimes. It\'s not the worst I have seen, and I do like some of the palettes as well, but it\'s overall just a very bland looking show. However, the character designs are some of the worst I have ever seen! While the boy\'s school uniform is fine and conventional, I have no clue what the hell happened to the girl\'s outfits. It looks like something you\'d find straight out of a porno for god\'s sake! The skirt is about five millimetres in length, covering barely any flesh and they have these short tops, which exposes their stomachs, complete with garter belts and straps around from their skirts to their stomachs. How, in the holy mother of hell, was this allowed in a high school is way beyond me, and, as a result, it pretty much ruins every dramatic moment in the show since the uniforms are so silly, they end up distracting me from the emotional scenes. As for the music, it\'s perhaps the most stock and dull soundtrack I\'ve heard in a while. Not a single one is memorable or even decently composed, and the opening and ending tracks are just generic pop music that you\'ll forget as soon as you listen to something else. The opening, in keeping up with the traditions set by the Gun Gale Arc from SAO, also spoils who the main villain is going to be!If you\'ve seen any light novel adaptation about a group of kids with magic powers inside a high school then you\'ve seen Akashic Records, because each one of these shows is fundamentally the exact same thing with only slight variations, and I\'m done with this shit forever. Each one of these boring, insipid, shallow, vacuous light novel series can seriously just go fuck themselves for their insulting storytelling, awful characters and terrible pandering. These series are essentially the anime equivalence of the films made by Illumination Animation; they\'re both produced with no soul or intent at creating a piece of art or telling a story with a message that can resonate with an audience. I love both the medium of film, and the animation medium very much since they have provided some of the most heartfelt, and most impactful pieces of fiction I have seen. Film and animation can make you cry, make you laugh, they help shape you as a person, especially at a young age, and I honestly don\'t know where I\'ll be without them, for as corny as that sounds. But, these light novel adaptations offer nothing at all; no emotion, other than genuine anger and irritation, and hence, I am done forever with these boring shows. I\'d rather digest cyanide than sit through another show like Hundred or Absolute Duo, and, especially Akashic Records ever again. Of course, if you like these shows, then that is completely fine. I\'m glad you\'re able to enjoy something that I don\'t. After all the world would be a boring place if we all liked the exact same thing. But, to me, this show is awful in every sense of the word. It has nothing. I\'d rather watch Hand Shakers on repeat than watch one of these shows ever again. Now, that\'s saying something... high school that is usually one in which the students have superpowers (and for some reason it\'s always magic) as he becomes stronger and stronger while all of the female cast gets wet at his complete awesomeness! Most of these light novel adaptations follow the same basic elements, character archetypes and plot threads, and, if you\'ve seen as many as I have, all begin to blend into one gigantic, horrible mess.

Now, that\'s saying something...', ""TL;DR at the bottomOkay, so it's none of the 'professional and long' reviews you see often. Just felt like it would be great to give you a short glimpse on this anime, since I'm that kind of person who needs to be reassured that an anime is worth watching, and that's usually by checking out trailers or reviews (mostly to see if there are any positive reviews, because I mostly watch non-popular anime). Either way, is it worth watching? Yeah, definitely. There are only 4 episodes at the moment and I will update the review once it finishes airing, but for now, jump in as...soon as you can, so you keep up with the flow and don't need to do an all-nighter as I do all the time when watching anime (updates later below).Now, I don't talk about people, yes you, who despise or dislike harem / ecchi genres. I, in particular, see no problem in watching these genres as long as it's not over the top or has actual plot. Maybe this show is a bit similar to a cliche, what is a strong MC; hides the powers; has a dark past; blah blah... But the execution itself and the kinda original spin of the cliche is what I like, because it reminds me of Konosuba, No Game No Life, Mondaiji-tachi, Gakushen Toshi Asterisk (even though it didn't have insane ratings) and such shows (ex. No Game No Life has an interesting plot to me, and it's good, further more it includes comedy, the MC doesn't strain / limit himself nor his character acting however he wishes, yet knows his abilities and thinks about them and proceeds knowing he can do this or that).  That is basically why, you should watch this show, since it reminds of those shows, yet it's original. The MC is similar to a one of NGNL / Mondaiji-tachi, yet it is original in ways, because he's not too OP, however has a lot of knowledge.

I want you to know that it's really worth watching. I myself love when there's romance in anime, however I prefer it preserved. In this particular one, well it's a typical harem, except that the teacher doesn't actually let it to be a harem, he actually represents a teacher as the anime gets going, even though careless he would seem, he's a mastermind.No idea how about you, but I loved the ending. I had various ships throughout the anime, and I couldn't really decide. I myself like romance, but I really don't even mind if it's not there as long as the author doesn't tease me to nerves. I loved it, I personally was amazingly satisfied by the ending and what was the last conversation of the whole pinnacle. I wished to see more and to see the romance develop, but on the other hand I guess it would push out the action and mystery out of it then, unless it's kept to minimal.I recommend you to watch it, no matter if the start or some parts feel like bore or unacceptable to you, I have no problem with harems and ecchi genres, and I fully advise you to watch this. It is completely not over the top and I ensure you will have both great time, and be satisfied. It has action, comedy and mystery in it, at least for me. I'm pretty sure it's a good one this year.What are you doing?Start watching, you bakaaaa!Cheers, enjoy!Patrick soon as you can, so you keep up with the flow and don't need to do an all-nighter as I do all the time when watching anime (updates later below).Now, I don't talk about people, yes you, who despise or dislike harem / ecchi genres. I, in particular, see no problem in watching these genres as long as it's not over the top or has actual plot. Maybe this show is a bit similar to a cliche, what is a strong MC; hides the powers; has a dark past; blah blah... But the execution itself and the kinda original spin of the cliche is what I like, because it reminds me of Konosuba, No Game No Life, Mondaiji-tachi, Gakushen Toshi Asterisk (even though it didn't have insane ratings) and such shows (ex. No Game No Life has an interesting plot to me, and it's good, further more it includes comedy, the MC doesn't strain / limit himself nor his character acting however he wishes, yet knows his abilities and thinks about them and proceeds knowing he can do this or that).  That is basically why, you should watch this show, since it reminds of those shows, yet it's original. The MC is similar to a one of NGNL / Mondaiji-tachi, yet it is original in ways, because he's not too OP, however has a lot of knowledge.

First, a decent chunk of this review will be spent analyzing the ideas this series had and how with some major and minor tweaks, the series could\'ve been better, at...least from a storytelling perspective. Secondly, I\'m about to let out something I have to get out of my chest because while this insufferable mentality I’m about to describe isn\'t truly widespread, I\'ve still seen it a handful of times, and quite frankly, it\'s sickening. People who have this upcoming mentality infuriate me with their ignorance and sheer vindictiveness.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If a title is almost nothing but recycled content from shows prior, then to me at least, it has no excuse and little reason to both exist and be defended as a work of fiction. It seems like creativity isn\'t as valued as it should be and this has been a problem in every industry at almost every point in history for one reason or another. With the anime in the 80\'s/90\'s, it was schlock bloodbath OVAs and nowadays in anime, it\'s Light Novel School Battle and/or Harem anime. Titles that largely or even entirely fit these descriptions can still break the mold and achieve something greater.We do not have some ""mythical, absurdly high, nigh-unachievable standard"" that bitter ""anti-elitists"" keep accusing us of having! We just want anime to actually have a sense of life, a sense of passion, and a reason to exist outside of making corporate money from people who have loved tons of shows borderline identical to what they\'re currently watching and fapping to. Even among school battle (usually harem) anime, there are some that go above and beyond, like the aforementioned Chivalry of a Failed Knight. In fact, even among the standards if these ""copy-paste"" anime, some manage to really sink below to almost creative levels of suck, like The Irregular at Magic High School, as if to prove that there is a standard to hold titles like this by and that even this kind of anime has its own hierarchy like all the rest.In summation, we do not all have some absurd standard for anime, we just want these kinds of titles to die out (or rather to not be as widespread, which in fairness, is already happening somewhat over the past year as isekai starts to take its place) so that anime that actually have passion and creativity can more easily flourish, and even by the standards of the now incessant LN school battle harem anime, some can go beyond the expectations or fail to even meet such bottom of the barrel standards. If you enjoy these titles, that\'s fine, just at least have some standards regarding these things since not all of them are of equal quality and the ones with the least amount of effort put into making them worthwhile works of fiction do not deserve to be defended, at least to me. Again, like them if you want, just don\'t accuse us of bad standards or incorrect views solely for dissenting from your ""it\'s done before but that\'s fine because I like it"" viewpoint. No one is saying everything must break the mold and become an extraordinary work of art otherwise it has no right to exist. It\'s certainly ok to have fun and enjoy a work that sought entertainment value first and foremost, as us supposed ""bitter, contrarian reviewer elitists"" do too. I simply refuse to sit down while shows like this and viewpoints such as the aforementioned run rampant.With that tirade out of the way, let\'s start the review proper.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mixing Konosuba humor and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is like mixing a liter of ghost pepper juice and white paint. You know, shit like this is why I invested in a tomato farm. Wait, I\'m sorry, was that joke not predictable enough for you? My bad, let me try again: Ahem, “This show is cancer.” Actually, my previous joke was funnier than both this one and every single joke here in this godforsaken show. Let me grab those tomatoes now.Akashic Records. For some reason, people thought this was actually funny and “totally not exactly like all of the other trash we hate because it has more comedy in its trashiest scenarios than those others shows that do the exact same thing but with a permanently straight face.” This show isn\'t funny; it\'s predictable. It has no semblance of tact or actual self-awareness on how awful its writing and gaudy cheese-fest self-justification for subsequent action exposition dumps that last up to a minute are. You people call SAO terrible? At least it has more tact and worthwhile humor than this show ever did, as well as more originality, better music, a much more tolerable color pallet. Even with its bad pacing, at least it never showed off early events that feel like they should be coming in much later than they should, or give flashbacks to equally terrible and popular shows with specific plot points. This show thinks it can get away with being the trashiest LN garbage ever as long as it adds “hurr-de-durr” to everything and adding a funny face just to really make it even more obvious than it is. It thinks it\'s the Konosuba of school battle harem trash; it\'s not. It takes itself just as seriously for most part, so that doesn\'t work. Hell, it\'s even worse since those shows take horrible scenarios like attempted rape seriously when presenting them. This show doesn\'t. But enough rambling; what makes Akashic Records so awful to the point where I actually believe that The Asterisk War is a much better show than it? Well, let’s find out, shall we?Let’s address the elephant in the room before we really rip into the logic of this show: the female school uniforms. You know, I think it should be the woman’s choice as to whether or not she’ll be so scantily clad that not only are her midriffs and things exposed, but that she also has suspenders at the thighs and waist to make sure that two-piece outfit doesn\'t fall apart, not something that a school, let alone an “esteemed private academy” such as this one, should mandate. This kind of uniform that would make any real school principal revile in horror is, while sexy and appealing, downright disgusting in the fact that a school mandates women wear that as their official uniform. I get that this is a trash anime, but no successful school in their right mind would pull such a stunt without raising absolute hellfire from parents, true gentlemen, feminists, other schools and districts, and SJWs across the nation, especially when this show’s one obviously hot and fanservicey character is more decently clad than the high school students (aka, generic archetype bitches) that are forced to wear this. I mean, the men wear regal and classy suits befitting of gentlemen (even Glenn wears something of decent clothing, and he’s the lazy asshole pervert), so wouldn\'t it make sense to have the ladies wear something even more regal and classy, like Celica, the obviously hot fanservice character? You wouldn\'t believe how badly that made me lose hope in any logic found in the story. I mean, I am a teenage, straight male, and I like hot women like the rest of my kind, hell, I can ogle at Celica all day, but this is just ridiculous!Now, to everything else.To be fair, the series doesn\'t really have major plot holes, even despite a few minor ones (nor all of which I\'ll cover), but it does have many leaps in logic for the characters, bad pacing, and it manages to portray certain scenes horrendously. But there are decent moments, like the rare joke that hits, occasional (if not successful due to poor pacing) attempts at emotional scenes, and the scene where Glenn goes Grammar Nazi on students to show just how convoluted magic can really be. I\'ll start by going rapid fire on a few dumb things from episodes 1 and 2. Still, prepare to be here a while, the story segment takes up a vast majority of the review since there is a lot I need to say here.Why does Celica threaten Glenn to get him to work at this school despite knowing that he is beyond unqualified and that he hates magic? Is it because she just wants him to get a job and if he a deadbeat regardless of whether or not he is remotely qualified, because if so, that\'s stupid (since she needs to make sure he is at least remotely qualified for his job). The series checks out one important trite bullshit (aka bad cliché) from the list really early with a scene where the flatter student (Sistine) helped the big-tits student (Rumia), but here, it\'s portrayed in such a sexual manner to the point where in other series, they are still sexual harassment despite teasing, this is easily a more blatantly disgusting and uncomfortable act of sexual harassment that sent out of its way to be as horrid as possible (partially since it made me hate the Sistine, one of the main characters, by the first episode, the episode where we are supposed to be sold on these characters).The entirety of episode 2 felt like it should\'ve been stretched out over multiple episodes given how here is a small time skip in the middle of episode 2 after Glenn reaches the importance of grammar in changing magic, and how much is packed into this episode story-wise. In order of appearance: Glenn starts the episode same as before, he goes so far into dissing magic that Sistine slaps him and leaves in tears, each character has an emotional moment before Glenn realizes how little students truly know about magic besides one particular method for each spell, he schools them, then his students like him, he has then made progress and is now infinitely more passionate about work, we go back and reaffirm that there is a moment in which Rumia was saved by presumably Glenn (we even see the hair color, and in episode 1, she looks familiar to him, but this isn\'t spaced or enough to feel organic or that it would take a little while for us to really explore this point without coming up with the answer so early into the show), and then terrorists. All of this should\'ve been episodes 3, 4, and even 5. I mean it. We could\'ve just done the same shenanigans and have episode 2 end on the moment where Sistine slaps Glenn and walks off in tears, then episode 3 have an emotional episode that shows us another side of our (at the time) 3 important characters while showing us that terrorists are soon to some before at the end, he busts out some knowledge on the students, then episode 4 not only shows us how much all of this is working out while at the same time showing us that he is actually becoming happier overall while doing this, but then the episode brings us back to that moment where we see him and Rumia interact before we learn that she was saved by someone who looks suspiciously like Glenn, and then it ends on terrorists moving in. Episodes 5 and 6 would be a bunch of terrorists raising hell in the school and then Glenn, and all students and teachers fight back in a mini war arc, by editing the final few minutes of episode 2 where terrorists show up and turning that into episode 5, and editing some of the intrusive comedy of episode 3 and making it episode 6.. There, I just vastly improved the show just by taking episode 2 stretching it out, and adding and editing parts as I went along,like making episode 3 episode 6. If only the writer was this capable.The moment that made this show awful beyond redemption was the attempted rape scene. Let me set the scene. Terrorists have just captured Rumia who turned out to be a former princess but her family was killed and she escaped (hence why she said she was saved by someone before terrorists would\'ve killed her). Sistine is alone in a room, and a terrorist walks in. He then begins to toy with her, saying that people like her are surprisingly and deliciously fragile while pinning her down and slowly undressing her. Then, Glenn walks in and it turns from trite to actively offensively terrible. In the midst of a scene of attempted rape, Glenn walks in, pays no mind, and lackadaisical comedy ensues for like 40 seconds! WHAT THE FLYING FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!?! A character is in the verge of getting rape, and the supposed “hero” who busts in not only doesn\'t recognize the situation, but acts all lazy! Needless to say, this moment made this show practically impossible to redeem. When SAO can treat this kind of scene with infinitely more tact than this show can, in regards to content and tone, you know we have a problem here! Sure, eventually Glenn saves her, but then we get the rest of the scene.Glenn busts out this arcana card which nullifies all magic (especially opponents’ and enemies” magic). This is a very generic magic for an MC to have, and it\'s giving me Mahouka flashbacks as if the school terrorism thing didn\'t do that already. Glenn just busts out an arcana card unceremoniously and explains what it does in his usual lackadaisical tone (tired of me using that word yet?). This is the first time we see this kind of magic card in the series, adding to the already surpassingly convoluted magic system of this world, so at least the show could do is unveil it with grandeur. Even Mahouka did that right! Whatever, a badly animated curb stomp commences in which Glenn wins, and episode 2 ends. As you can no doubt tell, the rape attempt scene should\'ve never happened and in my version above, it never would.Actually, there are a few things in episode 3 I would alter, since it\'s not a great episode either (I mean, what did you expect from this show). I think the worst thing this episode does is prove that this crock of shit had potential, potential that it, predictably, squandered. I mean, Glenn was a mate killer, so that could\'ve been explored and built up a bit better since before then, the only buildup was him saying magic kills people. In this episode, I would edit out the numerous and always monotonous self-justification for what someone is about to do exposition dumps there always last for around 30 seconds, some of the intrusive comedy of the first 6 minutes, and do one last crucial thing in the last few minutes of the episode. Remember how Professor Huey apparently left (hence why they have a sub) prior to the events of episode 1? Well, here he is again, but has no exposed motivations for being here, and he just stands there, saying that it\'s a game to see if Glenn can free Rumia from a bunch of magic circles, so, none of that makes any real sense. He needs a reason for doing this, and why he is treating this like a game. Also, at the end, they completely gloss over what Rumia’s true name as princess was Eruminia, and I don\'t know why. This also confirms that yes, Glenn was the one that unknowingly saved her. It\'s a shame that one of the most potentially interesting hook questions about the series was dealt with only 3 episodes in out of 12.I\'m not going to go or if my way to really break down the rest of the episodes since that would take fucking forever and I\'m already spending a lot of time doing rapid fire on a few problems per episode while fixing the series as a whole. But now, we reach the tournament arc, starting with episode 4, so time for me to keep doing what I\'ve been doing. The queen is still the mother of Rumia but apparently everyone was killed but her. Why did she pronounce her daughter dead after the terrorists came? What actually happened? Did terrorists simply kidnap her from everyone? Has the school heard nothing about the Queen? What about the dad/king?The other thing is that we are suddenly introduced to what all of the students can do during the beginning of this tournament arc via a pep talk from Glenn. Want to know how to have made this moment work. Have it so that when the terrorists showed up, they all do what we would hear them being capable of, that what this moment would be actually gratifying since by then we would\'ve known a bit about all the students and then have epic realization that Glenn was exactly right since that what they did in that hypothetical. This has been another round of me improving the series. In fact, the actual tournament section in episode 4 could\'ve been 2, maybe even 3 whole episodes in order to make an interesting tournament arc up until the next episode (specifically, 7-9 on my version), since there are so many games that are glossed over since most students are not important. Hell, even before that, we saw a typical asshole vs underdog rivalry set up with Harley and his class vs Glenn and his, and then it would be gratifying and exciting to see both groups compete and Glenn’s class do well on each of these events. This has been another round of me making a better series out of the pieces this one failed to put together. Also, the asspull of Rumia winning her round because the big buff guy suddenly blacked out for no reason was infuriating, and the fact that it came after a rushed and stupid bit of her teammates telling her to quit since they “care for her” despite her being in no peril and her wanting to do this, is especially galling. When both The Asterisk War and Fairy Tail can make a better tournament arc, then your arc is shit, and by extension, you\'re shit!Episodes 5 and 6, barring a few really dumb moments (as per usual), are probably the best in the series, as little as that says about them. The comedy is still pretty miss for me but not only are there a few genuinely sweet moments like Glenn’s conversation with Rumia I episode 5 and her true reunion with her mother at the end of episode 6, but also, the way Glenn defeats the villain of this arc is actually pretty intelligent and entertaining, reminding me of some of the most popular protagonists in anime like Lelouch from Code Geass, Light from Death Note, and Sora from No Game No Life. Still, time to fix ‘em. I\'ll give this series a compliment when it deserves one; it\'s already like...96:0 in problems (and you get a cookie if you get where that reference came from). The way to make it better this time is simple, and it builds from the last fixing I did: actually juggle the rescue attempt and the tournament matches equally and flesh them both out, that way we have all of the emotional payoffs actually pay off (at least if you give each scene enough space), and so that we can actually enjoy the tournament side of the arc, and have that whole thing from episodes 5 and 6 take up 3 more episodes (10-12 in my version) while removing some of the fake out comedy, taking away the explosion speeches about “me saying why I\'m doing what I\'m doing”, removing the dere moments Sistine has with her teacher (I get that he is 19 but still it\'s sorta creepy for a student to have a hunted romantic interest in her teacher) and altering the ending where the students spend all his money to him actually treating them with some of his money, that way nothing about any of the arcs each character went through get cheapened upon rewatch and hindsight (namely Glenn’s). Also, have more animation in the arc since this series doesn\'t really have much actual character animation.See? It\'s simple. If we create a brand new episode 1 from scratch to replace this episode 1 and take all of the ideas I brought up that modify these episodes, we could\'ve had an actually good series on our hands since despite all of the LN trope bullshit, awful comedy moments that ruin certain scenes, and a few other things, all the pieces were there for the first 6 episodes to be a good 1 cour series. The other 6 on the other hand...yeah, I haven\'t been really living up to my promise of tone, and these episodes are gonna change that; they are that bad...*sigh* Episode 7 is where things go back to being abysmal instead of just bad, partially due to almost half of it being a cliché beach episode and the irritating comedy, partially due to the character Re=L (make your Ergo Proxy joke elsewhere). She is such a bad character, and it is the impetus of the arc and why it\'s horrible. Her heel turn is insanely telegraphed and still incredibly forced, being out of jealously in episode 7 about the fact that the deuteragonist females are quote unquote “stealing Glenn away from her”, and because she is just a double agent who likes her dead brother who she saw again (which means he was revived, which is a major plot point in the arc, revival) in episode 8, while the rest of episode 8 before that is just the introduction of revival, one of the villains of the previous arc showing up and being a crazy bitch, and Re=L moving around and being an insufferable bitch. Fuck this arc in its entirety. Oh, and she nearly kills Glenn because of this and badly injures Rumia. When you consider that up to this point, she had been trying to kill Glenn (or at least she attacks him as greeting and always wants to settle a score with him) and the fact that she genuinely talked of the fact that she had a lot of fun with the people she immediately afterwards hated) and the fact that she had just been a generic deadpan loli character, this sudden turn is infuriatingly stupid and forced. The 9th episode is just as bad honestly, and they rushed the shit out of a villain death and the backstory Re=L has can\'t redeem her in the slightest. Also, the main blue-haired villain of the arc was wasted in the fact that there is a malicious character named Reiner, but this guy was just some random who wasn\'t connected with anything and is just a “bad person who does bad things because villain” character. I literally have no way to really remotely fix this arc; it was dead on arrival.But now, we finally reach the final arc. It is one of the stupidest story arcs I have ever seen in my life, if not the absolute dumbest and most wince-worthy of them all. Here is the main plot of arc 4: Some creepy teacher guy continually confesses to Sistine and after Glenn overheard him dissing her dream, he puts on this front about wanting to marry her for money, and it all becomes a pissing match, except between teachers over a student. Fucking creepy! It\'s beyond stupid a premise given the age ranges (adult and teenager), and given how this is the impetus on having another evil protagonist bent on using Rumia for some scheme, you\'d think this wouldn\'t exist and that they\'d find a less disgusting way for this to happen. The sub plot is about Glenn suddenly realizing that Sistine looks like Sera, a now dead girl he once loved before he left the Imperial Corps, and that now angel dusts addicts (I wish they meant the real life Angel Dust drug) are dying, even a year after that substance was said to have been eradicated. All of these have no right of intertwining with the main (disgusting and wince-worthy) plot of the arc. Also, Re=L is off scot free after the betrayal (did she not ever get arrested for treason for that whole thing in the previous arc?), just to add on to what an irredeemable crock of shit this final arc is! Then, the finale. Oh boy. It\'s probably the most generic episode in the entire show. Turns of there was another traitor that posed as Leo\'s after he killed him part-way into episode 11, and the only thing resolved is the immediately inserted grudge match between the two. I don\'t even have the energy to go into any depth with this one, it\'s just generic and bleh, as if the show is not even trying to hide it\'s true colors anymore. Serves it right.You know, if the narrative wasn\'t so shit in the way that it was, Glenn might have been an actually good character. Think about it: a cynic gave up his pursuit of being a hero of justice after the lives he took and lost now teaches the very thing he hates against his will while growing attached to his students despite everything. Despite what a radical shift in personality he has from past to present, if the writing did how I laid out above, he could\'ve been a pretty good character, assuming they toned down the perviness completely and just made him cynical and partially lazy instead of basically a cross of Archer from UBW and Kazuma from Konosuba. I also like how he is an LN protagonist who isn\'t very overpowered, but that\'s not enough to save him from this awful writing. Celica is a hot and haughty woman who is basically never capable of being there since she’s so overpowered that the narrative wouldn\'t throw a challenge unless they restrain her or just keep her or entirely beforehand. What I like about her is some of her almost motherly nature towards Glenn, like how she threatens Harvey for dissing him in her presence, even if the whole blackmail job thing was nonsense. Now, for the actual named side-characters with relevance outside of just one arc since I\'m not even gonna cover the antagonists (partially since I kinda already did in as much detail as they deserve, barring one who I\'ll get to), nor will I cover small characters like the queen mother or the annoying parents of Sistine.Sistine is a nightmare for her archetype. She aggressively checks out all of the boxes of a bad and cliché tsundere and does it in a way that makes her especially obnoxious. The fact that she has this dynamic with a teacher makes me even more grossed out (regardless of both the nonsensical age dynamic and partially because nothing about this is brought up). She\'s also absurdly useless, to the point that this is a legitimate plot point that carries throughout each arc until she finally does one thing right in the finale. Rumia is basically a typical dere-dere of the group who is basically the MacGuffin for all of the arcs in this show. I\'ve already talked about why Re=L is such a shit character so I\'ll cover one more: Albert. He’s the stoic badass of the bunch whose hunch is always right, so there’s not much to say on him. Lastly, why don\'t we talk about Leos? He is such a shitty character. He apparently had been asking Sistine our since they were kids and not only has he not let go of that, he has gone pathetic over it despite coming off as a decent person (typical of this trope), but again, the whole teacher and student bit makes it worse, and the fact that ha managed to spend only a paltry evening to be able to decipher everything about Glenn, Re=L, and Rumia is absurd, though it turns out it was this Justine guy from episode 11 who is just another evil LN bad guy for LN bad guy sake villain, since literally every single antagonist in this show is the exact same. They turned a crap and generic character into something creepier and stupider and then replaced him with the exact same character as every other villain in this retarded ass show; how typical! So yeah, that\'s everyone relevant. What a shit cast, am I right? As if the wasted potential as generic characters weren\'t bad enough, they reuse the same bad guy personality and have some truly horrible characters thrown into the mix. Let’s move on before I die of embarrassment.The audiovisuals aren\'t much better than the writing, unfortunately. Part of the problem this time isn\'t that the show is badly animated per se, but that its animation insanely limited. Its own damn OP has about as much animation as a typical episode of this show, and there are plenty of reused clips, like the clip of Albert pulling Re=L’s hair or Sistine blasting Glenn with wind, and the slew of reused clips are reused at an insane rate with no remote variation. Hell, even the fight scenes have little animation, especially the one in episode 2 when Glenn beats up the attempted rapist. I initially couldn\'t stand the color palette but I got used to it. I already mentioned how awful the uniforms are so no need to repeat that. There is minimal (albeit terribly some CGI though it\'s blink and you miss it), but did there also have to be minimal animation too? Oh well, at least I like the eyes (they remind me of the trademark Studio White Fox eyes) and some of the admittedly humorous facial expressions.The OP, ""Blow out"" by Konomi Suzuki is a pretty generic (if somewhat catchy) OP that feels like it should be part of a generic fantasy adventure anime, not a generic school battle anime with fantasy elements thrown in there. The ED, ""Precious You☆"" by Sistine Fibel (Akane Fujita), Rumia Tingel (Yume Miyamoto), Re=L Rayford (Ari Ozawa) is absurdly MediocRE that I never bothered listening to the entire minute and thirty second ED. The OST is decent in its own right but honestly feels misplaced here in the same vein as the OP in terms of where it feels more suitable, even despite the darker tone the series boasts on about half of the episodes.The dub is probably one of the worst dubs Funimation has produced in recent memory. Next to none of the voices even remotely fit the characters and sound like they\'d fit completely different sounding roles, like Monica Rial as Rumia and Josh Grelle as Glenn, but the absolute worst offender here is Sistine, played by Rachael Messer, whose acting not only sounds miscast, but at times, bad in its own right. The tertiaries and antagonist roles aren\'t good either, and some of them were doomed to be inferior (like Re=L since it\'s much harder for a dub to pull off a loli voice), and the only voice I sort of see working is Morgan Garrett as Celica. Then again, dubs have been getting worse in recent years, so I guess this is to be expected.Needless to say, I hate this show. I hate it so damn much. I only found one joke funny since it was the only one that wasn\'t predictable as shit, and that was in the very first episode. Any potential the story or characters had ended up being squandered rather quickly, which is frustrating since the first 6 episodes could\'ve actually been pretty good had they removed the bullshit elements and made it a 12 episode series that fleshed these episodes out, though the last 6 are beyond terrible and impossible to redeem. Then again, the show lost any path to actual redemption during the rape attempt scene where they treat it with so little tact that there is comedy in the already drawn out scene. The lack of animation made the fights pretty dull as well, and a lot of the characters, namely Sistine and Re=L were infuriating to no end. There are times when a show offends me with how terrible it is, but when it happens more than once, let alone up to 5 times, that\'s when we know that the show is dogshit and that I\'m in for a terrible experience.When I wasn\'t aggravated to some degree, whether it be mild or insane, I was pretty bored since the action was mediocre and the comedy didn\'t stick with me at all, and a lot of the awful LN school battle harem tropes are here in full display, sometimes taken to the most disgusting degrees possible to the point where I almost wanted to vomit. Also, the final arc is one of the most wince-worthy pieces of animation I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing as if arc 3 didn\'t piss me off enough to the point where the show went back from being bad but salvageable to irredeemable and truly abysmal again. Shame really, since the second arc was actually somewhat enjoyable at times and has the most potential to be good. So yeah, I\'m basically repeating myself at this point so let’s just move on to the final thoughts.You know, it\'s almost cute to know that this show thinks it can get away with being typical trash that gives LNs a bad name just by adding more comedy, disgusting elements, and an occasionally bleak tone and more blood. It pretends to not be exactly like its brethren but does all of the same awful things you\'d expect a show like this to do, only with a tinge of extra putridness. When there\'s a good idea, it\'s gleefully ruined, and the comedy is more predictable than a generic shounen anime. I\'ve already spoken ad nauseam about basically everything wrong with the show and I\'m basically repeating myself, but yeah, suffice it to say, this is one of the worst anime I\'ve seen all year. Hopefully, this is a lesson to all of you that even among shows like this, there are still standards that some of them can meet and surpass their contemporaries, and that we don\'t just have absurd standards that only value high art. Also, hopefully you realize why this show is such a trap that you shouldn\'t fall for. This show scores disgustingly low compared to its peers. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu. least from a storytelling perspective. Secondly, I\'m about to let out something I have to get out of my chest because while this insufferable mentality I’m about to describe isn\'t truly widespread, I\'ve still seen it a handful of times, and quite frankly, it\'s sickening. People who have this upcoming mentality infuriate me with their ignorance and sheer vindictiveness.---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------If a title is almost nothing but recycled content from shows prior, then to me at least, it has no excuse and little reason to both exist and be defended as a work of fiction. It seems like creativity isn\'t as valued as it should be and this has been a problem in every industry at almost every point in history for one reason or another. With the anime in the 80\'s/90\'s, it was schlock bloodbath OVAs and nowadays in anime, it\'s Light Novel School Battle and/or Harem anime. Titles that largely or even entirely fit these descriptions can still break the mold and achieve something greater.We do not have some ""mythical, absurdly high, nigh-unachievable standard"" that bitter ""anti-elitists"" keep accusing us of having! We just want anime to actually have a sense of life, a sense of passion, and a reason to exist outside of making corporate money from people who have loved tons of shows borderline identical to what they\'re currently watching and fapping to. Even among school battle (usually harem) anime, there are some that go above and beyond, like the aforementioned Chivalry of a Failed Knight. In fact, even among the standards if these ""copy-paste"" anime, some manage to really sink below to almost creative levels of suck, like The Irregular at Magic High School, as if to prove that there is a standard to hold titles like this by and that even this kind of anime has its own hierarchy like all the rest.In summation, we do not all have some absurd standard for anime, we just want these kinds of titles to die out (or rather to not be as widespread, which in fairness, is already happening somewhat over the past year as isekai starts to take its place) so that anime that actually have passion and creativity can more easily flourish, and even by the standards of the now incessant LN school battle harem anime, some can go beyond the expectations or fail to even meet such bottom of the barrel standards. If you enjoy these titles, that\'s fine, just at least have some standards regarding these things since not all of them are of equal quality and the ones with the least amount of effort put into making them worthwhile works of fiction do not deserve to be defended, at least to me. Again, like them if you want, just don\'t accuse us of bad standards or incorrect views solely for dissenting from your ""it\'s done before but that\'s fine because I like it"" viewpoint. No one is saying everything must break the mold and become an extraordinary work of art otherwise it has no right to exist. It\'s certainly ok to have fun and enjoy a work that sought entertainment value first and foremost, as us supposed ""bitter, contrarian reviewer elitists"" do too. I simply refuse to sit down while shows like this and viewpoints such as the aforementioned run rampant.With that tirade out of the way, let\'s start the review proper.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Mixing Konosuba humor and Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei is like mixing a liter of ghost pepper juice and white paint. You know, shit like this is why I invested in a tomato farm. Wait, I\'m sorry, was that joke not predictable enough for you? My bad, let me try again: Ahem, “This show is cancer.” Actually, my previous joke was funnier than both this one and every single joke here in this godforsaken show. Let me grab those tomatoes now.Akashic Records. For some reason, people thought this was actually funny and “totally not exactly like all of the other trash we hate because it has more comedy in its trashiest scenarios than those others shows that do the exact same thing but with a permanently straight face.” This show isn\'t funny; it\'s predictable. It has no semblance of tact or actual self-awareness on how awful its writing and gaudy cheese-fest self-justification for subsequent action exposition dumps that last up to a minute are. You people call SAO terrible? At least it has more tact and worthwhile humor than this show ever did, as well as more originality, better music, a much more tolerable color pallet. Even with its bad pacing, at least it never showed off early events that feel like they should be coming in much later than they should, or give flashbacks to equally terrible and popular shows with specific plot points. This show thinks it can get away with being the trashiest LN garbage ever as long as it adds “hurr-de-durr” to everything and adding a funny face just to really make it even more obvious than it is. It thinks it\'s the Konosuba of school battle harem trash; it\'s not. It takes itself just as seriously for most part, so that doesn\'t work. Hell, it\'s even worse since those shows take horrible scenarios like attempted rape seriously when presenting them. This show doesn\'t. But enough rambling; what makes Akashic Records so awful to the point where I actually believe that The Asterisk War is a much better show than it? Well, let’s find out, shall we?Let’s address the elephant in the room before we really rip into the logic of this show: the female school uniforms. You know, I think it should be the woman’s choice as to whether or not she’ll be so scantily clad that not only are her midriffs and things exposed, but that she also has suspenders at the thighs and waist to make sure that two-piece outfit doesn\'t fall apart, not something that a school, let alone an “esteemed private academy” such as this one, should mandate. This kind of uniform that would make any real school principal revile in horror is, while sexy and appealing, downright disgusting in the fact that a school mandates women wear that as their official uniform. I get that this is a trash anime, but no successful school in their right mind would pull such a stunt without raising absolute hellfire from parents, true gentlemen, feminists, other schools and districts, and SJWs across the nation, especially when this show’s one obviously hot and fanservicey character is more decently clad than the high school students (aka, generic archetype bitches) that are forced to wear this. I mean, the men wear regal and classy suits befitting of gentlemen (even Glenn wears something of decent clothing, and he’s the lazy asshole pervert), so wouldn\'t it make sense to have the ladies wear something even more regal and classy, like Celica, the obviously hot fanservice character? You wouldn\'t believe how badly that made me lose hope in any logic found in the story. I mean, I am a teenage, straight male, and I like hot women like the rest of my kind, hell, I can ogle at Celica all day, but this is just ridiculous!Now, to everything else.To be fair, the series doesn\'t really have major plot holes, even despite a few minor ones (nor all of which I\'ll cover), but it does have many leaps in logic for the characters, bad pacing, and it manages to portray certain scenes horrendously. But there are decent moments, like the rare joke that hits, occasional (if not successful due to poor pacing) attempts at emotional scenes, and the scene where Glenn goes Grammar Nazi on students to show just how convoluted magic can really be. I\'ll start by going rapid fire on a few dumb things from episodes 1 and 2. Still, prepare to be here a while, the story segment takes up a vast majority of the review since there is a lot I need to say here.Why does Celica threaten Glenn to get him to work at this school despite knowing that he is beyond unqualified and that he hates magic? Is it because she just wants him to get a job and if he a deadbeat regardless of whether or not he is remotely qualified, because if so, that\'s stupid (since she needs to make sure he is at least remotely qualified for his job). The series checks out one important trite bullshit (aka bad cliché) from the list really early with a scene where the flatter student (Sistine) helped the big-tits student (Rumia), but here, it\'s portrayed in such a sexual manner to the point where in other series, they are still sexual harassment despite teasing, this is easily a more blatantly disgusting and uncomfortable act of sexual harassment that sent out of its way to be as horrid as possible (partially since it made me hate the Sistine, one of the main characters, by the first episode, the episode where we are supposed to be sold on these characters).The entirety of episode 2 felt like it should\'ve been stretched out over multiple episodes given how here is a small time skip in the middle of episode 2 after Glenn reaches the importance of grammar in changing magic, and how much is packed into this episode story-wise. In order of appearance: Glenn starts the episode same as before, he goes so far into dissing magic that Sistine slaps him and leaves in tears, each character has an emotional moment before Glenn realizes how little students truly know about magic besides one particular method for each spell, he schools them, then his students like him, he has then made progress and is now infinitely more passionate about work, we go back and reaffirm that there is a moment in which Rumia was saved by presumably Glenn (we even see the hair color, and in episode 1, she looks familiar to him, but this isn\'t spaced or enough to feel organic or that it would take a little while for us to really explore this point without coming up with the answer so early into the show), and then terrorists. All of this should\'ve been episodes 3, 4, and even 5. I mean it. We could\'ve just done the same shenanigans and have episode 2 end on the moment where Sistine slaps Glenn and walks off in tears, then episode 3 have an emotional episode that shows us another side of our (at the time) 3 important characters while showing us that terrorists are soon to some before at the end, he busts out some knowledge on the students, then episode 4 not only shows us how much all of this is working out while at the same time showing us that he is actually becoming happier overall while doing this, but then the episode brings us back to that moment where we see him and Rumia interact before we learn that she was saved by someone who looks suspiciously like Glenn, and then it ends on terrorists moving in. Episodes 5 and 6 would be a bunch of terrorists raising hell in the school and then Glenn, and all students and teachers fight back in a mini war arc, by editing the final few minutes of episode 2 where terrorists show up and turning that into episode 5, and editing some of the intrusive comedy of episode 3 and making it episode 6.. There, I just vastly improved the show just by taking episode 2 stretching it out, and adding and editing parts as I went along,like making episode 3 episode 6. If only the writer was this capable.The moment that made this show awful beyond redemption was the attempted rape scene. Let me set the scene. Terrorists have just captured Rumia who turned out to be a former princess but her family was killed and she escaped (hence why she said she was saved by someone before terrorists would\'ve killed her). Sistine is alone in a room, and a terrorist walks in. He then begins to toy with her, saying that people like her are surprisingly and deliciously fragile while pinning her down and slowly undressing her. Then, Glenn walks in and it turns from trite to actively offensively terrible. In the midst of a scene of attempted rape, Glenn walks in, pays no mind, and lackadaisical comedy ensues for like 40 seconds! WHAT THE FLYING FUCK IS THIS SHIT?!?! A character is in the verge of getting rape, and the supposed “hero” who busts in not only doesn\'t recognize the situation, but acts all lazy! Needless to say, this moment made this show practically impossible to redeem. When SAO can treat this kind of scene with infinitely more tact than this show can, in regards to content and tone, you know we have a problem here! Sure, eventually Glenn saves her, but then we get the rest of the scene.Glenn busts out this arcana card which nullifies all magic (especially opponents’ and enemies” magic). This is a very generic magic for an MC to have, and it\'s giving me Mahouka flashbacks as if the school terrorism thing didn\'t do that already. Glenn just busts out an arcana card unceremoniously and explains what it does in his usual lackadaisical tone (tired of me using that word yet?). This is the first time we see this kind of magic card in the series, adding to the already surpassingly convoluted magic system of this world, so at least the show could do is unveil it with grandeur. Even Mahouka did that right! Whatever, a badly animated curb stomp commences in which Glenn wins, and episode 2 ends. As you can no doubt tell, the rape attempt scene should\'ve never happened and in my version above, it never would.Actually, there are a few things in episode 3 I would alter, since it\'s not a great episode either (I mean, what did you expect from this show). I think the worst thing this episode does is prove that this crock of shit had potential, potential that it, predictably, squandered. I mean, Glenn was a mate killer, so that could\'ve been explored and built up a bit better since before then, the only buildup was him saying magic kills people. In this episode, I would edit out the numerous and always monotonous self-justification for what someone is about to do exposition dumps there always last for around 30 seconds, some of the intrusive comedy of the first 6 minutes, and do one last crucial thing in the last few minutes of the episode. Remember how Professor Huey apparently left (hence why they have a sub) prior to the events of episode 1? Well, here he is again, but has no exposed motivations for being here, and he just stands there, saying that it\'s a game to see if Glenn can free Rumia from a bunch of magic circles, so, none of that makes any real sense. He needs a reason for doing this, and why he is treating this like a game. Also, at the end, they completely gloss over what Rumia’s true name as princess was Eruminia, and I don\'t know why. This also confirms that yes, Glenn was the one that unknowingly saved her. It\'s a shame that one of the most potentially interesting hook questions about the series was dealt with only 3 episodes in out of 12.I\'m not going to go or if my way to really break down the rest of the episodes since that would take fucking forever and I\'m already spending a lot of time doing rapid fire on a few problems per episode while fixing the series as a whole. But now, we reach the tournament arc, starting with episode 4, so time for me to keep doing what I\'ve been doing. The queen is still the mother of Rumia but apparently everyone was killed but her. Why did she pronounce her daughter dead after the terrorists came? What actually happened? Did terrorists simply kidnap her from everyone? Has the school heard nothing about the Queen? What about the dad/king?The other thing is that we are suddenly introduced to what all of the students can do during the beginning of this tournament arc via a pep talk from Glenn. Want to know how to have made this moment work. Have it so that when the terrorists showed up, they all do what we would hear them being capable of, that what this moment would be actually gratifying since by then we would\'ve known a bit about all the students and then have epic realization that Glenn was exactly right since that what they did in that hypothetical. This has been another round of me improving the series. In fact, the actual tournament section in episode 4 could\'ve been 2, maybe even 3 whole episodes in order to make an interesting tournament arc up until the next episode (specifically, 7-9 on my version), since there are so many games that are glossed over since most students are not important. Hell, even before that, we saw a typical asshole vs underdog rivalry set up with Harley and his class vs Glenn and his, and then it would be gratifying and exciting to see both groups compete and Glenn’s class do well on each of these events. This has been another round of me making a better series out of the pieces this one failed to put together. Also, the asspull of Rumia winning her round because the big buff guy suddenly blacked out for no reason was infuriating, and the fact that it came after a rushed and stupid bit of her teammates telling her to quit since they “care for her” despite her being in no peril and her wanting to do this, is especially galling. When both The Asterisk War and Fairy Tail can make a better tournament arc, then your arc is shit, and by extension, you\'re shit!Episodes 5 and 6, barring a few really dumb moments (as per usual), are probably the best in the series, as little as that says about them. The comedy is still pretty miss for me but not only are there a few genuinely sweet moments like Glenn’s conversation with Rumia I episode 5 and her true reunion with her mother at the end of episode 6, but also, the way Glenn defeats the villain of this arc is actually pretty intelligent and entertaining, reminding me of some of the most popular protagonists in anime like Lelouch from Code Geass, Light from Death Note, and Sora from No Game No Life. Still, time to fix ‘em. I\'ll give this series a compliment when it deserves one; it\'s already like...96:0 in problems (and you get a cookie if you get where that reference came from). The way to make it better this time is simple, and it builds from the last fixing I did: actually juggle the rescue attempt and the tournament matches equally and flesh them both out, that way we have all of the emotional payoffs actually pay off (at least if you give each scene enough space), and so that we can actually enjoy the tournament side of the arc, and have that whole thing from episodes 5 and 6 take up 3 more episodes (10-12 in my version) while removing some of the fake out comedy, taking away the explosion speeches about “me saying why I\'m doing what I\'m doing”, removing the dere moments Sistine has with her teacher (I get that he is 19 but still it\'s sorta creepy for a student to have a hunted romantic interest in her teacher) and altering the ending where the students spend all his money to him actually treating them with some of his money, that way nothing about any of the arcs each character went through get cheapened upon rewatch and hindsight (namely Glenn’s). Also, have more animation in the arc since this series doesn\'t really have much actual character animation.See? It\'s simple. If we create a brand new episode 1 from scratch to replace this episode 1 and take all of the ideas I brought up that modify these episodes, we could\'ve had an actually good series on our hands since despite all of the LN trope bullshit, awful comedy moments that ruin certain scenes, and a few other things, all the pieces were there for the first 6 episodes to be a good 1 cour series. The other 6 on the other hand...yeah, I haven\'t been really living up to my promise of tone, and these episodes are gonna change that; they are that bad...*sigh* Episode 7 is where things go back to being abysmal instead of just bad, partially due to almost half of it being a cliché beach episode and the irritating comedy, partially due to the character Re=L (make your Ergo Proxy joke elsewhere). She is such a bad character, and it is the impetus of the arc and why it\'s horrible. Her heel turn is insanely telegraphed and still incredibly forced, being out of jealously in episode 7 about the fact that the deuteragonist females are quote unquote “stealing Glenn away from her”, and because she is just a double agent who likes her dead brother who she saw again (which means he was revived, which is a major plot point in the arc, revival) in episode 8, while the rest of episode 8 before that is just the introduction of revival, one of the villains of the previous arc showing up and being a crazy bitch, and Re=L moving around and being an insufferable bitch. Fuck this arc in its entirety. Oh, and she nearly kills Glenn because of this and badly injures Rumia. When you consider that up to this point, she had been trying to kill Glenn (or at least she attacks him as greeting and always wants to settle a score with him) and the fact that she genuinely talked of the fact that she had a lot of fun with the people she immediately afterwards hated) and the fact that she had just been a generic deadpan loli character, this sudden turn is infuriatingly stupid and forced. The 9th episode is just as bad honestly, and they rushed the shit out of a villain death and the backstory Re=L has can\'t redeem her in the slightest. Also, the main blue-haired villain of the arc was wasted in the fact that there is a malicious character named Reiner, but this guy was just some random who wasn\'t connected with anything and is just a “bad person who does bad things because villain” character. I literally have no way to really remotely fix this arc; it was dead on arrival.But now, we finally reach the final arc. It is one of the stupidest story arcs I have ever seen in my life, if not the absolute dumbest and most wince-worthy of them all. Here is the main plot of arc 4: Some creepy teacher guy continually confesses to Sistine and after Glenn overheard him dissing her dream, he puts on this front about wanting to marry her for money, and it all becomes a pissing match, except between teachers over a student. Fucking creepy! It\'s beyond stupid a premise given the age ranges (adult and teenager), and given how this is the impetus on having another evil protagonist bent on using Rumia for some scheme, you\'d think this wouldn\'t exist and that they\'d find a less disgusting way for this to happen. The sub plot is about Glenn suddenly realizing that Sistine looks like Sera, a now dead girl he once loved before he left the Imperial Corps, and that now angel dusts addicts (I wish they meant the real life Angel Dust drug) are dying, even a year after that substance was said to have been eradicated. All of these have no right of intertwining with the main (disgusting and wince-worthy) plot of the arc. Also, Re=L is off scot free after the betrayal (did she not ever get arrested for treason for that whole thing in the previous arc?), just to add on to what an irredeemable crock of shit this final arc is! Then, the finale. Oh boy. It\'s probably the most generic episode in the entire show. Turns of there was another traitor that posed as Leo\'s after he killed him part-way into episode 11, and the only thing resolved is the immediately inserted grudge match between the two. I don\'t even have the energy to go into any depth with this one, it\'s just generic and bleh, as if the show is not even trying to hide it\'s true colors anymore. Serves it right.You know, if the narrative wasn\'t so shit in the way that it was, Glenn might have been an actually good character. Think about it: a cynic gave up his pursuit of being a hero of justice after the lives he took and lost now teaches the very thing he hates against his will while growing attached to his students despite everything. Despite what a radical shift in personality he has from past to present, if the writing did how I laid out above, he could\'ve been a pretty good character, assuming they toned down the perviness completely and just made him cynical and partially lazy instead of basically a cross of Archer from UBW and Kazuma from Konosuba. I also like how he is an LN protagonist who isn\'t very overpowered, but that\'s not enough to save him from this awful writing. Celica is a hot and haughty woman who is basically never capable of being there since she’s so overpowered that the narrative wouldn\'t throw a challenge unless they restrain her or just keep her or entirely beforehand. What I like about her is some of her almost motherly nature towards Glenn, like how she threatens Harvey for dissing him in her presence, even if the whole blackmail job thing was nonsense. Now, for the actual named side-characters with relevance outside of just one arc since I\'m not even gonna cover the antagonists (partially since I kinda already did in as much detail as they deserve, barring one who I\'ll get to), nor will I cover small characters like the queen mother or the annoying parents of Sistine.Sistine is a nightmare for her archetype. She aggressively checks out all of the boxes of a bad and cliché tsundere and does it in a way that makes her especially obnoxious. The fact that she has this dynamic with a teacher makes me even more grossed out (regardless of both the nonsensical age dynamic and partially because nothing about this is brought up). She\'s also absurdly useless, to the point that this is a legitimate plot point that carries throughout each arc until she finally does one thing right in the finale. Rumia is basically a typical dere-dere of the group who is basically the MacGuffin for all of the arcs in this show. I\'ve already talked about why Re=L is such a shit character so I\'ll cover one more: Albert. He’s the stoic badass of the bunch whose hunch is always right, so there’s not much to say on him. Lastly, why don\'t we talk about Leos? He is such a shitty character. He apparently had been asking Sistine our since they were kids and not only has he not let go of that, he has gone pathetic over it despite coming off as a decent person (typical of this trope), but again, the whole teacher and student bit makes it worse, and the fact that ha managed to spend only a paltry evening to be able to decipher everything about Glenn, Re=L, and Rumia is absurd, though it turns out it was this Justine guy from episode 11 who is just another evil LN bad guy for LN bad guy sake villain, since literally every single antagonist in this show is the exact same. They turned a crap and generic character into something creepier and stupider and then replaced him with the exact same character as every other villain in this retarded ass show; how typical! So yeah, that\'s everyone relevant. What a shit cast, am I right? As if the wasted potential as generic characters weren\'t bad enough, they reuse the same bad guy personality and have some truly horrible characters thrown into the mix. Let’s move on before I die of embarrassment.The audiovisuals aren\'t much better than the writing, unfortunately. Part of the problem this time isn\'t that the show is badly animated per se, but that its animation insanely limited. Its own damn OP has about as much animation as a typical episode of this show, and there are plenty of reused clips, like the clip of Albert pulling Re=L’s hair or Sistine blasting Glenn with wind, and the slew of reused clips are reused at an insane rate with no remote variation. Hell, even the fight scenes have little animation, especially the one in episode 2 when Glenn beats up the attempted rapist. I initially couldn\'t stand the color palette but I got used to it. I already mentioned how awful the uniforms are so no need to repeat that. There is minimal (albeit terribly some CGI though it\'s blink and you miss it), but did there also have to be minimal animation too? Oh well, at least I like the eyes (they remind me of the trademark Studio White Fox eyes) and some of the admittedly humorous facial expressions.The OP, ""Blow out"" by Konomi Suzuki is a pretty generic (if somewhat catchy) OP that feels like it should be part of a generic fantasy adventure anime, not a generic school battle anime with fantasy elements thrown in there. The ED, ""Precious You☆"" by Sistine Fibel (Akane Fujita), Rumia Tingel (Yume Miyamoto), Re=L Rayford (Ari Ozawa) is absurdly MediocRE that I never bothered listening to the entire minute and thirty second ED. The OST is decent in its own right but honestly feels misplaced here in the same vein as the OP in terms of where it feels more suitable, even despite the darker tone the series boasts on about half of the episodes.The dub is probably one of the worst dubs Funimation has produced in recent memory. Next to none of the voices even remotely fit the characters and sound like they\'d fit completely different sounding roles, like Monica Rial as Rumia and Josh Grelle as Glenn, but the absolute worst offender here is Sistine, played by Rachael Messer, whose acting not only sounds miscast, but at times, bad in its own right. The tertiaries and antagonist roles aren\'t good either, and some of them were doomed to be inferior (like Re=L since it\'s much harder for a dub to pull off a loli voice), and the only voice I sort of see working is Morgan Garrett as Celica. Then again, dubs have been getting worse in recent years, so I guess this is to be expected.Needless to say, I hate this show. I hate it so damn much. I only found one joke funny since it was the only one that wasn\'t predictable as shit, and that was in the very first episode. Any potential the story or characters had ended up being squandered rather quickly, which is frustrating since the first 6 episodes could\'ve actually been pretty good had they removed the bullshit elements and made it a 12 episode series that fleshed these episodes out, though the last 6 are beyond terrible and impossible to redeem. Then again, the show lost any path to actual redemption during the rape attempt scene where they treat it with so little tact that there is comedy in the already drawn out scene. The lack of animation made the fights pretty dull as well, and a lot of the characters, namely Sistine and Re=L were infuriating to no end. There are times when a show offends me with how terrible it is, but when it happens more than once, let alone up to 5 times, that\'s when we know that the show is dogshit and that I\'m in for a terrible experience.When I wasn\'t aggravated to some degree, whether it be mild or insane, I was pretty bored since the action was mediocre and the comedy didn\'t stick with me at all, and a lot of the awful LN school battle harem tropes are here in full display, sometimes taken to the most disgusting degrees possible to the point where I almost wanted to vomit. Also, the final arc is one of the most wince-worthy pieces of animation I have ever had the displeasure of witnessing as if arc 3 didn\'t piss me off enough to the point where the show went back from being bad but salvageable to irredeemable and truly abysmal again. Shame really, since the second arc was actually somewhat enjoyable at times and has the most potential to be good. So yeah, I\'m basically repeating myself at this point so let’s just move on to the final thoughts.You know, it\'s almost cute to know that this show thinks it can get away with being typical trash that gives LNs a bad name just by adding more comedy, disgusting elements, and an occasionally bleak tone and more blood. It pretends to not be exactly like its brethren but does all of the same awful things you\'d expect a show like this to do, only with a tinge of extra putridness. When there\'s a good idea, it\'s gleefully ruined, and the comedy is more predictable than a generic shounen anime. I\'ve already spoken ad nauseam about basically everything wrong with the show and I\'m basically repeating myself, but yeah, suffice it to say, this is one of the worst anime I\'ve seen all year. Hopefully, this is a lesson to all of you that even among shows like this, there are still standards that some of them can meet and surpass their contemporaries, and that we don\'t just have absurd standards that only value high art. Also, hopefully you realize why this show is such a trap that you shouldn\'t fall for. This show scores disgustingly low compared to its peers. Well, with all that said, I bid you adieu.', 'Rokudenashi is an unfortunate case of ""what could have been"".I\'ll try to keep this relatively concise and straight-to-the-point: Rokudenashi had the potential to be a modern version of Great Teacher Onizuka. While it has an overused magic academy premise, unlike most battle harems, the protagonist here is actually the teacher of one of its classes, and he is also a huge troll. Just like Onizuka, Glenn Radars is largely incompetent at normal teacher duties, preferring to let his students have self-study sessions all the time instead of having to put any effort in. However, he also has a lot of talent in other areas, especially...concerning unorthodox magic usage. What Glenn lacks inside the classroom he makes up outside of it, and his trollish interactions with his students is the main selling point of the anime.As a result, the first episode or two of Rokudenashi are very funny and entertaining, and show a lot of promise for the show as a whole. But unfortunately, from there on out it slowly starts to decline. Starting in episode three, the anime starts introducing actual outside villains and a much more serious story starts taking over as the main focus of the show instead of the previously light-hearted comedy theme. And sadly this is a big loss, because the majority of the show ended up becoming a rather generic action/fantasy light novel adaptation mixed with some drama as a result, featuring a somewhat overpowered MC and his sidekick heroines fighting a bunch of cheap bad guys with some rather uninteresting ulterior motives. In other words, the kind of anime you\'ve seen dozens of times over already. It\'s not terrible but it\'s just extremely average when it\'s doing this, and considering how promising the show seemed to be at first, it feels like such a huge waste of potential. Sure, the magic system in this universe is pretty interesting and well-designed, but that doesn\'t actually end up amounting for much when the overall plot itself is so uninspiring.The one thing that is still pretty good about Rokudenashi in the end though is the character cast. As mentioned already, Glenn is a pretty huge troll on top of being a good magic duelist, and overall he is a pretty likable protagonist, especially by harem MC standards. And yes I do think Rokudenashi should be called a harem even if it isn\'t currently labeled as one on MAL; while there aren\'t any public romantic themes, the vast majority of the supporting cast is female and it\'s pretty clear that most of them are very attached to Glenn. This is especially clear in the case of Fibel Sistine, who I guess would have to be considered the main heroine if you have to pick one, and who is also a skilled and clever magician, albeit a bit naïve and dishonest at times, and she\'s also extremely pretty if you ask me. Her verbal arguments with Glenn are always a treat to watch.Overall, Rokudenashi is still a pretty decent anime with generally likable characters and good chemistry in-between them, but it\'s also unfortunately dragged down quite a bit by its bland and generic storyline. It\'s hard to not be bothered by the feeling that it could have been so much better still had it just gone down a different direction plot-wise. But compared to most magic academy battle harems out there, this is still probably one of the better ones all things considered, even though I doubt I\'d go out of my way to actively recommend it to people in the future. Though if you don\'t care too much about the story and you just want to see a fun and intelligent protagonist goofing around with a bunch of cute and likable girls then you\'ll be hard-pressed to find anything better.Oh and by the way, Rokudenashi probably has the best female school uniforms I\'ve ever seen in anime. Say what you want about the show itself, but hot damn those exposed bellies, miniskirts and garter belts are sexy as hell.

Sure, it isn't a totally unique anime by any means, but I still believe that something doesn't have to be unique to be great.  Especially since almost everything can be average or close to it if everyone broke down every show to a simpler form.  I'm sure even acclaimed works can be average if you approach them with a mind set of breaking the story into simpler aspects.  Well, before I start rambling too much, I love Akashic Records.  I'm not sure if this or Re:Creators takes my top spot for the...season, but either way, they are my top 2.The story isn't the most unique, but it was really fun to watch.  It's suppose to be that Sisitine discovering some of the mysteries about the floating sky castle,  or at least it sounded that way at first;  I realize after reading the description again  that what I assumed was never the case and I just misread it.  So, it's actually more of what you would expect from a magic school anime, with some unique parts mixed in together.  The students favorite teacher leaves and is replaced by Glenn Radars, a very lazy and sarcastic professor, yet capable at the same time.  He doesn't show his skills at first though and he actually beaten by Sistine when they dual in the first episode, I believe it was.  His students realize they don't know nearly as much as they think they do, once Glenn starts teaching them all the ways to alter a simple shock bolt spell that they never knew was possible.   Pretty quickly, dark forces/ people lurking within the empire they live start showing up Glenn, Sistine, Rumia, and the others start being caught in all these traps as they arise.  Rumia is the damsel in distress many times, but it's more due to her past than just being a pretty girl people capture in order to use for stupid reason;  it's not completely ok that her abilities and past lead to her having that role, but it seemed to serve more of a purpose than just we need a girl captured type of thing, to me anyway.   As Glenn's past, Rumia's, even a little bit of Sistine's, all get revealed, the story just got more and more interesting.  It will probably feel like a dull story if you're not more than an average/ are a below average fan of magic battle shows.  In addition to these elements,  I'd also say it's like a story of growth between Glenn and his students.  His students bring out his better side and vice versa.  There's also a ton of funny moments through the plot and you just need a good comedy sometimes.  I'll give a 9/10 here, but I'm also a huge fan of magic battle shows.The art is probably the most controversial part of the anime.  I love the character designs, detailed background scenes, detailed magic circles and move displays, etc.  The animation was actually really fluid too for the most part with some pauses and re-start ups, but that could've just been due to my computer and the settings I had up on crunchyroll.  I personally find the designs to be extremely memorable.  The weird school outfits (the controversial part) definitely help with this.  I'll admit they are weird, but they do help the character designs stand out.  Another personal 9.The sound is rather great too.  The music scores just felt like they had a slightly different tune to them than other magic battle scores.  The same goes for the opening and ending themes.  They may seem typical, but I'd say that they sound different and actually stand out as great songs.  I consider them among some of the better ones I've heard and each of them is pretty high up on my favorites.  I'll give the sound a 9.5/10 since both theme songs are among the best ones of the genre, in my book.  Precious You is my favorite ending theme of the spring 2017 season.The characters are more of the love them or hate them kind of group, or at the like them or don't like them kind.  I don't see there being many in between opinions.  Glenn may be there to almost always save the day, but he sure as hell doesn't feel like a self insert.  I don't think a self-insert would be so snarky, lazy, have a dark past, and mess around as much as he does.  His personality just doesn't fit the self insert criteria to me, and he's a great protagonist, in my book.  Sisitine is a tsundere, but she doesn't seem like the typical one that acts out all the time and tried really hard to hide their feelings for most of the show.  She does act out in the beginning, but she's grows more accepting of Glenn and lets her guard down a bit earlier than many tsunderes do.  She also has a pretty strong sense of responsible and the will to fulfill her dream without taking drastic measures to do so.  I'd rather just leave my thought focused on the main two, and let the readers see the others for themselves.  I found something to like and or love about every character in the series, especially Glenn and Sisitine.  I'll give another personal 9.I'll make my thought on my enjoyment very short.  I loved every minute of the anime and actually find some of it's weird aspects that are considered stupid and appalling by others to be parts of the show that make it stand out and put it at a high place among shows in the genre.  I'm giving a 10 here.  I'm also sorry that my review doesn't seem convincing, but I'd rather write it more for people who like the genre and are only a little hesitant to watch it rather than  to convince people who generally don't like these types of shows.

It looked like atleast avarage script: main storyline, a piece of mystery and unknown history of the characters.In the next episode I was feeling really sad about the development, the point of mystery has been revealed very fast - didn\'t have time to try and solve it by myself, storyline got worse - nothing more surprised me, new threads that has been introduced had less and less sense, it got dumber and some situations happened out of blue, without any backgrounds just appeared on the stage like a block of ice on a desert.Art:I can\'t say anything special about the art, it was nice, not bad.

Is he really...? This anime has a knack for throwing in (kind of) unexpected plot twists for comedic purposes. Glen Radars has more depth to him than meets the eye....The story follows him and his interactions with his students as he builds his pseudoharem--- wait what? What I meant to say was, “the story (supposedly) follows him as he builds a relationship with his students and helps them reach their full potential through his unconventional teaching methods”. However, you never know when tragedy might strike in this magical world, because there is always a hidden air of danger lurking in the shadows. Who is Glen Radars? Who are the students, really? Does any of that really matter? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this series.Reading the previous paragraph may make you believe that show is relatively serious, but, while it does have some pretty serious aspects,  the bulk of the show is more focused on comedy and magic. Some of this anime’s main selling points are largely related to its unexpected comedy. Often times this comedy happens between Glen Radars and the white haired girl, Sistine Fibel. It was a bit refreshing to see a pseudoharem rather than a real harem, which has overplayed over the past few years. Each of the main character students have their own hopes, dreams, and issues. Their issues are revealed more as the series progresses, and I believe that they were revealed at the proper pace. If you are not a fan of harem anime, you most likely won’t like this anime.Characters: 5/10The characters are probably the weakest aspect of this show. Generic archetypal side characters, generic main characters, the only real exceptions are Glen Radars and perhaps ReEl, who also happened to be my fav char in this anime. Sistine is presented as a very intelligent, dedicated student who will not stand for any teacher that disrespects magic and her right to learn. However, Gled Radars, being the lazy bastard that earned this anime its title, will not be broken so easily and forced to teach stripper students. The clashes between their personalities creates an interesting dynamic as the series progresses. Rumia Tingel is basically of your generic warm character that isn’t clumsy. ReEl comes off as kind of odd/aloof and ends up being all types of annoying/interesting in my opinion, but I’ll leave that up to decide after you watch because I can’t include any more information without spoilers~Art: 5/10The art in this anime is very basic. In comparison to more recent anime, the characters do not have a wide variety of facial expressions, the backgrounds aren’t too detailed, and the special effects aren't exactly the greatest either. The art is pretty average for a professional studio. Still frames, few dramatic camera angles, relatively low frame-rate. The art is really nothing special. However, the character designs may be appealing to a lot of guys. Especially so if you like garter belts, crop tops, and mini skirts. Other than that there’s really not much special about the art.Sound:6/10The music sounds like music that you would hear in the background of old TV advertisements, you know the ones that go, “But wait… THERE’S MORE! If you call now, we’ll DOUBLE the offer.” Yeah. It’s a bit of a change from most other anime out there and it’s kinda interesting. The characters were voiced pretty well. Though there wasn’t really anything too special about the voice acting either. There wasn’t a voice acting scene that stood out so much that it left an impact on its viewers. For example, if you search “When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace - I don't understand” on youtube, the first result will be a great example of great voice acting. There was nothing like that here.Enjoyment: 7/10I thought it was pretty good. It was a slight change of pace from a shitty and generic harem anime. Good enough for me. I could see myself recommending this to some anime fans of comedy and harem anime though.Overall:6/10It had its moments, it had it’s flaws. The story, at times, can actually be pretty serious. At other times relatively humorous and has some innuendos. It does a good job at balancing the comedy and humor, but the characters are pretty generic overall. That quality takes away from the story’s potential quite a bit. The music was TV ad background music and the voice acting was pretty average.Would I recommend this to you personally?If you’re a fan of harem anime, comedy, magic, romance, cute girls, ecchi, then go for it. It’s pretty decent.If you’re looking for something more serious, then you are definitely not in the right place buddy. The story follows him and his interactions with his students as he builds his pseudoharem--- wait what? What I meant to say was, “the story (supposedly) follows him as he builds a relationship with his students and helps them reach their full potential through his unconventional teaching methods”. However, you never know when tragedy might strike in this magical world, because there is always a hidden air of danger lurking in the shadows. Who is Glen Radars? Who are the students, really? Does any of that really matter? These are some of the questions that will be addressed in this series.Reading the previous paragraph may make you believe that show is relatively serious, but, while it does have some pretty serious aspects,  the bulk of the show is more focused on comedy and magic. Some of this anime’s main selling points are largely related to its unexpected comedy. Often times this comedy happens between Glen Radars and the white haired girl, Sistine Fibel. It was a bit refreshing to see a pseudoharem rather than a real harem, which has overplayed over the past few years. Each of the main character students have their own hopes, dreams, and issues. Their issues are revealed more as the series progresses, and I believe that they were revealed at the proper pace. If you are not a fan of harem anime, you most likely won’t like this anime.Characters: 5/10The characters are probably the weakest aspect of this show. Generic archetypal side characters, generic main characters, the only real exceptions are Glen Radars and perhaps ReEl, who also happened to be my fav char in this anime. Sistine is presented as a very intelligent, dedicated student who will not stand for any teacher that disrespects magic and her right to learn. However, Gled Radars, being the lazy bastard that earned this anime its title, will not be broken so easily and forced to teach stripper students. The clashes between their personalities creates an interesting dynamic as the series progresses. Rumia Tingel is basically of your generic warm character that isn’t clumsy. ReEl comes off as kind of odd/aloof and ends up being all types of annoying/interesting in my opinion, but I’ll leave that up to decide after you watch because I can’t include any more information without spoilers~Art: 5/10The art in this anime is very basic. In comparison to more recent anime, the characters do not have a wide variety of facial expressions, the backgrounds aren’t too detailed, and the special effects aren't exactly the greatest either. The art is pretty average for a professional studio. Still frames, few dramatic camera angles, relatively low frame-rate. The art is really nothing special. However, the character designs may be appealing to a lot of guys. Especially so if you like garter belts, crop tops, and mini skirts. Other than that there’s really not much special about the art.Sound:6/10The music sounds like music that you would hear in the background of old TV advertisements, you know the ones that go, “But wait… THERE’S MORE! If you call now, we’ll DOUBLE the offer.” Yeah. It’s a bit of a change from most other anime out there and it’s kinda interesting. The characters were voiced pretty well. Though there wasn’t really anything too special about the voice acting either. There wasn’t a voice acting scene that stood out so much that it left an impact on its viewers. For example, if you search “When Supernatural Battles Became Commonplace - I don't understand” on youtube, the first result will be a great example of great voice acting. There was nothing like that here.Enjoyment: 7/10I thought it was pretty good. It was a slight change of pace from a shitty and generic harem anime. Good enough for me.

Now,  bashing this anime for that would be very illogical, since the target audience is not the people that look for a good storyline, it's not the people that look for a lot of character development, and it's not the people that want to decode an anime in every single aspect. Therefore judging it on these factors does not make sense, so I will judge it based on it's intended audience, and based on the overall delivery.This anime is for...people that want to enjoy a bit of cliché, it is for the people that don't mind the slightly erotic schoolgirl uniforms and it is for the people that enjoy a bit of magical action thrown into the mix. Now don't get me wrong, it's not all fanservice, there is a plotline, there is some character development, but nothing that hasn't been done before, and like previously mentioned, these factors are irrelevant, due to the intended audience of this anime. The characters are likable, the MC is fairly unique in many aspects, with some character development, and decent backstory. We do explore a bit about the backgrounds of some of the students of the magic academy, and the characters that were previously associated with the MC, but obviously with there being only 12 episodes, you can't expect those to be very thorough or go into a lot of depth. The art is average, it is nothing that differentiates itself from the other anime, therefore it is not something I want to write about. The sound and music do help the story portray the different themes, and it does help the viewer understand the mood and the situation, although again, I'd say it's average.To conclude, I have enjoyed this anime for what it is, I think it has delivered what it aimed to deliver to it's intended audience, and in my opinion, it is a great anime to watch if you're looking for something to kill the time with. It also did well on keeping me intrigued, even though it's fairly predictable at times, at no point did I feel like not wanting to watch the next episode, probably due to the attachment I had to the characters, and the contrasting, complex character of Glenn's, the fact that he is not at all portrayed as a strong MC, and his creative solutions when it comes to problem-solving. So, I think if you do have some spare time, and you're looking for an anime that just wants to make you cheer up, laugh, and enjoy yourself, then do give Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, and personally, I would rate this anime as 7/10. people that want to enjoy a bit of cliché, it is for the people that don't mind the slightly erotic schoolgirl uniforms and it is for the people that enjoy a bit of magical action thrown into the mix.

I hope for a day where they will make a comedy-adventure (perhaps magic or demon including) anime, which DOES NOT rely on idiotic fanservice moments, with their predictable transfers, unnecessary shots etc. This started like a promising anime, but eh. Somehow there are always people gifted enough to ruin me some enjoyment.Also what\'s with this review system?... How come ""Decent"" accounts to the score 4 and ""Mediocre"" is for 5. Clearly they are misplaced. And...there is a supposed length for a review, yet no counters are displayed? How ridiculous.Man I sound so hateful. But in truth, I\'m just tired of people giving up on innovation. Started a bit different than your average anime, but somehow morphed into yet another ecchi-relying template. there is a supposed length for a review, yet no counters are displayed?

Started a bit different than your average anime, but somehow morphed into yet another ecchi-relying template.', 'Because magic is such a foreign concept grounded in the limits of one\'s imagination, the possibilities for stories based around magic are virtually limitless.  So what happens when you combine the concept of magic with an arcic harem setup?  Well you get this show.  Whoever thought this was a good show idea is a bastard for sure.Story: Glenn Radars is a man without any motivation for anything.  With his guardian, Celica, threatening him and forcing him to get off his ass to do something with his life, he ends up at the magic school that also serves as Celica\'s...workplace, and ultimately becomes a magic teacher much to his chagrin.Akashic Records is a very arc-heavy (or as I refer to as arcic) show.  The series itself is split into 4 arcs spanning roughly 3 episodes each, with the general focus of each episode being Glenn saving and involving himself with one of the three main girls in the series: Rumia, Re=L, and Sistina in that order.  General arc flow involves something evil plot relating to each of the three girls, things get dire, and Glenn saves the day.  Rinse, repeat, do it again.As a result, the story for Akashic Records becomes monotonous and quite predictable.  It\'s not bad per-say, as the presentation for each arc gives the audience some more world building and a better look into the mysterious past life of our main protagonist, but because each arc is just another rehash of a story setup done countless times, it\'s very hard to be invested in it, especially since each arc is so short and there\'s very little buildup before we end and move onto the next girl.Another problem I find is exposition.  In order to educate the audience about aspects of the magic concepts that they didn\'t know before, the show inputs heaps of exposition in various parts of the series from character introductions to new magic studies and research.  As a result, the flow of the series feels slightly choppy because we\'re given what\'s essentially a wall of text to tell us who this person is or what kind of magic that\'s being put at the forefront right now.  Doing this makes it clear that it\'s important to this section of the story (and nowhere else), so it just makes it all the more easier to know what\'s coming the audience\'s way.Overall, Akashic Records\'s story is average at best.  With a predictable arc-heavy setup as the formula for its story telling, the story ends up becoming very easy to guess and as such, relieves a lot of the built up tension the show attempt to create.  Not only that, but the \'Akashic Records\' that\'s in the title is barely even mentioned. Pretty sure it\'s the end-all be-all of the series, but since we only got a small bit of the whole story, the fact that we\'re led on that it plays a part kinda sucks.Overview:+/- Worldbuilding through exposition+/- Arc heavy storytelling-  Extremely predictable-  Very little tension despite alluding to itCharacters: You\'re either Glenn or the 3 main girls.  If you\'re not, you\'re unimportant.Glenn Radars is a cocky, selfish, self-congratulating bastard of a teacher.  (I mean the show is called \'Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor\' in translation after all.)  As a character, Glenn plays the duality of roles of being the series\'s main asshole, as well as the show\'s secret badass.  Haunted by a past that he doesn\'t like talking about (Cause everyone has one of those), Glenn\'s character changes as the series goes along from a jerkface to someone who genuinely thinks positively of being a magic instructor while at the same time, fixing all of the series\'s conflicts because ""I\'M THE MAIN PROTAGONIST"" and because he wants to be a \'mage of justice\'.  (Archer would like to talk to you btw.)  While the characterization is nice, it\'s how easy all of the problems are solved which is the problem.  As mentioned before, Glenn solves literally all of the conflicts that this series has, and as a result, makes the show very predictable and kinda lackluster.  There\'s not any serious loss that the series shows us on-screen, so any potential weight that the show might have dissipates because the main character is always there to say the day.Then there\'re the three girls: Rumia, Re=L, and Sistina, better known as the kind, understanding girl, the kuudere loli, and your typical tsundere.  As far as personalities go, this is about the extent that these girls have.  While true we do get a better idea of them and their past as a result of the show devoting an entire arc of equal length and time to each of them beyond their devoted arc, they don\'t really do or get anything.  If anything, they sink back into the background while the one currently in front gets the spotlight and their respective damsel in distress story.  Oh yeah, they also really like making at least Rumia a damsel in distress.  It\'s actually really annoying considering she\'s the only girl of the 3 that\'s even slightly annoying sometimes.The rest of the cast involves members of the imperial mage corps (who barely get any screentime), some other teachers in the magic school, one-off villains who you won\'t really remember cause they get defeated so quickly that we\'re already on the next arc, and the rest of Glenn\'s class who\'re only there to...be a class of students.  These characters are only there to make some kind of meaning or worth to the conflicts that the series presents or \'expand\' the world in a way that it feels like there\'re more people that\'re important than there really are.  Also, the evil organization known as the \'Researchers of Divine Wisdom\' that the show says are scary, really aren\'t?  I mean obviously they\'re just building their resources or knowledge up for the series finale, but the lack of tension really makes it hard to see them, frankly anyone, as a threat.Overview:+ Some characterization for the main cast-  Main girls really are just tropes beyond their arc-  Side characters are just screen fodderArt: Produced by Lidenfilms, the art for Akashic Records is...standard.  The art itself doesn\'t stand out that much, as everything looks like a brightly colored show that\'s slightly muted in its color palette.  Action is semi-fluid only because of the varying shots they use to choreograph the fights, but most of it is just magic blasting out of their hands after they spend 5 second chanting.  The magic circles however are nice and detailed, so that\'s a nice little detail they do consistently.My biggest complaint with the art however is the design of the school uniforms, particularly the female uniforms.  I know it\'s there for fanservice, but dear lord the girls look more like strippers than students of a magic academy.  With skirts shorter than hotpants, straps just wrapping their abdomen and lower body, and different gloves on each hand, the design for the female uniform in particular is just a clunky, incohesive design that\'s only there to make up for the lack of bath scenes or other classic fanservice moments that the show lacks.  I just...don\'t like it.  (And it doesn\'t help when the male uniform is completely covered and everything.)Overview:+/- Art is standard fare-  Terrible, terrible uniform design.Sound: The sound for Akashic Records is nothing special.  The OP, ""Blow Out"" is an action song that starts out sounding interesting, but quickly turns into any other high energy song that many other shows have.  It\'s honestly quite good, but it just doesn\'t have anything unique about it to make it neither special nor memorable in the sense that you\'d want to listen to it over and over again.Its ED, ""Precious You"" shares the same problem.  Sung by the girls\' seiyuus, the song is a cheerful and bright song that while sounds good, really has nothing great going for it.  Its only real draw is the fact that it\'s the seiyuus singing it, but that\'s about it.  Overall, the soundtrack just suffers by not being anything special or unique, resulting in a decent, but not fantastic OST.Overview:+/- Average soundtrack that\'s not really memorablePersonal Enjoyment: While currently at the time of this review, Akashic records is one of the more popular anime this season, this show just...doesn\'t really do a lot for me.  I\'ve seen this plot, this concept, and many aspects of it time and time again, and seeing it again with another coat of paint on is just really, really dull.  I don\'t hate this show, as nothing about it is really aggravating, but nothing about it makes me want to give a damn.  Oh, there\'s a conspiracy...oh no...a hidden fiancé we didn\'t know about appears...oh dear...what\'re we gonna do...Did I like this series?Not...particularly.  I read some of the source material, so I ended up watching this.  There\'re far worse things out there, but I didn\'t really find any specific enjoyment while watching this.What didn\'t I like about this series?If anything, it\'s the fact that Rumia was a damsel in distress character.  She doesn\'t come off as one, but since the series knows that she\'s super important, they relegate her to that role.  It\'s not fun seeing a character become a damsel, so if anything, that\'d be something about this show I hate.Would I recommend this series?If you\'re looking to kill time or for a magic show without much investment, than Akashic Records suits the bill.

But even so, I am still disappointed. The story is average and unoriginal. Filled with dozens of cliche moments, this one is far from impressive.After episode 10, I\'m still wondering what the big idea actually is, where this series is going to, and if it even has an actual plot. The story lacks coherence with no central line whatsoever. They just keep adding new enemies one after another. I was just hoping they had brought up the actual premise much sooner, if there is even one. There\'s mention about Sistine...searching for some kind of magical secret or whatever, the rest is still unknown. There are also Rumia and Re:L, two other main girls from this anime who have their own troublesome family and background. My question is: What is the bigger picture? This is the kind of series that can\'t do without.All characters especially these three girls seem forgettable. They are too plain and passive, none of them really stands out. They tend to stay helpless until it\'s time for MC to save them.Speaking of MC which is for me the worst part of this show, I find him detestable.An apathetic, good-for-nothing MC suddenly starts changing his character drastically just after episode 2. He looked extremely weak and incompetent at first, but that\'s not what he really is. He actually is a skilled magician, who is also a compassionate person deep inside his heart. But I just don\'t buy it. It looks like a cheap way to make MC likable, and it doesn\'t work.They tried too hard to make MC stand out and as the result MC becomes annoying as hell. Don\'t you hate it when a loser suddenly pops up conveniently at the right time and steals the show. He is a show-off, put it that way. A self-conceited hero wannabe who comes to save the day, spouting some shallow moral-enhancing speech forgetting that he is a crook himself. He must be the most hypocrite bastard I\'ve ever seen. I just want to see him gets beaten to a pulp, but sadly that won\'t happen. He can defeat his enemies easily, not because he is too strong but because all of them are brain-dead weaklings who would fall for the most simple trick and get knocked out with a single punch.I also hate it when they add those ridiculous ""touching moments"" in the end of every episode where MC gets recognition for his works, which make me wanna throw up so badly. I just had a good time badmouthing this abominable MC, but even he has some good points. His outfit looks simple yet cool. I like the character design. The same can be said about the girls. Their uniforms look cute on them.----The last two episodes are no different. They get to the final showdown where MC and his girl confront the main villain. It\'s cliche af and you know which side will win in the end.Then finally it\'s finished, leaving too many questions unanswered. Hell, there\'s not even ONE answered question. Maybe they save it for season 2.. or 3, I don\'t know.So, the art, animation, and sound are decent. The rest is really bad.I hate this anime, but sometimes it\'s good to have something to hate.

He can defeat his enemies easily, not because he is too strong but because all of them are brain-dead weaklings who would fall for the most simple trick and get knocked out with a single punch.I also hate it when they add those ridiculous ""touching moments"" in the end of every episode where MC gets recognition for his works, which make me wanna throw up so badly. I just had a good time badmouthing this abominable MC, but even he has some good points. His outfit looks simple yet cool. I like the character design. The same can be said about the girls. Their uniforms look cute on them.----The last two episodes are no different. They get to the final showdown where MC and his girl confront the main villain. It\'s cliche af and you know which side will win in the end.Then finally it\'s finished, leaving too many questions unanswered. Hell, there\'s not even ONE answered question. Maybe they save it for season 2.. or 3, I don\'t know.So, the art, animation, and sound are decent. The rest is really bad.I hate this anime, but sometimes it\'s good to have something to hate. I can\'t wait for season 2.', ""I have seen videos about this anime so i decided to give it a try and i wasn't dissapointed.I realy enjoyed interesting plot twisted with good humor and characters were so well performed that i couldn't decide which of them i liked the most.The biggest disadventage was forced plot in late episodes and unfinished plot line.Overall+Good and interesting plot line+Lots of humor+Characters have really interesting stories and are well performed+There are a lot of moments where we see our characters from diffrent angles-Plot is forced in last episodes-Some characters are just background and they have no inpact to the storyGod I hope season 2 will...come out soon come out soon"", ""Because do not be fooled, the first episode is absolutely AWFUL. The cast is uninteresting and full of tropes, the motivation is stupid, the magic is mediocre to look at, the ecchi feels like it was included as an afterthought (yeah, yeah, just make all the girls in the school wear 50% less clothes for no reason) and the main character is pathetic at best... Until you get to the second episode. This is by far the best example of how NOT to start your show, but holy crap if it doesn't change its tune for episode two. I'm actually mad that the author undersold...his own work so bad right off the bat. Especially since the approach this show takes to magic is actually really interesting once they dive into it.Episode two feels like the beginning of something great. It cuts a lot of the bullshit and has some much darker (even somewhat disturbing) content, as well as a lot of hints and explanations for each character's motivation and attitude. The classic stuck up rich girl gets a logical and even somewhat heartwarming reason for why she takes magic and her education so seriously. The typical nice girl gets a darker albeit cliche past, and the teacher gets fleshed out into a real, likeable character. There's still a lot of show to go, and obviously there are some growing pains, but I genuinely think it will be worth keeping up with if the second episode is any indication of things to come. his own work so bad right off the bat.

May they be a classmate, work colleague or a friend of a friend, a certain someone will just appear out of nowhere and make you instantly despise them. It\'s an unspoken rule that we can\'t like everyone we meet, but the individuals that grind your gears to a state of disrepair are the unforgivable worst of the worst.Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor is pretty much about the second half of the title. A new teacher joins Alzano Imperial Magic Academy, and he\'s a bastard. Big surprise. You\'d...expect a kind of School Comedy with maybe some Action thrown in since they are learning Magic, but Akashic Records decides to give us much more. Too much. The story jumps from arc to arc, which all follow the same boring predictable formula. Obvious villain appears, (like come on could you be any more conspicuous?) pull out some cliches, Glenn and co proclaim their friendship and love as teacher and students, defeat villain. Sure the try and explore some of the main characters and add some suspense inducing drama, but they just fail at keeping us invested or entertained most of the time.Our main character, Glenn, is a bastard, or at least he tries to be. His act is so forced due to the fact that he\'s actually a decent person, he just chooses to hide behind his trope shield so the premise of the anime doesn\'t become irrelevant. The other two mains, Sistine Fibel and Rumia Tingel. aren\'t much better. One is a tsundere and the other has a heart of gold. That\'s it. All they\'re there for is to be damsels in distress so Glenn can save the day. Although we see a couple of times where they help their teacher defeat the bad guy, it just comes down as plot convenience instead of ""strong female characters"" that can hold their own. Looking past other characters, a sword-wielding kuudere who\'s also a damsel in distress and an old buddy of Glenn\'s who helps provide us with exposition and battle support, everyone else is pretty empty. You have an entire class of students, a few teachers, and some more friends of Glenn\'s, but barely any of them get a hint of exploration. At most, they\'re all just props for the generic comedy skits the show puts on. (Although I can\'t deny that I did chuckle at parts of the show)Now you could say the action is nice. At first, it was pretty amusing watching Glenn use his limited skills to defeat others, but soon it just went downhill. You already know Glenn will defeat them after overcoming a small obstacle, (Power of Friendship everybody!) and the anime makes no effort to try and compensate for that. It just becomes another layer added onto the show as it tries to make up for its run of the mill story.The title also mentions an ""Akashic Records"" in it\'s first half. What is this record you ask? I don\'t know. They mention it once or twice and just kinda forget about it, and that\'s how most of the plot points go. We don\'t find out much about The Researchers of Divine Wisdom, or the Alzano Empire Royal Family, or the Imperial Court Mage Corps. They\'re just thrown in during different arcs to keep shit interesting. This anime had a decent amount of material they could explore, but it decided to just screw it and hope what they do present is acceptable. (It\'s not)Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor is not an enjoyable show. It had its fun moments but they were overshadowed by everything else Akashic did wrong. Maybe if you don\'t mind all the predictability and cliches, you could probably have fun with this mess, but if you perhaps want some that doesn\'t dig itself so deep into the norm that it becomes unbearable, avoid this show. Don\'t be a Fool.P.S. Just wanna rant about the uniforms the girls wear. Why do they show their lower body for all the world to see? And those skirts. Might as well just force them to dress in nothing but their panties cause you\'re gonna use them for fanservice either way. What kinda bullshit school lets their students dress like this?

The comedy in this is almost on par with that main protagonist in Steins;Gate. Was my kind of humor and it's consistent throughout the whole series which I love.It's quite short and I wish they would make more because although it doesn't bring anything new to the table the comedy is quite unique which other animes are lacking especially with the consistency part.Definitely an amazing anime, really good story and awesome laughs.

The series picks up slightly in the following episodes, with some effort to justify the MC's actions and some background on the supporting cast. However, these efforts seem half-hearted and do not provide a believable justification for the characters. There is little reason why the MC is should be as OP as...he is, seemingly able to blitz through many of the challenges he encounters, all while having a pair of fangirls in tow. I feel that the characterization is the weakest link in this show.On the other hand, I found the conflicts/threats to be quite decent. There is good pacing and sufficient action to keep the audience entertained. But good conflict without good characters isn't going to make an impactful series. he is, seemingly able to blitz through many of the challenges he encounters, all while having a pair of fangirls in tow.

So first of all, let me say one thing: a cliche is a cliche for a reason. Though many people go around saying ""not unique"" ""cliche af"", I want to say that the reason why ideas and stories are overused is because they are ""good"". And a lot of people like it. That\'s why cliches become a thing.Now, let\'s talk a bit about the show itself. Well, I do have to say that this show is based upon cliched ideas - but that provides a good foundation for the show. On top of that, the show has some extra touches - or...that cherry on top of a sundae. Let me make a little Shokugeki no Soma reference. You know that Mimasaka Subaru? who copies dishes and makes it better? That\'s what this show does. that cherry on top of a sundae. Let me make a little Shokugeki no Soma reference.

This is definitely a guilty pleasure anime for me that I come back to when I need a cringe pick-me-up.The story is kinda awful and campy. It is very enjoyable with a pint of ice cream because you already have a spoon you can gag on.The majority of characters are archetypal AF and don\'t have the time to really grow, but you get enough glimpses of humanity that the character tropes are worth groaning through.The music is actually pretty good - it...is exactly what you would expect for a Shonen magic school anime.

This is one of those cases.When you watch the first episode, it does feel a little underwhelming because if i\'m being completely honest...it was pretty irritating. However, after you watch more and more episodes, it begins to get better and better. It has the right amount of suspense that would make you want to watch more but also have some comedy mixed here and there, to not make you completely bored.The only problem with the anime is it\'s lack of originality....The characters have their own tropes and their personality doesn\'t really go beyond that.

This should be seen as something entertaining by itself, not to break it down in search of secret keys.To be a light Japanese version of Harry Potter, they are doing very well.

As someone on reddit put it, this is the perfect definition of a 7/10 anime. Our main character, Glenn, is a lovable asshole who is a rare competent protag. (Mostly.) Our heroine, Sistine, is a very cute tsundere done right. It takes place in a magical academy where the show shines, showcasing an original and interesting magic system. In fact, one of the early episodes spends the entire time explaining the magic, and it was fantastic. However, what brought this show down was the story....It wasn't bad per say, but I wouldn't write home about it either.The first few episodes spend a ton of time goofing around with your typical SoL stuff, while the last episodes go to a gritty and dark place. Its jarring really, with the sudden tonal shift in between episodes. Art wise, it is a very beautiful show, magical effects are fantastic, characters are cute, and environments are your typical medieval fantasy, but they still look good. Near the end of each episode, a small little chibi short is played as well as a beautifully drawn end card.The sound department did not do as well however. The opening and ending are forgettable, and only a few songs in the OST really stick out to me. Overall, not very good.The characters can both be a high and low point of the show. Glenn and Sistine are high points, while Halley (bet it took you a second to remember who that was) and Rumia are low points.

It starts with a bang, delivering perfect episodes that balances out fresh Comedy with serious Action very well in a Magic Academy setting. Sadly, it can\'t end on the same note as new arcs with new characters are introduced late in the game that aren\'t given much exposition. Still they do a good job with explaining the magic of this world logically, making it sound both interesting and realistic. This is further supported by the shows focus on the students...to NOT just become a bookworm, rather participate willingly to field work as well. However, I would have liked more explanation with the makeup of spells and their mana cooldowns. In addition, I would have liked more types of magic used during combat rather than the few we get to see. And the competition arc needed a bit more flare to it cause at certain parts they came close to mading me felt like I was in Hogwarts! And while the plot is nice, the storytelling is weak which is why some things go unexplained like what’s the use of gems when casting strong magic or what’s the secret behind Rumia being an \'Amplifier\' or what is really an \'Amplifier\' in this world? The current story arcs don\'t have a conclusion and they leave an open end to the series, so I would have liked more closure, who doesn\'t? Plus, the last few episodes felt rushed and I am not a fan of it! We also get to see a lot of blood in this show, but then again the anime isn’t exactly \'Rated R\' since it refrains from showing violent deaths. And while they couldn\'t get their storytelling right, they did a better job with their characters.The main characters all get fleshed out pretty well and have their moments to shine! But the spotlight wasn\'t consistent with the girls, since the show would focus on each individual while the others would remain more of a side character like Re=L for instance. She is a weird one who apparently has only 1 strategy on her mind, which is Attack! And I’m afraid no matter how much our MC squeezes her brains out, she will remain a thickhead forever! However, she is scary and despite her deadpan look, her unpredictability can make you her enemy or a friend in a matter of seconds. Removing swords from the ground and stabbing people is all she knows! Rumia, on the other hand, is strongminded but comes across a bit naïve as well as an optimist which is further explored by her insight and desire to help people with magic. Regrettably, she\'s also the unlucky one who finds herself in the \'damsel in distress\' situation all the time which gets boring so I would have liked something else from her. Albert comes across cool and mysterious but turns out to be a good friend who apparently has a thing for cats! And \'White Cat\', ahem, I mean Sistine has quite a temper, I particularly enjoyed her frame of inner struggle dilemma which she gladly overcomes. (Side Note: I found her parents funny!) While she comes off as a hardworking student from a prestigious background, her relationship with Glenn is the most interesting thing about her. The have a rocky start but they do warm up to each other eventually. I particularly liked this setup since the 2 are polar opposites of each other so we get to witness the classic romantic tale of Opposites Attract! (Though they still need a lot of work for us to take them seriously) Thankfully the MC is always at the centre of the story cause he\'s just amazing! I loved his quick remarks and his constant trolling nature despite being a lazy bastard as the title entails! He\'s very strong as well with a rich yet dark history that\'s moderately explored but it’s his attitude and resolve as a magician and teacher that helps him in standing out! Radars is hella lot of fun to be around as he makes fun of his students and teachers. Thankfully this is just an outer layer, like a mask, to hide away his true self which is dark, gloomy and bloody. Constantly haunted by his past mistakes, he wants to erase all of that with something useful and positive. And lastly, Celica was left as a background character which sucked cause she’s so powerful, but she seems to have more going on in the next season so I won\'t complain for now.Voice Acting is top notch across the board with Josh Grelle stealing the show once again! He just has so much fun with this role and it clearly shows with his Comedic line delivery like ‘Later Nerds!’ or ‘You may now kiss my A**!’ which always springs a smile to my face. Glenn\'s expressions are on point which helps in delivering his lines across and that makes him a fun Main Character. The smile of Rumia mirrored her mother’s which was a nice touch. Sistine, voiced by Rachael Messer and Celica, voiced by Morgan Garrett had a certain flair to their accents which helped them in standing out. Sistine rages of fit or screams are well done and Celica’s concern for Glenn is shown by the warmness emanating from her which further bands the Big Sis, Little Bro kinda relationship between them. The animation is simple but beautiful when it wants to be, especially the magic casting parts. I liked how healing spells represented bright colours with soothing sound effects while dangerous spells had sharp colours with quick and loud sound effects. The OP is catchy due to it’s upbeat track that can easily be assigned as your ringtone, but I didn’t like the ED very much as it sounded very generic.This is one of my favs from last year, it even ended up in my Top 5 Anime list of 2017! It’s not perfect as it tries to cram around 4 arcs in just 12 episodes, so you can tell when details are omitted out. Still it\'s very good for it\'s 1st season and I have high expectations for S2. I hope they organize their storytelling better and improve the screentime for their characters along with some further development. Also, if they had refrained from rushing their story, this anime would have made a bigger impact with the audience. I also thought the costumes for the girls were too showy which didn\'t make sense and I absolutely adored the short theatre skits at the end of each episode. Overall this certainly made me laugh and care for the characters and I would love to see their next adventure in the coming season.

And while they couldn\'t get their storytelling right, they did a better job with their characters.The main characters all get fleshed out pretty well and have their moments to shine! But the spotlight wasn\'t consistent with the girls, since the show would focus on each individual while the others would remain more of a side character like Re=L for instance. She is a weird one who apparently has only 1 strategy on her mind, which is Attack! And I’m afraid no matter how much our MC squeezes her brains out, she will remain a thickhead forever! However, she is scary and despite her deadpan look, her unpredictability can make you her enemy or a friend in a matter of seconds. Removing swords from the ground and stabbing people is all she knows! Rumia, on the other hand, is strongminded but comes across a bit naïve as well as an optimist which is further explored by her insight and desire to help people with magic. Regrettably, she\'s also the unlucky one who finds herself in the \'damsel in distress\' situation all the time which gets boring so I would have liked something else from her. Albert comes across cool and mysterious but turns out to be a good friend who apparently has a thing for cats! And \'White Cat\', ahem, I mean Sistine has quite a temper, I particularly enjoyed her frame of inner struggle dilemma which she gladly overcomes. (Side Note: I found her parents funny!) While she comes off as a hardworking student from a prestigious background, her relationship with Glenn is the most interesting thing about her. The have a rocky start but they do warm up to each other eventually. I particularly liked this setup since the 2 are polar opposites of each other so we get to witness the classic romantic tale of Opposites Attract! (Though they still need a lot of work for us to take them seriously) Thankfully the MC is always at the centre of the story cause he\'s just amazing! I loved his quick remarks and his constant trolling nature despite being a lazy bastard as the title entails! He\'s very strong as well with a rich yet dark history that\'s moderately explored but it’s his attitude and resolve as a magician and teacher that helps him in standing out! Radars is hella lot of fun to be around as he makes fun of his students and teachers. Thankfully this is just an outer layer, like a mask, to hide away his true self which is dark, gloomy and bloody. Constantly haunted by his past mistakes, he wants to erase all of that with something useful and positive. And lastly, Celica was left as a background character which sucked cause she’s so powerful, but she seems to have more going on in the next season so I won\'t complain for now.Voice Acting is top notch across the board with Josh Grelle stealing the show once again! He just has so much fun with this role and it clearly shows with his Comedic line delivery like ‘Later Nerds!’ or ‘You may now kiss my A**!’ which always springs a smile to my face. Glenn\'s expressions are on point which helps in delivering his lines across and that makes him a fun Main Character. The smile of Rumia mirrored her mother’s which was a nice touch. Sistine, voiced by Rachael Messer and Celica, voiced by Morgan Garrett had a certain flair to their accents which helped them in standing out. Sistine rages of fit or screams are well done and Celica’s concern for Glenn is shown by the warmness emanating from her which further bands the Big Sis, Little Bro kinda relationship between them. The animation is simple but beautiful when it wants to be, especially the magic casting parts. I liked how healing spells represented bright colours with soothing sound effects while dangerous spells had sharp colours with quick and loud sound effects. The OP is catchy due to it’s upbeat track that can easily be assigned as your ringtone, but I didn’t like the ED very much as it sounded very generic.This is one of my favs from last year, it even ended up in my Top 5 Anime list of 2017! It’s not perfect as it tries to cram around 4 arcs in just 12 episodes, so you can tell when details are omitted out. Still it\'s very good for it\'s 1st season and I have high expectations for S2. I hope they organize their storytelling better and improve the screentime for their characters along with some further development. Also, if they had refrained from rushing their story, this anime would have made a bigger impact with the audience. I also thought the costumes for the girls were too showy which didn\'t make sense and I absolutely adored the short theatre skits at the end of each episode. Overall this certainly made me laugh and care for the characters and I would love to see their next adventure in the coming season. (P.S. where\'s the Comedy tag cause this s*** is funny!)', 'Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records by studio LIDENFILMS is based on a Light Novel of the same title as well as a manga, both of which are still publishing.Setting/Plot/Story 7The show takes place in a fantasy world, where magic is a thing and primarily taught and used due to its military strength.The story so far has taken place at the best magic academy of the kingdom, where our MC is just about to teach a class of students to become the best of the best in terms of magi.. that\'s not how it begins though - since our MC starts of as a very...laid back guy.The way magic looks and works in this world is pretty similar to many other shows in that it\'s magic circle, a chant and a boom. However the difference this show has is that they put a twist on the chants themselves - For a student in magic, casting a spell using a slightly different set of words or versing will cause the spell to have some kind of side effect, and at the same time, a master of magic can cast a spell with only a single word achieving its\' full effect. We learn that magic is something that isn\'t created by the chant itself, rather that the chant is what makes you focus on the ""correct..things"" to cast the spell.Our MC has some kind of special magic called ""original magic"", which is a sort of magic he himself has created that can only be used by him. Original magic is described as something very complicated, however our MC tells us that the magic that they call elementary was also once called original magic,  someone had also come up with the spells after all.We also get to see a castle floating in the sky, but we have no idea what it implies to the story so far, more than that sistine wants to go there.Art/Animation 7The art in this show falls in the generic category, much thanks to its setting  and the colors used. That is not to say that the art is bad. It is easy to see that most of the effort went into Rumia, Sistine and Celica, Glenn is very bland (He also needs to look bland for the show to use its comedy) and the whole class as well as the bad guys we\'ve seen so far look very normal, much like ""extras"". The worst part I noticed was that the focus of the characters\' eyes were sometimes off target, did the creator not know how to draw well in different angles?Sound: 7The OP is a Jrock track ""Blow Out"" and the ED a Jpop track ""Precious You"".The character VAs are all good with one exception - I really don\'t like the VA they chose for Re=L.Characters: 5It is very easy to notice that this is based on a light novel due to the characters. While at first glance they leave a good impression both visually and personalities, however.. the main characters all leave things to be desired when more heavily interacted with. There is very little sign of actual character development more than having a bit of backstory and flashbacks, which I don\'t consider to be real character development, since there are better ways to go about it.The only real character development can be seen in the first episodes regarding our MC, to how he changes his attitude toward teaching.The MC is the kind of MC who ""seems useless"" to the stupid characters, but always shows up and delivers when needed. He\'s kind of a grown up tropelord MC from highschool romcom animes in the sense that he gives off the same vibes but has seen all those clichés before and will deliver their opposites every time when encountered.Rumia - Extremely nice.. Extremely nice.. Always nice.. ... .... ...Sistine - *Hmph..* *Hmph..* *Hmph..*.... Actually a nice girl, who would\'ve thought?Celica - The STRONGEST mage alive, can shoot laser beams 2m in diameter, but just turns out to be... completely powerless and not available in every situation they encounter.Enjoyment: 8This show delivers 2 things quite well:The first is how quirky the magic is, the ""limitless possibilities"" and how they can use those quirks to win fights etc.The second part is its above average comedy. I really wish they would have focused a bit more on the comedy rather than the forced ""feelings"" the characters are supposed to have. When characters just start loving MC for no reason, the characters become really stale, and the show becomes hard to watch. The good thing about how they did it is: Our MC is an adult! Which means he can actually notice girls with the ""love mc complex""  and make fun of them rather than ""not notice"" and keep the episodes awkwardly boring.Overall: 7.3It\'s not a particularly interesting plot or setting. The art&animation is pretty good, and the characters can be a mess at times.I\'ve enjoyed this show up until now, but I doubt that it will get much better, or have a good finale.7.3 for average, but worth a watch. laid back guy.The way magic looks and works in this world is pretty similar to many other shows in that it\'s magic circle, a chant and a boom.

Don\'t get me wrong -- a lot of the elements put in place for this anime are highly cliche and uninspired (and not in a satirical way); however, don\'t get me wrong in the other direction -- this anime is also not awful. In fact, I\'d say the first three episodes led me to believe that it\'d be significantly above average.Enter Glenn Radars -- deceptively versatile, but incorrigibly opportunistic and frustratingly dispassionate. Did this anime attempt to...make him an antihero but miss its mark? From the moments we meet him, showing absolutely no concern for his female students\' right to privacy (and basking to their nakedness before him), to the final episodes, admitting harboring motivation that would see him wedlock out of shallow desire to never work another day in his life (through marrying up in caste), his lazy demeanor and sleazy treatment of other characters doesn\'t end up being integral to the primary plot (or his development as a character). (If we can even call this a plot -- it\'s mostly just a disjointed series of ""things happening"",  which doesn\'t define an actual plot.) An anti-hero is supposed to be someone who acts out of self-interest because of their nature, environment, past experiences, and other context, and that says something about the world around them. For example, Holden Caulfield from A Catcher in the Rye is a true anti-hero; he\'s disaffected, cynical, and sarcastic because he experiences the alienation and isolation associated with growing into an adult world full of hypocrisy and fakeness. Han Solo from A New Hope is another great example - he does things that advantage him in a galaxy ruled by forced order mixed with unattended lawlessness. And while this Glenn Radars main character has clearly-needed back-story to exposit why he\'s first shown to detest magic (I suspected it involved tragedy that would be tied directly to the forthcoming narrative), when all of this is revealed it still doesn\'t explain why he is how he is. Why is he so lazy and so scummy? It only explains why he ""doesn\'t like magic"" during the first two episodes of the anime; otherwise, the reasons for his attributes are weakly expounded. He also had clear room to grow as a dynamic character that could face his past in an increasingly mature way while learning from his new experiences in a new position of guiding, teaching, and protecting his students. This also didn\'t happen. Holden Caulfield remains jaded, but at least he learns things and tells his story with surprising honesty. Glenn Radars doesn\'t learn anything. Han Solo realizes that there\'s value in risking his life for a greater cause of liberty and autonomy, through developing connections with Luke and Leia. Glenn Radars always knew that risking his life is worth it (as evidenced by his back-story), so why attempt to make him an anti-hero? If they wanted to do something that made sense with his back-story, the writers should have explored his dealing with loss in a much different way, instead of making him lazy and contemptible. But it\'s hard to make things funny that way with levity, so they built him into a chauvinistic asshat with little regard of other human beings as people with feelings, even behind the bravado of protecting Sistine\'s prospects of applied magic, or safeguarding Rumia\'s life. This lends the anime to funny moments, but also fails to delve into real, human experience of love, loss, sacrifice, withdrawal. Revenge and acceptance. Depression vs drive. It never feels like Glenn is internally vulnerable; he\'s too sure of himself and the backstory feels too devisive.But the main character isn\'t the only flaw. I\'ve already referenced it, but the more egregious problem (which probably ruins the characters in terms of development), is the narrative.Puella Magi Madoka Magica. Sakamichi no Apollon. Usagi Drop. If you think of short-form 12-episode anime that are *exceptional*, their compact form justifies their scope and reflects their pacing. Everything starts from a strong foundation of structured, deliberate form, as well as unique storytelling of smartly-crafted character-driven narrative. Characters change. Relationships between them are ephemeral. And, most importantly, the narrative tells a story, through those characters, that means something. Kids on the Slope brings very contrasting characters together through mutual appreciation for the language of jazz. Usagi Droppu explores the challenges associated with raising children. And Madoka Magica is about existentialist themes of dedication and creating meaning. But I\'m confused what Akashic Records is about. Is it about finding meaning after loss? Is it about pursuing passion? Is it a critique about just vs unjust use of power? This leads me to the core fundamental problem with this series - it\'s unfocused. It turns into a rushed jumbled mess. It assaults the viewer with so much sensory resulting in too many unresolved threads, fails to fully address plot holes or tie up plot points, or fully flush out the back-stories so that we can actually care about the characters more than, say, a ""5, mediocre"" status. We get a main character whose true characteristics (underneath all of the ""lazy asshat"" facade) are unclear, faced by antagonistic forces whose motivations are under-developed, rushed into the story\'s plotpoints with little establishment, with arcs that are unnecessary or random. Imagine attempting to cram 25 episodes of some great anime (say, Spice and Wolf or Code Geass) into 12 episodes, but then remove two key episodes and add two filler episodes. That\'s what this feels like.It borrows a lot from current hype trends in anime, but it still had definite potential that feels wasted because of poor planning and a rushed structure . But don\'t tell me that I need to read the manga or wait for another season to come out, in order to have a firmer understanding of this anime\'s purpose. This should stand on its own merits alone. In the end, it\'s not meaningful to me, but it\'s still a fun time. Sistine is a cute, if overdone, tsundere archetype, and Re-L is adorably clueless. I like the way magic is represented in the anime, and the action scenes are competently choreographed and animated. The dialogue is good in general, if you can look past the contextual plot problems. The voice acting is pretty good, as well as other elements of the production value, and it\'s entertaining even while I\'m frustratingly trying to connect with the characters or themes of the show. I won\'t bother getting into many details about the revealing character designs, the fan service, or the minor inconsistencies and weird plot arcs - this anime had more fundamental issues (than just execution) that I wanted to address, like how they dealt with the anti-hero and how they structured the narrative, and I think other reviewers have talked about these various other problems sufficiently.Overall, I\'d recommend this if:* you want a new best-girl tsundere that\'s well animated and voice acted* you don\'t mind a confused plot in an overdone magic high school setting* you could use some light fun with moderately humorous scenes and dialogue* I have to admit that it\'s a cute show, even if it\'s nonsensical - especially the preview cuts at the end of each episode, with this kind of self-referential humor, etc. that this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously as an art form make him an antihero but miss its mark?

For me, I really enjoy and like this show. The story has good plot, humors, tad bit of romance for me, some characters even have their own story to be shown in 12 episodes show. For me, it doesn't really matter if it is realistic or not but the way they react on situations is somewhat okay. On to the last few episodes, it felt like it was forced instead of taking it slow. This show  is a cliffhanger but...it doesn't disappoint me that much, what I'm disappointed is that it has already been 6 years and there's still no season 2. it doesn't disappoint me that much, what I'm disappointed is that it has already been 6 years and there's still no season 2."", ""Real Score:7.25\\10Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, one of the most popular Anime this season, does it deserve the popularity it gets? Yes...and no. It is a really nice and enjoyable show, with a good MC, a really nice satire on the usual tropes of the Magical High School genre and an amusing side and explanation of magic. But the same Clichès that the show makes fun of in the first episodes come back to bite the overall enjoyment and flowing of the story, some of the characters lose a lot of steam and, of freaking course, it doesn't end, making the entire season a...bait for future adaptations and for the Light-Novel SeriesStory 7.25The story is surprisingly good, it builds the characters, the world and the villains really well, it has a great variety of situations and the characters actually develop throughout the story, and because of the story only, there are very few flashbacks, the story continues and unfolds not because of a mere FlashBack , the 101 method of all storywriters to develop the story, but because of the story itself, as it evolves the characters adapt to it and respond in many different ways. The short arcs, they're around 3-4 episodes long, may bother someone, i'm not a big fan too, but i found it quite enjoyable: maybe the reason is that the pacing is astonishingly good, is not slow, but not that fast either, is a weirdbalance that may throw someone off, but that captivated me. The problems reside in the overuse of the same old Clichés that we see all the time in the last 2 arcs, granted they aren't that bif of a problem, but after setting up a nice satire in the first 5-6 episodes, it's a shame seeing RokuDenashi fall in the same hole as the other Anime of this genre. The biggest problem is that the story ends too quickly, just when things started to get interesting, this is the same bait, the same method as every light novel adaptation out there, the ending does not exist to make the viewer feel good, or simply to applease it, it does not end with a good cliffhanger too, it just ends, like that, PUF!If you want to see more, read the freaking Novel you dumbass! Listen, i'm not against supporting the producers, we must support them if we want to have constant and quality content over the years, but there are better ways to do it, i should be incline to buy products because it genuinely intrigued me, because i want to know if  this show differentiates itself from the Novel\\Manga, because I decide to support it; this is forcing viewers to buy the Source Materials. Sorry for the little rant, it is not an attack to Rokudenashi, i enjoyed it and i will definitely read the Novel, i just wanted to say something about this horrible strategy that Publishing companies are using nowadaysCharacters 7The side characters are simple, yet effective, they all incarnate the same guidelines for High school characters, but you can actually get behind them and believe them sa a single class, unity, mainly because of the well-done Tournament Arc, that creates bonds between the class, something that should be done more in School Anime; however it's cut short and  they never go any further than that. 2\\3 of the main Trio is interesting, but nothing more: Rumia has the most interesting story and has a really nice character, not so naive as it seems, a lot more profound than you might think, but quickly becomes a damsel in distress that has to be always saved by our main character, what a pity. Sistine is, too, an interesting character on paper, and is not your typical Tsundere, but she never has that leap, that breakthrough needed for her personality, it may happen in S2, but here, it doesn't happen. Our main character, Glenn Radars, is hands down the best part of this show, he's got a really amazing and cool backstory, in fact i would 100% see and even support a prequel that follows the adventures of Glenn before going to the Alzano Magical High School Academy, they are build up incredibly well and add a lot to Glenn's character without flashbacks. He's a funny, charming, charismatic and secure protagonist, he's a breath of fresh hair, he's a reliable and secure guy,  you can genuinely cheer him up and get behind him.Sound 7.25Suzuki Konomi is always awesome to hear and her songs fit the scenery pretty well, they are energetic and pump you up for the viewing.

The action scenes and the magic scenes are where the animation and direction really shine the colourful spells, the detailed runes and good choreography are really good. Too bad the direction is, well, normal, it doesn't stand out in no manner whatsoever but, at the same time, it's not bad, it's in the middleEnjoyment 8I really liked the entire Anime overall, the comedy is really well executed at times and Glenn's personality was just so entertaining. I liked all the Arcs, even though they were short, and i liked the way the story evolves with the characters. The character banter was really good and enjoyable, and i loved the different take on magic, a down to earth and bloody take on magic. I'm totally in for a second season and for a prequel for Glenn's story, a prequel that the character deserves.I won't  lie, this was a disappointment for me, after 6 episodes, i really thought that i would enjoy this a lot more, and maybe give a lot more than 7.25, it's a real shame that the same clichés that it makes fun of in a clever way, brings it way down. The way that it ends may be infuriating but, however, it kinda works, it builds curiosity and makes you wonder what might happen next. It's a nice, i would recommend it this season, for the amazing main character, the interesting take on Magic and interesting story, that doesn't get too tiring, i have high hopes for a future season 2 if they correct their mistakes.

It never gets better.On the list of things the world is lacking, another fantasy high school light novel must rank pretty high. Fortunately, Akashic Records of Bastard Magic Instructor (AroBMI) – so called because Brilliant Bastard wasn't cumbersome enough – is here to provide.Sistine & Rumia are two friends on their way to the first day of class at the Alanzo Imperial Magic Academy when they have an only in anime collusion with some guy. Said guy turns out to...be Glenn, a right bastard who mocks their apology & behaves in such a way that means Sistine must yell “baka!” & shoot magic at him. As if the day couldn't get any worse, Glenn turns out to be their new teacher & not only is he a bastard, but an idle one at that.Cliche beginnings aside, the first episodes of AroMBI showed promise. Glenn, pronounced Gülenn in this universe, being a teacher rather than a student immediately stands out as somewhat of a novelty, though his appearance makes it hard to tell how much older than its students he's supposed to be. Though his cocky & abrasive, not to mention lazy, attitude rubs everyone up the wrong way at first, he soon reveals himself to be much more capable & reliable than he seemed.The episodes that focus on him as a teacher are the strongest. Taking a Great Teacher Onizuka approach to schooling – even using a similar title at least once – his unorthodox teaching methods gradually win over his students, even if he is openly disdainful of magic as a tool fit only for harming others. Eschewing the conventional methods of rote learning & memorisation, Glenn instead emphasises practical application & experimentation as well as encouraging each student to excel at what they're best at, rather than relying on the top students to carry the rest of the class. The potential was there for the series to at least offer a somewhat novel spin on the genre, even if Glenn still had the usual cliché past & an evil organisation to fight.Unfortunately, what potential it had is soon squandered by its inability to adapt genre conventions to the new status of its protagonist. It soon becomes apparent that, although a teacher, Glenn is still very much a light novel protagonist. Events all revolve around him, he is the solution to every problem & people just can't help but like him, think about him, or at least blame him for all their problems. Worse is that, while Sistine is your typical tsundere heroine, she is also your typical light novel love interest. There is some effort to explain Glenn's apparent closeness to her as being because she reminds him of someone he used to know. But by the time she's daydreaming about him defeating her plot convenient fiancé & proposing to her, it feels very awkward.As does Glenn's constant need to rescue his harem...sorry, students with non-brown hair. Normally you expect a teacher character to encourage their students personal growth & ability to stand up for themselves & that does happen with the class as a whole. But when the evil mages show up to cause trouble for the main female characters, it's all on Glenn to save them, once just in time to stop Sistine from being raped.Rumia is supposed to be some sort of unique magic user, her power to amplify others magic apparently a cause both for her being hidden away by her royal mother & also why the evil mages keep attacking. But it's never established why her power, in a world full of magic, causes that, or why amplifying power is a bad thing while nobody bats an eye at Glenn's power to nullify magic or Sistine's power to drain it. It's just a thing the plot needed to have, really. When another character from his past, Rel (spelled Re=L) joins his class as a transfer student who openly professes her devotion to him, it only furthers the sense that ARoBMI is unable to think outside the box.Speaking of that near-rape scene, its narrow avoidance leads into another issue with the series: it's terrible sense of comedic timing. Sistine's assault is built up for well over a minute, with her calls for help becoming increasingly desperate as more clothes are torn through. But almost as soon as Glenn strolls through the door the tone does a 180 & witty banter ensues. Even in regular exchanges, jokes often fail to hit the mark, either due to excessive repetition or punchlines taking too long to deliver. It's alright when it's not trying to be funny, but it's almost always trying to be funny & is only made worse by the OST, which uses a cuckoo clock sound effect in the “funny scene” music.There is also a frustrating lack of continuity & consistency between the three main arcs of the series (one for each girl). The first two build up an evil maid character to be the series' main antagonist, being involved in both Rumia's & Re=L's stories. But the final arc almost completely ignores her so Glenn can do battle with another guy from his past that we haven't been introduced to. It seems pretty basic to think that they would have to fight against the maid henchman before revealing a new, higher ranking enemy, or at least have him say “you sit this one out, I got this.” But that wouldn't fit Sistine's marriage fantasy that's the core of the final arc, with all the unhealthy student – teacher relationship implications that has. By the final episode it's almost like they're flinging whatever they've got at the wall in the hope that twenty minutes of material sticks.There are issues in the small details as well. For the first half of the series, the setting seems a fairly typical fantasy one, with magic & swords & carriages. But then in Re=L's arc there's suddenly a high-tech laboratory & Glenn's former special mage forces partner Albert hands him his old revolver. It's the only firearm in the series, which begs the question: why are there firearms in a world with knights & magic? The answer is because the director thought having Albert hand Glenn his old gun to symbolise their reuniting for one more case would make a cool scene, implications be damned. It's not the only time where something that worked in a different film is used to poor effect.As to what the Akashic Record is, well you'll just have to read the novels to find out.The production of AKoBMI follows the tiresomely familiar pattern of starting with its best foot forward & only getting worse as the series goes on. Putting the usual light novel inevitabilities aside – like silly uniforms & character designs taken from the beginners guide to archetypes – everything seems to look & move fine, with some eye-catching animation sequences in the first few episodes. But things become gradually more static & stuttery as the series progresses, with a notable decrease in the amount of detail put into character art.There are also a couple of annoyingly obvious continuity errors. A minor but unmissable one is when Glenn has very clearly been stabbed through the lung, complete with bloody wound to mark the spot. But his bandages mostly cover his abdomen instead of his chest, presumably because it looked cooler. A more glaring & irritating one comes later, when Glenn punches an opponent into a wall. When the dust clears, he's in a Jesus Christ pose that the camera is really keen you get a good look at, only for him to be sprawled on the floor in the next cut, no falling animation or even a sound effect. It's eye rolling at best & likely to cause viewers to yell at expletives at the screen for how pretentious it is.AKoBMI is hardly the first light novel to start with an interesting premise, only to become increasingly unfocused & reliant on overdone tropes & clichés as it progresses. But there have been so many of them, which becomes increasingly unforgivable as each year also produces more shows that buck the trend. The first 5-6 episodes that focus on Glenn becoming a teacher & Rumia are okay enough that they might be worth watching on their own if you're a big enough fan of the genre. But if you really want to watch a light novel adaptation about a magic bastard instructor, just watch Alderamin on the Sky. be Glenn, a right bastard who mocks their apology & behaves in such a way that means Sistine must yell “baka!” & shoot magic at him.

I actually had high hopes for this adaptation, but in the end it really was horrid.If they had more episodes and kept the pace at the beginning few episodes this might have been an enjoyable 6-7 / 10 show.If you watched this show for the genre of OP MC, save your time and go watch Mahouka. This show's MC is supposed to be strong and OP, but he ends up being helped by students that should show no prowess near his level and are able to be at or beyond his level within the series time frame.The last 3...episodes brought this show to a burning pile of junk. The show tried to pack so much into so few episodes and there was no room for story or character progression.TLDRWatch Mahouka, or set your standards extremely low coming into this anime. episodes brought this show to a burning pile of junk.

It also has magic in it. But even though its the ""magical world"" there are other anime that do magic better. Here it feels like they didn\'t want to go with knights or guns so they put magic in it. Its okay.The beginning is quite good though, unexpected and funny. Even if you dislike harem anime, there is a decent comedy and enjoyment in this. Its nothing new but its not as bad.The characters are well rounded up,...classical stereotypes of girls and a seemingly incompetent MC... he isn\'t that.. he just lazy and unmotivated.. unless its a save the day situation in which everyone in the world disappears and he is the only one that can do it.The art is awesome so that\'s gonna carry it if nothing else.I\'d recommend it for any lazy afternoon/night. You can easily blaze through all of it, its all good. classical stereotypes of girls and a seemingly incompetent MC... he isn\'t that.. he just lazy and unmotivated.. unless its a save the day situation in which everyone in the world disappears and he is the only one that can do it.The art is awesome so that\'s gonna carry it if nothing else.I\'d recommend it for any lazy afternoon/night. You can easily blaze through all of it, its all good.', ""STORY: it takes place at an academy where magic is key and used in their everyday lives. It starts off with a substitute teacher filling in for a class, but he doesn't have a lesson planned out for them. Eventually, it has escalated to the point where one of the students has faced him in a duel and won (& told him to step up). But things get more interesting in the anime where an evil organization has invaded the school and abducted one of the students. From there, the anime lets us explore the other side of him (the good side). This anime contains...a lot of cool battle scenes, the school life, comedic moments and a lot of cliffhangers and twists.CHARACTERS:Glen Raders: the substitute teacher who originally had no intentions of teaching magic to the class, but later on we get to see another side to him that is kind, caring and is capable of understanding the class' magic. He can be very cocky and obnoxious too.Sistine: one of the smartest students in the academy and is part of a rich family. On the outside, she comes off very strong, but on the inside, she is very vulnerable.Rumia: one of the sweetest, soft spoken students. She wants to use her magic to help others.OVERALL: I enjoy the anime overall. It was nice, but there are a few flaws. Such as: needing to explore more of Glen's & Sistine's past (aka character development) and learn more information about the evil organization. Personally, I think the school uniform looks like a crop top. a lot of cool battle scenes, the school life, comedic moments and a lot of cliffhangers and twists.CHARACTERS:Glen Raders: the substitute teacher who originally had no intentions of teaching magic to the class, but later on we get to see another side to him that is kind, caring and is capable of understanding the class' magic.

These days in anime if it's not something with an insane and over complicated plot it usually gets hate especially anything using remotely cliche arch types characters etc. If your not one of these people and actually watch for enjoyment and don't mind a show not being groundbreaking or using themes anime have used forever and got popular then keep reading.This is a magical academy anime...with hints of harem etc. However though with common arch types which is why most people hate and say it's all terrible I really like the characters especially the girls so far. Also something basically a must for me im not to into comedy or just fat out harem shows so a serious on going good plot in it as well is a must and this has that. For a what most would consider a good vibe,comedy harem show this show actually has a pretty serious and dark plot. Just for reference and this isn't spoiling anything by episode 2-3 there are already deats and very very bloody fight scenes. It also looks like the mc has a very dark past at is going to be shown more of as it goes.I will say this show is one that already seems to be getting better as it goes. I will flat out admit from episode 1 it seemed like it was going to be your basic average a few a season level harem magical school show. It picks up tho and you see the differences in episode 2 and heavily in episode 3. I think this is aside from like I said people just loving to hate anything not considered elitist approved or insanely popular is why this show got dropped by alot of gets hated on. Compared to where it goes after episodes 2-3 if you just watched episode 1 it's not great. This show in recent memory had the biggest jump from episode one to 2-3 ive seen in a while. Rating just by episode 1 I would have given it most likely a 5-6 up to episode 4 im at around a 9.If you don't mind themes being used that are good an made anime what it is and don't require everything to be groundbreaking give this anime a shot and please watch it past episode 1. If your not into it past episode 3 then yes it's  a drop for you but don't drop after episode 1. with hints of harem etc. However though with common arch types which is why most people hate and say it's all terrible I really like the characters especially the girls so far. Also something basically a must for me im not to into comedy or just fat out harem shows so a serious on going good plot in it as well is a must and this has that. For a what most would consider a good vibe,comedy harem show this show actually has a pretty serious and dark plot. Just for reference and this isn't spoiling anything by episode 2-3 there are already deats and very very bloody fight scenes. It also looks like the mc has a very dark past at is going to be shown more of as it goes.I will say this show is one that already seems to be getting better as it goes. I will flat out admit from episode 1 it seemed like it was going to be your basic average a few a season level harem magical school show. It picks up tho and you see the differences in episode 2 and heavily in episode 3. I think this is aside from like I said people just loving to hate anything not considered elitist approved or insanely popular is why this show got dropped by alot of gets hated on.

Why? Read on to find out.We also get a healthy dose of action and romance in Akashic Records, and it packs a solid punch.The anime is adapted from a light novel of the same name and it also has a manga adaptation which is pretty great. The story is pretty generic but enjoyable. In a fantasy world, where mages still exist, we get to see the goof ups and adventures of the extremely lazy but immensely capable Glenn Radars. He starts as a part time...teacher in the school and the story follows from there.The Art is superb! I just love it! The sound on the other hand is kinda okay, and while the OP doesn't strike as anything remarkable to me, I love the ED!As for the characters, Akashic Records does a fantastic job. Glenn is easily my number one fav character this season. His comical yet serious nature, his antics, his courage and his love for his students & friends are immensely enjoyable. The other characters, especially, Rumia is also interesting. Her nerve of steel is appreciable. Sistine(the best girl ofc) does her job well portraying a cute girl and a lovable student. She's a tsundere, but a good one. She is powerful, like real powerful and supports Glenn. Re=L, the other girl is an interesting character. I'd like to spoil, but won't and I can say that she'll have a strong fandom after the series ends.The other characters, Celica, Albert and the Queen plays side roles albeit important ones. I found Leos to be hateable enough as I don't like third wheels at all.Overall, I'd pretty much suggest anyone to watch Akashic Records if you're a fan of comedy and action genres. The characters, the story, everything is just too good. Watch it, you won't regret. And also don't forget to read the manga(it's a shame that it's still behind the anime tho).As a parting shot, Sisti(Shiro Neko) is totally the best girl! Don't agree with me? I don't care, lol. teacher in the school and the story follows from there.The Art is superb! I just love it!

It generally flows at a good pace, gives us enough information to flesh the characters out, and progresses the story well enough. The progression of the story could be made more realistic/natural, however, and that is actually one of the things that bugged me the most. I could pick out specific episodes that were put in for different reasons, like ""this episode is to flesh out so-and-so\'s character"" and ""this episode is about...revealing this thing"" and whatnot, and basically what I\'m getting at is that sometimes the episodes seem formulaic. I prefer it when episodes are able to create a seamless picture of the whole, telling the story in a way where it\'s not divided into blocks but has multiple strings in it that all tie into the end. (Hopefully that makes sense—I did my best.)Additionally, if you\'re looking for a one-time/one-season anime, don\'t try this one. The ending wasn\'t entirely satisfactory. There wasn\'t that much development between the love interests and a large amount of big questions went unanswered, likely in the anticipation of a second season. (I hope there will be a second season.)Overall, it is enjoyable but nothing that will get your heart pumping. revealing this thing"" and whatnot, and basically what I\'m getting at is that sometimes the episodes seem formulaic.

Initially, it appears to follow a set formula that has been established over the years: The characters attend a school to learn some power, main male lead isn\'t all that exceptional, main girl lead is a tsundere, and so on. It seems like it will be entirely skip worthy and, in a word, trash. However, Akashic Records ends up becoming unexpectedly good because of some twists that deviate from the norm.Story - 7The story of Akashic Records is...fairly enjoyable. It follows short arcs that tend to focus on a given character with a faint overarching plot connecting it all. The arcs are fairly enjoyable and do their job well. They have a thin coat of harem hijinks while actually being fairly serious. However, what prevents it from scoring higher is the fact that the ending (VERY important) was rushed. It doesn\'t feel rounded off and needed at least another episode.Art - 7The art for Akashic Records maintains a decent standard and has few quality  lows or highs. The art for the various spells and the eyes of the characters are the primary noteworthy aspects. General character designs aren\'t all that special, but are acceptable.Sound - 6I really can\'t give special credit to the soundtrack. It was an overall ""meh"" and had no memorable tracks to speak of. It served its purpose as a background, but doesn\'t go beyond that. The opening at the very least was pretty good. The voice acting was alright (though I wouldn\'t know given I don\'t speak Japanese), but I can\'t speak for the dub given I didn\'t watch it (yet).Characters - 7In general, I liked the characters in Akashic records. I want to give special praise to the main character Glenn Radars. While he is best described as a lazy scumbag, he ends up being fairly interesting to watch. He isn\'t weak like most harem protagonists and is relatively amusing to watch. The rest of the cast is good, but a bit typical. I strongly believe they could have been given a little more nuance, but at the very least they have their own backgrounds that prevent them from being one dimensional.Enjoyment - 8I want to especially stress that this series was very enjoyable to watch. As stated earlier, the key part is that it sets itself apart from other magical high school shows enough to be fairly interesting. It doesn\'t rely on fanservice to keep people watching and actually stays tame in that field. It has a cast that is fun to watch and has some good action scenes with a dash of humor. I really did like that it is comparatively serious to other shows of the same genre and has a good lead.Overall - 7In general, Akashic Records is at the very least worth a test run for most people. Give it the 3 episodes rule, and then decide to watch it fully or not. It deviates from the norm enough to be fairly interesting and fun to watch. While most elements are not exceptional, the good parts of them are executed well and make the show worthwhile.It probably is worth a second season, but I wouldn\'t count on it. fairly enjoyable.

Answer, it makes them look like a bunch of ho’s, I mean, WTF is the illustrator, Kimura Satoshi, thinking about the girl’s school uniform design? They ought to be working in a gentlemen’s club as hostesses, instead of studying to be magicians or sorcerers, another pathetic thing about studio LINDENFILMS they didn’t go all the way with the fanservice, which would have been a saving grace for this anime. The boy’s uniform design doesn’t fare either, I mean, what’s with that cowl that they have to wear? The illustrator should have just made them boys wear a shirt and tie for crying out loud.Fair 6, Sound:I really have nothing to say about the seiyuus who did the voices of the characters, and frankly I just don’t have an opinion about both the opening and closing themes.Poor 3, Character:Ok, so the setting is in some English fantasy kingdom, and the main characters here have rather very pathetic names like Glenn Radars, Rumia Tingle, Fibel Sistine and Rayford Reil. The setting was old but the name were new, also the characters were too poor in how they were presented. We have a lousy teacher Glenn Radar, who can kick ass but lacks motivation, Sistsine who is this uptight proud girl who in the end is actually weak, Rumia, who we don't know how important is she that all of the sudden she becomes secondary on the mid of the season, also there is Reil, whom she has a sort of frenemy with Gleen where at one point she's trying to kill him and in the other she gets cutesy with him. Also, we never get to know as to what had happened to that evil maid Charlet Eleanor.Fair 6, Enjoyment:Well, it was sort of funny that Glenn gets to have his ass kicked by Sisti at first, then seeing Glenn develop his relationships with his students, but in the end things were pretty predicable as Glenn rushes to free Sisti from marrying early, since she does remind of Glenn’s love, the white dog, whom we have no idea as to what happened to her and let’s not forget the puppet master who manipulates things in the shadows.Mediocre 5, Overall:One only has to watch the last episode to see why, so, another season? Yeah right.Radars Out! as cliché as any anime/manga/ novel that has a harem genre in it, despite of other genre’s involve, and no matter how things go between the guy and the harem members.Pathetic 1, Art:Ok, what can anybody of you out there say about the girl’s school uniform?

Yeah right.Radars Out!"", 'Before I start, I\'d obviously like to point out that I\'ve not finished this anime yet, with one episode left to go. However, I feel that I can give a proper review of this anime even without that final episode. I\'ll edit if my opinions change.Well, that being said, onto my review. At first glance, Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records looks like a regular fantasy anime with school elements, but it ends up being a lot more than just your regular run-of-the-mill school comedy.Story: The story of Akashic Records isn\'t that much. Seeing as how this is a school themed anime, the main development...of the plot is in the development of the characters. The first episode of this anime doesn\'t really do much compared to other animes, but hey, they did their job of introducing our lovable cast of tropes. However, the second episode is when Glenn starts dropping his ""bastard"" personality and trades it in for an actual teaching personality. But after episode 2, the anime starts picking up really fast, only to slow down near episode 7.Art: The artists really made some amazing art, in my opinion. And I\'m not just talking about the 2 bits of plot on Celica, I\'m talking about all those magic spells that they drew. I have a strange fascination with how artist draw magic, and their summoning circles, and this anime has them drawn really well. Also, they did a nice job with the designs of all the different characters in Glenn\'s class, since they all look different from each other, and are all unique.Sound: There\'s not much to say here in the sound category, but Konomi Suzuki\'s Blow Out is now one of my favourite openings. It\'s upbeat, and is a theme that I\'d expect to hear from an anime like this. Other than that, I think that the voice actors did an excellent job, with Glenn sounding even more like a bastard than I\'d expect.Character: Well, with the characters, they\'re not too good, not too bad. Aside from Glenn, most of the characters are pretty much just tropes. Sistine, although very KAWAII~DESU, is just your ordinary tsundere catgirl at the end of the day. And even Rumia falls into another trope. To me, she kinda feels like Jeorge from Fire Emblem. Glenn, on the other hand, changes twice in this anime. The first episode 2, when he starts to become more of a teacher, and the second change is when the class goes back from the beach, and he regains his persona as a bastard.Enjoyment: I did enjoy this anime, despite how much I bashed the characters (it\'s bashing in my book >.<). The anime has moments where I smashed that next episode button, just because I wanted to see more of the characters and their tropes, or a climatic moment like in the beach episodes. This anime is something that I\'d recommend to my friends, as long as they have a peculiar sense of humour like me. Anyways, I\'ll be looking forward to being able to watch that last episode.

When you find out the writers were being completely serious and there is no punchline whatsoever.Akashic Records could have at the very least been a decent ecchi romantic comedy, if it wasn\'t for the fact that it doesn\'t seem to understand how bad its own plot devices are. Compare to a better anime like Konosuba. Does Konosuba have a good story to it? Oh god no, it absolutely does not. But here...is the kicker: Konosuba is fully aware that it is bad and brilliantly takes advantage of its inherent badness to self parody at every chance it gets. That\'s how a show like this ironically avoids being bad - by not taking itself seriously and having full self awareness that the best way to be a fantasy-comedy is to go full slayers. Akashic Records unfortunately does not share this self awareness, nor does it understand what makes this kind of show good.Instead of trying to find ways to make all this nonsense entertaining, the writers try to pan off the standard tacky ""mamoru"" and ""I am strong because I have friends!"" elements as if they actually count as good storytelling. The result is that instead of being funny and enjoyable, Akashic Records ends up being cringy and generic. It makes you feel like the show was written for very young children, but at the same time this is an R-rated anime where the female students are all wearing ridiculously revealing school uniforms and violence is everywhere.

It\'s not ironically bad, it\'s just bad.', 'Akashic records of the bastard instructor is based off the light novel of the same name that I only started to read recently. This anime after seeing the Pv for it and the first episode is proving to be one of the best animes that started this season. Power based animes like Akashic records are one of the staples of the anime industry and one of the most common genre and with good reason. The premise of the show somewhat resembles another anime that I seen in the past that had a similar story and premise. This was Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei. In a way,...the main character Glenn does have some resemblance to the main character of that show.The premise behind Akashic records is a rather simple one and centers around the life of a magic instructor that has a rather dark past that one day becomes an instructor at a famed magic academy where he is charged with teaching a class of trainee mages that among their number includes some really interesting characters. However just as the main character Glenn thinks he’s earned an easy job evil forces start to make their moves and forcing Glenn to protect his students and friends from them.Story and settingThe overall story for Akashic records follows the adventure and life of the main character Glenn Radars a 21-year-old mage that despite not looking like he has the knowledge to become a magic teacher is forced to become a teacher at the famed Alzano Imperial Magic academy. Here he meets a host of interesting characters that includes Rumia a positive and cheerful girl that loves to learn and aspires to use magic to help improve the life of people and Sistine an intelligent and competent mage of noble birth that despite acting tough cares a great deal about her classmates and friends. Though Glenn’s laid-back nature and dismissive attitude towards magic antagonizes the members of the class both Glenn and the class soon find common ground after Glenn meets Rumia and Sistine and gets to know them more. However, from the shadows enemy factions begin to start their nefarious plans against the empire and Glenn and his students find themselves caught up in their plans forcing Glenn to both defeat them and defend his friends and students.The story for Akashic records is largely set within the Alzano empire a country that seems to be run by a monarchy. The Alzano empire is famed for its magic and its strong mages which are used for both offensive purposes and research purposes. Rather than using wands or staffs like in other anime and media that feature mages and magic in this world seems to be incarnation based and features a variable number of steps that must be taken before the spell can be used.SistineSistine Fibel voiced by veteran seiyuu Akane Fujita of Orange and High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main heroines of the show. A 16-year-old girl of noble birth that attends the magic academy that Glenn is posted to Sistine is a proud girl that has great pride in both her family and in the field of magic. At the same time, she’s also hard working and kind and cares a great deal about her friends and classmates. While also hard working Sistine is also highly motivated as a student that comes from her desire to study magic and achieve her goal into the legendary sky castle which is one of the great mysteries of the empire. Although a rich girl and a Tsundere Sistine doesn’t fit the profile of an archetypal rich girl in that she is willful and kind to all she meets and at the same time willing to put herself in the line of fire to protect them highlighting her bravery.Sistine and Glenn have an interesting relationship that forms a part of the animes main plot and serves as character development for her character. In the beginning of the series Sistine did not really have a very high opinion of Glenn both as a teacher or as a mage mainly due to his lazy nature and the way that he taught the class. However, as the series progresses and seeing more of Glenn’s true nature and how much he’s been through as well as seeing how much he’s willing to do to protect his students Sistine’s impression of him starts to change. Though she will still get angry with him it can be seen that she’s also more understanding of Glenn as a result and more willing to go with his ideas than in the past. In terms of character role however Sistine in addition to being one of the main heroines also has an important role with regards to Glenn in that she serves as a foil to him that is able to deflect Glenn’s worst ideas and keep him focused on the task at hand. This is a role that she shares with the character of Celica. Aside from her strong personality Sistine actually has a rather strong motivation for studying magic that stems from the last wishes of a member of her family that she respected a great deal. As a result, she is very determined to study hard so that she can one day be able to achieve her dream and fulfill the wishes that wasn’t achieved by her motivator. One notable trait of their relationship is the nickname that Glenn gave Sistine on their first meeting White cat which though annoyed her to great extent was eventually accepted by her as her relationship with Glenn improved. This was a good indication of their deepening relationship.As a character, I thought that Sistine was a pretty well-designed character. While smart, fast thinking and brave she was not the typical rich girl that most nobles are and instead displayed kindness and compassion to her friends and classmates that was surprising and really put her in good stead. However, the main highlight that her character brings to the field is of course the relationship that she establishes with the main character Glenn and the changes that she helps bring out in him. I also thought that their relationship though not started on the best of terms was developed rather well and I thought it was cute seeing her develop feelings for Glenn though. Overall, I thought that Sistine was an excellent character that brought a lot to the plot and that her seiyuu Akane Fujita really did an excellent job portraying her. As a result, Sistine is one of my favourite characters on the series.RumiaRumia voiced by new seiyuu Yume Miyamoto is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the man heroines of the series. A cheerful and positive 16-year-old girl Rumia attends the Alzano imperial magic academy with her best friend Sistine and is part of the class that Glenn teaches. Personality wise Rumia is a kind, caring and diligent person that while also a studious person always strives to keep arguments and disagreements in the class to the minimum. Like Sistine Rumia is a capable mage that tries hard to improve her knowledge of magic but in contrast to Sistine her intended reason for this is to improve her knowledge of magic so that she can think of ways that it can be improved so that it can be used for the benefit of all of humanity. While Rumia may look meek and innocent on the outside Rumia actually is a very brave and responsible person that tries her best to protect her friends and classmates from the danger that is drawn to her even if it meant sacrificing her life in order to protect them. Rumia and Sistine have been friends for a long time and as a result Sistine can be considered to be her best friend. As a result, both know each other very well and most often can guess on what motives are behind their actions. In the anime, this trait is mainly used by Rumia when she tries to determine Sistine’s actions with regards to her interactions with Glenn often to hilarious results to Sistine when she finds out. As a result of her personality Rumia often finds herself as the mediator when trying to deal with Sistine’s disagreements with Glenn which I found to be funny to watch.Along with Sistine Rumia also plays a role in effecting changes to Glenn’s personality and behavior though in a slightly different way. In Sistine’s case she manages to effect changes in him due to her earnest nature and passion to achieve her intended goal but in Rumia’s case the change was mainly due to the dreams and wishes that Rumia has in relation to magic and how it can be used to help people. Like Sistine Rumia tries her best to educate Glenn on what a good mage should stand for and how magic should be used though in this case this is reinforced by her own beliefs in magic as well. With Rumia’s character I really liked the fact that while quiet Rumia is still able to provide a great deal of emotional and knowledge to Glenn and the cast with her prominent trait which is determination and courage helping the most as it motivates them even more so.As with the other heroines of the show Rumia also has a sub story arc of her own that concerns her real identity and the tense relationship that she has with her real mother. I felt that this story arc was actually pretty well done as it helped establish the cause of Rumia’s meek personality as well as reveal the trauma that not only hung heavily on Rumia but also on Glenn as well. Overall, I felt that the character of Rumia was very well designed and contrasted with the other main heroines like Sistine and Re=L in personality. While certainly not as proficient in combat as Re=L or as headstrong as Sistine Rumia exhibited a kindness and determination that serves well to motivate the main cast as they deal with the threats that pop up in the story. Though this is the first time that I heard Yume Miyamoto’s voice I felt that she did a pretty good job in voicing Rumia.GlennGlenn Radars voiced by veteran voice actor Soma Saito of Qualidea code and Rokka no Yuusha fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the show. A veteran mage that has a mysterious past that is forced to find a job to support himself and on recommendation of his guardian decided to apply for a teaching post at a prestigious magic academy even though he lacked the required skills needed. Personality wise Glenn actually has two different personalities with the second being hidden behind the mask of the first that he adapts in his normal duties. Glenn’s initial personality is one that is laid back and lazy and seems to adapt the belief that he’s only here for his pay check. This personality is what the students in his class seen as Glenn started to teach them and from this I can certainly see why the students especially Sistine did not view him with confidence. Though laid back and lazy in the beginning Glenn as the series progresses mainly due to the efforts of Sistine and Rumia and to some degree Celica does start to get serious with his teaching which switches his personality to his second one.In this second personality that Glenn adapts when he gets serious with his job Glenn is notably more serious with his teaching and tries to ensure that each of his students understand the topics that he’s teaching them by breaking his topics into individual chunks that are more easily understood. Because this manner of teaching is noticeably different from how other instructors at the academy teach and because the techniques that he teaches actually have a noticeable difference Glenn’s teachings soon become more famous.Arguably from this second personality we can get a sense of what Glenn’s true personality that was hidden is actually like. When properly motivated Glenn though still retaining his prominent trait of adaptability is apart from being more serious with is job more caring towards his students and see’s each one as his responsibility. As a result, any mistake and failure that they incur is felt by Glenn as he views this as his own failure. Although overconfident and cocky at times Glenn’s confidences in his students are often based on a combination of his faith in his teachings as well as in the skills of his students and usually have a high probability of succeeding. A peculiar trait of Glenn’s is the way that he motivates his students which in this case is done usually be him not believing that his students can achieve their goal which has the effect of making his students angry and cause them to perform even better by devoting more attention to it. Though odd to see for a teacher this method of motivation that Glenn makes use was surprisingly effect as the students with Sistine at their head will try ever harder so that they can prove to Glenn that they can do it. Overall, I felt that the character of Glenn was a pretty well designed one that proves that while knowing how something works in theory is all well and good its actual experience combined with the means of adapting that knowledge that is the most useful on the field. Though a somewhat incompetent teacher at first it was nice to see Glenn develop both as a character and as a teacher over the series and seeing him develop a good working relationship with his class and also with the main heroines of Sistine, Rumia and Re=l was heart-warming to see. I felt that Soma Saito really did a pretty good job in voicing the character of Glenn.CelicaCelica voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Eri Kitamura of Yamada and the seven witches and High school of the dead fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Glenn and co’s main allies. A professor at the academy that teaches at the magic academy that Sistine and Rumia study at and also the one that recommended Glenn for the role of a lecture Celica’s personality can be best described as that of a trickster. A long living mage that seems to have extensive knowledge regarding magic in a number of different fields Celica and Glenn seem to have a close relationship as she was the one that adapted him when his parents were killed. As a result, it can be said that the foundation of the magic that started him on his path of becoming a mage actually stems from her. The relationship between the two can be seen to be a close one but not to the extent of being a romantic one as of yet. Yet it does appear that she does have a great deal of trust in him. Personality wise Celica has a rather mischievous personality in that she loves to tease Glenn though at the same time she can be equally serious as well. Celica has also proven to be pretty smart and well-read in that she’s able to deduce the identity of a curse object with only the minimum of hints. Lastly Celica can also be surprisingly understanding able to see the true reason why Glenn’s attitude towards teaching has changed and seeing how his students have affected him. In the end, I felt that Celica though not often seen was a great support character that did a lot to help Glenn and co in the story. I felt that Eri Kitamura did a pretty good job in voicing the character of Celica and though I would have liked to see her more her existing role will have to do.Re=LRe=l played by veteran seiyuu Ari Ozawa of Classroom crisis and Asterisk wars fame is one of the main support characters in the series and is one of the series three main heroines. A combat mage and a part of the empires elite mage corps division where she is partnered with Albert Re=l is a very quiet girl that prefers solitude than be with friends and indeed despite her age in which she should be in school actually has very few friends. While quiet and innocent Re=l also has limited social skills in the beginning of the series and as such rarely talked to anyone other than Albert and Glenn. Indeed, when confronted by strangers Re=l would often hid behind Glenn when present. This behavior actually reminded me of a child to which Re=L’s personality resembles. Despite that Re=l’s personality in the beginning can be described to be rather blunt and straightforward in the most comical of ways. As a result of her personality Re=l prefers things to be straightforward. Because of her limited social skills other people find it hard to approach her which is the main reason why she doesn’t have any friends. Re=L’s most prominent trait that is seen most prominently when she first appears is that she associates everything about her with Glenn which often caused an embarrassing moment for Glenn and a sense of jealousy for Sistine that I found to be pretty funny.The development of Re=l’s character in the series I felt was actually done pretty well and was tied to her sub story arc which focused on explaining her origins and her past and explain how she and Glenn actually met. This story arc I felt was pretty interesting and I have to say Re=l’s origins was really unexpected.  As the series progresses and as Re=L meets not just Glenn but also Sistine and Rumia Re=L’S personality starts to change. Though still only able to express a limited amount of expressions Re=l’s personality and demeanor starts to become more positive as she starts to make friends with not just Sistine and Rumia but also with other members of the class which had the effect of making her more happy and cheerful. This also revealed a surprisingly cute thing about her which was her love of eating desserts.  As a result of both the forming of friendships with Sistine and Rumia and accepting who she really was after completing her sub plot Re=l becomes more not just more positive and cheerful but also more determined than ever to protect those that she considers dear to her. More importantly she was able to understand the intended lesson that Glenn wanted to convey to her in this arc which was to live your own life and let people accept who you are.The most important relationship for Re=l in the series is without a doubt the one that she shares with Glenn that stems from the fact that she was saved by him and followed him when he was in the corps. As a result, his sudden disappearance was a great shock to her and ultimately was what caused her personality to be that of a recluse. This is a fact that Glenn too knows and is something that can be seen that he regrets immensely. As a result, her story arc was as much as it in revealing Re=l’s past and origins as it was in establishing the effects that Glenn’s sudden exit had on his friends.  Overall Re=l I felt was a well-designed character that had an interesting backstory and origin that really defined her. I felt that her seiyuu Ari Ozawa really did an excellent job in portraying her.EleanorEleanor voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yoko Hikasa is one of the main support characters and is one of the many villains that Glenn and co face in the series. A member of a terrorist organisation that forms this series main villain Eleanor is a devious, manipulative and deceitful person well used to manipulate people to achieve her own goals. At the same time Eleanor has been shown to have excellent combat skills that are on par with even veteran mages like Albert surprisingly. Indeed, Eleanor is the only evil mage that Glenn hasn’t had the opportunity to deal with which was surprising. Though a support character I felt that Eleanor was an interesting character that brought up the point that evil mages could be just about anybody even a simple maid like herself. Her combat scenes with Albert though were pretty interesting and I felt that her seiyuu Yoko Hikasa really did a great job in portraying her.LeoLeo voiced by veteran voice actor Kensho Ono of Aldnoah Zero and Bungou stray dogs fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of the many villains that Glenn and co has to deal with. A talented mage that Sistine is familiar with Leo is a capable, smart and well-mannered person that on the outside appears to be a perfect gentleman. Leo is also a talented speaker and teacher and excels at breaking down complex problems and explaining how each part works. In a way Leo can be considered to be a contrast to Glenn. Leo’s true nature and personality that he skilfully hides behind his mask however is vastly different to normal personality in that he is arrogant, competitive and manipulative and would trample other people’s dreams if it meant he could achieve his even quicker. The true reason that caused him to actually into a villain however was really surprising though. In a way Leo can be considered to be perhaps the best two face character I have seen in a long time mainly because his two different personalities are entirely opposite of each other. This character actually had a pretty surprising twist near the end that I though was well executed and was certainly unexpected.Arts and animationIn terms of arts and animation I felt that the character designs for the individual characters in the series was done pretty well and was largely faithful to the source material which in this case is the light novel. The design of the school uniform that Sistine and Rumia wear did of course raise some eyebrows but since this was in line with the source material I guess it can’t be helped. The designs for the uniforms that Re=L and Albert wear as part of their duties I felt was also pretty good as they helped convey a sense of authority that members of the military should have. Animation in general I felt was well done especially in relation to showing how magic in this world is used and what its effect are like. The fight scenes in this series I felt was pretty detailed and clear and allowed us to clearly see the moves that both sides made during the fight quite easily.MusicThe music for the series I felt was well done with both the opening and ending themes being my favorites as they were both catchy and positive. The scene music I felt was nice and was appropriate for the scenes that it was used in. Akashic records like most anime these days makes use of an opening and ending theme which in this case was Blow out by Konomi Suzuki and precious you which is sung by the seiyuu’s for the three main heroines in this show which is Akane Fujita for Sistine, Yume Miyamoto for Rumia and Ari Ozawa for Re=l. The opening theme I felt managed to convey a sense of excitement for the series that was welcoming and fresh while the ending theme managed to convey a sense of hope towards the future while also being catchy. Both I felt were pretty well done and matched the tone of this series as well.Voice actingVoice acting as a whole for the series I felt was excellent with particular praise going to Akane Fujita, Yume Miyamoto and Ari Ozawa who voiced the characters of Sistine, Rumia and Re=l who I felt managed to portray their respective characters really well. Soma Saito who voiced the main character Glenn I felt also did a pretty good job in portraying him.Overall conclusionOverall Akashic records was an interesting and impressive anime that had among its main strengths a strong story that was full of twists and revelations, strong and well-developed characters, excellent voice acting and excellent animation and design with regards to animation, character design and fighting scenes. Finally, it had a very strong voice cast as well. This anime is one that deserves a sequel though because it had everything that a good anime needs and without a doubt this anime is one of the best ones for this season. Most importantly the ending the series I felt was really well executed and reflected the changes that not just Glenn as a character has developed into but also in how perception of him from his class that was wary of him at first at changed as a result of the struggles that they been through together.The overall plot line for Akashic records I felt was pretty interesting and had a pretty unique premise that drew me to it. The idea of a reclusive mage that despite not having the required skills and qualifications actually become a teacher at a prestigious magic academy was a surprisingly good identity and role for the main character. As the main character is actually a teacher naturally the other main characters that he interacts with will either be students or teachers. However, it was also interesting to have characters that are connected to the main characters past also make an appearance and take key roles in the story as well. As is common in most modern anime the overall plot of the show also contains a series of sub story arcs that that are intermingled with the main plot and focus on one of the main heroines and have the effect of expanding upon the personalities and motivations of the heroines that it has as its main focus. I felt that each of these story arcs was well designed and really helped in providing context and background info on the respective heroines and what their motivations are as a person. Of the three my favorites were Re=L’s and Rumia’s. The overall plot line was also notable for having a number of sudden twists that introduced a number of situations required a good amount of quick thinking and adaptability to overcome traits of which the main character and his allies had no shortage off. Some of these situations were pretty surprising such as in the second story arc. The revelation on the identity of the true mastermind behind these incidents though surprising was introduced into the series a bit too late for him to be really effective at his role but despite that he did prove to be an interesting villain that had both conviction in his beliefs and genuine skills to back that up.The characters for the show whether main or support cast I felt was pretty well designed and had interesting personalities that only served to define them and make them really stand out. However, while their initial personalities were strong it’s the way that they are developed and improved upon that ultimately makes each of the characters special in their own right. The personality changes that each of the main characters go though as they are developed I felt was pretty good and it was nice watching them grow into more mature and better characters as the series progresses. Of the characters in the show the main cast arguably had the best in terms of character development with each of the main heroines undergoing changes in their personality as a result of not just meeting and re encountering Glenn but also as a result of their respective sub story arcs that apart from showing their origins and what caused them to develop their initial personality also served to let them find whats the most dear to them and from their discover the motivation that they need to improve themselves. Apart from the three main heroines I felt that main characters personality was developed rather well and it was heart-warming to see him develop not just as passion to teach but also care about his class and its students and more importantly be willing to put himself in harm’s way in order to protect them from threats. the main character Glenn does have some resemblance to the main character of that show.The premise behind Akashic records is a rather simple one and centers around the life of a magic instructor that has a rather dark past that one day becomes an instructor at a famed magic academy where he is charged with teaching a class of trainee mages that among their number includes some really interesting characters. However just as the main character Glenn thinks he’s earned an easy job evil forces start to make their moves and forcing Glenn to protect his students and friends from them.Story and settingThe overall story for Akashic records follows the adventure and life of the main character Glenn Radars a 21-year-old mage that despite not looking like he has the knowledge to become a magic teacher is forced to become a teacher at the famed Alzano Imperial Magic academy. Here he meets a host of interesting characters that includes Rumia a positive and cheerful girl that loves to learn and aspires to use magic to help improve the life of people and Sistine an intelligent and competent mage of noble birth that despite acting tough cares a great deal about her classmates and friends. Though Glenn’s laid-back nature and dismissive attitude towards magic antagonizes the members of the class both Glenn and the class soon find common ground after Glenn meets Rumia and Sistine and gets to know them more. However, from the shadows enemy factions begin to start their nefarious plans against the empire and Glenn and his students find themselves caught up in their plans forcing Glenn to both defeat them and defend his friends and students.The story for Akashic records is largely set within the Alzano empire a country that seems to be run by a monarchy. The Alzano empire is famed for its magic and its strong mages which are used for both offensive purposes and research purposes. Rather than using wands or staffs like in other anime and media that feature mages and magic in this world seems to be incarnation based and features a variable number of steps that must be taken before the spell can be used.SistineSistine Fibel voiced by veteran seiyuu Akane Fujita of Orange and High school fleet fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the main heroines of the show. A 16-year-old girl of noble birth that attends the magic academy that Glenn is posted to Sistine is a proud girl that has great pride in both her family and in the field of magic. At the same time, she’s also hard working and kind and cares a great deal about her friends and classmates. While also hard working Sistine is also highly motivated as a student that comes from her desire to study magic and achieve her goal into the legendary sky castle which is one of the great mysteries of the empire. Although a rich girl and a Tsundere Sistine doesn’t fit the profile of an archetypal rich girl in that she is willful and kind to all she meets and at the same time willing to put herself in the line of fire to protect them highlighting her bravery.Sistine and Glenn have an interesting relationship that forms a part of the animes main plot and serves as character development for her character.

Like Sistine Rumia is a capable mage that tries hard to improve her knowledge of magic but in contrast to Sistine her intended reason for this is to improve her knowledge of magic so that she can think of ways that it can be improved so that it can be used for the benefit of all of humanity. While Rumia may look meek and innocent on the outside Rumia actually is a very brave and responsible person that tries her best to protect her friends and classmates from the danger that is drawn to her even if it meant sacrificing her life in order to protect them. Rumia and Sistine have been friends for a long time and as a result Sistine can be considered to be her best friend.

A combat mage and a part of the empires elite mage corps division where she is partnered with Albert Re=l is a very quiet girl that prefers solitude than be with friends and indeed despite her age in which she should be in school actually has very few friends. While quiet and innocent Re=l also has limited social skills in the beginning of the series and as such rarely talked to anyone other than Albert and Glenn. Indeed, when confronted by strangers Re=l would often hid behind Glenn when present. This behavior actually reminded me of a child to which Re=L’s personality resembles. Despite that Re=l’s personality in the beginning can be described to be rather blunt and straightforward in the most comical of ways. As a result of her personality Re=l prefers things to be straightforward. Because of her limited social skills other people find it hard to approach her which is the main reason why she doesn’t have any friends. Re=L’s most prominent trait that is seen most prominently when she first appears is that she associates everything about her with Glenn which often caused an embarrassing moment for Glenn and a sense of jealousy for Sistine that I found to be pretty funny.The development of Re=l’s character in the series I felt was actually done pretty well and was tied to her sub story arc which focused on explaining her origins and her past and explain how she and Glenn actually met. This story arc I felt was pretty interesting and I have to say Re=l’s origins was really unexpected.  As the series progresses and as Re=L meets not just Glenn but also Sistine and Rumia Re=L’S personality starts to change. Though still only able to express a limited amount of expressions Re=l’s personality and demeanor starts to become more positive as she starts to make friends with not just Sistine and Rumia but also with other members of the class which had the effect of making her more happy and cheerful. This also revealed a surprisingly cute thing about her which was her love of eating desserts.  As a result of both the forming of friendships with Sistine and Rumia and accepting who she really was after completing her sub plot Re=l becomes more not just more positive and cheerful but also more determined than ever to protect those that she considers dear to her. More importantly she was able to understand the intended lesson that Glenn wanted to convey to her in this arc which was to live your own life and let people accept who you are.The most important relationship for Re=l in the series is without a doubt the one that she shares with Glenn that stems from the fact that she was saved by him and followed him when he was in the corps. As a result, his sudden disappearance was a great shock to her and ultimately was what caused her personality to be that of a recluse. This is a fact that Glenn too knows and is something that can be seen that he regrets immensely. As a result, her story arc was as much as it in revealing Re=l’s past and origins as it was in establishing the effects that Glenn’s sudden exit had on his friends.  Overall Re=l I felt was a well-designed character that had an interesting backstory and origin that really defined her. I felt that her seiyuu Ari Ozawa really did an excellent job in portraying her.EleanorEleanor voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yoko Hikasa is one of the main support characters and is one of the many villains that Glenn and co face in the series. A member of a terrorist organisation that forms this series main villain Eleanor is a devious, manipulative and deceitful person well used to manipulate people to achieve her own goals. At the same time Eleanor has been shown to have excellent combat skills that are on par with even veteran mages like Albert surprisingly. Indeed, Eleanor is the only evil mage that Glenn hasn’t had the opportunity to deal with which was surprising. Though a support character I felt that Eleanor was an interesting character that brought up the point that evil mages could be just about anybody even a simple maid like herself. Her combat scenes with Albert though were pretty interesting and I felt that her seiyuu Yoko Hikasa really did a great job in portraying her.LeoLeo voiced by veteran voice actor Kensho Ono of Aldnoah Zero and Bungou stray dogs fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of the many villains that Glenn and co has to deal with. A talented mage that Sistine is familiar with Leo is a capable, smart and well-mannered person that on the outside appears to be a perfect gentleman. Leo is also a talented speaker and teacher and excels at breaking down complex problems and explaining how each part works. In a way Leo can be considered to be a contrast to Glenn. Leo’s true nature and personality that he skilfully hides behind his mask however is vastly different to normal personality in that he is arrogant, competitive and manipulative and would trample other people’s dreams if it meant he could achieve his even quicker. The true reason that caused him to actually into a villain however was really surprising though. In a way Leo can be considered to be perhaps the best two face character I have seen in a long time mainly because his two different personalities are entirely opposite of each other. This character actually had a pretty surprising twist near the end that I though was well executed and was certainly unexpected.Arts and animationIn terms of arts and animation I felt that the character designs for the individual characters in the series was done pretty well and was largely faithful to the source material which in this case is the light novel. The design of the school uniform that Sistine and Rumia wear did of course raise some eyebrows but since this was in line with the source material I guess it can’t be helped. The designs for the uniforms that Re=L and Albert wear as part of their duties I felt was also pretty good as they helped convey a sense of authority that members of the military should have. Animation in general I felt was well done especially in relation to showing how magic in this world is used and what its effect are like. The fight scenes in this series I felt was pretty detailed and clear and allowed us to clearly see the moves that both sides made during the fight quite easily.MusicThe music for the series I felt was well done with both the opening and ending themes being my favorites as they were both catchy and positive. The scene music I felt was nice and was appropriate for the scenes that it was used in. Akashic records like most anime these days makes use of an opening and ending theme which in this case was Blow out by Konomi Suzuki and precious you which is sung by the seiyuu’s for the three main heroines in this show which is Akane Fujita for Sistine, Yume Miyamoto for Rumia and Ari Ozawa for Re=l. The opening theme I felt managed to convey a sense of excitement for the series that was welcoming and fresh while the ending theme managed to convey a sense of hope towards the future while also being catchy. Both I felt were pretty well done and matched the tone of this series as well.Voice actingVoice acting as a whole for the series I felt was excellent with particular praise going to Akane Fujita, Yume Miyamoto and Ari Ozawa who voiced the characters of Sistine, Rumia and Re=l who I felt managed to portray their respective characters really well. Soma Saito who voiced the main character Glenn I felt also did a pretty good job in portraying him.Overall conclusionOverall Akashic records was an interesting and impressive anime that had among its main strengths a strong story that was full of twists and revelations, strong and well-developed characters, excellent voice acting and excellent animation and design with regards to animation, character design and fighting scenes. Finally, it had a very strong voice cast as well. This anime is one that deserves a sequel though because it had everything that a good anime needs and without a doubt this anime is one of the best ones for this season. Most importantly the ending the series I felt was really well executed and reflected the changes that not just Glenn as a character has developed into but also in how perception of him from his class that was wary of him at first at changed as a result of the struggles that they been through together.The overall plot line for Akashic records I felt was pretty interesting and had a pretty unique premise that drew me to it. The idea of a reclusive mage that despite not having the required skills and qualifications actually become a teacher at a prestigious magic academy was a surprisingly good identity and role for the main character. As the main character is actually a teacher naturally the other main characters that he interacts with will either be students or teachers. However, it was also interesting to have characters that are connected to the main characters past also make an appearance and take key roles in the story as well. As is common in most modern anime the overall plot of the show also contains a series of sub story arcs that that are intermingled with the main plot and focus on one of the main heroines and have the effect of expanding upon the personalities and motivations of the heroines that it has as its main focus. I felt that each of these story arcs was well designed and really helped in providing context and background info on the respective heroines and what their motivations are as a person. Of the three my favorites were Re=L’s and Rumia’s. The overall plot line was also notable for having a number of sudden twists that introduced a number of situations required a good amount of quick thinking and adaptability to overcome traits of which the main character and his allies had no shortage off. Some of these situations were pretty surprising such as in the second story arc. The revelation on the identity of the true mastermind behind these incidents though surprising was introduced into the series a bit too late for him to be really effective at his role but despite that he did prove to be an interesting villain that had both conviction in his beliefs and genuine skills to back that up.The characters for the show whether main or support cast I felt was pretty well designed and had interesting personalities that only served to define them and make them really stand out. However, while their initial personalities were strong it’s the way that they are developed and improved upon that ultimately makes each of the characters special in their own right. The personality changes that each of the main characters go though as they are developed I felt was pretty good and it was nice watching them grow into more mature and better characters as the series progresses. Of the characters in the show the main cast arguably had the best in terms of character development with each of the main heroines undergoing changes in their personality as a result of not just meeting and re encountering Glenn but also as a result of their respective sub story arcs that apart from showing their origins and what caused them to develop their initial personality also served to let them find whats the most dear to them and from their discover the motivation that they need to improve themselves. Apart from the three main heroines I felt that main characters personality was developed rather well and it was heart-warming to see him develop not just as passion to teach but also care about his class and its students and more importantly be willing to put himself in harm’s way in order to protect them from threats.', 'One of the bests anime of this year.The characters are very charismatic and the world that the history is happening is very interesting.The animation is on the average, but to this studio this animations is very nice.Aparently the last 2 episodes were very rushy. But it did not break the beauty of the work.And the screenwriter leave some questions without awnsers, this was becouse they used only 4 volumes of the Light novel. This smells like a market strategy to you buy the source or a way to a new season.(the second pls ;-;)Id liked too much this anime and i recomend to people that...watched FMAB, Mahouka and DanMachi.Waiting for a second season that never will come ;-;kiss on your ass <3 watched FMAB, Mahouka and DanMachi.Waiting for a second season that never will come ;-;kiss on your ass <3', '(This review has been adapted from my blog/reddit thread. Spoilers ahead!)I inherited from my parents a tendency to keep records of the important documents I come across.Financial papers, important personal information. While not the most organized set of folders imaginable, I keep track of the details in my life that require it to make sure that things are in order on my end.Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records (or Akashic Records for short) could have done the same, keeping track of itself so that everything proceeded smoothly. Instead, it misplaces its details all over the place.STORYAkashic Records: another anime, another arc-tiered cake to devour. The...Infiltration Arc, the Necklace Arc, the Project Revive Life Arc, and the Justice Arc layer this tale for the audience to digest as best it can. Unfortunately, weak frosting and missing flavor deliver to the audience an anime that starts out somewhat appetizing but eventually devolves into a forgettable foodstuff when the last bite chomps down.The first taste starts at the top with the Kidnapping Arc. Minus the overt sexual assault scene, this arc argues for its status as the strongest of the bunch, setting the anime up for moderate success. The comedy is snappy and fun thanks to Glenn’s lazy, prideful attitude. (Indeed, said comedy is Akashic Record’s greatest strength as seen multiple times throughout the season.) The magic system takes a bit of priority with extra lessons as to its usage and construction. The plot heads for action and skirmishes as allusions to grander story beats and darker pasts appear.Altogether, a competent first arc. But, after having one’s fill, the next tier to the cake becomes a tad harder to stomach. In the Necklace Arc, again disregarding a sexualized segment involving a strange older gentleman and his fetish, the anime still does a nice job on the comedy side. For example, Sisti reinforces how cool of a dude Glenn is for involving the whole class in the field games, forcing him to double down on his nice-guy act. It also makes use of particular plot elements. Specifically, Glenn transforms into Rumia as a demonstration to one of his students, and this same transformation magic equates to the solution required to dissolve the queen’s conflict.However, this arc starts to give this cake a bitter flavor. It repeats a previous plot point – Rumia’s kidnapping – which demonstrates a lack in narrative variety way too early on in the season. Furthermore, Rumia herself somewhat out of nowhere just remembers now that Glenn was, in fact, the person who had saved her all those years ago, glossing over what was presumably setup to be a big moment between the two.Nothing too problematic for the time being. Indeed, to be fair, the new characters Re=L and Albert hope to keep the cake from falling over in their ability to sweeten the proceedings with new relationships between the cast. Then the show reaches the third arc.The Project Revive Life Arc, taking place between episodes seven and nine (inclusive), begins to turn Akashic Records into a mushy mess. It repeats, yet again, the Rumia-gets-kidnapped plot point which really makes one wonder if she shouldn’t have body guards protecting her 24/7. Regardless, the anime tries to cram in backstories about (fake) brothers and strange experiments that ultimately provide necessary info but do not lead to anything emotionally impactful. These episodes also don’t quite nail down the drama when Glenn survives despite a massive wound through his chest without ramification and when the anime fails to capitalize on incorporating his students despite their higher emphasis in the previous arc.Again, nothing here is technically horrendous in construction. But it is a whole lot of blandness as the anime does not quite have the know-how to provide a plot that reaches someplace interesting or worthwhile.Finally, in rolls in the last arc of the season, the Justice Arc, which makes the cake almost entirely unappetizing. The comedy isn’t as balanced as it was with the previous arcs, giving way for harsher happenings and more drama to unfold that it never quite got right in the first place. The plot goes with yet another “kidnapping” (read: blackmailed and forced to marry a weirdo which is basically kidnapping) scenario (but at least Sisti is the victim this time and not Rumia so that the show avoids outright repetition). And Glenn’s weirdly handled loss to “Leos” and leaving of Sisti put the story in a rough spot.For, it must be noted (and in its own separate paragraph at that) that the final episode of Akashic Records is the worst one of the season by far. It rushes forward to a ridiculous degree thanks to a couple of time skips, pushing the content forward without much regard. Moreover, a very brief flashback or two aims to draw supposed parallels between this tense situation and a similar one he encountered in the past with a girl named Sara from his memories. But, without much context of the latter, these parallels do not form well at all.Furthermore, the villain and his tactics after his big reveal are laughably silly. His final attack amounts to practically nothing, the crucifixion symbolism following his defeat is really unnecessary, and he just runs away after everything anyway. And the episode barely crams in some relevancy for Celica right at the very end with some subplot about a labyrinth that doesn’t matter at this point. The episode does have a full-circle narrative insofar as Glenn re-narrates his words from the very first episode, but that’s not nearly enough to justify the complete mess that proceeds his words.With this cake now begrudgingly devoured, it settles for a while before introducing other talking points. Specifically, each arc (more or less) focuses on a certain character and delivers a certain idea pertaining to an overarching motif on personal growth. In the first arc, Sisti showcases hope in her beliefs and the intentions behind her actions. In the second arc, Rumia wrestles with her true feelings and the notion of no regrets. In the third arc, Re=L highlights how one does not always need a reason to live if one just protects what is close to him or to her. In the fourth arc, Glenn proves how easy it is to lose one’s true self along the way.Over-reiterating at this point, but, while these ideas are not by any means explored let alone powerful, it’s nice to see that the anime had some kind of thread keeping this cake together as best it could.Still, Akashic Records uses scissors of its own accord to cut this thread. Despite the title and their potential importance, almost nothing about the so-called “Akashic Records” pops up except for a few words here and there as to their existence. Other plot points, like Melgalius’s Sky Castle or the Researchers of Divine Wisdom, do not properly resolve. And the show does not do a very good job of carrying over a lot of the details from one arc to the next, like providing more about the academy itself or using Rumia’s royal bloodline.So, while this cake doesn’t taste horrible, and the thread that binds it isn’t so much torn as it is mangled amidst sloppy extra details, the entire experience rises no higher than the absolute bare minimum in execution.ART & ANIMATIONThe main artistic element that stands out in Akashic Records is the designs for its characters. Specifically speaking, the main outfits for the girls go straight for eyeful pleasure. Exposed midriffs, skimpy skirts, garter belts, complementary colors (blue and white), extra details (tiny cat ears, ribbons).On the one hand, these designs serve their purpose of crafting a bunch of cute, ecchi looks for the female leads. On the other hand, they’re a bit too overt when taking into consideration the anime’s goals. I.e., their sexualized nature does not benefit either the story or the characters. Regardless, Glenn’s meager look – a white button-up shirt, a red tie, and a disheveled head of hair – fit his lazy, unassuming nature well. And Celica’s appearance – blonde hair, black dress, and “evil” color scheme – coincide with her witchlike persona. Meaning, not all the designs misalign.After the characters’ designs, the anime does not venture too far with either its art or its animation. It has different magic usage and skirmishes throughout the season, but variety isn’t a selling point here, and their effects usually do not amount to much besides flashy explosions. Background artistry and cinematography likewise provide nothing more than is absolutely necessary, putting the visuals in a passable state but without any flair to call their own.However, besides an incorrect coloring to a student’s eyes during a comedic bit in episode seven, the anime does not commit any egregious errors that detract from the presentation. So, the mixed designs and the serviceable visuals keep the show upright enough to carry the show from start to finish.CHARACTERSFor Akashic Records, it cares about four main characters: Sisti, Rumia, Re=L, and Glenn. Ironically, though, “care” may not be the correct word to use here.Sisti is Rumia’s “sister,” and she comes from a political family with ties to the academy she attends. Her grandfather (now passed away) inspired her to pursue the ancient wisdom surrounding magic so that she could one day go where he sadly could not. While she is not exactly a juggernaut in the field, her promise and her drive push her along nevertheless.A lot of her character revolves around fear. Fear of the truth behind how people sometimes use magic for vile deeds. Fear of going against her own beliefs. Fear of losing her friends and those close to her. Throughout the season – be it from Glenn’s harsh life lesson, Re=L’s provocations, or her own refusal to fight back – this fear grips her heart at most turns.Sisti does have her small moments throughout the season. She supports Glenn during their skirmish with the skeleton warriors in the third episode, and she trusts in their judgement during the field games to keep spirits high. Unfortunately, it takes the entire season for her to finally confront those fears of hers altogether. In the final episode, she symbolically rips off the lower half of her (unwanted and bloodied) wedding dress, choosing to stand by Glenn and up for herself rather than running away as she so regularly did in the past.While Sisti’s turnaround is appreciated, it’s a too-little-too-late inclusion. However, worse off is Rumia. A kindhearted girl, she looks after Sisti and Re=L like an older sibling does, keeping a level head about the situations they find themselves in and treating everyone around her like a true friend.She becomes the target of the baddies because of her special ability to amplify a user’s magic, a rare trait within this world. As such, she spends most of her time kidnapped or otherwise on the sidelines without contributing much, if anything, of her own. Rumia makes up with her real mother, and her occasional asides with Glenn give the audience more insight as to her thoughts and her meager backstory. But, for the most part, she does little else besides be the nice one of the group.Where Rumia barely maintains a presence as a notable character, Re=L goes one step lower and comes off as pretty pointless. From the get-go, she has two plans in mind: to always charge right at the enemy and to devote herself to Glenn indefinitely. As such, she’s very much the major comedic relief part to the group in her deadpan mannerisms and silly behavior.She’s introduced at around the episode five mark, but doesn’t have much of a place within Akashic Records immediately. Instead, it isn’t until the Project Revive Life Arc (which is where her name Re=L comes from) that her character receives attention. During these episodes, Re=L befriends, betrays, and befriends again as more of her backstory as a laboratory copy surfaces.Thus, she officially joins the cast – only to lose all relevancy afterwards. When that last arc rolls around, Re=L may as well have never existed to begin with since she does almost nothing of value throughout the last three episodes of the season. (Rumia is in the same boat here, but she at least had a role in the show from the very beginning.)With Re=L not even noteworthy as a cast member, that just leaves Glenn. While once an impressionable kid who sought to guard and to nurture the world from its evil ways, he quickly learned that magic did not follow his ideals of a complete force for good.But the audience does not learn about this detail of him right away. Instead, he presents himself as an unconventional main protagonist of sorts. Beyond lazy. Dishonest to a degree. Unfazed by the cliché dude-walks-in-on-a-bunch-of-girls-undressing scenario. Plus, he doesn’t fight normally either, relying more so on his secret weapon – the Fool’s Card – to do the exact opposite of battling with magic by negating it all around him. A fitting ability for the man who no longer loves magic.With each episode, bits and pieces of Glenn’s backstory come to light, and he teaches his students more about magic and life in general. In other words, he slowly becomes a rounder character, a stronger professor, and a better person. This transition from lazy loser to full-fledged teacher does not equate to anything nuanced, but his progress at least demonstrates an improvement for him overall.As the season nears its end, Akashic Records tries to do more with him on a personal level, but it mishandles the content. His roundabout description of himself in his aside with Sisti in episode eleven isn’t as meaningful without that aforementioned context. Furthermore, the poor attempts at linking his (presumably) beloved Sara with Sisti in episode twelve do not work well since the former’s relationship likewise does not have much of a basis.Still, his lapse of self stands as a nice contrast to his professorial role throughout the previous rest of the season. A clear indicator that he belongs alongside his students to guard and to nurture as he has always wanted rather than away and alone within a world that he does not desire.There’s one last “character” in the anime. Quotes needed because this character isn’t an individual but instead a collective. Although somewhat hinted at earlier in the season, episode four of Akashic Records turns Glenn’s whole class (minus Sisti, Rumia, and Re=L) into a cast member themselves. Some of these students form cliques and have tiny moments here and there, letting their involvement go beyond just filling space in the classroom to complement the main girls.In the end, the entire cast sadly puts forth more negatives than positives. Sisti has an arc, but it is not addressed enough. Rumia drives the plot, but she does not maintain much of a presence. Re=L makes for a completely pointless inclusion. And Glenn receives a few sides to his character, yet they are not as pronounced or as sound as necessary for his part in the anime. At least the other students do not go unnoticed, but that realization doesn’t save Akashic Records to any large extent.MUSIC & SOUND“Blow Out”, the opening track for Akaschic Records, isn’t the most original song around in the medium, but it nonetheless has a solid foundation. The dual guitar riffs. The fast-paced drumming. The clean vocals. Each part combines to form a track that follows the anime’s premise and plot while still working as a fine song on its own. The “Ahh!” is perhaps a bit too out of sync, and the background sound-effect during its second half somewhat muddies the instrumentation. But these downsides do not completely detract from the OP’s audio appeal.Opposite the OP, “Precious You☆” plays at the tail end of each episode as the show’s ending track. Slower and daintier, this beat-driven song puts more emphasis on the vocals. Multiple singers, specific sound placement, charming lyrics (“Be with me. Stay with me. You and me.”). Sadly, the ED is not as interesting as its OP counterpart, and it doesn’t catch the ear when listened to it on its own. So, while it works as a means to hear something at the end of each episode, it isn’t exactly a wonderful inclusion.Between the OP and the ED, the original soundtrack does not contain anything too notable. Violins, pianos, and wind instruments usually make up most of the music played throughout Akashic Records as it pushes ahead with its fantasy setting and its more grounded moments. However, one particular piece does stand out. It plays the sound of a cuckoo clock, coinciding with Glenn’s dunce-like persona and bringing a dash of laughter when first heard.As for the voice-acting performances, nothing too grand exists. Yume Miyamoto as Rumia stars in one of her first main roles, and, while not an incredible performance, she can clearly play kindhearted characters well. Akane Fujita as Sisti also stars in one of her first main roles, giving the “white-cat” girl cute reactions in her various scenes with Glenn. And speaking of Glenn, Soma Saito as the main protagonist deserves a small shoutout, too. When not so serious, his sillier moments give him the chance to display a fun contrast that further helps the comedy of the anime.With just the ED not pulling its weight, and the rest of the music and sound offerings supporting the anime as best as they can, the audio production for the show barely earns a passing grade.ENJOYMENTI did not pick this anime up initially during the Spring 2017 season. Some people back during its airing suggested it to me, and I myself saw all the fun they were having with it despite its somewhat common approach in the medium.From the outset, it had me laughing and entertained if for nothing else besides the character interactions and the comedy. Glenn was a silly guy in his laziness and inability to accept defeat. Sisti’s shyness, usually from the romance angle, were cute to watch, too. And even the tiny scene with her father and mother at dinner in episode four got a big chuckle out of me, enough to highlight it in my notes while watching.Past these first few or so episodes, though, the anime put higher focus on its drama and its action rather than sticking more strictly with its comedy. Because I didn’t particularly care for the serious scenes and because the action never really did anything cool, I slowly lost interest in the show as it went along.To be fair, I did occasionally laugh during the last half or so of the anime. Re=L declaring to the whole class that Glenn is her “everything” got to me. Yet, when the last episode faded to black, I found myself shrugging my shoulders, unsurprised by its decline into less-than-mediocre territory.If I had one wish, it would be for the anime to include Celica more in the festivities. Yes, the show jokes about how little screen time she has during the after-ED theater bits, but she’s attractive and fun whenever she is around. With each subsequent episode, though, I would frown at her continued absence. And so, both shrugging and frowning, the show just did not impress me much.Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records has bits and pieces going for it, but the overall project simply doesn’t come together. A bland story, a bunch of mishandled characters, and an acceptable set of art and audio design decisions create the majority of this project. Rarely interesting and usually boring, it tracks only an unfulfilled desire for better organization.SUMMARYStory: Bad, an arc-tiered cake whose subsequent layers either bloat or upset the stomachArt & Animation: Fine, mixed designs and serviceable visuals lead to a presentation that carries on well enoughCharacters: Bad, Sisti fears but without enough going for her person, Rumia drives the plot but lacks a presence otherwise, Re=L fails in her pointless involvement, Glenn tries to become a better individual, and the other students at least contributeMusic & Sound: Fine, okay offerings from the OP, the OST, and the VA performances, but the ED isn’t too intriguingEnjoyment: Bad, entertaining first few episodes, some funnies sprinkled in afterwards, but mostly a shrugged experience that needed way more CelicaFinal Score: 3/10 Infiltration Arc, the Necklace Arc, the Project Revive Life Arc, and the Justice Arc layer this tale for the audience to digest as best it can.

His final attack amounts to practically nothing, the crucifixion symbolism following his defeat is really unnecessary, and he just runs away after everything anyway. And the episode barely crams in some relevancy for Celica right at the very end with some subplot about a labyrinth that doesn’t matter at this point. The episode does have a full-circle narrative insofar as Glenn re-narrates his words from the very first episode, but that’s not nearly enough to justify the complete mess that proceeds his words.With this cake now begrudgingly devoured, it settles for a while before introducing other talking points. Specifically, each arc (more or less) focuses on a certain character and delivers a certain idea pertaining to an overarching motif on personal growth. In the first arc, Sisti showcases hope in her beliefs and the intentions behind her actions. In the second arc, Rumia wrestles with her true feelings and the notion of no regrets. In the third arc, Re=L highlights how one does not always need a reason to live if one just protects what is close to him or to her. In the fourth arc, Glenn proves how easy it is to lose one’s true self along the way.Over-reiterating at this point, but, while these ideas are not by any means explored let alone powerful, it’s nice to see that the anime had some kind of thread keeping this cake together as best it could.Still, Akashic Records uses scissors of its own accord to cut this thread. Despite the title and their potential importance, almost nothing about the so-called “Akashic Records” pops up except for a few words here and there as to their existence. Other plot points, like Melgalius’s Sky Castle or the Researchers of Divine Wisdom, do not properly resolve. And the show does not do a very good job of carrying over a lot of the details from one arc to the next, like providing more about the academy itself or using Rumia’s royal bloodline.So, while this cake doesn’t taste horrible, and the thread that binds it isn’t so much torn as it is mangled amidst sloppy extra details, the entire experience rises no higher than the absolute bare minimum in execution.ART & ANIMATIONThe main artistic element that stands out in Akashic Records is the designs for its characters. Specifically speaking, the main outfits for the girls go straight for eyeful pleasure. Exposed midriffs, skimpy skirts, garter belts, complementary colors (blue and white), extra details (tiny cat ears, ribbons).On the one hand, these designs serve their purpose of crafting a bunch of cute, ecchi looks for the female leads. On the other hand, they’re a bit too overt when taking into consideration the anime’s goals. I.e., their sexualized nature does not benefit either the story or the characters. Regardless, Glenn’s meager look – a white button-up shirt, a red tie, and a disheveled head of hair – fit his lazy, unassuming nature well. And Celica’s appearance – blonde hair, black dress, and “evil” color scheme – coincide with her witchlike persona. Meaning, not all the designs misalign.After the characters’ designs, the anime does not venture too far with either its art or its animation. It has different magic usage and skirmishes throughout the season, but variety isn’t a selling point here, and their effects usually do not amount to much besides flashy explosions. Background artistry and cinematography likewise provide nothing more than is absolutely necessary, putting the visuals in a passable state but without any flair to call their own.However, besides an incorrect coloring to a student’s eyes during a comedic bit in episode seven, the anime does not commit any egregious errors that detract from the presentation. So, the mixed designs and the serviceable visuals keep the show upright enough to carry the show from start to finish.CHARACTERSFor Akashic Records, it cares about four main characters: Sisti, Rumia, Re=L, and Glenn. Ironically, though, “care” may not be the correct word to use here.Sisti is Rumia’s “sister,” and she comes from a political family with ties to the academy she attends. Her grandfather (now passed away) inspired her to pursue the ancient wisdom surrounding magic so that she could one day go where he sadly could not. While she is not exactly a juggernaut in the field, her promise and her drive push her along nevertheless.A lot of her character revolves around fear. Fear of the truth behind how people sometimes use magic for vile deeds. Fear of going against her own beliefs. Fear of losing her friends and those close to her. Throughout the season – be it from Glenn’s harsh life lesson, Re=L’s provocations, or her own refusal to fight back – this fear grips her heart at most turns.Sisti does have her small moments throughout the season. She supports Glenn during their skirmish with the skeleton warriors in the third episode, and she trusts in their judgement during the field games to keep spirits high. Unfortunately, it takes the entire season for her to finally confront those fears of hers altogether. In the final episode, she symbolically rips off the lower half of her (unwanted and bloodied) wedding dress, choosing to stand by Glenn and up for herself rather than running away as she so regularly did in the past.While Sisti’s turnaround is appreciated, it’s a too-little-too-late inclusion. However, worse off is Rumia. A kindhearted girl, she looks after Sisti and Re=L like an older sibling does, keeping a level head about the situations they find themselves in and treating everyone around her like a true friend.She becomes the target of the baddies because of her special ability to amplify a user’s magic, a rare trait within this world. As such, she spends most of her time kidnapped or otherwise on the sidelines without contributing much, if anything, of her own. Rumia makes up with her real mother, and her occasional asides with Glenn give the audience more insight as to her thoughts and her meager backstory. But, for the most part, she does little else besides be the nice one of the group.Where Rumia barely maintains a presence as a notable character, Re=L goes one step lower and comes off as pretty pointless. From the get-go, she has two plans in mind: to always charge right at the enemy and to devote herself to Glenn indefinitely. As such, she’s very much the major comedic relief part to the group in her deadpan mannerisms and silly behavior.She’s introduced at around the episode five mark, but doesn’t have much of a place within Akashic Records immediately. Instead, it isn’t until the Project Revive Life Arc (which is where her name Re=L comes from) that her character receives attention. During these episodes, Re=L befriends, betrays, and befriends again as more of her backstory as a laboratory copy surfaces.Thus, she officially joins the cast – only to lose all relevancy afterwards. When that last arc rolls around, Re=L may as well have never existed to begin with since she does almost nothing of value throughout the last three episodes of the season. (Rumia is in the same boat here, but she at least had a role in the show from the very beginning.)With Re=L not even noteworthy as a cast member, that just leaves Glenn. While once an impressionable kid who sought to guard and to nurture the world from its evil ways, he quickly learned that magic did not follow his ideals of a complete force for good.But the audience does not learn about this detail of him right away. Instead, he presents himself as an unconventional main protagonist of sorts. Beyond lazy. Dishonest to a degree. Unfazed by the cliché dude-walks-in-on-a-bunch-of-girls-undressing scenario. Plus, he doesn’t fight normally either, relying more so on his secret weapon – the Fool’s Card – to do the exact opposite of battling with magic by negating it all around him. A fitting ability for the man who no longer loves magic.With each episode, bits and pieces of Glenn’s backstory come to light, and he teaches his students more about magic and life in general. In other words, he slowly becomes a rounder character, a stronger professor, and a better person. This transition from lazy loser to full-fledged teacher does not equate to anything nuanced, but his progress at least demonstrates an improvement for him overall.As the season nears its end, Akashic Records tries to do more with him on a personal level, but it mishandles the content. His roundabout description of himself in his aside with Sisti in episode eleven isn’t as meaningful without that aforementioned context. Furthermore, the poor attempts at linking his (presumably) beloved Sara with Sisti in episode twelve do not work well since the former’s relationship likewise does not have much of a basis.Still, his lapse of self stands as a nice contrast to his professorial role throughout the previous rest of the season. A clear indicator that he belongs alongside his students to guard and to nurture as he has always wanted rather than away and alone within a world that he does not desire.There’s one last “character” in the anime. Quotes needed because this character isn’t an individual but instead a collective. Although somewhat hinted at earlier in the season, episode four of Akashic Records turns Glenn’s whole class (minus Sisti, Rumia, and Re=L) into a cast member themselves. Some of these students form cliques and have tiny moments here and there, letting their involvement go beyond just filling space in the classroom to complement the main girls.In the end, the entire cast sadly puts forth more negatives than positives. Sisti has an arc, but it is not addressed enough. Rumia drives the plot, but she does not maintain much of a presence. Re=L makes for a completely pointless inclusion. And Glenn receives a few sides to his character, yet they are not as pronounced or as sound as necessary for his part in the anime. At least the other students do not go unnoticed, but that realization doesn’t save Akashic Records to any large extent.MUSIC & SOUND“Blow Out”, the opening track for Akaschic Records, isn’t the most original song around in the medium, but it nonetheless has a solid foundation. The dual guitar riffs. The fast-paced drumming. The clean vocals. Each part combines to form a track that follows the anime’s premise and plot while still working as a fine song on its own. The “Ahh!” is perhaps a bit too out of sync, and the background sound-effect during its second half somewhat muddies the instrumentation. But these downsides do not completely detract from the OP’s audio appeal.Opposite the OP, “Precious You☆” plays at the tail end of each episode as the show’s ending track. Slower and daintier, this beat-driven song puts more emphasis on the vocals. Multiple singers, specific sound placement, charming lyrics (“Be with me. Stay with me. You and me.”). Sadly, the ED is not as interesting as its OP counterpart, and it doesn’t catch the ear when listened to it on its own. So, while it works as a means to hear something at the end of each episode, it isn’t exactly a wonderful inclusion.Between the OP and the ED, the original soundtrack does not contain anything too notable. Violins, pianos, and wind instruments usually make up most of the music played throughout Akashic Records as it pushes ahead with its fantasy setting and its more grounded moments. However, one particular piece does stand out. It plays the sound of a cuckoo clock, coinciding with Glenn’s dunce-like persona and bringing a dash of laughter when first heard.As for the voice-acting performances, nothing too grand exists. Yume Miyamoto as Rumia stars in one of her first main roles, and, while not an incredible performance, she can clearly play kindhearted characters well. Akane Fujita as Sisti also stars in one of her first main roles, giving the “white-cat” girl cute reactions in her various scenes with Glenn. And speaking of Glenn, Soma Saito as the main protagonist deserves a small shoutout, too. When not so serious, his sillier moments give him the chance to display a fun contrast that further helps the comedy of the anime.With just the ED not pulling its weight, and the rest of the music and sound offerings supporting the anime as best as they can, the audio production for the show barely earns a passing grade.ENJOYMENTI did not pick this anime up initially during the Spring 2017 season. Some people back during its airing suggested it to me, and I myself saw all the fun they were having with it despite its somewhat common approach in the medium.From the outset, it had me laughing and entertained if for nothing else besides the character interactions and the comedy. Glenn was a silly guy in his laziness and inability to accept defeat. Sisti’s shyness, usually from the romance angle, were cute to watch, too. And even the tiny scene with her father and mother at dinner in episode four got a big chuckle out of me, enough to highlight it in my notes while watching.Past these first few or so episodes, though, the anime put higher focus on its drama and its action rather than sticking more strictly with its comedy. Because I didn’t particularly care for the serious scenes and because the action never really did anything cool, I slowly lost interest in the show as it went along.To be fair, I did occasionally laugh during the last half or so of the anime. Re=L declaring to the whole class that Glenn is her “everything” got to me. Yet, when the last episode faded to black, I found myself shrugging my shoulders, unsurprised by its decline into less-than-mediocre territory.If I had one wish, it would be for the anime to include Celica more in the festivities. Yes, the show jokes about how little screen time she has during the after-ED theater bits, but she’s attractive and fun whenever she is around. With each subsequent episode, though, I would frown at her continued absence. And so, both shrugging and frowning, the show just did not impress me much.Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records has bits and pieces going for it, but the overall project simply doesn’t come together. A bland story, a bunch of mishandled characters, and an acceptable set of art and audio design decisions create the majority of this project. Rarely interesting and usually boring, it tracks only an unfulfilled desire for better organization.SUMMARYStory: Bad, an arc-tiered cake whose subsequent layers either bloat or upset the stomachArt & Animation: Fine, mixed designs and serviceable visuals lead to a presentation that carries on well enoughCharacters: Bad, Sisti fears but without enough going for her person, Rumia drives the plot but lacks a presence otherwise, Re=L fails in her pointless involvement, Glenn tries to become a better individual, and the other students at least contributeMusic & Sound: Fine, okay offerings from the OP, the OST, and the VA performances, but the ED isn’t too intriguingEnjoyment: Bad, entertaining first few episodes, some funnies sprinkled in afterwards, but mostly a shrugged experience that needed way more CelicaFinal Score: 3/10', ""The writing kinda reminds me of SAO and not in a good way at all. The main character's writing was pretty horrible for whatever the hell they were going for. Everything else was mediocre at best. I also found that the serious lost its initial premise of the 'teacher who is lazy' rather quickly and deposited into the 'good teacher who uses different methods' archetype that was done much better in series like AssClass (kinda). Also, I felt there weren't any good characters to speak of and the world-building sucked. Also, they initially explained how magic modification was possible and then proceeded to not really...mention it. It kinda does not make sense that something that OP is not utilized by more people.

It caught my attention because it was very cheerful and fun; not often does a theme song stir positive emotions in myself.MC in this anime has the classic sad/bad past so he plays the jerk personality but actually he\'s a good guy. He also performs a few rescues and/or heroic deeds, which is high on my wish list / fantasy items for animes.Female characters in this anime are definitely above average. First of all, there\'s a mature (not MILF) teacher who...took care of the MC and wants the best for him. Very nice but no romance between them though.The other females are the students in the class in the academy. There were almost too young or even loli-like but thankfully not. IRL, there shouldn\'t be romance between student and teacher but this is an anime. So, I very much enjoyed the (mild) romance that progressed thru the story between the MC and his student, both of whom were unaware of their (""blossoming""?) relationship at the start.

Something that hopes to help you make anything out of the huge disparity between user reviews rather than add another opinion to the already varied bunch. Now then...So a show like Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records comes around and it gets some really mixed opinions. A bunch of people rate it at 3. Then there are some 9\'s. And to top it off there\'s a small handful of those who give it 7~, but never really get enough attention to reach the spotlight and be seen/read...unless you dig through the reviews.So who is right? Is is really the worst disaster that hit the Earth in this millenium? Or a work of art that deserves to be put at the forefront, for all the unbelievers to see that THIS is what anime is about? To be honest, it\'s neither and it\'s the 7\'s guys and gals that are mostly right. But to better explain, let\'s consider a different, purely theoretical example.Imagine the new Transformers movie coming out. The first screenings are done and now the viewer reviews are coming in:- There are some people who think it\'s utter crap and rate it at 3. It\'s shallow, completely uncreative, reusing the same overused tropes, the plot twists are predictable and the story lacks any meaningful message behind it. It\'s your common story about the Earth being in grave danger and only some special (care?) kid who thinks he\'s funny and his token lass (being there just because boobs) being able to save it. What MOST of them fail to notice is that you are >NOT< supposed to watch Transformers movie expecting it to forever change the way you look at your car/fridge/dildo. This, and that enjoyment can be drawn from different sources.- There are some people who think it\'s the new coming of Jesus (the 9 guys). Those are easy to explain. They are MOSTLY just a bunch of dudes jacking off to two giant robots wrestling while covered in oil and rate it at 9 rather than 10 only because there were always those 2 meatbags that constantly got in the way of more giant robot fighting.- And lastly, there are the wise ones, that put it at 6-8, stating that while it had some faults, it was nevertheless a good piece of simple, lighweight, commitment-less enjoyment.Now replace the ""giant robots"" with ""cute girls"", do a few minor tweaks in other places and you have a summary of the user reviews for Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records.I wrote this all just to say that you - whoever you are - should approach this just like you would approach a Transformers movie and watch it only when in a mood in which you would gladly watch a Transformers movie.

It seems a lot like your generic weak ass MC with a hidden past, the tsundere, the big chested teacher (Celica) and the goody two shoes. There wasn't really a clear direction and it was kind of scattered.All the episodes past episode 1 are where it starts getting good. We can see that the MC isn't as weak as we all think he is,...and he isn't a sorry excuse for a teacher. He actually knows magic but he uses hand to hand combat style pretty often so maybe he doesn't have that much mana for magic? We aren't quite sure of everything in his past but we do know that he used to serve in the Royal army of some sort and had two other comrades- forgot the first guy's name, and Re=L. Re=L is super cute, I am still confused as to whether she? is a girl or guy but I loved her since she came onto the screen.I don't mind Sisti and Rumia either. I just find it somewhat odd that Sisti has cat ears while everyone else looks normal. I haven't read the light novel or manga. Their school outfits are kind of questionable too but its an anime so whatever. I do wish that Sisti would be less tsundere, but I do like the chemistry between her and Glenn as well as Glenn with Rumia. Wouldn't mind if either of them got with Glenn. Is this supposed to be a harem? Not sure don't care. Lots of cliches in this but I think it was done right and not so in your face.Music and soundtrack are kind of forgettable but I just skip through them anyway.I like this anime so I'll continue watching it. It's a decent watch for a general audience and I'm sure one can find a likable feature by giving this a shot. and he isn't a sorry excuse for a teacher.

Otherwise I cant really recommend.Semi-Serious review belowCharactersYou have your average main character (protag-kun). Protag-kun is a depressed ex-assasin that has the mystical ability to disable all magic, with no exceptions at all whatsoever (himsef included.) too bad he almost never uses it. There are many times in the 12 episodes where that ability would of come in very handy, but is rarley ever used. Additionally, the protag-kun has the common sense of an embryo, despite being a famous, well known assassin, whose hands are too bloody to...teach children, he has absolutely no battle sense. He easily shows his back to his enemies, must be legally deaf, because two elephants having sex could sneak up on him, etc. In the introductory cut scene. at the very beginning of the first episode he is shown killing large groups of mages, but in all of his fights he struggles to kill just one. By the end of the 12 episodes, he is shown up by one of the 16(ish) year old girls in a fight against ""Evil bad Guy Villain Dude"".Two other characters are average tsundere (Girl A), complimentary kudere (Girl C), and the typical large breasted girl (Girl B). You get fun memorable characters with this show, like the guy with pink hair from episode 5(?), and Generic side-character H. Essentially what I am trying to convey is that this anime has the most cookie-cutter, generic, and clichéd characters for an anime.The villain character, ""Evil bad Guy Villain Dude"" is my second least favorite character in this anime. He is only truly introduced in the last half of the last episode. He\'s the type of, ""I\'m doing bad things because I am bad"" villain that seriously ruins entire anime. Nothing about, ""Evil bad Guy Villain Dude"" makes him feel like an actual character, rather he feels more like something that was slapped into the plot because a villain was necessary and the author had nothing better. His powers are lack luster, and apparently his magic is not effected by the protagonists ability to stop all magic.Now all the characters, though bland would at least give this series a mediocre 4/10. However I personally would give the characters a 2/10 because of, and Solely because of Girl C. If Girl C was a lamp-post than she would have been a better addition to this anime than what she is. She is a flaming hot ball of bipolar, who has no sense of what is socially acceptable, and so much of the story is ruined because of how bad her character relations are. (see bottom of the page for that)StoryStereotypical school-shounen-light novel anime that doesn\'t do a whole lot of things to stand out. Every arc of this story also is very predictable. Girl B is always the damsel in distress, Girl A is your typical tsundere, ""I\'m not helping you because I like you B-B-Baka."" that  is best friends with Girl B. She will stop at no lengths to help Girl A because of the power of friendship. As a bonus there\'s a bunch of side characters that are completely irrelevant to the plot, but the show acts like you know them anyways. Bonus!!!One additional thing I should note, which falls under Story/Characters is the Characters tone. This is probably the worst thing in the entire anime. Here are a few examples, lets see if you can catch on about why it\'s so bad,EXAMPLE 1: Terrorists walk into room and shoot magic capable of killing the students right next to Girl A\'s head. Background characters leaning forward, mouths slightly open, intensely yawning(?)EXAMPLE 2: Bloody splattered all over the walls, furniture smashed, balcony door open revealing broken railing. Background characters walk in, and say, ""Hey girl A did you see Girl B?"" Other background character quizzically asks, ""Did something Happen?"" EXAMPLE 3*ArtSkipable ED, and a terribly choreographed ultra-generic OP.BMG is acceptable, probably the best ""art"" Akashic records has to offer.very lazy animation, too many still shots / panorama\'s. Character design is, again very cookie cutter, and anyone with some knowledge of anime could accurately guess all the main character\'s roles just by looking at their designs.Overall Akashic Record\'s art is pretty deplorable, even somehow being worse than shows like Asterisk wars.VerdictI certainly cannot recommend Akashic Records to anyone who likes quality anime. There are many anime that do the same thing as Akashic Records, but do it much better, like Magi and Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei. Akashic Records currently has a 7.5(ish)/10 on mal, however I would give it a 3-4/10. If an anime were to do absolutley 0 right, and be completley boring it would get a 3/10. Akashic Records, though it does not do much did 1 thing that was mildly entertaining, and that was explaining it\'s own worlds principals of magic. However, it does absolutely nothing with these  principals later in the 12 episodes, returning to the point that everything protag-kun taught his students was only shown a few episodes after, then it completely diapered. The students in Akashic Records are never shown to have improved through the anime, which was the appeal of watching the teacher (protag-kun) in the first place. Instead the characters say they cant do something, through the power of protag-kun, they do it, then they go back into the sidelines, completely useless as if nothing ever happened.So, yeah here\'s a score""\\sum _{n=4}^{\\sqrt{16}}n / 10""(sorry for this review being inconstant, wrote this pretty late im not exactly in the right frame of mind to worry aboud sentence structure and narative flow. expect some edits.)___________________________________________________________________________extras (*contain spoilers)___________________________________________________________________________The ending is complete garbage. Like, SAO tentacle rape levels of garbage. It tries to be really clever with a denouement, and link back to the intro cutscene but it fails. The final battle is an anticlimax to an anime that is nothing but a large anticlimax.EXAMPLE 3Girl C just impaled  Protag-kun with a sword. Girl A knows it\'s Girl C, and to rub salt into her wound Girl B is attacked by Girl C and handed over to the enemies that want to kill her. Girl A, and ""Alfred"" then attempt to save protag-kun from threshold of death. They do so. Later that episode Protag-kun approaches Girl C and is completely cool being impaled and almost killed. He convinces her to switch back to his side, and acts like he was never impaled by a huge sword. they defeat the villain of that episode (Fake onii-san) and return. ~Says nothing to protag-kun who almost died~. Girl A to Girl B ""I am glad you\'re back."" Girl A to Girl C - frowns slightly, then IMMEDIATELY CRYING TO THE POINT THAT HER FUCKING TEAR-DUCTS DRY THEN WITHER, AND HUGS GIRL C TIGHTLY  ""I AM SO GLAD U R BACK"" ?wat? teach children, he has absolutely no battle sense. He easily shows his back to his enemies, must be legally deaf, because two elephants having sex could sneak up on him, etc. In the introductory cut scene. at the very beginning of the first episode he is shown killing large groups of mages, but in all of his fights he struggles to kill just one. By the end of the 12 episodes, he is shown up by one of the 16(ish) year old girls in a fight against ""Evil bad Guy Villain Dude"".Two other characters are average tsundere (Girl A), complimentary kudere (Girl C), and the typical large breasted girl (Girl B). You get fun memorable characters with this show, like the guy with pink hair from episode 5(?), and Generic side-character H. Essentially what I am trying to convey is that this anime has the most cookie-cutter, generic, and clichéd characters for an anime.The villain character, ""Evil bad Guy Villain Dude"" is my second least favorite character in this anime. He is only truly introduced in the last half of the last episode. He\'s the type of, ""I\'m doing bad things because I am bad"" villain that seriously ruins entire anime. Nothing about, ""Evil bad Guy Villain Dude"" makes him feel like an actual character, rather he feels more like something that was slapped into the plot because a villain was necessary and the author had nothing better. His powers are lack luster, and apparently his magic is not effected by the protagonists ability to stop all magic.Now all the characters, though bland would at least give this series a mediocre 4/10. However I personally would give the characters a 2/10 because of, and Solely because of Girl C. If Girl C was a lamp-post than she would have been a better addition to this anime than what she is. She is a flaming hot ball of bipolar, who has no sense of what is socially acceptable, and so much of the story is ruined because of how bad her character relations are. (see bottom of the page for that)StoryStereotypical school-shounen-light novel anime that doesn\'t do a whole lot of things to stand out. Every arc of this story also is very predictable. Girl B is always the damsel in distress, Girl A is your typical tsundere, ""I\'m not helping you because I like you B-B-Baka."" that  is best friends with Girl B. She will stop at no lengths to help Girl A because of the power of friendship.

Time to review this. Some notes:-1 for lame something, I forgot what it was already. Maybe it was the fanservice, but I think it was more than that. Oh, I remember. The stupid school uniform for the girls. What sort of school makes them wear... something... like that...? That\'s just. No. No thanks. Even if it were a super good school I don\'t think I\'d go there for that reason.-1 for super annoying characters. It was in Episode 9 or something, when I just went ""NO"".Anyhow, to the review!For starters, I wasn\'t expecting much. Really. Went in thinking ""meh another one of those super...cliché anime"" and aha, that\'s what I got.Well, it had a decent concept (that wasn\'t too original either) - but hey when can I learn what these ""Akashic Records"" even are? Well, I know what they are in general, but not in relation to the anime.Story: 5/10Was there anything I wasn\'t expecting? Not really. There was the evil organization. The overarching plot of them vs the good guys. The whole... life thing. The short tournament arc. The usual. I don\'t really think it was unique, either, so 5/10.Art: 6/10Discounting the first note I had in the review, of course. I found nothing particularly unique or cool about the art. Just average. But I gave it a 6 for some reason.Sound: 5/10I couldn\'t hear any unique music, really. Some anime I really love the OST, but this one didn\'t have any that stuck. I tend to rate sound a 10/10, but I guess this anime wasn\'t good enough. The opening song was nice, it took me a while to place Suzuki Konomi\'s voice. And the ending, I immediately knew was sung by three of the female characters. Because it sounded like one of those.The voice acting... hm... None of my (current) favorite voice actors are there, so no bias points, but I think they did a good job.Character: 3/10I like... almost none of the characters, and dislike quite a few. There were some characters with nice witty or funny lines, but those were of the minority. I don\'t know what else I can say about these characters, besides there cliché and sometimes annoying personalities. And I\'m considering giving this a -3 for the main character being a pervert. Not a big fan, and I\'m not sure why they keep adding those.Enjoyment: 8/10See, it was good enough for me to watch while I played some other game. And it only took me less than a week (while studying for various exams). That probably means I enjoyed it. But I wouldn\'t really want to watch it again, because uh... there\'s nothing I\'d watch it again for.Overall: 5.4/10.But if we factor in the two -1\'s at the beginning... It\'s a grand 3.4/10.I\'m sorry Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records.... but it\'s basically on the same rating as stuff like ""Makura no Danshi"" and uh, I nearly fell asleep watching that.In conclusion, not the best or most unique anime out there, super cliché, frustrating sometimes when the characters cry about their uselessness without doing anything, etc.But it\'s enjoyable and can be worth wasting 4.5 hours on. cliché anime"" and aha, that\'s what I got.Well, it had a decent concept (that wasn\'t too original either) - but hey when can I learn what these ""Akashic Records"" even are?

Overall the plot (the real one, not the Anime tiddies) felt rushed and it ends pretty soon, without going too much into detail.  There are Light novels and the show was probably made to sell them, but me being Anime only on this one is left with a ""meh"" feeling afterwards.I stil enjoyed watching the show. The Protagonist is a jerk with a heart of gold who rarely gets serious, but when he does it\'s nice to watch. The female lead is a Tsundere...with a dream or something, probably explained in the Light Novel. Also a lot of Background and more exploring of the world should be there, in the manual.Without it the show works fine, it\'s funny if  you don\'t want to think about it too much it\'s the show for you. But I wish they had taken their time and made like 24 episodes instead, it adapted 5 LN volumes and a lot in the later episodes was rushed.I\'m usually not a fan of Ecchi stuff either, but it\'s manageable.The best parts about the show is the Magic system, and thus the fights. It\'s hard enough, so the viewer can get an idea how everything should and will work, but it\'s stil soft enough so the writers can play with it and surprise you. The perfect mix in my opinion. The fights are cliche, but stil enjoyable and cool.

When hers favorite instructor suddenly retires, his replacement, Glenn Radars, is anything but what Sistine expected, as he appears to be lazy, incompetent and not very skilled at magic.What was missing:I would say that the anime would be much better if it had more episodes, because there are 12 episodes and there's not much to put, that's why I say that if there were 25,...or 35 more worked episodes, it would be a much better anime, there would be less break. of time, more character development and things could go slower, and definitely put in a little more drama; Rumia almost died and Sistina gave me the impression that she didn't really care about it.About the characters:In my opinion, the best characters are Re = L and Glenn, because they were the only ones who had a well explained backstory.I'm not a big fan of Rumia, it looks like she was meant to be that typical character who just gets screwed all the time. They tried to put a backstory on her, but it didn't fit very well...Sistine is also another one I don't really enjoy. No one knows anything about her other than the fact that she wants to find out more about Sky Castle (by the way, she talks about it the entire anime).Celica... disappointed me a lot. All the episodes talks about how powerful she is, and how she is the best magician on the continent, but I only saw her doing 3 spells the entire anime.And please who the fuck is Eleanor? Ok, I know she was the only one who did the Akashic Records, and got into the idea of \u200b\u200bperforming the revive spell, but what else? Akashic Records is the name of the anime, she should have been used a lot more.Art:The art is really something to admire, cute characters, pleasant to see, the characters' eyes are very big and colorful, stealing a lot of attention, and detailed and armed hair, typical of loli, an impressive scenario, very colorful and for whom like a medieval footprint, I really liked that.Sound:A great dubbing, both in Japanese, English and Portuguese (my mother language). We just need some characters' enchanting and screams to be stronger, with more desire, then it would be perfect. A very good opening, with an addictive song, I was singing all day, a great soundtrack too, placed at the right times. I didn't like ending 2 very much, but just because it's not my style of music...Overall:I would recommend it, but for someone who is starting in the otaku world and needs something lighter, buuut I would not recommend it to someone who already knows this world. or 35 more worked episodes, it would be a much better anime, there would be less break. of time, more character development and things could go slower, and definitely put in a little more drama; Rumia almost died and Sistina gave me the impression that she didn't really care about it.About the characters:In my opinion, the best characters are Re = L and Glenn, because they were the only ones who had a well explained backstory.I'm not a big fan of Rumia, it looks like she was meant to be that typical character who just gets screwed all the time. They tried to put a backstory on her, but it didn't fit very well...Sistine is also another one I don't really enjoy. No one knows anything about her other than the fact that she wants to find out more about Sky Castle (by the way, she talks about it the entire anime).Celica... disappointed me a lot. All the episodes talks about how powerful she is, and how she is the best magician on the continent, but I only saw her doing 3 spells the entire anime.And please who the fuck is Eleanor? Ok, I know she was the only one who did the Akashic Records, and got into the idea of \u200b\u200bperforming the revive spell, but what else? Akashic Records is the name of the anime, she should have been used a lot more.Art:The art is really something to admire, cute characters, pleasant to see, the characters' eyes are very big and colorful, stealing a lot of attention, and detailed and armed hair, typical of loli, an impressive scenario, very colorful and for whom like a medieval footprint, I really liked that.Sound:A great dubbing, both in Japanese, English and Portuguese (my mother language).

It had potential, well a lot of potential but failed. its  neither bad nor too good. seemed like a decent 7 for me. that magical punch( actually kick) got me their laughing but i wouldn't give it marks for comedy.the plot and story was predictable. The characters were not fully utilized. seems like like i have been giving only bad reviews.well pacing is also bad.the good thing I liked and the noticable (for me at least ) was that MAGICAL PUNCH!!!!...(but actually MAGICAL KICK!!)others are ok.I guessis 6 rating very much? (but actually MAGICAL KICK!!)others are ok.I guessis 6 rating very much?"", ""the story was good. this anime made me laugh a lot already even at episode 1. I love this anime, I hope it'll get a new season 2. I might just read its manga source if it has one since I really like this anime. I recommend to anyone finding something that can make them happy to watch this anime, it really removes your stress and exhaustion.lastly, I do think that this anime gives a lot of life lessons despite the main character being so hilarious and making jokes all the time but you'll know why he's like that if you watch this, it's a...really good anime, pls watch it really good anime, pls watch it"", ""So I'm just now getting into this anime in 2022, and I have to say I had a blast all the way through.Story: A guy with a carefree attitude, but dark past is pretty much average in anything magic, but to cope with his averageness uses basic spells in different ways rather than from what their intended purpose was used for. Becomes a professor and teaches kids his way of magic while constantly teasing the students. His personality and looks is similar to Kamina if you ever seen Gurren Lagann. You really just have 2-3 students who are also main side characters. There's also...a mystery that's just waiting to be discovered, and a villainous group who's trying to obtain that mystery. But of course there's more if they ever release season 2, but seeing as this was released in 2017, a season 2 might not happen so you're gonna have to read the manga which not many are translating it.As far as characters go. Love the relationship between the tsudere cat girl and the professor. It's pretty hilarious. Other than that you don't get much personality from any of the other students besides 2 who have a story of their own, and the other staff.Overall: I enjoyed this. I want a season 2 lol a mystery that's just waiting to be discovered, and a villainous group who's trying to obtain that mystery.

Rumia is like the overused plot after some point always in danger needs to be rescued.Not a nice back story for her either.The anime starts off good and ends up being just a normal anime.It gives little explanations here and there on how magic works but i wasnt satisfied.Mahouka Koukou no Rettousei(irregular at magic) for example is really detailed about magic and logic on how things work.In case of this anime we are given ok this spell works like this and throw in 5-6 spells.If its magic school anime we deserve to know maybe a bit more on how things work dont you think?.The anime overall becomes something like this Calm at first plot development a few character development here and there,Evil guy gets girl,hero goes to save,back story somewhere in between,hero fails gets help and resuces the end.Very overused pattern.Overall its not completely bad.There are a few puns I enjoyed like the magical punch and the first 2 episodes were really good but after that its like Black bullet not much fun.New episodes dont have live up to their expectaitions at some point.Will I watch it again? fuck no.just watch Irregular at magic school i guess not much to discuss not many new things this anime brought to anime world in that field just like my review plain and bland.Musics was fine although i didnt like the opening songs and closing songs its skipable to say the least.Character development is the main reason this anime nose dived,I feel like side characters were not given justice and u see very little to no development.Take for example the whole of class during the tournament episode there is extremely less coverage for our side characters the guys who made this should have done better always watching main characters is kind of boring and the anime looses its touch there.To be honest I only enjoyed first 2 episodes after that plot is very predictable.There are plot twists but if you are a regular in anime watching it is very predictable the hints this anime gives to the audience is almost like a taunt challenging you to figure out wtf will happen next.Glenn Radars is your typical main character shady past,overpowered skill or power we got it covered he has certain limitations which I liked about this anime,Sistene Fibel is the first female protagonist which I found can be replaced and the anime still makes lot os sense.Sure she resuces our main hero 2-3 times but no romance man she is only here for her cat ears seriously.Re=L has an interesting back story which I really like.

Rumia was the only one that was stagnant but its rare to have the naive ones change.i actually enjoyed it for that reason it didnt have massive dealbreakers for me (that school uniform was close tho) so here i am having completed it and recomanding it if you have nothing better to do. that front.sound was ok i guessthe characters started pretty tropey but they kinda grew into something better. i like that sisti wasnt written like the usual tsunderes her complaints were always valid and she was honest with her feelings. same goes for RE:L and even Glenn.

I think a lot of people got turned off by the almost rape scene and ended up not giving the series a chance. Also, with being only 12 episodes the overall plot was a little lacking. However, those were really the only flaws of the series and unfortunately the rape scene happens very early one. Aside from that, this anime has great themes in it. It is shown throughout the series, the importance of friends, family, love, and standing up for what you believe in. Do not give up on your dreams. That...is what made this anime so special. The situations that the characters had with each other tested the limits of friendship and trust. At the end of the day, it wasn't about the magic or school, it was about how interactions between characters changed them. I do not want to give anything away so you will have to watch it to find out what I mean exactly and it is worth watching. is what made this anime so special.

Im not saying this show has 0 entertainment value to be found. Now ill try to keep this short and sweet because itd be silly to put more effort into writing this review than the writers put into writing this show. Dont get me wrong i understand the appeal of this show, which happens to be more for the type of person who watches anime...to project their self into the main characters position as a wish fulfillment fantasy of sorts. Theres nothing wrong with this per say, but its definitely far from my cup of tea. The show is riddled with uninspired writing, boring characters and villains and lacks any real depth.The main characters of this show are all flat and boring and have no more depth than the archetypes that they were created around. Silver haired tsundere (sisti) is just a basic tsundere, she even makes a point to yell baka at least 3 times an episode in the most grating voice possible. The main protagonist (glen) is basic light novel protagonist type 2, the edgelord. He constantly trys to act like a lone wolf cool guy and of course gets all the underage girls he teaches affection despite his shitty demeanor. You get the point, none of the main cast is likable. The school outfits the girls have to wear cross the line between fantasy and fetish as well. The author just shamelessly put the main females in super revealing clothing and garter belts. Typically im fairly lenient with this kind of thing but as i said previously this is past fantasy and into fetishism. If a character wants to dress like that on their own accord so be it, but for a school to force them into these clothes is just kinda sick.The story is just another uninspired high school magic acadamy based one like asterisk war or irregular at magic high. the show brings nothing unique or interesting to he table just like the other two shows i mentioned along with it. if youve seen one you might as well have seen all three. They also dont seem to know how to write a proper plot twist at all either. in the last mini arc the main villain reveals himself to be some other guy weve never even seen up to this point. on top of that the guy he was posing as was just introduced as well. as viewers we have no connection to either of these guys so finding out that he was just posing as some other guy is meaningless.The villains in this show are also as weakly writen as the protagonists. Their motivations are weak and lack elaboration. Almost all of them are just mindless murderers or rapists hat just do it because gotta be evil somehow amiright??  The writers dont spend any time making these villains seem human at all and its just another example of this shows poor writing. I dont think theres one instance of nuance being added to the villains, which just leaves them as cackling maniacs with no real presence. I can honestly say i dont remember one of their names or faces.It may be obvious by now between the title of my review and my commentary thus far but this show definitely gets a pass from me. Theres many shows that do this genre much better, Chivalry of a failed knight is one great example but theres also just many better shows out there in general. Go watch or black lagoon, sunabozu, my hero academia or psycho-pass season one if youre looking for something with action.

Let\'s go through a list of all the tropes shall we:Premature little girls that wear more revealing clothes than strippers? checkAnnoying tsundere female lead? checkThe ""other"" beautiful, kind, sweet, what every guy wishes for in a girl, supporting female lead that is also in love with the male lead? checkSomehow super incredible and genius but lazy male lead? checkThe characters are bland and nothing you haven\'t seen before if you\'ve watched any shounen anime before. I honestly don\'t understand why it\'s so incomprehensible to...animators to maybe switch things up a bit before giving the rest of the us recycled plot, characters, and design.Like of course the female lead is a huge ditz who is passionate about learning and yet is a huge tsundere. Of course she practically gets raped in the very first few episodes. Of course the idea of anyone having any romantic interest in her is unfathomable to the human brain. Of course the main character basically treats her like shit.I\'m not asking for a shoujo lmao, I\'m asking for a fair representation of both genders?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!/ animators to maybe switch things up a bit before giving the rest of the us recycled plot, characters, and design.Like of course the female lead is a huge ditz who is passionate about learning and yet is a huge tsundere.

It\'s a show that, while lacking in plot development and confusing at times, is entertaining enough on its own to keep you watching until the end. Additionally, if you enjoy watching shows with an OP protagonist, you\'ll feel relatively at home here. Overall, I would give it a 7.5/10 rounded to 8, and a 5/10 rewatchability score.Plot: 6/10Akashic Records\' plot development leaves a lot to be desired. My biggest issue with it was the seemingly random lead-ins between arcs. In a strange way, the...show is lacking in filler episodes that would help with the flow of the overall storyline. If Akashic Records was a 26-episode series, it probably would do a lot better. Instead, its plot development feels very crammed, and even cliche at times. A good comparison would be to imagine the entirety of Zero no Tsukaima compacted into one 13-episode season. And unlike ZnT, story arcs in Akashic Records just seem to happen without any clear indication as to why, and is often lacking a good backstory. Also, for an average anime enjoyer, the resolution of each arc isn\'t necessarily predictable, but don\'t feel very satisfying.Character: 8.5/10Akashic Records make up for its plot shortcomings by its much better character work. While it\'s essentially a harem anime, it goes very light on the romance fan-service, and actually takes time to flesh out each girl\'s attraction to the protagonist. Much of the romance plot is pushed along by the main story, rather than being shoved in your face, which makes it a lot more enjoyable and meaningful. Although, the MC can be a bit of an ass sometimes, so be prepared for a little bit of frustration.In terms of character interactions, there are sufficient meaningful ones to make me laugh and giggle, as well as slightly get emotional.In regards to it being a good ""OP MC anime"", the MC Glenn, is a classic overdog-posing-as-underdog trope. He\'s clearly powerful in his own right, although his actual power seems to be governed more by plot armor. However, if you\'re expecting a total beatdown, be prepared to be disappointed as he gets his ass kicked. A lot. And most of the times he does win, it\'s usually due to some sort of luck rather than overwhelming strength or intellect. At least the MC does get recognized and appreciated by his peers, so that\'s a plus.Art/Animation: 8.5/10Decent graphics that have no glaring issues.

Later when they started to develop more characters things got deeper and the development itself was great and they managed to put comical moments there and there well. We got to know the motives and history of the characters well and why things are the way they are. Story is very slice of lifeish. Main characters are not per se looking for the thing that is the ""goal of the anime?"", it is rather that enemies drive them to look for it, I think. Art is great and action scenes are good though would...have wanted something even more action packed; ref. later in review. Sound design was ok, nothing remarkable.This anime would have been 8 or 9 if it weren\'t for the more lack luster and a bit rushed ending. It was kind a disappointment that there wasn\'t really a good resolve and scenes just went by very quickly without without good tie ends, so episodes didn\'t flow smoothly. Because of this rushing we didn\'t see a good action packed all out battle in the end.Badness of the ending is most likely due to the fact that studio wanted to end in action so they had to cut development in the end short to meet the 12 ep. limit. 24 episodes most probably would have solved this so they would have had time to develop things more and give us a satisfying ending.In the end we don\'t know what would have happened but for this anime\'s score is 7,4/10, rounded to 7/10. have wanted something even more action packed; ref. later in review.

It was fun seeing Glenn's character develop though the show as he starts out looking like a lazy douchebag character yet overtime he does start to warm up to the students of his class and the main female characters while also acting like a badass when bad things start happening.The magical aspect of the show was alright, but I have definitely seen this type of magic with colourful, well detailed circles plenty of times at this point, at least the spells were pretty good.The show does start out slow as we get introduced to the characters, then the situation does start to get a bit more dire and we get introduced to some of the characters backgrounds which are kinda dark, then some characters that are introduced do pick the show up a little bit like Re=L who certainly hepled the show out a little, but after her little tantrum the show gets a little bland again as they put in a forced marriage situation which just reminded me of High School DxD and even the final battle was pretty meh too so in some cases the story did disappoint me.The characters were mostly bland apart from a few that kept the show going for me.Glenn the MC is definitely a good character and his douchey attitude towards the girls was a nice change instead of a harem or romantic aspect even though it tries to do that, nonetheless he acts like an unreliable person however he is certainly a badass when it comes to fighting his enemies and even starts to warm up to the students once he gets to know them although his constant jokes always put him on their bad sides.Sistine, Rumia and Re=L are the main female characters and each of them do vary, Sistine is the main one and is your typical Tsundere girl yet for once she didn't annoy instead she was just a bit boring and whined quite a bit sometimes saying she isn't strong enough to help anyone although you gotta give her determination some respect.Rumia is the kind and innocent girl of the trio or as I like to call her Princess Peach because she gets kidnapped about 3 times in this show and it was kinda annoying how easy it was for her to get kidnapped although she was an important figure in all of this so it is understandable, she can be pretty strong though which for a character like her is surprising which is shown during the tournament episodes.Re=L is introduced later on in the show and used to work with Glenn in the past, but she was by far the best of the three main girls and is a Kuudere and a pretty damn cute one because even though she hardly express's any feelings you can just look at her face and see the adorableness however the last thing you want to do is piss her off because not only is she good with a sword she also has a dark past where her brother was murdered which does make her go to the bad side at some point luckily this only lasts for about an episode making her character still very enjoyable.Celica is an immortal mage that is a professor at the academy and a friend of Glenn, she is very powerful and can be quite easy going although if Glenn gets on her nerve's she does shift into a Tsundere tone, she isn't really in the show much during the second half, but I still found her more interesting than most of the characters.Albert who like Re=L is an old friend of Glenn and a very powerful mage who mainly uses magical sniping, but even in close quarters you shouldn't underestimate him, much like Re=L he doesn't show much emotion although he does care for Glenn's well being and does help him out a few times during the show.The villains weren't that great and mostly just seemed like a nuisance although Eleanor was definitely one sexually crazy woman that you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley or on the streets at night.The artstyle was ok, I liked the way the city looked which reminded me of something out of Lord of the Rings which seems pretty odd and the magic that was displayed wasn't too bad either it was definitely strong enough to cause some mayhem, the uniforms that the students wore was pretty mixed reception they looked nice, but the girls uniforms just looked like they were made to make them look sexy which just didn't feel right this time considering I getting no sexual attraction from them.The action was actually pretty meh and even when it picked up it didn't impress me hell the final battle didn't make me feel amazed either and the show was surprisingly bloody which I was expecting to have in droves and I was also surprised to see guns which don't usually pop up in these settings plus seeing Glenn beat up enemies with his fist's was actually refreshing to see when people mainly rely on magic they forget that fist's are also an option.There was certainly comedy in this show and it was ok especially the relationship between Glenn and Sistine made for some decent entertainment like when Glenn would get on Sistine's nerves and she just shot him up in the air with her wind magic and the way Glenn acted around the students was also really funny and made me think that the way he acted made sure there wouldn't be any forced romance, but I was mostly wrong even though Glenn doesn't have romantic feelings for the girls Sistine looks like she kinda does by the end and honestly it just doesn't feel right.Overall this was a pretty average anime with some surprise's and funny moments here and there, but it surprise's me the most how this is one of the more popular anime's of the spring season. before, true it's magic which I haven't really seen a lot of as a main concentration for an anime though it just didn't get to me mostly. It was fun seeing Glenn's character develop though the show as he starts out looking like a lazy douchebag character yet overtime he does start to warm up to the students of his class and the main female characters while also acting like a badass when bad things start happening.The magical aspect of the show was alright, but I have definitely seen this type of magic with colourful, well detailed circles plenty of times at this point, at least the spells were pretty good.The show does start out slow as we get introduced to the characters, then the situation does start to get a bit more dire and we get introduced to some of the characters backgrounds which are kinda dark, then some characters that are introduced do pick the show up a little bit like Re=L who certainly hepled the show out a little, but after her little tantrum the show gets a little bland again as they put in a forced marriage situation which just reminded me of High School DxD and even the final battle was pretty meh too so in some cases the story did disappoint me.The characters were mostly bland apart from a few that kept the show going for me.Glenn the MC is definitely a good character and his douchey attitude towards the girls was a nice change instead of a harem or romantic aspect even though it tries to do that, nonetheless he acts like an unreliable person however he is certainly a badass when it comes to fighting his enemies and even starts to warm up to the students once he gets to know them although his constant jokes always put him on their bad sides.Sistine, Rumia and Re=L are the main female characters and each of them do vary, Sistine is the main one and is your typical Tsundere girl yet for once she didn't annoy instead she was just a bit boring and whined quite a bit sometimes saying she isn't strong enough to help anyone although you gotta give her determination some respect.Rumia is the kind and innocent girl of the trio or as I like to call her Princess Peach because she gets kidnapped about 3 times in this show and it was kinda annoying how easy it was for her to get kidnapped although she was an important figure in all of this so it is understandable, she can be pretty strong though which for a character like her is surprising which is shown during the tournament episodes.Re=L is introduced later on in the show and used to work with Glenn in the past, but she was by far the best of the three main girls and is a Kuudere and a pretty damn cute one because even though she hardly express's any feelings you can just look at her face and see the adorableness however the last thing you want to do is piss her off because not only is she good with a sword she also has a dark past where her brother was murdered which does make her go to the bad side at some point luckily this only lasts for about an episode making her character still very enjoyable.Celica is an immortal mage that is a professor at the academy and a friend of Glenn, she is very powerful and can be quite easy going although if Glenn gets on her nerve's she does shift into a Tsundere tone, she isn't really in the show much during the second half, but I still found her more interesting than most of the characters.Albert who like Re=L is an old friend of Glenn and a very powerful mage who mainly uses magical sniping, but even in close quarters you shouldn't underestimate him, much like Re=L he doesn't show much emotion although he does care for Glenn's well being and does help him out a few times during the show.The villains weren't that great and mostly just seemed like a nuisance although Eleanor was definitely one sexually crazy woman that you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley or on the streets at night.The artstyle was ok, I liked the way the city looked which reminded me of something out of Lord of the Rings which seems pretty odd and the magic that was displayed wasn't too bad either it was definitely strong enough to cause some mayhem, the uniforms that the students wore was pretty mixed reception they looked nice, but the girls uniforms just looked like they were made to make them look sexy which just didn't feel right this time considering I getting no sexual attraction from them.The action was actually pretty meh and even when it picked up it didn't impress me hell the final battle didn't make me feel amazed either and the show was surprisingly bloody which I was expecting to have in droves and I was also surprised to see guns which don't usually pop up in these settings plus seeing Glenn beat up enemies with his fist's was actually refreshing to see when people mainly rely on magic they forget that fist's are also an option.There was certainly comedy in this show and it was ok especially the relationship between

expectations for this show was pretty low, considering it has your typical fantasy, action and harem genre in it. While the anime proved my wrong, the story plot was pretty mediocre and each action scene was pretty bland. The soundtracks used are unoriginal.A lot, a lot of plot holes. While plot twist exists, but the show lack in-depth reasoning to why some sequence of events took place. Antagonists have a very shallow sense of purpose to believe in what they believed in.

Guessing, studio wanted to make this work into milking franchise, but failed. Recommendation that does it better: Irregular at magic high school.Long review:Power scaling is all over the place, at times we are to believe that Glenn, 'The Joker', is super strong, veteran of front-line magic warfare and at others, he gets beaten to a pulp by some kid or saved by his students. Same as the tone of series as a whole. At times...lives are at stake and background inhabitants people are slaughtered left and right, at others fan-service beach scenes.The romance plot of herbivore MC harem didn't add anything to the story. Didn't bother checking, but looking back, I think every other episode if not in all of them, one of harem girls was crying and expressing how hard it is to be a nobility and live on silver platter. lives are at stake and background inhabitants people are slaughtered left and right, at others fan-service beach scenes.The romance plot of herbivore MC harem didn't add anything to the story.

I really liked it and I hope there is a second season of the anime !!The anime talk about of action and fantasy, we put ourselves in the shoes of Glenn Radars, a part-time teacher in a school of magic. However, her teaching methods are somewhat particular: when she arrives at class she writes on the blackboard ""Personal Study"" and takes a nap.

The second is the final Villain of the anime, which despite having made a very careful plan from the beginning to take down Glenn, he lost very easily to me seems in the final chapter, which left me somewhat unsatisfied.But in general its was good.

I put 8/10 of the anime. That was my review. BYE!!', ""Akashic Records is a fantasy light novel adaptation that is about, shockingly, an overpowered protagonist that has both a harem and is at a magical academy. I know shocking material for fantasy anime; however, I will say that remarkable the show is not an isekai series with the protagonist instead just being an overpowered mage for some reason. However, despite not being an isekai series Akashic Records still falls into the same story pitfalls as most generic isekai series and just comes off as another bland overpowered fantasy series with the only shocking aspect being the magic academy’s uniform choice.Set predominately in an academic setting...the series focuses on the protagonist Glenn, personal journey of evolving from a perverted lazy shut-in, to a perverted lazy instructor. Don’t get me wrong as the series progresses Glenn is shown to not only be a competent instructor as he breaks down the rules of the world’s magic system to both the audience and students in an easy-to-comprehend manner, but also seems to generally care for his students.  However, before that growth occurs the viewer is unfortunately forced to watch Glenn flounder around the first few episodes as he not only struggles to act his age but also stays off an FBI watchlist. I know this initial impression is meant to give the viewer a point to see Glenn grow; however, due to his poor introduction I struggled to ever truly take him seriously, and even by the series end he never latched onto me as a character.Okay so the mc might be terrible but surely the side cast can save the plot or at the very least try to carry the series? Unfortunately, while Glenn might have been annoying and childish he at least saw some character growth something that completely missing from the side cast. First, you have the prim and proper student Sistine who serves as the series mandatory tsundere, as well as candidate A for developing an odd romantic relationship with Glenn. As a by the books tsundere, she is fine; however, outside of her romantic on and off feelings for Glenn her character doesn’t have much happening in the show. She is the best friend of Rumia, who actually does have some purpose and she has a fixation on wanting to unlock the mysteries of ancient floating civilization, but despite bringing it up a couple of times in the earlier episodes it is never brought up again so who cares. Besides Sistine is her best friend Rumia whose single defy trait for the series is that she is a magical MacGuffin that serves as the show’s damsel in distress. Seriously in a twelve-episode series, all but one of the show's arcs is about her being kidnapped and Glenn having to rescue her. In fact, every single plot point of the series can be summed up as a new school event occurring, Rumia gets abducted during a school event, Glenn fights a generic magic secret society, villain fights Glenn only for him to unveil a new magical ability and save the day. Repeat about four times and just swap out Rumia for Sistine during the final arc and you have the entire series. Outside of the core trio you also have the magic police due of stoic Albert who has little to no character info, and the Re=L whose personality is that she has the mind of a doll and a really dumb name.If you haven’t guessed already I wasn’t particularly thrilled about Akashic Records; however, if there was one oddly strong standout about the series it has to be the show’s magic system. The first few episodes take great strides to break down the rules of the world’s magic system going so far as to divulge the inner workings of incantations and how to morph and bend spells by altering their pronunciation and incantations. It was an aspect that truly felt unique for the series and was constantly being added to throughout the show with each hostage citation needing new SWAT tactical magic, heck the show even briefly has a magic tournament arc.Sadly, while the magic system goes a long way to establish the world of Akashic Records as a unique setting for a fantasy anime, its visuals and soundtrack leave much to be desired. The art style and music of the world are so painfully generic that it is barely worth mentioning with only the character designs partially standing out and even then not for a particularly positive reason. The school uniforms for the female students are bizarre, and probably the first thing you notice about the series, with their uniforms being divided into two halves attached by belts with fully exposed bellies. It is very strange and is never mentioned or explained throughout the series. Outside of that Sistine has cat ears for some reason that unique right, and Glenn has a glove fixation. Yeah, the character design isn’t particularly great, but sadly for the villains, it's even worse. The main villain of the series and leader of the secret magical society is an evil maid who is never named and is always dressed up in a maid uniform for no particular reason, and the final villain of the show is the all-powerful evil carriage driver. The only bright spot design-wise is the fight scenes have some visual flair and degree of strategy mostly due to the magic system.I can not say with a straight face that Akashic Records is a good show or even worth viewing. It is a painfully generic series with a world and characters that never try to break free from their stereotypical fantasy molds. The story is stuck on an endless loop of hostage rescue, the characters lack both good design and dialogue, and there are little to no character developments.

(Don\'t worry, i\'ll proceed without giving massive spoilers away, but I will tell vaguely of a few events.) The first...episode basically makes the MC look like a massive loser who is way overconfident and arrogant, and tries to make as many comedic moments as possible, with ""tries"" being the operative word in that statement. It isn\'t awful--obviously, I still kept watching afterwards, but it\'s certainly not the best way to try to sell your MC; not really a character I feel that I can relate to. Then the episodes that follow show him being a badass and a better person in order to try to make you think he\'s really improved, when in actuality they just really oversold his shitty personality traits in the opening episode. The story is all over the place, but still laughably predictable--theres like 4 or 5 people that are introduced that all end up being villains, and it was obvious in every instance that they were a villain, basically from the moment of their introduction. What\'s worse is this show does that lovely thing of giving you no fucking clue how much time has passed in between episodes. Yes, some episodes start at the end of the previous episode, but seeing changes in characters\' personalities from one episode to the next without seeing that natural growth of character relations is quite jarring, but I\'m starting to bleed into the ""character"" section of this review, so to conclude this section--the one positive I saw in the story was the running theme of ""the fool"" and how it relates to the MCs life.Art and Sound: 7, Usually I review these two separately, but I have nothing negative to say in these categories. I wouldn\'t say either were ""phenomenal"", but both served their purposes adequately and supported the show well.Character: 5, There were a few likable characters, but honestly, most characters in this show are completely flat. You could say some characters have changes, but most of them just build-up until they explode, or just explode randomly with no warning, and then simmer back down after. The unknown length of time-skips between random episodes certainly makes character relations perplexing, as its weird to see two characters acting incredibly friendly, when they weren\'t friends, got in a fight, resolved, and were now like close friends? Just unnatural and jarring to the experience. The villains are just a list overly cliche troupes; like they were going down a damn checklist. Not everything was awful, but I binged the whole anime this morning, and I can literally only remember like 5 character\'s names, so I feel like a 5 in this category is generous.Enjoyment: 6, It\'s the kinda thing that isn\'t awful to have run in the background while you do other stuff, but there really isn\'t enough depth in this show to really keep your attention, or at least mine.Overall: 6, Honestly, unless you wanna do what I said, and have it run in the background while you do other stuff, I wouldn\'t waste your time on this one. Its not awful, but there is certainly a wide range of anime that far surpasses this one. I genuinely didn\'t think it was an awful watch, but I have noticed the more and more I sit here and pick at Akashic Records of the Bastard Magic Instructor that it falls apart whenever I think critically about it, or even without trying. I was literally saying the ""reveals"" as they happened because the only information they go over is stuff they plan to be turning over within 3 episodes. You also gotta love the asspulls of, ""I\'m a super smart character so I\'m gonna shout out whatever other people are doing,"" because the show is dumb and forgot to introduce and teach the things to the audience before the middle of a conflict. Enough is enough though, my point is, if you want a series you can think critically about, and enjoy the thoughts you\'re having, then for your own sake, skip this one. episode basically makes the MC look like a massive loser who is way overconfident and arrogant, and tries to make as many comedic moments as possible, with ""tries"" being the operative word in that statement.

This show keeps up that standard. But it didn't have to be that way. This show has an interesting world that they pretty much failed to explore or build. They instead chose to play to tropes that have been beat to death, which really held this show back from its potential.Story:The story itself was the biggest asset and missed opportunity. The world was interesting. The mythos could've been expanded on more. They could've explained the political situation more. Instead, they decided that simple magical...school anime cliches were the best bet to draw viewers. It was like watching a major league batter go up to the plate and swing and miss at pitches down the heart of the strike zone.Art:Nothing really special here. But I will say this, the outfits the female students were a little outrageous. The fan service hurt the credibility of the show a bit.Sound:VAs were alriight, but nothing stood out from their performance. The themes also were generic-sounding.Characters:The main character was one of the better protagonists I've seen in this genre of show. He had an air of reliability, and was easily the best character of the show. A big criticism I had though was that I felt he wasn't as fleshed out of a character as I would've hoped.Enjoyment:The show underperformed, but the protagonist was cool enough to keep me entertained. The world was also interesting, even if they didn't go enough into itOverall:This show suffered from a lack of ambition. It had sturdy bones, but that was hidden underneath a bunch of excess fat. If they had taken a stronger narrative based on the world's mythos, and expanded on the main character more, the show would've been stronger. The way this show was made, you'd think they'd get another season out of it.

The clips were basically showing a guy (teacher) that didn't care or was really aggressive in his views. Example: Him saying the girls are falling in love with him kind of thing.The back story of the anime is that there is magic. This magic is usually brought to form by a) people having the ability to use it b) the casting speed, which is them saying the incantation. But of course you can shorten it based on how your mind works or make the magic do something slightly different....So the story focuses on the main character named Glenn Radar. The guy is shown as someone how didn't want to do anything, lazy, not really caring about the school. In the class there are two main students, basically, that are the focus. One is Sistine, she is the hard headed always study type person, the other is Rumia, she the soft kind girl. Not sister but there something up with them. The other thing is there are some bad guys that are trying to make a noise attacking the school. So all that happening for Glenn.Rating time:Plot: I think the basic introduction of the plot is neat. I like magic and fantasy so I had the interest. I think the anime show probably doesn't give it a justice for the plot since I feel there should be more. For 12 episodes I would say there was like 4 different progress. But progress felt like it was done already so they just re used again. I would give it a 7 out of 10Animation: The animation was great. I mean it was sometimes ecchi and when you have those ecchi scene you know they will try there best to make the animation look really good and the art style really good as well. I would give this a 7.5-8 out of 10.Sound: I watched the anime in English dub. I would say that I enjoyed most of the voice actors. The voice actor for Sistine was getting annoying as the more I watched. The music wasn't bad or good. I would give it a 6.7-7 out of 10.Character: The character introduction was done fine. They introduce them and I like the character define characteristic. The character past was done really fast and very little. That might be because of the amount of episodes and what they wanted to show to the viewer. Lastly the character development, I would say 2 out of the 3 main character made some progression. Though I would say it light. but again I would blame that on the number of episode constraint (maybe). I give it a 6 out of 10.Overall with Bias: After all said it done, I enjoyed the first half and the second half of the anime I was just watching it to complete the anime. I would give it a 6 out of 10.Recommend: Would I recommend... probably not. So the story focuses on the main character named Glenn Radar. The guy is shown as someone how didn't want to do anything, lazy, not really caring about the school. In the class there are two main students, basically, that are the focus. One is Sistine, she is the hard headed always study type person, the other is Rumia, she the soft kind girl. Not sister but there something up with them. The other thing is there are some bad guys that are trying to make a noise attacking the school. So all that happening for Glenn.Rating time:Plot: I think the basic introduction of the plot is neat. I like magic and fantasy so I had the interest. I think the anime show probably doesn't give it a justice for the plot since I feel there should be more. For 12 episodes I would say there was like 4 different progress. But progress felt like it was done already so they just re used again. I would give it a 7 out of 10Animation: The animation was great. I mean it was sometimes ecchi and when you have those ecchi scene you know they will try there best to make the animation look really good and the art style really good as well. I would give this a 7.5-8 out of 10.Sound: I watched the anime in English dub. I would say that I enjoyed most of the voice actors. The voice actor for Sistine was getting annoying as the more I watched. The music wasn't bad or good. I would give it a 6.7-7 out of 10.Character: The character introduction was done fine. They introduce them and I like the character define characteristic. The character past was done really fast and very little. That might be because of the amount of episodes and what they wanted to show to the viewer. Lastly the character development, I would say 2 out of the 3 main character made some progression. Though I would say it light. but again I would blame that on the number of episode constraint (maybe). I give it a 6 out of 10.Overall with Bias: After all said it done, I enjoyed the first half and the second half of the anime I was just watching it to complete the anime.

The cast of characters are interesting enough and all the main characters get solid development. They aren't tremendously likable, and the heroines aren't particularly original, but they're easy enough to empathize with. Glenn himself was pretty unique and seeing him establish relationships with others and deal with various problems despite his peculiar personality was interesting. The plot itself so...far is also really solid with good world building surrounding it, though as is generally the case with light novel adaptations its only begun telling the story and a lot of plot threads are still hanging. There were some interesting themes regarding justice, power, and having a place to belong, and though they were cliche they were implemented solidly enough with the ending being a great place for the series to end thematically. The action was also solid all the way through, with the final episode especially being great in this regard. And it was also positively hilarious, much more than I expected, when it tried to be. The biggest issue for the series though is that it felt rushed. This is very evident in both the really fast pacing, and some aspects such as them skipping a lot of OPs and EDs in order to fit in more content per episode. The end result is that while it manages to hit the points it needs to thematically and emotionally and all the points it probably wanted to convey are indicated, it moves too quickly and they don't have enough time to sink in. I feel this is also one of the reasons that there wasn't enough of the amazing comedy. Hence, while it does most things right, to some degree it just doesn't feel like it has that much impact.The art and character designs were really solid and surprisingly memorable. The animation was solid. The OP was great and ED was solid enough, though I remember both of them less than most shows due to them being skipped so often. The soundtrack wasn't particularly memorable. far is also really solid with good world building surrounding it, though as is generally the case with light novel adaptations its only begun telling the story and a lot of plot threads are still hanging.

But the second episode really got me hooked. It was going so well and had a big potential of making an amazing storyline, but it didn't. It sticked with this average cliche story that we have all watched, and is now so uninteresting, as well as the story came out as a cheesy fanservice instead of a decent, clearcut fantasy story. The story just revolved on Glenn saving everyone because everyone is so useless. It is cringy, though I...still love Glenn.ANIMATION: 7/10 SOUND: 6/10Animation and OST is good. But not the best still. But it is decent enough.CHARACTERS: 3/101 point for Glenn because he is actually bad ass and smart. 1 point for Albert because he is best bro and probably the only one who does not need to be saved in the anime, and instead, he held up his own ass. 1 point for Celica because she is bad ass and can hold up her own ass.As for the others, the whole anime focused around on saving the three girls included in the harem. That's it. If you want fanservice, go. If you dream of girls who are in distress, & you just want to imagine yourself saving them while pretending you are Glenn, go. But if you want quality, don't bother watching this.I just hoped the fanservice did not take over the entire freaking story. still love Glenn.ANIMATION: 7/10 SOUND: 6/10Animation and OST is good.

The battles are thoughtful and engaging, as the main character teaches his students early on that there are a number of ways to utilize magic and adjusting chants to suit their purposes. These question about the real value of magic to society is definitely not addressed deeply enough.Plot twists come fast and often and even the mandatory ""beach"" episode comes with a twist. Overall very good anime if you like magic, aloof bachelors with a dark history,...high school dramas, perverted jokes and an anti-hero. There is also some slight character progression, particularly on the part of the students growing magical abilities.Probably will not make your top ten best anime list or maybe even top twenty-five, but still worth a watch to pass the time. high school dramas, perverted jokes and an anti-hero.

As carry on watching the anime, you start to see that Glenn slowly but surely changes into the expected OP main protagonist and is cleverly masked through other characters arcs along with his own hidden backstory as well and by all means developing others as well as the mysterious main protagonist is fine and all and even better since we\'re expected him to be OP as hell but at the start but he\'s clearly not and slowly getting used to him as a karmic savant main male protagonist being a magical teacher. But from all that, it seems especially with Glenn\'s writing and development in this anime that he quickly changes into the thing he was expected to become in this anime, this is probably LA\'s biggest gripe with the anime though there are more problems along with Glenn in the process of it all.With that said, the characters in this anime is vast yet somewhat lacking as the plot\'s focus has a typical character focused arc feel to it with the added hints to Glenn\'s backstory in the process. The characters that get the most focus from this becomes Glenn himself due to him needing to be introduced with his cliched with a twist introduction as well as his development into being the badass he\'s expected to become, Rumia Tingel voiced by Yume Miyamoto, best friend of Sistine and her having a mysterious backstory to her and being the damsel in distress for the majority of the anime, though she was LA\'s favourite character in all this as she was your typical nice girl to Sistine\'s tsundereness and was a constant support to Glenn throughout the entire anime even if she was being a damsel in distress, the aforementioned tsundere Sistine Fibel voiced by Akane Fujita being the typical tsundere to Glenn as well as his minder yet the constant support of her class away from Glenn\'s affairs. One of her major problems is exactly that, she for the most part is the support to her classmates but at first was the cliched tsundere to Glenn and not much else and considering she\'s one of the defining main characters in this anime, she had more of a hand in the background than the major plotlines until it was her arc and even then her focused arc had more to do with Glenn than herself, she\'s ""nearly"" wasted potential but thankfully this anime actually paid her mind and remembered to even give her an arc that ties into Glenn. Finally we have Re=L voiced by Ari Ozawa, one of Glenn\'s old college\'s who might as well be part of Glenn\'s harem, though her arc did make her more than that. From this, the rest of the characters, from the harem nanny of Celica Arfonia voiced by Eri Kitamura (and LA\'s favourite minor character) to the many classmates are satellite to supporting characters to the 3 main leads who have arcs to them. The only other character problem LA had with Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is the most obvious one...although this anime does become unpredictable at times the one constant is that the expected villains in this anime are stock mad crazy psycho magicians but the only defense to that are that finding out who will either become really easy if you pick up the hints or some will be really unpredictable.In terms of animation by LIDENFILMS, it\'s expected of them to have some stark and unique character designs and they really do pop out at you (thus why LA really liked Celica), ohh and before LA forgets and this is an obvious point but ""yaaaaa school uniform looks like a sailor fuku stripper"" schtick...LA didn\'t really care but yes...the uniform design is weird in this one, moving on please. The magical fights are entertaining to watch and some fluidity to them albeit they fall into the ""rune spamming"" notion but that\'s the magic lore of the world of Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records at hand, nonetheless the magical battles are decent enough to watch and this anime doesn\'t skimp on the bloodlust either....hmm they still haven\'t gotten that off since Schwarzesmarken haven\'t they.And here we go, LA had been thinking about the voice work for this anime for some time especially one seiyuu but that will be a bit down the line. Soma Saito as Glenn was decent enough keeping to his character of the lazy karmic teacher who happens to be a badass but Soma Saito prideful tone can be a bit irritating at times but LA thinks that the point of that. LA really liked Yume Miyamoto as Rumia vocals overall and she had the wide range of emotions minus the annoyance that LA needed to make her easily LA\'s favoruite seiyuu of this anime. As for the other voice cast, LA really liked Eri Kitamura\'s femme fatale harem nanny-esque vocals as Celica though LA wished LA saw more of Celica in the first place and seeing Yoko Hikasa doing the psychotic villain vocals was a fresh breath of air for LA from her but again like Eri Kitamura, LA wished LA saw more of Yoko Hikasa\'s character. Now to the seiyuu your expecting LA to talk about...Akane Fujita...LA actually liked it very much (what with LA being a fan of anime tsundere\'s) as her tsundereness though brash and abrasive though with ALOT of restraint even at her worst, Akane\'s deredere vocals do come and balance things out and it\'s not just all tsun vocals from Akane. To be frank, Akane\'s role as Sistine is LA\'s most tolerable role from her for Spring 2017...but LA\'s said most tolerable not the best from her but nonetheless from ALL of this, the voice cast is decent albeit LA would have wanted other seiyuu\'s to shine in this anime.Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is a case of where an anime diverts your expectations greatly but it loses steam VERY slowly before it turns into the thing it was trying NOT to be like and this easily manifests itself into our main protagonist Glenn but just with this does it make Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records horrible?...well LA isn\'t giving this anime any grace and even then LA thinks there are much bigger fish to fry than Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records, it\'s harmless at best for LA, trying to be something new....then loses it soon afterwards from both tone, plot and characters and at worst it\'s trying to sell you light novels under the guise of it being a fresh and different magical school anime with an OP protagonist with some credit to itself.""Expectations may vary to change"" will be a very solid statement to Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records if anything. main OP protagonist Glen Radars voiced by ""Soma Saito"" being a lazy narcissistic substitute teacher for the Alzano Imperial Magic Academy and he ""at first"" is a horrible magician AS well as being weak...but that\'s soon changes the more you watch of Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records.

On one hand the inner ecchi lover in me wanted to love this show, but my practical side said it was average. What we are faced with is a standard harem/ecchi that tries to deliver a relevant plot but fails. In the story we have the OP myseryious backstory protagonist, Glenn, thrust among young highschool girls. Enter the tsundere Sistine and her friend Rumia, who are both cookie cutter characters with little to no backstory in skimpy outfits. Through this dumpster fire they call a story the three of them are caught...up in some horribly written chase the evil dark cult. I dont know if it was written from the point of view that you had read the LN because it felt like there were gaps in information we needed to know. The villains are laughable attempts at being some secret society researching to improve mankind by any means.The series looked okay, being recent but they used a lot of static images for knockouts, but the magic casting was cool. It looked and sounded unremarkable from most other shows.As I said earlier the three leads were weak. Not in strength but in character. All of them were static characters that never experienced any growth emotionally and just stayed the same. I refuse to let people tell me that when a tsundere realizes her emotions it counts as growth, I refuse them. Glenn is supposedly a strong magician from the army but you never see what made him so special that everything he does leads people to be awed. Sistine has literally no backstory she may as well be a side character with extra lines. Rumia had a chance at being acceptable, but was hindered by what is medically called a ""Blonde Bimbo"". She spent most of her important scenes being either captured or confused about what was going on. Literally the only positives about the characters was the outfits. Ecchi no more needed.But I must say no matter how trash the story, bland the characters, or lackluster the style ecchis can get it done.

The first 3 introductory episodes weren\'t very good to an enjoyment level, the first episode was a bit cringe worthy, and unfortunately doesn\'t really establish anything but set up the tropes and show you how the harem starts.The story of this series is about a ""mysterious"" I guess you could say temporary substitute teacher named Glenn Radars who\'s background becomes more apparent when flashed back...later in the series, and the whole show revolves around him and his ""class"" but more like 3 girls, Sistine, Re:L, and Rumia.The reason I say ""class"" is because throughout the show the class in generally doesn\'t really matter at all besides certain students. The class is more of a ""support when needed for Glenn"" and not a ""fundamental"" part of the show.One thing that I hated about this show story/plot wise lies with the Title and nonstop hearing of ""AKASHIC RECORDS"" its in the TITLE, and literally said god knows how many times in the show, but never gives a single thought or minute as to explaining what even IS the Akashic Records. Instead the whole plot revolves around rescuing Rumia and other girls the entire series like you\'re a knight saving the princess from the tallest tower trope in fairy tales.The story side I rate a 5 because the Akashic Records which is never talked about once in the whole story, and constant use of repetitive tropes, and cliched bullshit throughout the show made it very very boring, and on the contrary it being rushed to all hell is very nice also.Character wise I\'ve already gone into for the most part, and the characters around Glenn are all just... bland. They\'re really really boring. We have typical tsundere Sistine, typical loli Re:L, and your basic anime girl Rumia.Something I also don\'t understand though as an Academy why is it never seem frowned upon the entire series that there are students constantly trying to get with Glenn? I fail to understand that as we clearly see other teachers/faculty see how the relationship is etc. I mean, there should be a boundary usually, however that is obviously not the case in this show.On the contrary the enemies/villains in Akashic Records are even worse, not only do they all do the same stupid idea: LETS GO CAPTURE -insert whoever here- for their magic power, its done so almost Team Rocket like where there\'s never any success rate. The funny part is the amount of stupidity into some of the things that happen in the series. Not recommending this, but go rewatch some of the episodes Glenn uses the fools world and realize the laws of the card get broken whenever they need to keep the sequence going to work out how the author wants it to, and not ""what actually makes logical sense.""Art wise, you can kinda tell by how they dress all the female students like they\'re complete skanks, and the males all have the typical uniform seen in any other LN adapted magic/school/fantasy harem series dresses, so the art really isn\'t anything you haven\'t seen, and the animation also wasn\'t really different compared to anything else.The sound from the anime besides the OP was just meh. I actually really do like the opening theme for Akashic Records, but the voice actors do at least fit their respected character for the most part, but most of the time when something serious/emotional was happening it was poor.My overall enjoyment of this series was weird, it started off like ""wow this looks like its gonna be complete garbage."" to ""eh, maybe this can make a comeback?"" and then back to ""man this wasn\'t anything I haven\'t seen already."" by episode 12. I give it a 6 being fair because honestly as a harem anime standpoint it really isn\'t that bad, but it isn\'t amazing either.Overall, I\'d say if you like harem series and never get sick of them, go ahead and watch this show. Its a show where you kinda just shut your brain off to enjoy. I personally didn\'t really like the show due to the fact that it breaks its own rules, pretty bad cast overall, and just the fact the most important parts of the actual show were never talked about in the slightest. I would really only recommend watching this if you want to kill time, or just really really like harems. I rate it a 7 overall, its not like its bad, or mediocre, I\'d say its good for the most part for a harem genre show, which I generally rate it as just good or poor as is lol. later in the series, and the whole show revolves around him and his ""class"" but more like 3 girls, Sistine, Re:L, and Rumia.The reason I say ""class"" is because throughout the show the class in generally doesn\'t really matter at all besides certain students.

I actually really do like the opening theme for Akashic Records, but the voice actors do at least fit their respected character for the most part, but most of the time when something serious/emotional was happening it was poor.My overall enjoyment of this series was weird, it started off like ""wow this looks like its gonna be complete garbage."" to ""eh, maybe this can make a comeback?"" and then back to ""man this wasn\'t anything I haven\'t seen already."" by episode 12. I give it a 6 being fair because honestly as a harem anime standpoint it really isn\'t that bad, but it isn\'t amazing either.Overall, I\'d say if you like harem series and never get sick of them, go ahead and watch this show. Its a show where you kinda just shut your brain off to enjoy. I personally didn\'t really like the show due to the fact that it breaks its own rules, pretty bad cast overall, and just the fact the most important parts of the actual show were never talked about in the slightest. I would really only recommend watching this if you want to kill time, or just really really like harems. I rate it a 7 overall, its not like its bad, or mediocre, I\'d say its good for the most part for a harem genre show, which I generally rate it as just good or poor as is lol.', ""Magic high school setting, main character is the instructor. I'll tell you why I love this anime:-MC is cool and not too OP-has good humor-well explained settings(how the magic works)-The plot is interesting, magic high school setting is used too much but the show manage to develop a good stories. The MC's past, the mystery of Akashic record, Sky Castle, Tarot card users and school events.what I don't like:12 episodes only. It does not unravel the mystery of Akashic record an Sky castle.It merely sparks an interest. The character is generic pattern in anime. A bastard teacher, tsundere heroine, a plain heroine assist and several...more.Ovarall: Yes I've enjoyed this show. more.Ovarall: Yes I've enjoyed this show."", ""I expected this to be your run of the mill magic academy storyline with a perverted protagonist who gets caught up in totally crazy and suuuper awkward situations that occur in literally every anime ever with a male main character and several supporting female characters. Instead what I got was an interesting story about a substitute magic instructor who tries to open the minds of his students, and have them think about how to use magic outside of what their textbooks teach them. I also thought this was going to be a stereotypical ecchi anime, made more creepy than usual by the fact that the...main character is a teacher and his students are underage, but once I was able to look past the scanty school uniforms I ended up liking the show.One thing I should say about this anime before I briefly discuss each element of the show is this: Before you judge whether you will like the show or not, watch up to episode two. If you are wondering why I insist on doing this, it is because episode one is garbage. It is full of clichés and a whole lot of nothing important happening. However, it provides context for the events of episode two, so I still recommend you watch it. For those of you who follow the three episode rule like myself, this is not a problem. For those of you who do not follow the three episode rule, I urge you to watch through to episode two before deciding if this anime is for you or not. That being said, let's go over the aspects of the show.The story's not bad for a magical academy setting. For something that has been done a billion times over, I feel as though the creators of this show managed to put an interesting spin on it. Most magic academy stories take place from the students' perspective, but instead with this show, we get both the teacher's and students' POV's on the story. Although having the teacher as the main character is not a novel idea (e.g. Negima), the way it is presented in Akashic Records is presented well enough. Because Glenn already knows a lot about magic, the fights that take place showcase how serious he can get, while still keeping the viewer informed on the workings of magic in this universe via Glenn’s lectures to his students. In the interest of being fair, the episodes do have a habit of jumping around sometimes, and inserting filler episodes such as a beach trip. I felt as though there were several minute chunks in a few episodes that could have been cut entirely and replaced with either character development scenes or more world building scenes. But, for what the show has, it works.Not much to say about the art. It feels standard and generic, like any anime studio could have made this. Some of the background art is nice, and a few of the shots going over the different locales are nice, but for the most part it looks pleasing enough to the eye to not be considered bad. The areas where it shines are in the appearances of the magic spells.The soundtrack - from what I remember of it - is quite nice. Many of the songs that play during dialogue-heavy scenes are soothing, while music played during action scenes are upbeat and exciting! That being said, I am not exactly an expert on what makes good music and soundtracks, so I cannot say much else on it, nor do I feel confident going into detail on why it's so great.By far, the best part of the show is the characters, especially the main character, Glenn. Most anime protagonists are hotheaded boys who are kind to a fault, and get angry when someone harms their friends. Glenn's an utter bastard - true to the show's name - and is not afraid to be himself in that regard. He's lazy, rude, and shoots down the dreams of his students (at first). Yet as the show progresses, we see more and more that this bastard personality is more of a persona than a personality. This other side of him is brought out while he teaches his class, but the two students who see this side the most are Sistine and Rumia, the main supporting characters. At first glance, these two are your generic tsundere with a big dream, and deredere with a dark past. Of the two, Sistine has the bigger spotlight and goes through more development than Rumia (although the most focus goes to Glenn). The other students in Glenn's class are also quite interesting. The only problem is that we never learn much about them. None of the students' backstories or motivations are fleshed out much beyond basic personality traits and what type of magic each of them is best at, according to Glenn. This is a huge shame because I would have loved to learn more about some of the other students, as well as other supporting characters such as Albert.Ultimately, the story, art, and setting are nothing special, but the characters are all marvelous and make the show worth watching. That said, Akashic Records' biggest shortcomings are the generic setting, art style, story (to a degree), and the fact that it has a very interesting and diverse character cast, yet only fleshes out about four of those characters. In comparison, an anime such as Negima dedicates entire episodes to some of the different students, and although it never gets to every student, you're still left knowing more about them than you will with Akashic Records. In fact, I found that the students that I was most curious about were the ones who had just enough screen time for me to notice them, but not enough to remember their names. Overall though, if I was asked whether Akashic Records was worth somebody’s time to watch with a simple yes or no, I would say, “Yes.” main character is a teacher and his students are underage, but once I was able to look past the scanty school uniforms I ended up liking the show.One thing I should say about this anime before I briefly discuss each element of the show is this: Before you judge whether you will like the show or not, watch up to episode two.

Its quite cliché, your typical soft harem anime, yet it's probably the best at what it does. The plot isn't groundbreaking, the characters aren't deep and the show isn't hilarious but where it excels is being easy watching anime, where you neither have to think or concentrate and in this area its very enjoyable.To sum up, if your looking for mindless entertainment here it is, a good anime to watch if...you haven't got anything else to see. you haven't got anything else to see."", '""So today\'s class will be a self-study period...\'Cause I\'m tired""~ Yours truly, Glenn Radars (Everyone\'s beloved Sensei)What started out as one of the promising shows of the season, was let down by the rapid pacing of the story that left many fans - readers or non-source readers alike - bewildered.

Pacing of the story, MC personality might not be everyone\'s cup of tea, you don\'t even know what is Akashic Records at the end of the day and it\'s a light novel adaptation.Most light novel adaptation are borderline bad to watchable. Fortunately, Akashic Records sits above watchable but it is plagued by the pacing of the show itself. There are hardly any continuation in a light novel adaptation, since the purpose has always been to promote the source material.Also, only Japanese readers can easily access and fully comprehend the source materials. Majority of the English readers would rely on fans translation or adaptation that takes years to complete and by the time it\'s done, chances are you\'re not even gonna bother reading it. At least manga have the pictures to do the talking, even if you don\'t understand the text.Only few series are a notable exceptions, for example SAO. IMO, this trend and practice is slowly killing the anime industry. It\'s high time that producers rethink on how to run a sustainable business if budget is a concern in long run without compromising the quality of the show and fans interest, else we will forever be plagued with tons of poorly adapted LNs show every season in the years to come.Lastly,the show ended on an open note with a mixed signal, leaving behind a small hope for potential season 2 sequel, or it\'s just another gimmick by the producer trying to imply ""go read the source material for continuation, The End"" which unfortunately is a trend in the anime industry nowadays just to promote the source material.

Like really again? This sounds boring. Every season will have this kind of genre and it is very tiring to wait for a good kind of this Anime.Then there\'s this Anime that aired not long ago and it is MAGIC! So many casting, spells, seals and ""Tarot Cards"". First episode was really a killling episode especially our main protagonist. Glenn Radars.Here we have this character who is unmotivated in life and doesn\'t want to do anything besides to sleep etc. Just lazy things. He will be assigned to an academy to teach magic lesson to his class. There he meets...his class. The class 2. Full of interesting students especially our protagonists like Shironeko (The Tsun----) and Rumia (The Kind and cute one) Everything will be spoiler so prepare to take some actions.In my own watching. This anime didn\'t follow some cliches moments in other animes. It is interesting for me. I don\'t always watch Magic-school genre anime but this one captivated me episode by episode. Who knows where Tarot Cards would be interesting also. Every secrets and pasts of our characters are worth to hear and watch. Spending my time to this anime is quite good. Storyline so far is interesting. This is your typical anime but I am not sure how will this ends but it ends and this anime has ended not fair enough but bad enough to kill the mood of the viewers. It was good so far but how can I watch a forced and quick episode in the end? My hyped is not real so far in this anime. It just killed the last episode with some leftover plot and some mysteries.If this is your first watch. Please make some hesitation to watch it. You will love and not love the characters. Please beware also of our ""Magic Punch"". That is one of the reasons I love this anime.Thanks for reading it~ his class. The class 2.

Rokudenashi is kind of a tilta-whirl of an anime. The art is very cute but not overly cute, the characters are memorable for their own comical views and tropes and the story felt kind of all over the place for a bit.The protagonist and his outlook on life come into play about midway through the anime and the ending ties quite a bit of speculation up nicely and puts a bow on it. Given how the ending was portrayed and I won't say more...than that to avoid spoilers. I'd be really happy to watch a second season or even an ova to add more depth to what is actually going on in this fictional world.My likes are definitely the main trio of females in the show, their personalites and actions balance each other out perfectly to be cute and in your face but not overly annoying.The only real thing I disliked was the lack of linearity in the plot which kind of put me off until I got to the end, and the lack of brutality in the fight scenes.To argue my own negativity, the delivery left a sour taste because I kind of had predetermined notions instead of coming in with a fresh mindset and in the fight scenes that's a personal preference and shouldn't reflect badly on the anime.In summation, if schools or magic are something you enjoy in an anime. You should give this an honest watch, give it 3 eps and if you don't like it move on. than that to avoid spoilers.

The anime itself says that the protagonist (Glenn Radars) is supposedly a normal person that manages to pull off the unexpected but in the end, it seems like all of the conflicts are resolved in the same way as these other magic/school anime where he just saves the day every time without fail. As I see it, the anime saying he\'s an ordinary man is just something they say to seem slightly different...without really changing how the conflicts are resolved from the norm. It doesn\'t really stray much from around the lines of ""unmotivated teacher changes and wins over students and protects his students"". And, although this may sound lazy I feel like the pacing for the first half is slightly rushed, like he goes from unmotivated bastard to amazing teacher within the first 2 episodes iirc. The story doesn\'t really seem like it knows where it\'s going it just dramatically throws you background information on the characters while not really building up to anything or doing anything with it.For example, Re=L has her own little bit where they reveal that she\'s part of an experiment to revive or rather copy the dead and tells you about her brother that was killed.But afterwards she just goes back to acting like a normal girl while the plot just uses the fact that she\'s actually a strong when its convenient.Art & SoundI personally am not too good at being critical of more subtle details of animation or noticing background music so this section will be more on a surface level.The art itself is pretty standard and there aren\'t really any moments I can recall where the animation seemed clunky or it sounded off.But at the same time, nothing really stands out in either aspects.But for the few soundtracks that I\'ve noticed, they don\'t really seem like they stand out such as the music that they play for most fight scenes or dramatic scenes really just seem like an afterthought.Characters:The character\'s designs themselves don\'t really stand out in my opinion but it\'s better than the designs being too over the top.One main issue I have is that the anime doesn\'t really seem to know which character it wants to be the female protagonist.For the first few episodes it seems like Rumia is the protag with her being targeted by terrorists and her powers and being a princess and what not and then in the later half it seems like she becomes a side character while Sistine becomes the main female protagonist.This itself isn\'t such a bad thing, however, it just seems like it was executed poorly. This is because the story still relies on Rumia to create conflicts mainly in the form of threats or taking her hostage but she herself doesn\'t really do anything but the story revolves around one of the other characters, mainly Sistine and Re=L to reveal information about them or the current villain.Rumia seems like she should be important and to a certain extent she is but still ends up being a side character that really from what I remember just says ""I\'m glad you\'re okay, Sensei"" when she gets saved.But I digress, I\'m sorry if that bit seemed like a rant or went on too long.The characters themselves aren\'t too overused but they\'re far from original.I can personally say that I think the voices for each character matches their personalities decently well and are believeable.Enjoyment:This is an anime I was able to enjoy in the moment however, in hindsight, I probably shouldn\'t have as much as I did. If you\'re not actively trying to find faults and just watching it casually, you should be able to at least find some mild amusement.However, if you were to watch this anime critically, I don\'t think this would be too good of a choice if you\'re looking for something different or deeper. without really changing how the conflicts are resolved from the norm.

The difference is, they took the cliche` and added some variations to it, making it very enjoyable to watch.Story (8/10)Well the story is not unique. Again, it is pretty much what you can see in anime of the same genre. Magic Competitions, villains, badass mc. The story is easy to understand. The thing is, in some anime, the way they explain their magic powers is difficult to understand, but in this anime, they did a good job in explaining their magic. The only problems I see with the story is that it...is repetitive at some point and it is a bit too rushed. They crammed 5 volumes of the LN into a 12-episode anime. Even though it is crammed, it does not take any important and significant part out so it's acceptable. To sum it up, the story is quite normal but enjoyable!Art (9/10)The art is great. The magic casting, CQC scenes, and other effects are great! The design on the characters are also superb. They made cute heroines look like goddesses. Noting else could be said about the art except that it is good.Sound (10/10)Definitely the best part of this anime! The OP and the ED are both dope!I kept playing them over and over again. The OST/BGM they used is so good, and it may be the reason that this anime is hype. I will definitely listen to the OST once it's out.Character (8/10)Glenn (mc) is the best in this series. Actually, he is one of my all time favorites now next to Lelouch (Code Geass), Setsuna (Gundam 00), Shiiba Tatsuya, Kazami Yuuji (Grisaia), Kazuma (Konosuba), and Arata (Trinity 7). Glenn is basically a bastard, savage, kinda-tsundere?, easy-going teacher who trolls his students, colleagues, and enemies even in the most serious of circumstances. He never fails to amuse me. On top of that, he gets along with all his students well, especially Shiro Neko. He is not OP, but he is definitely badass. Definitely best MC of the Spring 2017.Sisti (Main Heroine, or at least that's how I fell) is a classic tsundere who at first despises Glenn because of his attitude. After saving her from being raped, Sisti begins to respect him little by little, learning how to rely on him, helping him when he needs it, and started developing feeling for him (so obvious). For me, she is the best heroine of this series, because every time Glenn is in a pinch, she was always there to help him. She fights the enemy with strong resolve. Even at the time when Glenn was dying, she was the one who stayed with him and resurrected him, with the help of Albert. In short, she is a classic tsundere gone right. Best girl for me. She also has the most favorites in this series with a very large margin compared to Rumia.Rumia is basically a kind, caring, and selfless girl. The problem with her is the she was always a damsel in distress. Every single time. She can't even fight for herself. If she could just fight even for herself, she would've been a better character.Re=L, Albert, Celica and the others are great supporting characters with their own special characteristics. Shout out to Harley (Halloween, Harvest, Harem) sensei for always being trolled by Glenn.Enjoyment (10/10)As for enjoyment, I enjoyed it to the point that I was literally waiting for new episodes to come out every Tuesday night (GMT 8). And after watching it once, I would watch it again and again especially when the episode really got me going. Best episodes for me were EP 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10.  Anyway, I would not mind having a season 2 for this. Actually, TBH, I want a season 2 for this because the ending was not satisfying. Anyway, I enjoyed it a lot!Overall (10/10)Overall, the OST, Glenn and Sisti, and the comedy was what got me going for this series. It was really fun and enjoyable. Can't wait for season 2 if there are plans for it. I would recommend this series to people who love badass MCs, magic school genre, and comedy.10/10 for me. is repetitive at some point and it is a bit too rushed. They crammed 5 volumes of the LN into a 12-episode anime. Even though it is crammed, it does not take any important and significant part out so it's acceptable. To sum it up, the story is quite normal but enjoyable!Art (9/10)The art is great. The magic casting, CQC scenes, and other effects are great! The design on the characters are also superb. They made cute heroines look like goddesses. Noting else could be said about the art except that it is good.Sound (10/10)Definitely the best part of this anime! The OP and the ED are both dope!I kept playing them over and over again. The OST/BGM they used is so good, and it may be the reason that this anime is hype. I will definitely listen to the OST once it's out.Character (8/10)Glenn (mc) is the best in this series. Actually, he is one of my all time favorites now next to Lelouch (Code Geass), Setsuna (Gundam 00), Shiiba Tatsuya, Kazami Yuuji (Grisaia), Kazuma (Konosuba), and Arata (Trinity 7). Glenn is basically a bastard, savage, kinda-tsundere?, easy-going teacher who trolls his students, colleagues, and enemies even in the most serious of circumstances. He never fails to amuse me. On top of that, he gets along with all his students well, especially Shiro Neko. He is not OP, but he is definitely badass. Definitely best MC of the Spring 2017.Sisti (Main Heroine, or at least that's how I fell) is a classic tsundere who at first despises Glenn because of his attitude. After saving her from being raped, Sisti begins to respect him little by little, learning how to rely on him, helping him when he needs it, and started developing feeling for him (so obvious). For me, she is the best heroine of this series, because every time Glenn is in a pinch, she was always there to help him. She fights the enemy with strong resolve. Even at the time when Glenn was dying, she was the one who stayed with him and resurrected him, with the help of Albert. In short, she is a classic tsundere gone right. Best girl for me. She also has the most favorites in this series with a very large margin compared to Rumia.Rumia is basically a kind, caring, and selfless girl. The problem with her is the she was always a damsel in distress. Every single time. She can't even fight for herself. If she could just fight even for herself, she would've been a better character.Re=L, Albert, Celica and the others are great supporting characters with their own special characteristics.

This review may or may not contain minor spoilers.Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records (RokuAka for short) is yet another of the required light novel adaptations of the season which showcases a story of MC-kun (in this case, Glenn) who pretends to be weak, but secretly has an immense talent or strength. He's forced into a situation with which he wants nothing to do with, and ends up meeting main love interest (in this case, Sistine). It's all said and done countless times while the setting and characters change from one place to another.RokuAka unfortunately suffers...a lot from the painfully overdone attributes and story it was given. Glenn Radars starts out as a massive dick, and ends up becoming more and more likable... or so I wish. Through the story, Glenn's reasoning and beliefs get ever so more and more frustrating to listen to. Even his laughably normal backstory of being a former pro and losing his former love interest because of his failure to be OP is just boring as hell.Beyond that, your main love interest Sistine is a boring tsun-girl who's far too dere after 4 episodes. Your best girl who's unfortunately not main love interest is vital to the story, but is actually just there to be a hostage. Your kickass girl is basically emotionless except when it comes to Glenn. *sigh*TL;DR: RokuAka is just another stereotypical light novel adaptation (just because it's a LN adaptation doesn't make it automatically bad, by the way) with the same setting, different location and different characters.

However, I was unable to like it and it is because of the characters.  First, there is the tsundere Sistine, who is quick to use violence on her own teacher.  I do not have problems with tsunderes, but when they do not hesitate to use violence on the mc, but unable to fight back against their enemies is annoying.  If Sistine is not using violence on mc, she is crying or freezing-up against the enemy.  Next comes Rumia, which most part of the show...she spends as the damsel-in-distress.  Then again, she is a princess, so she is always in another castle.  She should be training on protecting herself more.  Probably the character that I dislike the most is the one that fits the typical manga/anime trope, easily forgiven.  In manga/anime, no matter what horrible act a character commits, if they apologize all will be forgiven.  Another trope I dislike when a parent is also easily forgiven for what they did to their child, which the mother in this case is forgiven.  Later, in the anime, it was made like the mother was not that bad.  She was and she still is, but all the characters are okay with her, including her daughter. she spends as the damsel-in-distress.

However this show is neither it’s just disappointing. I have a thing for shows with good dubs this borders on good and while I did like the diction and VAs in the show I hate the lip sync which at times is very noticeable. The story is pretty bad as well if you want a summary I’ll just say nothing happens for an entire big part of the show. I know it’s hard to squeeze substantial story narratives into a 12 ep show but...it really doesn’t show in this one. This show likes to look at the characters and their drama as their form of entertainment. So how well did that turn out, well most of the heroines had little to no character development, the class has zero development, our main heroine who is given more screen time has some development that is quickly brushed away near the end and finally the most disappointing part is the MC. I liked the mc at the beginning he had the best moments out of all the cast. However I didn’t like how they tried to present him. Without spoiling it think of a MC with a horrific backstory full of death now try to slap that on a happy go lucky mc with charisma and what you get is two completely unreasonable separate mcs. The show tried to paint them as one and the same but they are so unreasonable you’ll be trying to puzzle how the show even arrived at this part. It sucks because that can be entertaining and done well in other shows but not here. The ending is why this show bumped down from a 6 to a 5. The ending is boring it tries really hard to sell that the mc had a bad backstory that completely changed him into who he is now but is so lazy that the most it does is convince you that you should have just ended at ep 11 and made season 2 about the MC working his way back into being a bad guy just so he could actually pull off the intended idea of good guy was bad guy and turns back into bad guy only to turn back into good guy again.

A única coisa que me incomodou nesses primeiros episódios (assim como no resto da série) é o ecchi desnecessário e a insinuação do relacionamento professor-aluna (que fica bem pior até o fim do anime).O maior problema mesmo é quando o anime começa a entrar em um loop: alguma menina fica em perigo e o professor vai lá e faz algo para salvá-la. Não dão tanto...tempo para entender exatamente o perigo, porque o vilão aparece em um episódio, no outro já sequestrou alguém e no próximo já foi derrotado. Senti que os antagonistas podiam ser mais bem trabalhados.O anime também peca em desenvolver qualquer outro personagem masculino além do protagonista (não necessariamente ruim, mas, além de estar um pouco cansado da Trope o personagem principal e seu harém de meninas hiper poderosas, senti que alguns tinham bastante potencial).Falando em desenvolvimento de personagem, eu gosto bastante do protagonista (mesmo com as cenas reprováveis) e das meninas principais, Rumia e Sistine. E só. Até por não ter mais gente para gostar tanto (a menina de cabelo azul também tem um desenvolvimento legal, mas o arquétipo criancinha ingênua me irrita um pouco).Outro ponto relevante é que a história termina em um cliff hanger maldito, ou seja, estamos aguardando próximas temporadas, que eu, sinceramente, espero que venham, afinal, faltam vários pontos para se amarrar nessa história.Enfim, o anime como um todo é divertido. Nada exatamente excepcional, mas tudo bem okay. Recomendo para se assistir em momentos de tédio total, sem altas expectativas.

But after the second arc it suddenly feels like filler in some long running shounen series. It just becomes: New bad guys show up, do something evil, get beaten, move to next arc. Honestly, the second arc wasn't much better, but it hadn't become a pattern at that point, so it didn't bother me as much.The characters were entertaining in the beginning, but not enough to make the second half actually enjoyable. The show went from being one I looked forward to every week...to one that I finished just because I was already almost done with it anyways.Also the uniforms are probably the worst I've ever seen. Seriously, they went with an unrealistic and impractical design that was supposed to look good, but it doesn't even do that. Maybe that's just my personal preference, but I think R=el looked way better in her first appearance than she did wearing that uniform. to one that I finished just because I was already almost done with it anyways.Also the uniforms are probably the worst I've ever seen.

Like this anime was a little weird at first as these types usually are, there's the usual revealing outfits for the girls and specifically our main women characters. But the main character Glenn, even though his personality is odd he's definitely a lovable character and one who would go to the ends of the earth to protect his students. It's an amazing story that should have the rest of its manga adapted. Glenn's storyline before he came to the academy isn't talked about much but it's...so incredibly interesting and we low key get left on a cliffhanger at the end of the 12 episodes. But I would highly recommend this anime to people who love action packed animes with cute girls, a strong main guy character and an intricate storyline.

The concept was pretty decent and a little bit cliché, but it was still fun to watch. The first couple of episodes started off with a great hype but then turned generic towards the end. Honestly, I was hoping for a whole class of badass magic users or at least have more characters get involved instead of having the story revolve on the usual three. But I guess that’s just my bias.Art: (8/10)The quality of animation is really good. The magic effects looked cool and most actions scenes were fluid.

Even the facial expressions of terror and anger among the characters sends me chills.Sound: (8/10)Loved their ost! Both intro and outro were decent as well.Characters: (7/10)I loved how the anime started out by giving the main character, Glenn, some complexity who went 180 degrees from loving magic as a child to loathing it as an adult. It gives us a little hint of mystery to his past and identity underneath all that goofy-teacher facade. I also loved how he isn’t the typical OP hero. It may seem so at first, but later on you’ll realize that’s really his true power with limits. The two sisters were great as well, though I was hoping for Sistine to be a bit more powerful but I get it, they’re still kids after all. The only thing that made me unease with the plot was the amount of subtle student-teacher puppy love (even if it’s only one-sided) as well as some sexual humor.

It is overall very rushed with 5 volumes adapted into this 12 episode season.Which might be your taste if you are looking for something that continues to have something going on, but for me it made the adaption worse. The anime will attempt to make you feel sad, but then immediately makes you toss away those feelings for cheap jokes or a...very fast resolution for each arch. Antagonist villains are cliche and easy to see while their motives are pretty simple.The characters while seemed hopeful end up not having much depth because this anime is going at lightspeed pace.

It was a rollercoaster of enjoyable at time while also a bit dull. Mainly I would say the build up moments in the beginning of each arch(which is about every 3 episodes) are the highlight being fun interactions and delving into the story. While the actual execution of each closing of the arch often were very much let downs with how fast and cliche they ended.

I have seen the average score, read a few reviews and I was like well: ""this is perfect to have some brainded fun after a long and tiring workday"". Well, I was wrong yet again. This show really surprised me. Fucking hell this is a good one.Don\'t be fooled by the comedic exterior. This is a character drama, so your personal enjoyment factor really depends on if you like the mc or not. I personally really liked the contrast between Glann\'s secret dark past, and the seemingly unclouded...joy of the school life. His character were really amazing. It was quite a while since I last stumbled upon such a well-developed, complex and relatable protagonist. On the surface he was an annoying clown who is unable take anything seriously. In reality though it was because he tried to hide his pain from his past, and he tried to keep the innocence of his ""students"", and he wanted to protectect their smiles. Now that\'s what I call a really noble goal. He was just a small guy, a cog in the big machine, and his only recognition was the smiles which he protected. He was really a commendable hero in my book. Yet, his past would let him go so easily. If this is not compelling to you, then I cannot recommend the show to you.I have to add thought that the other three main girls weren\'t so exceptional. Maybe Sistine stood out of the trio. I really appriciated her, when she realized she is too weak and she would only hinder Glann, so it is best if she just stay out of the conflict. This was a really mature thinking, and I don\'t even remember if I ever saw something like this in any anime. Ohh, and the ""kiss"" scene - parentesis intended - you\'ll know what I\'m talking about when you see it. On a second thought she had quite a few impactful scenes.One more important note. Despite all three of the girls has some kind of feelings towards the mc two of them are not in love with him. So this is not a harem shit. Finally, a show which is much more mature than that.As for the sidecharacters they are not really worth to mention. They were cardboard filler characters, but for the screentime they got it was fine.Additionally I was surprised by that this story had the guts to be bloody and dark, especially because it made contrast even stronger. However the story or the world itself is nothing new or groundbreaking. It didn\'t really bother me though, because the protagonist carried the show.The only weakness of the show is that in a few scenes it fails to convey the dread and despair properly what should be felt by the characters according to the given circumstances. It does, but is not effective enough, a little is missing.Lastly a warning. This show may trigger a few people, because it is operates with the taboo of the Teacher-Student relationship...All in all this is one of those show which is more than meets the eye. This is hidden gem, and I really glad if found it. However sometimes I really do question, if other reviewers did even bother to watch the anime. joy of the school life. His character were really amazing. It was quite a while since I last stumbled upon such a well-developed, complex and relatable protagonist. On the surface he was an annoying clown who is unable take anything seriously. In reality though it was because he tried to hide his pain from his past, and he tried to keep the innocence of his ""students"", and he wanted to protectect their smiles. Now that\'s what I call a really noble goal. He was just a small guy, a cog in the big machine, and his only recognition was the smiles which he protected. He was really a commendable hero in my book. Yet, his past would let him go so easily. If this is not compelling to you, then I cannot recommend the show to you.I have to add thought that the other three main girls weren\'t so exceptional. Maybe Sistine stood out of the trio.

What I have to say about the show is that it’s just OK. The story is nothing special, but that’s fine.Not that it’s completely unoriginal for the magic high school pseudo-genre.. the idea of the main character being a teacher instead of a student is unique. But I have to wonder if the story might have been better served by focusing on Sistine’s development instead. Sure Glenn plays an important role, but he’s already so accomplished that it’s not like the story is further enhanced through...his viewpoint.I think what doesn’t help is the anime industry’s insistence to move towards 12 episode cours. Even when the show isn’t an adaptation, they still do it. I don’t have any definitive proof, but I think that doing this really hurts light novel shows, making them cut out extra information.Perhaps I’m wrong, but either way, this show feels like it needs more episodes to breathe a bit. The first three episodes are kind of weird. Typically, that time is used to set the pace for the rest of the series, but it feels like the end rather than the beginning of a show because we’re already dealing with a high stakes situation.. the pacing is strange.I know it seems like I don’t really like this show, but that’s not true. I just feel like there’s a bit of wasted potential here. The characters are likeable and there are some funny scenes that I chuckled at, but this show is trying to do too much in too little of a time.Going back to the pacing, I think how quickly things start and stop makes it feel kind of confused and directionless. Does this want to be a dollar store Great Teacher Onizuka? or is it an action series about Glenn’s past? Or is it about Sistine achieving her dream? You could do all of them, but not in the allotted time given. Not well, at least.That’s why I think they wasted this show’s potential. They don’t deserve the payoff at the end of the season, it’s not earned. In conclusion: watch once and enjoy what it offers, and that’s it.

First write a novel yourself and make it into an anime. So now to the anime itself: Well, I found it very consistent and a lot happened there. The magic is expressive and shows its destructive side. In addition, it plays mega well again How one experiences the feelings of young love, angerup to the feeling of powerlessness and the struggle of the ex elite magic solat who wants to find his dream again and is...constantly confronted with his past anew and this is repeatedly put to the test. And being there as a teacher to protect his students from the violent magicians of this anime world.The music was often appropriate and coherent, which often raised the atmosphere, be it during a fight, a quiet scene or a conversation. The characters appeared fluid and the drawing of the characters was consistent and without little heel (angular faces, etc.). In terms of the story, it was nothing new, but on the whole looked wonderful and harmonious. Beautiful little stories were told and given back so that you could feel your way and understand. (read the novel which is also wonderfully written) Say the adaptation of the novel to the anime, I found it very successful. Conclusion: I would be very happy about further episodes of this anime because it was a lot of fun to watch and it was never boring (my opinion) and it just captivated me. So if you are into magic, a little romance and a light story as well as love drawn girls / boys (yes, they also appear there), this anime is fully recommended. constantly confronted with his past anew and this is repeatedly put to the test.

I mean, if you see the plot, you\'ll notice that this show is about: witches and magicians. It looks like something I already saw: is it basically Little Witch Academia, without the flying brooms? Basically yes lol, but I noticed that\'s more than that. Usually, I don\'t like being so harsh when it comes to make anime reviews. Akashic Records is quite enjoyable. It\'s not the best, but it\'s not the worst show I\'ve ever seen. It\'s average, ok? So, let\'s get...into it.Story: 8/10[WARNING: CONTAINS SPOILERS]To start to talk about Akashic Records, if you look my reviews, you\'ll noticed that: the most important thing, for me, on the animes (or in any show) is: the story and character development, right? The history of Akashic Records takes place on Alzano Empire, an prestigious empire due to their big magician school, when there\'s a lot of young students, learning about magic powers and techiniques, to mainly fight against the enemy faction of the Alzano. And firstly, we\'re introduced to Glenn Radars, which is a man: that when he was an child, he was aspiring to be a master magician, due to books that he read, that were given to him by Celica Arfonia, the most powerful witch on Alzano Empire, and the main creator of the magician school. Years passed, and Glenn turned to a lazy man, that was summoned by Celica, to be an substitute teacher (that after, he turns an fixed teacher on the school). And we\'re also introduced to the two main girls: Sistine and Rumia. Sistine is the daughter of the greatest magician on the Alzano (that lives on an Sky Castle), and she\'s aspiring to be an magician as good as her father. And Rumia, which is the daughter of the Alzano\'s Queen, but she was abandoned by her mother, because since when she was born, she had (and still has) an dangerous magic power, that may can turn her into an monster. So, a lot of people on Alzano are behind her, to explore her, or to make her stay away from the people, because the contact with people can feed, more and more, your bad magic power. So, these two girls (specially Sistine) aren\'t accepting Glenn as a teacher on the magician school, because Sistine noticed that he\'s lazy and a disrespect to the magic society. But, the days passed, and Glenn start to take seriously the life of a magic teacher. You know, I used the words ""magic"" and ""magician"" on my review, until here, I know lol. But, this show is about that, but not only about that. There\'s a lot of dramatic moments, which is quite tense, but there\'s a lot of funny moments (for example: Glenn disturbing Sistine, specially on the first episode. The canteen scene and the battle between Glenn and Sistine, on the 1st episode, was the funniest moments on the anime, for me. And also, when Glenn is calling Sistine as ""Shironeko"", which is: ""White Cat""). But there\'s some tense moments, such as: the beach episode (which I don\'t remember the number of the episode), when Glenn is looking to Sistine, and remembering of an deceased girl, who he met in the past (and fell in love in the past); the episode about Rumia and her mother (damn, really the relationship between them is a very deep thing: her mother abandoned her by the simple fact the she can turn to a monster, it was definitely a punch to the feels, but at the end, it was everything okay. I really wanted a scene, or a moment, that Rumia and her mother could pass more time together as a family. The fact that it doesn\'t have that scene got me a little bit frustrating, but yeah, everything ended okay, so it\'s a little bit fine at all); and on the last episode (with the Sistine\'s marriage scene and the final battle). Damn, these moments were very unexpected, and I like one thing (which is not an mentioned genre): ROMANCE. YES! You guys can\'t believe on it, but there\'s some romance on the story. It\'s a little bit visible the romance between Glenn and Sistine (even though Sistine hates him a little lol), but it\'s very cute sometimes. I definitely hated the relationship between Sistine and Leos Kleitos, because he was already an suspicious character, with suspicious intentions. Because he looks a very handsome man at the first glance, but we can\'t judge by the appearance, right? And with the course of the episodes (approaching to the end), we discovered that he was a very idiot character, right? So, I rate 8/10. It was very good, but I feel that some things are incomplete. Ok, the final of the story (last episode) was too closed, but I mean, I\'m feeling that we need to have a 2nd season, right?Art: 9/10Damn, the art is beautiful and very stunning. Some people don\'t agree with that, but the art is very great for an anime of this genre. Well, I never heard about the LIDENFILMS studio, it was very unknown for me, so I thought that they could be very sketchy about art aspects. But I just only needed to see Akashic Records, to prove the opposite (that they can make an beautiful design), right? The scenarios are very verdant, especially when it comes to more aesthetic traits. they worked really well on the castle design, and the characters design are very cute. When I started to watch it from the 1st episode, I noticed that it would have an pretty art. And it has. It\'s very detailed, and I actually need to admit: that I was very impressed and enchanted with this element. Because I mean, this will be a little bit dumb comparison, but I will compare Akashic Records and Konosuba: both of them have very similar premises (magic and Isekai), but the art of the two are very different. Konosuba\'s art is definitely more simple than Akashic Records. So, I started to watch Konosuba before Akashic (and I\'ll definitely watch it to the end, and make an review about Konosuba), and I can say: I was expecting an simple art on Akashic Records, because both of them have very similar premises, so we can expect very similiar art style, right? NO!!! It\'s very very different. While Konosuba is a funny and smoked anime (lol), Akashic Records is also about Isekai and magic, but it\'s more dramatic and romantic, right? Again, there\'s some moments that will shock you, and will give a punch to the feels. So, the art is a very freaking good element on this anime: 9/10.Sound: 8/10Ok, the opening is addictive. I still can\'t take off the refrain from my head: ""Fukadaou sae mo tobashiteikou BLOW OUT"". The guitar on the opening is the catchiest thing on the sound aspects of Akashic Records. And the background soundtracks fits so perfectly. On the funny moments, it\'s the best thing. However, I feel I missed some things, for example: there\'s some dramatic moments on the anime, that the soundtracks doesn\'t fit. Again, I liked so much of the sound element, but I don\'t know: they could do a better job on it. Again, the soundtrack is basically the same thing as the anime: ""It\'s not the worst, but it\'s not the best. It\'s average!"". Same for soundtracks. The only really greatest thing (when it comes to the music of this anime) is the opening: very excentric, very beautiful (specially the contemplative takes) and the rhythms (the guitar on opening) are very addictive. So, yeah! 8/10. I\'m giving that rate because LIDENFILMS studio also have the big potential to make great soundtracks. They got it, but not completely. It\'s a little bit catchy, but not something like: MEMORABLE, OR UNFORGETTABLE. It\'s on standard levels, the normal, okay?Characters: 7/10Ok, the characters were really well built, but there\'s some weak points. My favorite ones are the main ones: Sistine, Rumia and Glenn. But, one another defect that Akashic Records have is the character development: again, they were very well developed, but the anime just basically focused on the main characters, which is a good thing, but I really wanted a wider thing about the characters. What about the past or life about the another students (such as: Wendy Nablesse, or Theresa Reidy). Or even, about the past of Sara Silvers (one of the most intriguing girls on the whole anime). The facts and things about Sara Silvers just passed like a light flash (like really quick). I really wanted to see more about. Ok, the anime talked a lot about her, but there\'s some things I really wanted to see (like I was feeling a little bitter taste on my mouth, I was feeling I miss something). For example: how did Sara and Gleen meet each other? Why did Glenn love so much Sara? Those things weren\'t explained, if I\'m well informed, because I watched Akashic Records since a lot of months, so I don\'t remember everything of the story. So, if I\'m wrong, correct me, okay? But, again, those things (as I can remember) weren\'t explained. I feel that Tarou Hitsuji should make an movie or an OVA explaining more about her, because she was left open. At least, it was explained: how did Glenn meet Albert Frazer and Re=L. As I can remember, they met each other during an attack on Alzano Empire (years ago), and Re=L almost knife Glenn lol that was intriguing, but they met each other of an unusual way. At the first, Glenn didn\'t believe that they were here to protect him, but with the course of time, yeah! You probably know what happen after that. So, the main characters are very important, but what about secoundary characters? WHAT ABOUT SARA SILVERS? I was really paying attention to her, but she was like an supporting character, but I was feeling that she could be a really important girl to the story. So, I rate 7/10. I mean Akashic Records is average in all the aspects, but the character development point was very average. It could be a lot better, LIDENFILMS studio could make really a lot better job on it, but it\'s acceptable. Even Sara Silvers was forgotten (which I found her very cute, very mysterious but very important to the story), the character development is quite acceptable. It has holes, but yeah. Compared to Uchiage Hanabi (which was probably the worst movie I\'ve ever watched), Akashic Records is pretty well about characters.Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 8/10Clearly, the story is a little bit generic, it has some holes, and some things didn\'t enjoy me. But, considering the majority of animes from the LIDENFILMS studio aren\'t memorable, it\'s quite interesting to see the amount of effort that they putted to do Akashic Records. The premise is very generic, it\'s not something like new (original idea). We\'re already saw animes or shows with magicians and witches (such as: Little Witch Academia and Harry Potter, or something). I can say that: Akashic Records looks a little bit that: is Harry Potter in anime version. It\'s quite funny to think on that way, but yeah! Akashic Records is a little bit the same that read a really fanciful book with a lot of unreal elements, such as: magic, powers, spells, curses, etc. But, I feel Akashic Records is different than that. It mixes magic and fantasy with drama and romance. Even though it\'s very common, Akashic Records kind of got to give: an more mature and deeper climate, with a lot of tense moments. So, is this show basically an more adult version of Harry Potter and of the Disney\'s fairy tales?. No, it\'s not well that. Because, we can saw a lot of things that can also happen in the real life (the main things were: the hard relationships between families, that can be seen between Rumia and her mother; and the distant or impossible love, that we can see on the Glenn and Sara Silvers relationship in the past). So, it\'s very fanciful, but there\'s some very deep things. So, it\'s not 100% a fairy tale. Again, the characters development is great, but it lacks sometimes. Specially from SARA SILVERS, bruh. I felt a lot of potential above her, and she didn\'t deserve to be only an supporting character. I was always feeling that she could have more attention, but we can do nothing, right? None anime is 100% perfect. Akashic Records sinned in some points, but in general, it\'s good. I\'d give it a 6 or 7, but it would be very harsh, because Akashic Records showed it had a lot of potential, and it worked, but not completely. So I\'ll give 8. I\'ll not judge so hardly, because there\'s a lot of other really bad animes, and Akashic Records wasn\'t bad. It was pretty enjoyable at all. So, yeah. They delivered something good to me. I don\'t know if I will keep Akashic Records for a long time on my head, because isn\'t something remarkable, but the experience was good. I\'ll finish right there, and my opinion, overall, is: it\'s a good story, not the best, it has holes, but in general, I appreciated it. I reccomend you, at least, to take a quick look on that one.  But, if you\'re more a harsh reviewer, then you won\'t probably like too much of this one. But it\'s acceptable. This was my review, it was very long, because I like a lot to type, to express my real opinion. But yeah! Thanks for reading until here, and have a nice day, guys.

Compared to Uchiage Hanabi (which was probably the worst movie I\'ve ever watched), Akashic Records is pretty well about characters.Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 8/10Clearly, the story is a little bit generic, it has some holes, and some things didn\'t enjoy me. But, considering the majority of animes from the LIDENFILMS studio aren\'t memorable, it\'s quite interesting to see the amount of effort that they putted to do Akashic Records. The premise is very generic, it\'s not something like new (original idea). We\'re already saw animes or shows with magicians and witches (such as: Little Witch Academia and Harry Potter, or something). I can say that: Akashic Records looks a little bit that: is Harry Potter in anime version. It\'s quite funny to think on that way, but yeah! Akashic Records is a little bit the same that read a really fanciful book with a lot of unreal elements, such as: magic, powers, spells, curses, etc. But, I feel Akashic Records is different than that. It mixes magic and fantasy with drama and romance. Even though it\'s very common, Akashic Records kind of got to give: an more mature and deeper climate, with a lot of tense moments. So, is this show basically an more adult version of Harry Potter and of the Disney\'s fairy tales?. No, it\'s not well that. Because, we can saw a lot of things that can also happen in the real life (the main things were: the hard relationships between families, that can be seen between Rumia and her mother; and the distant or impossible love, that we can see on the Glenn and Sara Silvers relationship in the past). So, it\'s very fanciful, but there\'s some very deep things. So, it\'s not 100% a fairy tale. Again, the characters development is great, but it lacks sometimes. Specially from SARA SILVERS, bruh. I felt a lot of potential above her, and she didn\'t deserve to be only an supporting character. I was always feeling that she could have more attention, but we can do nothing, right? None anime is 100% perfect. Akashic Records sinned in some points, but in general, it\'s good. I\'d give it a 6 or 7, but it would be very harsh, because Akashic Records showed it had a lot of potential, and it worked, but not completely. So I\'ll give 8. I\'ll not judge so hardly, because there\'s a lot of other really bad animes, and Akashic Records wasn\'t bad. It was pretty enjoyable at all. So, yeah. They delivered something good to me. I don\'t know if I will keep Akashic Records for a long time on my head, because isn\'t something remarkable, but the experience was good. I\'ll finish right there, and my opinion, overall, is: it\'s a good story, not the best, it has holes, but in general, I appreciated it. I reccomend you, at least, to take a quick look on that one.  But, if you\'re more a harsh reviewer, then you won\'t probably like too much of this one. But it\'s acceptable. This was my review, it was very long, because I like a lot to type, to express my real opinion. But yeah! Thanks for reading until here, and have a nice day, guys. Bye!', ""Lately I've noticed I've been watching the majority of shows on 2x speed.This has become pretty standard as most shows are slow enough paced, that I can still keep up w the dialogue aside from slowing down certain parts.The only 2 shows that I've watched on normal speed recently are this and Trinity Seven.Regardless of what I consciously want to say about these shows, the fact that I am taking 2x the amount of time to enjoy them speaks for itself.The reasons for this are: To enjoy the art, enjoy the music, and the interactions and dialogue between characters.This show has all 3. I find...the art and music to be outstanding in this, and also the characters interactions are hilarious at times.The voice acting is great, I also find the characters to be more nuanced than in most harem/school shows like this. Especially Sistine and the MC.Also I like shows that have an MC who is a capable, witty, badass who gets shit handled.I noticed I've given this, Trinity Seven, Shokugeki no Souma, and The Irregular at Magic High School all higher scores than their counterparts, and this is one of the big reasons why.It's a lot more enjoyable for me than an MC who stumbles and hesitates his way around into becoming some admired hero. It's also far more realistic than that.The final thing about this is, although this has not been revealed in more detail. I find the mysterious premise dealing with the Akashic Records to be interesting. I was already interested in the subject and although it hasnt been discussed much it's still fascinating.I can't give this a 10 out of 10 bc I don't think it's a masterpiece as much as Shokugeki no Souma, but definitely looking forward to a Season 2 the art and music to be outstanding in this, and also the characters interactions are hilarious at times.The voice acting is great, I also find the characters to be more nuanced than in most harem/school shows like this.

It starts with a somewhat good and fairly comical first episode, with the introduction of an excentric and lazy protagonist who somehow ends up as a teacher in a magic academy, but instead of doing his job he clowns around and acts like some sort of troll to his students. Sadly, this first episode is a trap designed to hook the viewer by giving an inaccurate idea of what the series actually has to offer: stereotypical characters, cartoonishly evil villains, a generic magical fantasy universe and a predictable plot.THE...PROTAGONIST IS THE ONLY DECENT ELEMENT IN THE STORYThe protagonist, Glenn Radars (what an awful name!), is first introduced as a low-rank magician who was just hired as an instructor in a prestigious magic academy thanks to his weirdly-clothed female friend who pulled strings so that he could get a job and stop sucking out her money. In the first episode, he is portrayed as a disastrous teacher, as he is super lazy and constantly mocks his students, instead of helping them, or just doing his job properly in general. Doesn’t that sound comical? It does sound comical. There’s no way something like this isn’t comical.UNFORTUNATELY! This show is neither a comedy nor a slice-of-life, it has an actual plot – by plot I mean one female character fondling another female character’s breasts in the girls’ locker room – and soon after episode 1, what appeared as a somewhat better than average anime, turns into your generic fantasy anime. Glenn acts like an asshole? Well actually that’s because he knows how much magic is dangerous, and doesn’t want to give teenagers the power to kill people! Glenn is a lazy clown who doesn’t know how to do magic? You fool! He’s just hiding his power level! He’s actually a former elite magician who became disgusted with the use that is made of magic! Glenn goes on a field trip to a beach resort with his classroom right after a terrorist attack? You imbecile! He does that to keep his students out of danger! Glenn is a pervert who enjoys staring at his teenage female students’ breasts at the beach? Let me guess, is that because he’s actually pretending to be a pervert to catch his enemies off-guard? No! He’s just a regular pervert! Great!GENERIC AND UNORIGINALGeneric anime magic school, generic European-stylised buildings seen hundreds of times in the medium, generic and plain character designs, generic clothing. In terms of world-building, nothing stands out. It’s just your run-of-the-mil anime fantasy universe where magic can do everything, from teleportation and healing wounds to… phone calls and computers? This is just re-branded SF at this point.Same thing for the characters. On the “good guys” side you have the tsundere catgirl who acts like she hates the protagonist but is actually in love with him, for some unknown reason. Out of all the characters (not including the protagonist) she is probably the “least worst”, because she is the only one who has some kind of objective.Then there’s the “too young too simple, sometimes naive” girl with big boobs whose only purpose in life is to be abducted or attacked by the bad guys and then saved by the protagonist like the damsel in distress she is. It’s not supposed to be comical, and it happens three times in total. Three times! In a 12-episode series! Predictable! Repetitive! Ridiculous!And lastly, there’s the generic inexpressive and shy teenage anime girl template who adores the protagonist and is very powerful despite her childish appearance. Tina Sprout in Black Bullet, Sasami Saya in Gakusen Toshi Asterisk… you have seen this boring character template dozens, if not hundreds of times in recent anime.What about the “bad guys”, then? Ah, don’t worry – they’re worse! They are part of some sort of secret society of evil mages. All of them are cartoon villains with overly distorted faces who just can’t help bursting into evil laughter every five seconds, and then yell angrily at the protagonist when they realise that their very evil plan has failed. How original!A DUMB AND INCOHERENT SHOWLet’s talk about the blonde girl again. She is abducted by the evil organization on at least two occasions, and on both on these occasions, the protagonist comes to save her, tries to break whatever magical spell is restraining her, fails and then collapses on the ground. On both of these occasions, the bad guys could have used this opportunity to strike him and finish him off. But they did not. Instead, the bad guys stayed in the corner of the room, watched him as he stood up, and let him beat them up. So much for the members of a secret society who are supposed to be plotting against a whole empire!At another moment, the evil organization does some sort of terrorist attack where they take the queen hostage with a magical spell, because they want her to execute the blonde girl. Glenn is first beaten by the bad guys, but then comes back in perfect health two minutes later to save both the girl and the queen. Now, try to guess what the next episode is about. There has just been a terrorist attack and a hostage situation… what would happen after such a serious and terrifying event? A beach episode, you say? That wouldn’t be dumb enough for this anime. No, what would be fitting for such a ridiculous series is a 3-episode beach resort arc where the blonde girl gets abducted again!And lastly, towards the end of the series, another magic instructor appears to steal the protagonist’s favourite catgirl. The protagonist then turns very edgy and dark – he has the overly edgy-looking anime eyes, I’m sure you know what I’m talking about – and comes to the catgirl’s rescue. And then they run around the town fighting zombie drug addicts. Yeah.GOOD MONARCHY VS EVIL SECRET SOCIETY AND OTHER QUESTIONABLE POLITICAL MESSAGES“What the heck man? It’s just a random 12-episode fantasy anime, what does it have to do with politics?” Not much actually. It is clear that this series is mostly about a quirky protagonist teaching in a magic academy. HOWEVER! Anime or not, fantasy or not, the political content of a work must always be analysed and criticised.The story takes place in what appears to be a feudal society since there is a powerful nobility, the country calls itself an empire and is ruled by a monarch. The political system is never challenged by the “good guys”, at most some character will be disappointed by the fact that some people use magic for evil goals. But the monarchy or the nobility are never questioned – most of the time they are even portrayed in a positive light! Some examples: the monarch is a very kind and understanding woman, most of the characters on the good guys’ side are of noble blood, and at some point in the show the protagonist says that the life of the nobility isn’t actually as easy as we think… holy cow! If History taught us anything about the nobility, it’s that they are parasites who must be either forcefully abolished as a class, or executed by the hecking guillotine as my ancestors did back in the day!Oh and by the way, the only people in this series who actually challenge the empire are the bad guys from the evil secret society, and they are called terrorists by the good guys. Sure! I too, love stories where a feudal empire are the good guys and an organization of people who see the current political system as corrupt are the bad guys. Doesn’t look like monarchist propaganda at all!PRODUCTION-WISE, IT’S ACCEPTABLEAs I already mentioned earlier, character designs, clothing and backgrounds in this anime are generic and unoriginal. The faces are very basic and lack detail: male characters’ faces are single-coloured, and female characters’ faces only have a bit of pink on their cheeks to make them look cuter. Character designs are also incoherent. Glenn is clothed like a normal person from our world, not like a fantasy character, which feels out of place. The background music was forgettable, but not bad enough to hinder the show.On the upside, even if the art-style is generic, it is clean and doesn’t look ugly. For once, characters’ faces aren’t inconsistent. There are some landscapes and buildings (such as the flying island) that aren’t completely generic and look good.CONCLUSIONExcept from the fairly decent first episode,  Roku de Nashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records is a bad anime series and a waste of time, even in terms of entertainment value. So my advice would be to watch only the first episode and then move on to something better, as the rest of the series feels like a completely different show.

It gathers pace slightly as the anime progresses but is never really gripping. Much of the tension to the plot is negated by the sketchy limits of magic and abilities of the characters. It is a light, comfortable ride, hitting all the expected notes, but never ventures out of the ordinary.A teacher who doesn\'t fit into a prestigious academy clashes with his students, and as they are draw into dangerous affairs of the kingdom the teacher starts showing a different side to himself. Short adventure arcs follow...each other as the characters are developed and their back story explored. Some are more poignant than others, all the arcs are inoffensive, and enjoyable, but nothing to surprise or amaze.Glenn began as a very interesting main character. He started as a pretty useless and weak magician, absolutely inept at his job as teacher of the most prestigious magic academy in the world. He slowly reveals a more serious and dark nature as the anime progresses, and as his character was gradually   rounded I was more and more excited about finding out more.Until he dropped right into a stock, bland, cliche, boring, done-to-death anime hero, complete with troubled past( flavored with tragic love story), OP abilities, doing good to redeem his dark past, an unchanging resolve to uphold justice, protecting everyone and not letting anyone die ""again"" ... etc, etc., the whole bucket load.Sistine is your typical tsundere main heroine, who inspires the hero and keeps him anchored to light and hope. Blah blah blah. Rumia, the other main heroine, is not as typical a shounen anime heroine. She is strong but gentle, not especially talented, with a troubled past and an unique ability. Rumia is definitely the more sympathetic and compelling of the two heroines, though not exactly out of the ordinary, but sadly, the anime spends more time on Sistine and her inevitable crush on Glenn.Rel is the most intriguing of the show\'s female characters, but I felt that her story was glossed over, and her actions and the motives behind these actions roughly explained and too rushed a to arouse empathy in the viewer, which is a shame, because her back story had the most potential, and raised rather profound questions and explored an interesting issue with more depth than this comedic anime seemed to have potential to.The art is pretty much what you\'d expect from this kind of an anime. The character designs are slightly too fan service oriented to my taste. Cat ears on Sisitine, and that bunny ear gravity defying ribbon on Rumia... And that uniform... What academy has that kind of uniform?All in all this is a light hearted anime that seemed truncated rather abruptly. (Just when some depth seemed to be had from the dynamic of Sistine and Glenn, the anime ends.)

A show very suited for relaxing, nothing offensive, not really exciting, but fairly enjoyable.', '[THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS]So where to start...  Oh I know, characters.  Well for one thing, they\'re atrocious.  You have Glen-sensei, who try\'s to be the next GTO/Kouro-sensei, but in reality is overpowered light novel protagonist-kun, even though subjective trash will try to justify that he\'s not, but the problem is that the narrative will stick him in situations where he has the upper hand, or plot convenience kicks down the door and says, ""Hey, he can do this thing that no one/not many people can do.""  Then there\'s Sistine, who\'s Asuna Clone Number Four Million Eight Hundred Thousand and Two, basically...token waifu, with a bitchy tsundere personality, and wants protagonist-kun\'s dick, and for whatever reason, the writers of the show decide to show that she\'s ""capable"" and ""can take care of herself"", but then they don\'t really showcase her doing much, and then halfway through the shows twelve episode run, she gets shoved into this damsel in distress role because some dude comes in to marry her for political reasons because she\'s the daughter of the queen of the kingdom, and now Glen has to go save her because the guy who\'s trying to marry her is evil. Also, she gets sexually harassed in the second episode, since it\'s a shitty light novel adaptation, so it has to have some form of rape. Did you get all that?  Okay good, moving on to the next character.  Who are we at now, Rumia?  Yeah, Rumia.  Rumia is BigTits McGee, and a lot of her character is based on the idea that ""sad stuff happens to me, so you should feel sorry for me so make me best girl.""  Then there\'s Re=L, who\'s loli service oni-chan complex.  Also, what the fuck kinda name is Re=L?  You\'d think it would have some sort of big, symbolic meaning, but no, it doesn\'t.  There\'s this blue haired dude that\'s just kinda there.  There\'s this black dressed boob lady who\'s just kinda there.  Aaaand I think that\'s all for important characters.  There\'s a supporting class, but they\'re just kinda there (I\'m starting to notice a trend) and there\'s no really standout villain.  A big problem the shows characters have, is that they don\'t have any after game goals.  No ""I want to be hokage"", ""I want to be king of the pirates"", ""I just want a quiet life"", none of the characters have any equivalent of that...  Except Sistine.In the first episode of the show, Sistine states that she wants to go to this castle in the sky that her grandpa wanted to get to, but he died before he could get there, and the actual narrative never brings it up again, except for maybe the final episode, but that\'s just speculation.  But the show keeps on reminding the viewer, that hey, this is still a thing by cramming castle into random shots that just so happened to be aimed at the sky throughout the whole fucking show.It\'s kinda like Attack On Titan Season One, where it baits the viewer along with big plot reveals that inevitably lead into the grand scheme of things, even though it rarely ever does, so it just becomes a big cycle of plot reveals.  But with Akashic Records, it baits the viewer along until oh, look, it\'s the last episode, so now we\'re just going to season two bait, but we have to end this first season somehow, don\'t we?The final episode ends with this really uninteresting plot reveal that the big villain was pulling the strings the whole time, and he has some sort of connection to Glen, because everything in the narrative has to be connected to Glen somehow, and Sistine, who was supposed to get married this episode, continues to be the useless damsel she\'s been set up to be for the last couple of episodes, tears off her wedding dress, which is the writers of the show saying ""look how progressive we are"", and remembers she\'s really good at magic, and then she and Glen fight big villain guy in a giant magic laser beam fight, until Glen punches big villain, and yay we won.Another big problem the show has is the tone shift of its fight and action scenes.  At the beginning of the show they set up that all the fights will have a depth of strategy to them, similar to a JoJo Stand battle or an early Naruto fight, but then towards the end of the show, it just changes to generic magic spell battles.The pacing of the show is atrocious.  They try to cram so much shit into the short span of twelve episodes that it whole thing comes off as moving to fast, basically giving certain important plot threads not enough time to develop, making a bulk of the narrative seem pointless.The animation is decent.  It could be good, but whenever there\'s action it was always happens to quickly to even realize what\'s going on.  Don\'t quote me on this, but I\'m pretty sure they reuse the same clip of Sistine punching Glen into the sky a couple of times every episode, maybe not every episode, I could be wrong about this one.  The shows aesthetic, is again, decent, it\'s this pseudo cel shaded look, which admittedly looks fine, but nothing more than that.  Just fine. Although, I will say that the effect they use for magic looks pretty nice, reminds me of Konosuba.The shows opening and ending credits are nothing to right home about.  The opening kinda just showcases characters doing nothing, then there\'s shot of Glen being edgy for no apparent reason, while this shot of Sistine shifts into this girl from Glens past, Sarres I think her name is, and then it interludes into this generic action sequence set to one of the most generic get-the-viewer-hyped-for-action songs I\'ve ever heard in my life.  The ending credits are just still shots of the main four characters, exception being the shot of Glen with the spinning magical card.And now to address the big elephant in the room, the character designs.  From what I\'ve said so far, this show isn\'t one worst things in the world, and that\'s true, it\'s not.  But these character designs are just God awful, especially the female school uniforms.  They\'re literally stripper outfits, and compared to the modest and classy, it just makes me think that whoever thought that making the female characters wear skirts that are almost as short as my dads belt, should really go back to art school.  Plus, add to the fact that they say nothing about the characters themselves merely adds fuel to the fire.If there is one positive thing I would like say about the show, is its next episode previews.  These short thirty seconds previews were probably the one thing about the show I actually looked forward to watching every week.  Probably the best bits were the ones with the blue haired dude and all the cats, they always managed to put a smile on my face.Overall, Akashic Records is bad, but it\'s certainly not the worst thing ever, and certainly not even the worst thing this year.  I give at a 3/10, it\'s just plain bad. token waifu, with a bitchy tsundere personality, and wants protagonist-kun\'s dick, and for whatever reason, the writers of the show decide to show that she\'s ""capable"" and ""can take care of herself"", but then they don\'t really showcase her doing much, and then halfway through the shows twelve episode run, she gets shoved into this damsel in distress role because some dude comes in to marry her for political reasons because she\'s the daughter of the queen of the kingdom, and now Glen has to go save her because the guy who\'s trying to marry her is evil. Also, she gets sexually harassed in the second episode, since it\'s a shitty light novel adaptation, so it has to have some form of rape. Did you get all that?  Okay good, moving on to the next character.  Who are we at now, Rumia?  Yeah, Rumia.  Rumia is BigTits McGee, and a lot of her character is based on the idea that ""sad stuff happens to me, so you should feel sorry for me so make me best girl.""  Then there\'s Re=L, who\'s loli service oni-chan complex.  Also, what the fuck kinda name is Re=L?  You\'d think it would have some sort of big, symbolic meaning, but no, it doesn\'t.  There\'s this blue haired dude that\'s just kinda there.  There\'s this black dressed boob lady who\'s just kinda there.  Aaaand I think that\'s all for important characters.  There\'s a supporting class, but they\'re just kinda there (I\'m starting to notice a trend) and there\'s no really standout villain.  A big problem the shows characters have, is that they don\'t have any after game goals.  No ""I want to be hokage"", ""I want to be king of the pirates"", ""I just want a quiet life"", none of the characters have any equivalent of that...  Except Sistine.In the first episode of the show, Sistine states that she wants to go to this castle in the sky that her grandpa wanted to get to, but he died before he could get there, and the actual narrative never brings it up again, except for maybe the final episode, but that\'s just speculation.

I give at a 3/10, it\'s just plain bad.', ""I watched Akashic Records back when it was first released in 2017 in its original Japanese language and I decided to give it a second look, in its English dub. So, does it still hold up even after 4 years? Well, let's hop on and find out, shall we?Warning! Spoiler alert!StoryThe first episode left a lot to be desired and it wasn't till episodes 2 and 3 that Akashic Records found its footing. Once the show digs deep into Glenn's skills and talents, both as a teacher and a soldier is when the show kicks into high gear. I admit I still have trouble understanding...the general principles of magic in this show, but then again, that's not really something I gave much thought about.A very good aspect of this show is its balance of drama and tragedy. The two tones can hand to hand with one another, without really stepping onto each other's toes. The show isn't afraid to get violent, but it never goes to the point of being obscene and gory. I've never believed that a story becomes automatically better if takes the dark and gritty route, but Akashic Records does become better when it places the characters in more serious and intense situations, without forgetting to add in a healthy dose of humor. (7/10)CharactersThe relationships between characters is without a doubt the strongest element of Akashic Records. To be more precise, it's Glenn's relationship with his supporting cast what motivates and pushes his character development forward. This is the protagonists' relationships with his friends are so important in a story. They keep the hero grounded and encourage his better qualities.The supporting cast is well-developed and interesting in its own right. The three main girls in the story, Stistine, Rumia and Re=L, have fine relationships with Glenn and while some developments are more obvious than others, it's good to see how much the characters improve each other throughout the story. (8/10)ArtThe artstyle of Akashic Records lends itself pretty well for both action scenes and character moments. Aside from a few exceptions, however, almost every character in this show looks exactly the same. Sure, they have different body shapes and sizes, and hair colorings, but facially they all look the same. This isn't exactly new to the world of anime and it isn't something that takes you away from the story, but it's still worth pointing out. (7/10)SoundsThe opening and closing songs are used sparingly throughout series, as opposed the most anime, which use their OPs and EDs almost constantly. They're bad, but they're aren't that memorably, either.Still, the vocal performances are the true highlight of the sound department. Both Souma Saito and Josh Grelle are excellent performances and I couldn't have chosen better VAs for the role of Glenn. The Japanese version of the show features a good ensemble of relative newcomers like Yume Miyamoto (Rumia), Akane Fujita (Sistine) and Ari Ozawa (Re=L).The American version also features talented powerhouses like Monica Rial (Yume), Rachael Messer (Sistine) and Leah Clark (Re=L). Depending on which version you listen to, you'll definitely have fun with this show. (8/10)ConclusionAkashic Records features good comedy, intense action scenes and interesting characters. It definitely won't rewrite the book on light novel anime, but fortunately, it doesn't need to. I don't need every anime I watch to be a life-changing experience, just a good story and this is what Akashic Records suceeds at.

Magic anime isn\'t really my cup of tea, but I found Rokudenashi Majutsu Koushi to Akashic Records promising, at least in the beginning.The start is quite entertaining and introduces you to a world of magic with characters that captivate you for a brief period. However, strange things start happening in this anime, and it loses its value.At a certain point, the story became somewhat confusing; it felt like it wasn\'t going anywhere. When new characters were introduced, this feeling of incomprehension became even stronger.In short, the anime seemed like it...was going to provide me with some enjoyable entertainment on a lazy afternoon, but it ended up leaving me with the feeling of ""please just end already.""I\'m disappointed with the direction the story took because I initially saw a lot of potential.-------------------Pt/BrÉ incrível como esse anime conseguiu se perder tanto em apenas 12 episódios.

Porém coisas estranhas começam a acontecer nesse anime e ele perde seu valor.A partir de um ponto a história estava um tanto confusa, parecia que ela não estava indo a lugar algum. Quando introduzido a novos personagens esse sentimento de incompreensão se tornou maior.Em suma, o anime parecia que ia me entregar um bom divertimento em um fim de tarde, mas acabou que me trouxe apenas o sentimento de ""acabe logo, por favor"".Fico triste com o rumo que a história tomou pois inicialmente vi muito potencial was going to provide me with some enjoyable entertainment on a lazy afternoon, but it ended up leaving me with the feeling of ""please just end already.""I\'m disappointed with the direction the story took because I initially saw a lot of potential.-------------------Pt/BrÉ incrível como esse anime conseguiu se perder tanto em apenas 12 episódios.

Look at the poster.Comedy is good if you can ignore the girl that likes to eat. Each episode is split into two short stories, usually focusing on a specific team, but sometimes advancing the plot.The ED changes based on the characters they focus on for the episode, who themselves are very lively and diverse. Animation is also amazing during the action sequences.As you can see, this anime was made to satisfy a certain audience. It does that job well. "", 'Different ED versions ☑️Introduce new characters and their corresponding VAs. ☑️ED theme design changes every time ☑️Outstanding animation (As expected of Cloverworks) ☑️Nice plot (Not necessarily since that isn\'t the show\'s primary goal) ☒This show has it all, from introducing a new trio of characters in each episode to showcasing the day-to-day lives of several girls who live in a ninja village, train and study, and occasionally do adorable things. Each episode is separated into two short storylines, each of which focuses on a different team and occasionally moves the plot ahead (Excluding the anime original finale episode). The Dog Squad, led by Tsubaki, is...central to the plot of the show. What is nice about this show is that the character interactions, the funny humor and gags, and the occasional ""otoko"" tease moments don\'t seem forced and never fail to put a smile on the viewers\' faces. Despite the fact that each episode has little to no plot because the show is essentially CGDCT with added comedy, we can see the characters grow, learn more about their backgrounds, and how they came to be the way they are.Nothing more can be said about the show except that the ratings do not do the overall quality of the show and the enjoyment each episode provides its viewers justice. The show isn\'t for everyone, but it does a good job for the audience it is aimed at. I would strongly recommend people who are both not and are fans of these types of anime to give it a try. The show will not disappoint you. I hope a season 2 isn\'t just a pipe dream. central to the plot of the show.

From the creator of Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san, an incredibly entertaining romcom between two adolescents, here comes Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi, a CGDCT/slice of life series which also boasts a lovely character with an impressive brow.The plot revolves around a village hidden in some mountains, made up of young female ninja in training and their select few teachers. Split into squads of 3-4 girls each, they go about their daily lives, whether it be practicing new jutsu, classroom studies, foraging for food or simply playing around.The catch is that these young ninja in training have never...seen a Male in person and have no knowledge whatsoever about the opposite sex and have been forbidden from their superiors from finding out anything about them. A lot of misinformation and rumors are spread about their appearance, smell, etc, which leads to humorous antics and jokes being told between these ignorant kids. Seemingly only Tsubaki, the main heroine in this anime, is curious enough to find out whether these actually hold true. It works well, because there\'s always that hanging anticipation of if/when they will finally come into contact with a Man and what will proceed to follow. Like Takagi-san, it\'s a tease, but in a completely different manner.Yamamoto\'s character designs are becoming some of my favorite in anime, they are so incredibly noticeable and unique, one of the premier makers of adorable characters today. There are a sizeable group of kunoichi in this village that we get to see often and they are all so intricate, individual and well made. They\'re also not just relegated to the background for most of the anime, they often play a role in these mini stories. I say mini stories, because this anime generally splits it\'s episode into three parts, similar to Takagi-san, so we get to see a wide range of activity from a lot of characters. And this is a massive positive for me, Tsubaki and her squad are most certainly the main characters and have the most screen time, but it would have been tragic not to spend more notice on these great side characters who each have distinctive personalities themselves. And to think we\'re blessed with yet another Yamamoto work this Summer 2022 season, Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru, I\'m expecting good things.There are a couple of gripes that I\'ve noticed from other posters which I will quickly address here, and that is mostly about the humor and the supposed fan service.""Irritable, simplistic and repetitive jokes about how Men are gross, ugly and the likes are annoying"". What can I really say here? This sounds like a fragile ego complaint and I struggle to take it seriously, but I can tell you that Men being the butt of their jokes does take a decrease in appearance past the 3rd or so episode.  Happy now? You won\'t need your tissues anymore? Awesome. ""Men are gross"" is only one gag in this show, there\'s plenty more to choose from.As for the fan service, the only fan service in this anime are the skimpy outfits that some of the characters wear on a daily basis, which could be uncomfortable for some considering that they are underage (around 13-14). That\'s about as far as it goes sexualization wise, save for one little arc where the theme revolves around attractiveness. Won\'t be a problem for some, especially for desensitized fellows like myself, who have watched too many anime too even bat an eyelid here. But there\'s the warning. There\'s some skin shown.No quarrels with the animation for the most part, there are 1-2 episodes where the dip in quality is pretty noticeable, but it stays fairy consistent throughout. Vibrant contrast of colors are everywhere, it\'s very aesthetic. The seiyuu talent on hand is exceedingly apparent as well, an incredible range of voices on display, my personal favorite would have to be Sazanka, voiced by Miyari Nemoto, which is amazingly her first ever anime she has worked on! I will definitely be looking forward to her future works.These episodes felt like ten minutes, if that\'s not an indication of an entertaining series, then I don\'t know what is. 9/10 for a personal top 3 AOTS. seen a Male in person and have no knowledge whatsoever about the opposite sex and have been forbidden from their superiors from finding out anything about them.

The show its just started so i'll be brief.Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi is a show about ninjas... well... actually not. Not at all. they could be anything else and nothing changes. they are ninjas bc the plot says so and thats it. Im not complaining, the point im trying to make is, do not expect something deep or blody or whatever thing that make you like naruto, bc this show have none of that. Its just the every day life of some girls, who, live in the ninja village, train, study, and do cute things.Now. The question... what about the men thing?...well... thats not important at all, because is not about the men... is about the Unkown. is about the feeling in one girl, who really wants to know more about the world she lives in.For some reason (probabl to protect them) the grown ups has told the girls that men (again, the outside world i.g.) is dangerous and they should run at any moment if they encounter with that.If you think about that... well... its just natural that curiosity surpass the fear, thats how things work. and thats the charm of the story. This is the story about a girl, wich, begin told men are dangerous, still wants to know more about that. And she will probably succeed, in the mean time, the show feed cuteness and wholesome scenes, while reminding us that... yes, she still want to know better, no, what they said is not enough, she is alive... just like any of us.Sorry, I dont know enough about art or sound to make a judgement about it. I just judge story, and MC showing human traits so blatanly is more than enough to me.It does not has to be a deep plot, or perfectly constructed characters, just show how human they can be, just on the right moments, and thats it. well... thats not important at all, because is not about the men... is about the Unkown. is about the feeling in one girl, who really wants to know more about the world she lives in.For some reason (probabl to protect them) the grown ups has told the girls that men (again, the outside world i.g.) is dangerous and they should run at any moment if they encounter with that.If you think about that... well... its just natural that curiosity surpass the fear, thats how things work. and thats the charm of the story.

Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi in particular step in the grey area as they actually have men in it, but so far, it\'s still not clear whether they will take an active part in the story. At least they intrinsically exist in the title, as what is inside the heart of Tsubaki (or maybe inside her mind) is about men. The idea of someone who is not...like them, not girls. So nothing sexual so far.But fair warning, if you didn\'t see it in the poster already, these underaged girls, who are most likely around the age of middle school or at least elementary, are wearing very skimpy outfits that make you wonder whether actual ninjas wear those. I\'ll leave it up to you to decide to watch it after the fact.So far, the narrative is just an honestly pure story of these girls\' lives in the village. By setting it with blatantly overdone elements, such as a village of ninja trainees, innovation to this show isn\'t that apparent on a surface level. But one that focuses more on just making a story about the everyday lives of these girls and not on the ninja battle, for example, is far and few in between. Would there be any progress in the plot? I hope so, and it seems there will be something to look forward to when Tsubaki finds out more about the world.CloverWorks once again manages to wrap this anime with a well-directed sound department. The Peggies greeted us at the opening with an upbeat song, and then the episode was closed with a piece sung by a different kunoichi team at each ED. They also managed to pull the classic BGM for something like a Sengoku-era anime.If we\'re talking only about the visual aspect, this anime is one of the better-looking ones. I honestly wouldn\'t expect any less from the studio that made a slew of amazingly stunning anime. And if I\'m being picky, then the character design might put some people off because of the gap between the realistic nature in the background and the character who can\'t look more anime if they tried. The visual effects of ninja techniques, on the other hand, are actually really great.Considering the characters are a lot in this anime, it might be hard to appreciate the story because they need to keep introducing new ninja girls each episode. But some might enjoy it that way to keep things fresh. And we might have a whole village of nicely fleshed-out supporting casts if the pacing keeps going like this.Again, I would not discover this show if I held back from trying bunches of airing shows. Besides the story, I\'m thoroughly interested in the author\'s other work, Takagi-san. Totally excited when I saw a familiar big forehead girl on the poster. I may also add that I want to see how far their jokes can keep me entertained. Because honestly, it does feel slow, and I might drop it as I did with the first season of Takagi-san but then regret it later and actually enjoy every season of it. like them, not girls.

Cover for this looked cute so I figured, hey, I'll give it a shot. Cute girls doing cute things is usually very hit or miss. This time it’s a swing and a miss. In summary, it’s a very cute looking and mildly disturbing cringefest. The girls are prepubescent and MC is horny, that's the entire plot. Also they are ninjas. Maybe it'll get better as the show goes on, I dont know, but I personally am not willing to give it more time than I already have. This show is the definition of seasonal filler. Honestly you’re better off...just watching Naruto, and that’s coming from someone who isn’t even particularly fond of Naruto. just watching Naruto, and that’s coming from someone who isn’t even particularly fond of Naruto."", 'If there is an author that has his/her name thrown around quite a lot, it would be Souichirou Yamamoto. If you know any inkling of the works that this prolific author has ever done, you might have heard of it before since it was (and still is) the talk of the town: Karakai Jouzu no Takagi-san a.k.a Teasing Master Takagi-san, which has already spawned 3 seasons plus a movie that recently just released. It\'s no doubt one of many of Japan\'s most successful series in both AniManga forms, and towards the god of foreheads, he is absolutely raking in all the attention from Season 3...of the main series the past Winter season, its movie and this show this season, and the Shogi rom-com Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru a.k.a When Will Ayumu Make His Move? in the upcoming Summer season. That\'s 3 seasons in a row that\'s chock full of big-ball-wide foreheads that you\'re gonna see for 9 months straight, and that\'s a blessing to an already recognizable author whose works have generated a cult fan favourite for the die-hards, me included.But to be frank, let\'s backtrack on the one series that I felt that was a miss on the mark, the black sheep of the author\'s many works, and that is this show right here: Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi a.k.a In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki. This is the only series that Souichirou Yamamoto has deviated from the classic school-based rom-com that Takagi-san (and even the upcoming Soredemo Ayumu) is known for, and trades it with an all-female clan of kunoichi (a.k.a female ninjas) living in a village where there is a strict code that everyone must adhere to: women are not allowed to have contact with men, for like the enemy, they are dangerous and not wholly to be trusted should they win the females over to their side. Both AniManga forms have a huge character cast, but a female MC that guides the story along: Tsubaki of Team Dog, who\'s at that age where she is curious about men, and presumably, wants to know more about them because of her unequivocal heart-pounding and beating feeling, and the more she knows information about men, the more she gets flustered easily. Yeah, this is the adage of ""curiosity kills the cat"".If there is an area where credit must be given where its due, is in its naming conventions that hides deeper meanings. I will admit that the kunoichi of the female-only Akane Class clan that ranges from mere young children to teens, they have some of the skimpiest clothing that can be easily mistaken for the sexualization of minors (say Team Dog\'s Sazanka and Team Sheep\'s Benisumomo) that\'s a bit unsightful to see. But, this leads to the next point that if you haven\'t already figured it out yet, the Akane Class is made up of teams that are representative of the 12 animals in the Chinese Zodiac, with each team having 3 students (or kunoichi, rather) being either fully Senpais, Kouhais, or a mix of both (Teams Dog and Snake are the exception with 4 and 2 students respectively) with everybody\'s own unique Jutsu. And this is a crucial one that will be glanced over: each and every character\'s single-name-only given names have a symbolic floral theming that translates to different flowers, plants or both. Take for example: the central Team Dog\'s Tsubaki, Asagao, Sazanka and Rindou. While Asagao and Rindou both represent their main flower family respectively (morning glory and gentian), Tsubaki and Sazanka are in a close sisterly relationship because their names stem from the Camellia flower family (of the common Japanese camellia and Sasanqua camellia). So rather than just pick out rando names, Souichirou Yamamoto going the distance to literally pluck out flower names and adapt them to his work (this is a huge lot of characters spanning 30 to 40 names), this is what I feel separates him from many authors due to the creativity of his talents, and this talent is IMO simply unrivalled.The female-only Akane Class clan is taken care of by two teachers: the head of the clan Hana and her No. 2 counterpart Konoha. Both are stern teachers taking care of Tsubaki and the many kunoichi students, raising their lives to rise to the conduct of not having a fear of men. But, this is an abstract lie, and Hana-sensei knows it, because the truth is that both the women (Akane Class) and the men (Aoi Class) were once learning together in tandem, when this thing called ""love"" breaks all fear for potential kunoichi and shinobu to be in relationships together, to the extreme case of eloping altogether from their clans, forcing the hand of the clan\'s extinction so much that they blocked all interaction amongst one another, only to isolate themselves and never to interact again lest this hard-and-fast rule is either broken or violated by one of the students, which can bring consequences.For a large character cast like this show, it can be hard to follow who\'s what and how, so this is the full breakdown of the Akane Class:- Teachers Hana and Konoha (literally meaning \'flower\' and \'leaves\'), stern teachers whom cherish their students in a stoic manner, that by themselves, removes their acting facades of a base foundation towards tutoring the students in a proer manner.- Team Dog: team leader Tsubaki, with members Sazanka, Asagao and Rindou. Tsubaki\'s the star character of the Akane Class with skills unparalleled; Sazanka is the short-tempered and short-statured girl whom was a recluse until Tsubaki came to brighten up her life (and the only person calling her ""Nee-sama""); Asagao is the food-crazed glutton; and Rindou is the Aoi Class\'s transfer student, but as a girl being raised by men before they raised her as a girl to be transferred out to the Akane Class.- Team Sheep: team leader Benisumomo, with members Mizubashou and Touwata. Benisumomo\'s the next equal when it came to comparing her brains and brawn against Tsubaki; Mizubashou being the team\'s bookworm and trap master; and Touwata being a hard-working girl, sometimes too hardworking for her own good.- Team Horse: team leader Hinagiku, with members Kibushi and Oniyuri. Hinagiku\'s the self-proclaimed beauty of the Akane Class, the prideful and egosticial girl of the bunch. Kibushi is the member to help lift her spirits up, while Oniyuri acts more like a bodyguard due to her stature.- Team Monkey: team leader Mokuren, with members Housenka and Tsuwabuki. Mokuren is easily the kindest and sweetest girl of the clan, the Akane Class\'s go-to medic nurse. Housenka, like Team Dog\'s Sazanka, is the team\'s prankster, and Tsuwabuki...don\'t call her \'stupid\' or \'dumb\', or otherwise you will piss her off, she\'s the brawn-over-brain person.- Team Rat: team leader Tachiaoi, with members Higuruma and Hagi. Tachiaoi is a bit of a clumsy girl, and even if she sees how others (like Tsubaki) lead their own team, it\'s better to keep it at one\'s breadth. Higuruma is the yellow-haired optimist while Hagi is the grayish-blue-haired pessimist.- Team Ox: team leader Shion, with members Suzuran and Ajisai. Shion is the big sister character to Ajisai, while Suzuran is the same but being the mother character. Also, Ajisai is about the closest to a Takagi-san character cop-out (that\'s similar to Chi from the spin-off) as you can see.- Team Tiger: team leader Fuki, with members Itadori and Ume. Fuki is the nice girl that\'s a stark comparison to the manga counterpart when she is a no-nonsense individual, making her more adult-like than her team members Itadori and Ume whom are both childish and mischievous.- Team Snake: no team leader, but members-only. Uikyou and Kikyou may look like splitting images of one another, but in they are essentially the same person, sharing a tight-knit, almost sisterly dynamic, complete with having the same exact abilities. However, they actually aren\'t related, but rather simply best friends.- Team Dragon: team leader Higiri, with members Suzushiro and Hasu. Higiri is the reserved girl that isn\'t known much; Suzushiro is the direct opposite being boisterous and more open; and while Hasu may just be like Higiri, her deception Jutsu is quite useful.- Team Rabbit: team leader Kagetsu, with members Mukuge and Hototogisu. This team is essentially the idol group of Akane Class, with Kagetsu backing vocals as the lead singer and song composer, Mukuge supporting in instrumentals (drummer) and Hototogisu supporting on percussion (flute).- Team Rooster: team leader Sumire, with members Azami and Tanpopo. Sumire can be seen as a wilful leader going along with both members\' tactics, but also tends to interpret things too seriously that spirals down to detriments. On the other hand, Azami and Tanpopo are the free-spirited girls, one that many can refer to that of the gyaru a.k.a gal culture.- Team Boar: team leader Dokudami, with members Aogiri and Shakuyaku. If you thought that Team Monkey\'s Tsuwabuki was bad enough, wait till you see Dokudami rip people to shreds. This is the same for Aogiri and Shakuyaku, whom also blindly follows their team leader into endless ways to reach to their destination.Whew, never thought that this would be a huge chunk. I also noticed that while the members make the teams, the team dynamic of which they\'re called, also plays into the particular animal\'s properties as well, so that\'s something.I can never fault anything when it comes to the production side of things. This is storyboarder-cum-episode director Takudai Kakuchi\'s directorial debut, though for a show of a calibre such as this, really doesn\'t seem like much more than a small and notable side gig. As for CloverWorks, the A-1 Pictures\' sister studio definitely has seen better days not rushing and taking things slowly, and the overall production does look nice, as we should expect it to be.The music though, is another selling point of the show. Although the peggies\' OP is just decent and sounds fine (nothing like the sort of ""Centimeter"" for the KanoKari dumpster fire show), the ED is where it\'ll have a small surprise. For the entire show in a row, each respective team performs the same ED theme, but in their own versions that in all, provides 12 different iterations of the same song. Honestly, the show doesn\'t honestly need to go far in this, but also, you have to give credit where credit is due that this is intentional effort that might be just a Souichirou Yamamoto thing, but the same rhetoric that Takagi-san has actually done in its anime adaptations. As for my favourite ED version, Team Dog (Episode 1) is the best IMO, though Team Tiger (Episode 6) is a close 2nd being the Rock n\' Roll equivalent of that.All in all, you can take Kunoichi Tsubaki as a CGDCT show of sorts (since it\'s an entirely all-female cast), but it prides mostly in its Iyashikei, slice-of-life setting of the playful and comedic interactions despite the romantic subtext. Either way, I can see why nobody ever talks about this series that\'s a complete deviation to Souichirou Yamamoto\'s tried-and-true school-based rom-com formula that has always worked for the general audience. This is more like a \'if you have ample time on your hands, watch this instead"" kind of show that has its audience, but nothing more. A decent series, but nowhere near the acclaimed mangaka\'s magnum opuses of works that are more appealing. of the main series the past Winter season, its movie and this show this season, and the Shogi rom-com Soredemo Ayumu wa Yosetekuru a.k.a When Will Ayumu Make His Move? in the upcoming Summer season. That\'s 3 seasons in a row that\'s chock full of big-ball-wide foreheads that you\'re gonna see for 9 months straight, and that\'s a blessing to an already recognizable author whose works have generated a cult fan favourite for the die-hards, me included.But to be frank, let\'s backtrack on the one series that I felt that was a miss on the mark, the black sheep of the author\'s many works, and that is this show right here: Kunoichi Tsubaki no Mune no Uchi a.k.a In the Heart of Kunoichi Tsubaki.

A decent series, but nowhere near the acclaimed mangaka\'s magnum opuses of works that are more appealing.', ""More foreheads huh?Ok so In the heart of kunoichi tsbaki was a pretty good show, it was very inconsistent in the middle parts, but overall, a good and enjoyable show.So, let’s start with the story; we focus on the dog squad, led by tsubaki (mc), and her curiosity on boys. Assuming you read the synopsis, I don’t need to explain how the girls in the village feel about boys. So yeah, we were shown that Tsubaki wants to know more about boy. However, during the middle section in the show, the main focus is shifted to everyday life with the different squads, and tsubaki’s squad...mixed in the episode. You can see how the focus changes, and I think that’s where the show dropped in quality. We were led to believe that this show would focus on tsubaki finding out new things about boys, though we are given more stuff on boys throughout the show, it really wasn’t the main focus, the main focus of the show was to show the life of the girls living in the akane clan.Now that the focus was established, the story is a 7 for me. I feel like this could be classified as slice of life, and I’ll consider it as one, since, like I said main focus of life of the girls. As a slice of life, I feel like this show doesn't Deliver as much as it should have, most of the characters are pretty one dimensional and have a gimmick and that’s all they have. tbh there’s like 20 of them and we’re only given 13 eps, but still, other characters were given depth, so why couldn’t the rest get it? Anyway, that’s all I’ll have to say, since it’s a slice of life, if you want to watch it go.The characters. Since the story’s mc is tsubaki, we mostly follow the dog squad. All the characters in the dog squad are well developed, and their relationships with each other grow as the show goes on. I really don’t want to go in depth on all the characters, so I’ll just say, the characters that are introduced in the first 4 episodes are the only ones that get good character development. However, each character in each squad does get to shine per episode, so you could say that all are developed and have character.The other elements like art and sound are pretty good, nothing too outstanding, but gets the job done. The character designs are ninja-like, I guess... and the music is uses traditional Japanese instruments, so that’s cool. Also the fact that the ed in each episode is relative to each squad, and i think it’s an activity log or something, but anyway, that was nice. As for my complaints, not much other that what I said at the start. This show doesn’t shine, but it doesn’t really lack anything, so I give it an 8.Anyway, this show was a breather for me this season, with all the other animes out there, this one felt relaxing. So, if you want a chill anime, look no further, because this anime delivers. Good anime. mixed in the episode. You can see how the focus changes, and I think that’s where the show dropped in quality.

No, just generic CGDCT. Does this show stand out from the other CGDCT shows? absolutely not. Too many characters are introduced, with the main character having a elementary level obsession with men and romance.Also, the foreheads. Anime girls in CGDCT shows already have crazy weird proportions, but this show takes it a step further. All of these girls look like they have brain tumors compared to regular looking anime girls (which again, already have crazy proportions)Then there\'s the ninja plot setting. Honestly, the appeal of CGDCT is probably the fact that it\'s ""healing,""...or it\'s kind of funny with a supernatural twist, like Zombieland Saga, or maybe more of a fantasy setting like Urara Meirochou. This show just kind of slaps on a ninja setting and calls it a day. Of course, since it is a slice of life sort of show, there\'s going to be no real fighting, and most of the show is just girls fooling around with their ninja techniques. What was the purpose of doing that? It just takes away from the slice of life aspect. Again, another deviation is the MC\'s obsession with men. Most shows make so that the characters don\'t have any romantic interests...hence the genre name: Cute girls doing cute things.I don\'t even like the genre, but this show surely lands in the more bottom rungs of it, all things consdiered. or it\'s kind of funny with a supernatural twist, like Zombieland Saga, or maybe more of a fantasy setting like Urara Meirochou.

Nothing extraordinary, just kids acting like kids. Additionally, despite the pretty large cast, everyone is given a chance in the spotlight, with decent characterization to boot.The art is phenomenal, and the action sequences are top-notch, as expected of CloverWorks.If you're a fan of Takagi-san, then you'll probably like...Kunoichi Tsubaki, as both are written by the same mangaka.

Their really isn't a story and the premise doesn't even make sense. I get the idea of having a all girl kunoichi school but for what purpose. Why is their a need for girl ninja. They didn't really explain the purpose of the premise to me which in turn didn't make me take this anime seriously. To be honest I think anime like these are anime that aren't suppose to be taken seriously. But when you see that this anime is produced by a certain...anime studio and has a certain anime production that makes you get hype you can't help but have certain expectations. The characters were all fun to see. Most characters personalities are mostly archetype, but I didn't mind that much and they were very funny. I favorite character was probably Benismomo. She just had the bad girl energy and sarcastic that I find to be the most enjoyable for characters when watching anime. One problem I have with this story is how it teases the idea of an interaction of a man with the MC. I just got tired of it. Overall it wasn't half bad and I got fair share of enjoyment from it. anime studio and has a certain anime production that makes you get hype you can't help but have certain expectations.

The character designs are all really good and each girl looks like they had effort put into their design, but also the animation was surprisingly really good for this anime,...but it is Cloverworks so i guess you can't be too surprised.Sound: 9The sound design is really solid, but the background music at times was a little annoying. Something really good though was the number of endings there were. Not all of them were that great, but a few of them were nice to listen to. Also, the opening is a banger.Characters: 5One of the biggest drawbacks for me is the characters. I found so many of them to be annoying if I had to be honest with you. I thought Tsubaki was an enjoyable MC, and there are a few other really entertaining side characters like the teacher, and Benisumomo. However, the cast as a whole shifted more to the annoying side.Story: 6The story is fine at best if I had to be honest with you. In my opinion, they should've done more with the men side of the storyline, like I said before the are other animes that use the cute girls doing cute things format better than this one.

It also goes way more into the whole Ninja thing than you might expect if you're here for...just fanservice. But trust me, it has everything.

I think tackling adolescence from the female perspective for a shounen audience is an interesting idea. The show puts a group of pre-teen girls in a no boys allowed village and asks the question of what would happen when one of them starts to go boy crazy. It's cute, and plays on a lot of the strengths the author has shown in their other works.The ninja worldbuilding seems a little lazy, like those isekai shows that want to be set in an RPG fantasy setting but don't...want to do the leg work of creating a world from scratch so they just borrow heavily from established tropes. I guess comparing it to Naruto says more about Naruto's lack of unique worldbuilding than anything, because really it's all just Japanese folk legend.All the characters are cute, it's got a very relaxed slice of life feel and doesn't rely much on any kind of overarching narrative. It doesn't demand much from the audience so it's really easy to turn off most of your brain and just enjoy some silly cute girls doing cute things type stuff.

It would be highly recommended to follow the 3 episode rule for this show to get a better vibe of what to expect as the following episodes give a much better representation to what kind of show this will be going forward. Be rest assured it moves on from that and goes on to introduce new characters while finding new comedic points, though the man illusion references...do come back from time to time.It is essentially a ton of cute girls as ninjas in a rural school doing ninja jujutsu things or CGDCNT(Cute Girls Doing Cute Ninja Things).

Not really too much depth in either the characters or story, so if you're looking for something more relaxed and fun this will likely work for you.

It has gained an almost controversial rep within the community with its use of young girls as its main focal point, but I believe it\'s only problematic if you think it is. At its heart (pun intended), the show is a charming and relaxing slice of life/coming of age about a village of ninja girls as they continue to grow and learn with each other spearheaded by Tsubaki and her growing curiosity about men that they have been conditioned to fear and...hate.STORY: 8/10The main plot of the show is what actually pulled me in and made me decide to give this a go (yes, not the kawaii girls). It is centered around a village of ninja girls in training who are taught to despise all men. Tsubaki is the main protagonist in is senior and arguably most respected and strongest among them. Gradually, Tsubaki becomes increasingly curious as to what men are really like as she begins to develop some strange new feelings and emotions. Overall, this plot point did get a bit old especially when it was abused with the spreading of the Attractiveness Jutsu; at that point it did become a little cringe. Aside from it being a bit overused, the whole concept of the show was very fresh, unique, and intriguing. As I mentioned earlier, at its core, this is a slice of life show about ninja girls; a very unique setting for a slice of life, but hey, it works. The general formula of introducing a new trio of characters in each episode was very fun as it constantly adds something new.I feel that there is still so much potential with the show\'s plot when it goes further into exploring the world of men. Especially with how the surrounding mystery of Hana-sensei\'s past continues to unravel and her secret meeting with a man during the closing moments of the final episode. It feels like the show can trend towards a better direction surrounding its ""men are evil"" theme.ART & STORY: 9/10This aspect is what surprised me most about Kunoichi Tsubaki, it has one of the best animation in an absolutely stacked season. Yes, this show is about ninjas and it includes all the cool fighting, kunai throwing, and jutsu casting that has been so popularized by the likes of Naruto. The fighting sequences are very well done and the character design is so diverse given the fact that this is an entire village of ninja girls. I love how they each have their own specialty in terms of skillset and jutsu\'s which is very creative. Aside from the action sequences, the art style is incredibly crisp and vibrant that really sets the atmosphere of a wholesome and charming show. Special commendation must also be given to the ED of this series as there is a new ED animation for each and every episode which is a great show of care, effort, and detail. When it comes to the music, you have The Peggies headlining the OP and I think that nothing more needs to be said about that. Overall, this would have gotten a 10 in this department if there were more sequences like the final battle in the last episode. Just well put together and choreographed ninja fighting goodness. As a matter of fact, the entirety of the last episode was so good that it left me wanting for more as we were given a glimpse of what all out fighting is like in this series.CHARACTERS: 9/10The main group of the series of Team Dog is a wonderful mix of personalities in itself. You have Tsubaki as the level-headed and mature leader, Sazanka as the crazy and wild variable with an onee-san complex, Asagao and her calm and constantly hungry nature, and the introduction of Rindou to add some depth to the show\'s story midway through. Together these 4 by themselves are already enough to make interesting and hilarious moments, but this show doesn\'t stop there. With each episode, a new team from the village is introduced. We\'re able to learn a bit about their personalities, skills, and dynamics and relationships within their squad and with Team Dog. For all the different characters introduced, each have interesting stories to tell which made each episode fresh and gave viewers something to look forward to each time.ENJOYMENT: 8/10Kunoichi Tsubaki is a wacky and silly ride all the way through. Each episode we\'re treated to new sets of characters and more fun moments. Although the overall plot does stagnate a little during the middle, the show is still plenty of fun to watch and is very easy to watch. It isn\'t necessarily the show I am most excited to watch each week, but is definitely one that I felt I could watch at any moment because of its charming and wholesome atmosphere with sprinkles of ninja fighting goodness.Overall: 8.5/10Definitely a pleasant surprise for this show to be this good and have animation of such a great quality. With a fantastic final episode filled with amazing fight scenes and hints of what\'s to come, I really hope that we will be able to see Tsubaki, Team Dog, and the entire village for a second season. hate.STORY: 8/10The main plot of the show is what actually pulled me in and made me decide to give this a go (yes, not the kawaii girls).

The show is a pretty cut and dry coming of age story about a young girl hitting puberty in a much tamer manner than something like Araburu Kisetsu no Otome-domo yo (O Maidens in their Savage Season). The show is excellently made, has a lot of variety and heart, and without any knowledge of the source manga...I found it to really have a voice of its own that by the end of season delivered a nice slice-of-life character arc for our heroine. I will finish initial thoughts with a declaration, this is an anime for anime fans. If watching a show about a gang of loli’s attempting to learn about boys while the show displays their feet, armpits, and chests makes you feel unusually uncomfortable than don’t watch the show and stfu about it. All that established the show was not nearly as degenerate as I was worried it would be and was mostly just comfy.The best way phrase I could come up with to describe the show is “light-hearted Naruto”. I don’t really know how much of a cultural revolution Naruto started with the mythos of what a “ninja” is, but the setting of the show is about a village of young ninja girls training to become fully fledged kunoichi. Complete with ninja tools and jutsu techniques checking all the boxes including flame breath, shadow binding, transformation, and cloning.There’s something very nostalgic to me about the musical score. A lot of the typical slice-of-life slide flute and piano shows up in the score, but a lot of establishing shots and scenes are set to the tunes of Sanshin and other traditional instruments that really took me back to the anime and games of my youth. The OP was very well made, fun, and looked great. Every single ED was styled based on and vocalized by different cast members encouraging the viewer to stay and watch each credits sequence to make sure they don’t miss out on the epilogue found every episode.Plot was simple and refreshing after having just watched Cyberpunk: Edgerunners. It really is just a story about the daily lives of young girls in school with a ninja flair. The exact same story could essentially be told in a modern-day boarding school. Every episode was broken into two segments with one usually focusing on a specific set of characters. This made each 24-minute episode feel very full, utilizing every second of runtime. Tsubaki’s obsession with learning about men didn’t overtake the plot of every episode and the conclusion to her arc and coming to terms with getting older by the end of the show was a nice clean way to end this course in a way that I really don’t feel an urge to check out the manga until it is confirmed finished serialization.Final notes and reiteration.

I liked it, but there was no man in the story, it was all hidden☹️And the fact...that he didn't have a good fight at all, the story of the last episode with an unknown creature, in this uncle's opinion, is one of the negative points..... that he didn't have a good fight at all, the story of the last episode with an unknown creature, in this uncle's opinion, is one of the negative points.....""]"
