Renkin San-kyuu Magical? Pokaan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/941/Renkin_San-kyuu_Magical_Pokaan,"['I\'m not really a fan of ecchi comedies, and at first glance that what Renkin San-kyuu Magical? Pokaan (or MagiPoka as it\'s more commonly known), looks like. However, the old aphorism about never judging a book by it\'s cover applies to many anime and manga titles, and this is one of them. Anyone who labels this show as an ecchi comedy has probably missed most of the humour in it. Yes, there are ecchi moments, but unlike many other shows (e.g. Eiken, Amaenaide Yo!, Girls Bravo et al), MagiPoka has very strong anarchic and surrealistic comedy elements.In other words, this series has more in common...with Seto no Hanayome, Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle, Inukami, Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu and other strange and equally ""wrong"" shows than it does with the typical ecchi comedies.The story is, surprisingly, very straightforward. Four princesses from the underworld (a witch, a vampire, a werewolf, and a female frankenstein type android), are living on earth and learning about humanity.Cue the comedy.The show is generally episodic in nature, but each episode is usually split into two individual stories so the viewer gets 24 episodesinstead of 12. This format suits MagiPoka because of the nature of the comedy involved, and although there will be detractors who want ongoing plot development, this show doesn\'t really suffer from any failings in that department as the main point of the series is to make the audience laugh.The art and animation are pretty decent overall. There are some irregular moments in the animation, and the characters sometimes look like they were finished in a rush. In all honesty though these minor flaws are not really an issue to one\'s enjoyment of the show as MagiPoka has many hilarious moments that easily rival sketches and skits found in some of the big guns of comedy anime (that and you may be laughing too much to care).The sound is pretty decent overall, and the show has a nice range of background tracks and effects which are usually put to good use (although some are noticeably off-kilter). One of the things that sets this show apart though (at least for me), are the OP and ED.The ED shows one of the girls in (or on), a vehicle of some sort, but the entire thing (girl and vehicle), is actually a wind up toy, and all of it is animated in 3d. The ED songs are also tailored to each girl shown in the credit sequence (usually a different princess per episode), and the music is purposely made to sound like it\'s being sung in a karaoke booth.The OP on the other hand, has been specifically designed to be misleading. The opening track is a half decent J-rock song that has dark and serious overtones. This is reflected in the animation of the opening sequence as it shows the girls with injuries or being seductive, implies nakedness, and even goes so far as to include a bit of shoujo-ai. After watching the first few episodes, then re-watching the OP, I couldn\'t help but laugh at the joke (feel free to ask if you don\'t understand it).One area where MagiPoka excels is with the characters. All four girls have simple personalities, and are amazingly funny because of this. As they\'re from the netherworld, the misconception is that they\'re evil when nothing could be further from the truth. Each of the girls has quirks that are hilarious as well - the android sinks in water as she\'s too heavy, the vampire wears a large cardboard box on her head when she goes out in the sun, the witch simply doesn\'t understand anything and her magic only works well when she\'s ill, and the werewolf has a tendency to turn into a small dog  when she\'s excited. There\'s more than just those quirks as well, but you\'ll have to watch the show to see them.Now I\'ll freely admit that I\'m a fan of strange, weird, and just plain silly comedies, and I honestly enjoyed MagiPoka immensely, especially the first half of episode 6 - coming back from the dead has never been funnier. The show won\'t appeal to everyone, but fans of Inukami, Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle, Seto no Hanayome, Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu and other shows of that ilk should may find something to entertain them here. The main thing that may put people off watching is the lack of plot and character development, but this is one of those shows that doesn\'t really need any of that stuff, and is probably better without it.Renkin San-kyuu Magical? Pokaan is odd, anarchic, and very wrong at times. It\'s also extremely funny, and I\'d recommend it to anyone with half an ounce of humour in their body. This show was never meant to be taken seriously, so don\'t be fooled into thinking this is something it\'s not.Seriously, don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover. with Seto no Hanayome, Yoshinaga-san`chi no Gargoyle, Inukami, Jungle wa Itsumo Hale Nochi Guu and other strange and equally ""wrong"" shows than it does with the typical ecchi comedies.The story is, surprisingly, very straightforward.

Pokaan (I\'ll use ""Magical Pokaan"" for the rest of the review).Story: As usual for slice-of-life comedy series there isn\'t that much of a continuing story. To be precise every episode consists of two short completed stories which have nothing to do with the other episodes, which makes this series good for non-continuing watching. Magical Pokaan is good for inserting a random episode in your anime watching just when you need...a break of the anime you are currently watching.Art: The character designs are good and the animation itself is nice and clearly. there is nothing to complain about it.Sound: The opening song Senketsu no Chikai by Yousei Teikoku is quite catchy even though it is somehow misleading to what Magical Pokaan actually is (as well as the opening video itself is misleading). The ending songs are variations of the same song fitting the individual characters. These ending songs are much more fitting the style of the story since they are your usual standard jpop anime song.The seiyuu cast is good including Hirano Aya as the vampire Pachira, they did a good job at voicing the characters.Character: As mentioned earlier the characters are all kind of supernatural girls living together in a flat share. The characters of this series are making it as enjoyable as it is since they are all very likable and funny in their unique ways.Enjoyment: I really enjoyed watching this show. Magical Pokaan is a good anime to watch when you just want something entertaining where you don\'t have to think that much about it. It\'s good for an anime evening with friends or just for randomly watching an episode. You don\'t miss anything when you let Magical Pokaan rest for some weeks and continue watching it afterwards.Overall: Magical Pokaan is fun to watch. As allready mentioned in the enjoyment part it is nice for randomly watching it.

Unless, of course, you think it is a mostly disconnected set of episodes filled with absurdist humor, and largely free of ecchi content. Majipoka is more cute and/or moe than ecchi. There are some mildly ecchi moments, but they serve the humor rather than distract from it.The show makes great fun of the modern world and of pop culture. I like that kind of humor, especially when it avoids specific references to other media. Majipoka does just that. Enjoying it requires no familiarity with any other shows or media.Even if you aren’t immediately thrilled with Majipoka,...you may want to keep watching. It is made of pairs of half-length episodes. They are only marginally related, and each brings something new to the show. The downside of this is that people who insist on having some grand overarching story will not like Majipoka, but for those of us who can enjoy what is right in front of us, the show is excellent fun.Given its pacing, I would recommend Majipoka to anyone who likes slice of life anime. I would also recommend it to anyone who likes its brand of humor. Try a bit and see. you may want to keep watching. It is made of pairs of half-length episodes.

Never heard of them? Well, they don't have many credits to their name so that's not a surprise. Let's hope it gives as favourable first impression.Story:We follow four princesses from the Netherworld. The witch, Uma, the vampire, Pachira, the werewolf, Liru & the android, Aiko. One of these things is not like the others, not like the others, not like the others. The four of them are living in the human world and all kinds of shenanigans ensue. That's the basic crux of the comedy in...the series, the bizarre outsiders getting into strange situations.The biggest weakness in the comedy is simply that the series sometimes puts its desire for more fan service over its humour. Its “jokes” that revolve around under garments or nudity tend to be the weakest. Sometimes they get a funny one out there, but they're mostly just too predictable and not in the Space Balls, I can quote this by heart because it was just so memorable, way. No, it's in the “this joke was obvious and really heavily telegraphed” way.With that aside, this series does have a lot of funny moments. It melds the zany absurdism of a series like Galaxy Angel with the supernatural outsiders trying to engage with humanity aspect of Bottle Fairy and the two do mesh well. The whole “drinking game” episode is really funny. So is the sentai team parody episode. Actually, those two both remind me of episodes from the aforementioned Galaxy Angel but with completely different execution. The tanuki bit is one that involves some more ecchi elements, but still manages to be a surprise and pretty funny to boot. There are plenty of other funny bits as well.Characters:The series has one of those casts that only works in a comedy. The characters are zany, a bit shallow and, fortunately, have a good amount of comedic potential to their interactions. Remic could do a good four series more of this and not exhaust the possibilities. Even the minor characters who show up once or twice tend to have enough moments to be memorable. The invisible girl being the prime example. Which effectively makes them a strong cast for a comedic work. Although Aiko's desire to become human is a bit odd. It's like they were inspired by the best series of Star Trek but couldn't be bothered to put in the more substantial characterisation that makes that motivation make sense.Art:All of you who are familiar with my reviews know exactly what my complaint is in regards to the art. Yes, it's our old nemesis, excessive fan-service again. At least in a totally not serious series like this the only way it detracts is just based on the general crassness rather than being detrimental to the tone or impractical. I also have to give them credit for trying to blend the fan-service with the humour to make it relevant, even if that is the weak point of the comedy. I kind of like the character designs (they might've overdone the invisible girl's make up though) and the artistic direction is generally really good.Sound:For our main cast we have Nabatame Hitomi (also Aida Mana), Hirano Aya (also Haruhi), Saitou Momoko (also Solty) & Akesaka Satomi (also Korokoro) as our main characters. The four of them give really good performances and work well together. Then we have the music. This is one of those series where the theme tune doesn't remotely fit. Maybe Remic thought it would be a nice jape to put in a really serious looking theme tune, but it kind of doesn't work when you use the same tune with every episode. It would be another thing completely if they kept changing it to other tunes that ran completely opposite to the tone but they never do. The ending theme tune changes regularly, but the opening is just the same overly serious thing every time and it just comes across as inept.Ho-yay:There's a little bit here and there, but the series is always quick to remind you that all of these girls are looking for handsome boyfriends. Because, you know, it's a comedy about a group of girls and if you didn't remind people they were straight they'd be shipping them all together. Although, let's be fair, it could have very well just been that they had some good jokes about their romantic misadventures. This series does have quite a few of those. What are they supposed to do, have the same kinds of jokes about them pursuing other girls? That sounds like something I'd write. (New comedy, Tuesdays after the case files of Detective Hildegard. Except not really.)Final Thoughts:Magipoka, is a pretty solid comedy. Not the greatest one of all time, certainly, but it is quite good. If you enjoy zany absurdity, or the whole outsider trying to fit in types of comedy, give it a go. You'll probably get some laughs out of it. My rating stands at a solid 7/10.

What a surprise with this anime!!!When I saw pictures from this anime, I thought nothing much about it, it was just another anime to check out, but from the start it became a memorable one. It 's just one story about the life of four stereotype characters from tales: vampire, werewolf, android and witch, all of them innocent girls but with a ecchi touch, just a little, making things incredibly funny and unusual, trying to living in peace with humans in our mortal world; isn't the biggest plot ever but is so easy to love very quickly these girls from the bottom of...your heart as every episode pass by. If you're searching some anime to laugh a lot and not be picky about the style of drawing, give it a shot, you'll not regret it, is a simply anime but at the same time original, good luck!!! your heart as every episode pass by. If you're searching some anime to laugh a lot and not be picky about the style of drawing, give it a shot, you'll not regret it, is a simply anime but at the same time original, good luck!!!"", 'Imagine if four magical princesses — a vampire, a werewolf, an android, and a witch — all boarded the same house, with little knowledge about the human world. For example, in Episode 2: まやかしの呪文はTVショッピング (""The Make-Believe Spell is TV Shopping""), the girls fall for some infomercial scams and order a ton of worthless items! The series itself is less of a monster show and more of a comedy, slice-of-life with a group of gal pals experiencing practical things, in the real world! As well as some strange supernatural events, like a group of devious ※Japanese raccoon dogs tricking the gullible girls into bathing in an...imaginary hot spring!※Also known as tanuki (タヌキ).⚠️ This review is spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersIf you\'re a huge otaku, transitioning into a point in their adulthood that\'s really hard to handle, I suggest watching this anime. That is, if you don\'t mind a bit of ecchi in your cartoons. When I watched this series, there were a lot of things going on in my life, and I think that\'s why it\'s so special to me. I was at a point where I was feeling a caducity in my existence, and this series reminded me of the child-like joy that series like Doraemon (1979) helped me experience, once again!Usually with moe shows, I don\'t expect the female characters to act like real girls. This is a controversial opinion, but growing up as a girl, I never related to the K-On! cast... despite being directed by Naoko Yamada, a woman, it always felt like they were what men imagine high school girls to be like, instead of the actual reality. I love Naoko\'s Yamada\'s Tamako Market, but despite a few nuances with adolescent confusion, the girls didn\'t feel like actual girls. The dialogue is very romanticized. But, in Renkin San-kyū Magical? Pokān, the dialogue flows naturally, like how actual girls would communicate.Yes, there\'s otaku references. Yes, there are some pandering in the ecchi scenes. But, overall, the characters felt very genuine in their relations with each other and the comedy felt really natural. There are also some really nice scenes of wonderment, like the girls get to ride a space train, that directly parodies Leiji Matsumoto\'s Galaxy Express 999. You can probably tell from my favorites list, that I have a soft spot for flying trains, since the aforementioned Galaxy Express 999 and Night on the Galactic Railway, are in my top 150 list!It\'s difficult to reveal too much — without ruining the experience for everyone else, but I felt a fervor for this series, that I don\'t for many animated shows. The friendships, the untethered humor, and the cast of characters had such great chemistry together! The mix of real-world practicality, supernatural wonder, and vivacious characters really made this series for me. I really did not expect to love it as much as I did, but here I am, singing its praises!Luna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Ken\'ichi Yatagai (director), notable works:* Be-Boy Kidnapp\'n Idol* Dōjin Work* Macross II: Lovers Again ✅* Tenchi Muyō! Ryōōki — 2nd Season, 3rd Season, Omatsuri Zenjitsu no Yoru! (""The Night Before The Carnival""), and Galaxy Police Mihoshi Space Adventure ✅* Zettai Bōei LeviathanCommentary: Mr. Yatagai\'s work on the Tenchi Muyō! Ryōōki series and Macross II: Lovers Again are both respectable ventures. Based on what I\'ve seen of his work, including a couple episodes of Zettai Bōei Leviathan — I am comfortable with saying that Renkin 3-kyū Magical? Pokān is, in my opinion, his magnum opus. No, the sakuga is not insane, off-the-wall, madness! But, similarly to the atmosphere in the Tenchi Muyō series, he\'s able to create an atmosphere that is both cozy and is a great setting for gag-humor! Perhaps, some of that charm was lost with his transition to digital animation, in Zettai Bōei Leviathan. Who can really say for sure? But, all of the components of this series: the visual style, the cast of brilliant seiyū talents, and the script writing staff (which oddly enough, weren\'t credited?) made this series coagulate into a vessel that is rarely experienced in the medium! Legendary director!Momoko Saitō as Uma (or Yūma), notable roles:* Choco, Chocotto Sister* Tsuyuri, Dōjin Work* Perrier La Mer, Hoshi no Umi no Amuri* Maria Nanadan VII, Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari (""Tenchi Muyo!

Her characterization is an amalgam of honestly adorable moments, silly mishaps, and sprinkles of adult, otaku-oriented ""in-jokes""! Her earnestness and peppy nature, completely won me over! My favorite role from Ms. Saitō, is her performance as Momoko Tōyoko in Saki, even though I thought she was hilarious as Hatabō in Osomatsu-san, too! Amazing seiyū!※Fun Fact — Yūma\'s rabbit creature is voiced by Nomico, the original singer of the song ""Bad Apple"" from the famous 東方Project MV!Hitomi Nabatame as Liru, notable roles:* Nanao Ise, Bleach* Noi, Blue Dragon: Tenkai no Shichi Ryū* Kanade Sakurai, Candy Boy ✅* Kiri Kikyō, Canvas 2: Niji-iro no Sketch* Sena Aoi, ChäoS;HEAd ✅* Mana Aida, Dokidoki!

Her characterization of Liru is one word: lovable! Even though I preferred Yūma and Pachira, Liru is, without a doubt, the internet\'s favorite! She even had a CG-animated, dōjin game made about her — the creator must have been an insanely dedicated fan! But then again, she is like a goddess in dōjin circles, she has played some of the most iconic eroge roles, like Arcueid Brunestud in Shingetsutan Tsukihime, and has even voiced Eirin Yagokoro, in the 東方Project dōjin anime!

Pokān, Ms. Akesaka was able to get in some genuinely hilarious moments. Most of which, had to do with her android body malfunctioning in really exaggerated ways! I really, really love Satomi Akesaka as Rinko Shirokane in ""BanG Dream,"" too! Great seiyū!Renkin San-kyū Magical? Pokān is a special series, it isn\'t everyday that I get so invested in a cast of characters or get a recurring juvenescence of warm-fuzzy feelings! This show is such a fun ride, and the very last scene — I won\'t spoil what happens, but it made me tear up with catharsis and optimism. This series isn\'t just an ecchi comedy, it\'s much more than that — it goes far beyond what you would expect out of either of those genres! With a heart full of appreciation, I give Renkin San-kyū Magical? Pokān a 9/10!Rating: ★★★★★ imaginary hot spring!※Also known as tanuki (タヌキ).⚠️ This review is spoiler-free ⚠️—Story/CharactersIf you\'re a huge otaku, transitioning into a point in their adulthood that\'s really hard to handle, I suggest watching this anime. That is, if you don\'t mind a bit of ecchi in your cartoons. When I watched this series, there were a lot of things going on in my life, and I think that\'s why it\'s so special to me. I was at a point where I was feeling a caducity in my existence, and this series reminded me of the child-like joy that series like Doraemon (1979) helped me experience, once again!Usually with moe shows, I don\'t expect the female characters to act like real girls. This is a controversial opinion, but growing up as a girl, I never related to the K-On! cast... despite being directed by Naoko Yamada, a woman, it always felt like they were what men imagine high school girls to be like, instead of the actual reality. I love Naoko\'s Yamada\'s Tamako Market, but despite a few nuances with adolescent confusion, the girls didn\'t feel like actual girls. The dialogue is very romanticized. But, in Renkin San-kyū Magical? Pokān, the dialogue flows naturally, like how actual girls would communicate.Yes, there\'s otaku references. Yes, there are some pandering in the ecchi scenes. But, overall, the characters felt very genuine in their relations with each other and the comedy felt really natural. There are also some really nice scenes of wonderment, like the girls get to ride a space train, that directly parodies Leiji Matsumoto\'s Galaxy Express 999. You can probably tell from my favorites list, that I have a soft spot for flying trains, since the aforementioned Galaxy Express 999 and Night on the Galactic Railway, are in my top 150 list!It\'s difficult to reveal too much — without ruining the experience for everyone else, but I felt a fervor for this series, that I don\'t for many animated shows. The friendships, the untethered humor, and the cast of characters had such great chemistry together! The mix of real-world practicality, supernatural wonder, and vivacious characters really made this series for me. I really did not expect to love it as much as I did, but here I am, singing its praises!Luna\'s Favorite Works by Each Respective Creator = ✅Ken\'ichi Yatagai (director), notable works:* Be-Boy Kidnapp\'n Idol* Dōjin Work* Macross II: Lovers Again ✅* Tenchi Muyō! Ryōōki — 2nd Season, 3rd Season, Omatsuri Zenjitsu no Yoru! (""The Night Before The Carnival""), and Galaxy Police Mihoshi Space Adventure ✅* Zettai Bōei LeviathanCommentary: Mr. Yatagai\'s work on the Tenchi Muyō! Ryōōki series and Macross II: Lovers Again are both respectable ventures. Based on what I\'ve seen of his work, including a couple episodes of Zettai Bōei Leviathan — I am comfortable with saying that Renkin 3-kyū Magical? Pokān is, in my opinion, his magnum opus. No, the sakuga is not insane, off-the-wall, madness! But, similarly to the atmosphere in the Tenchi Muyō series, he\'s able to create an atmosphere that is both cozy and is a great setting for gag-humor! Perhaps, some of that charm was lost with his transition to digital animation, in Zettai Bōei Leviathan. Who can really say for sure? But, all of the components of this series: the visual style, the cast of brilliant seiyū talents, and the script writing staff (which oddly enough, weren\'t credited?) made this series coagulate into a vessel that is rarely experienced in the medium! Legendary director!Momoko Saitō as Uma (or Yūma), notable roles:* Choco, Chocotto Sister* Tsuyuri, Dōjin Work* Perrier La Mer, Hoshi no Umi no Amuri* Maria Nanadan VII, Isekai no Seikishi Monogatari (""Tenchi Muyo! War on Geminar"")* Hatabō, Osomatsu-san ✅* Melancholy, Phi Brain: Kami no Puzzle* Momoko Tōyoko, Saki ✅* Solty Sevant, Solty Rei* Sakura Shishidō, Sora wo Kakeru Shōjo* Nazuna Takanashi, Working!! ✅Commentary: I haven\'t heard many of Ms. Saitō\'s performances, but her comedic stroke of genius as Yūma, made her my best girl — and I\'m a really big fan of Aya Hirano, so I thought Pachira would be my favorite character, for sure! Her characterization is an amalgam of honestly adorable moments, silly mishaps, and sprinkles of adult, otaku-oriented ""in-jokes""! Her earnestness and peppy nature, completely won me over! My favorite role from Ms. Saitō, is her performance as Momoko Tōyoko in Saki, even though I thought she was hilarious as Hatabō in Osomatsu-san, too! Amazing seiyū!※Fun Fact — Yūma\'s rabbit creature is voiced by Nomico, the original singer of the song ""Bad Apple"" from the famous 東方Project MV!Hitomi Nabatame as Liru, notable roles:* Nanao Ise, Bleach* Noi, Blue Dragon: Tenkai no Shichi Ryū* Kanade Sakurai, Candy Boy ✅* Kiri Kikyō, Canvas 2: Niji-iro no Sketch* Sena Aoi, ChäoS;HEAd ✅* Mana Aida, Dokidoki!

Her characterization of Liru is one word: lovable! Even though I preferred Yūma and Pachira, Liru is, without a doubt, the internet\'s favorite! She even had a CG-animated, dōjin game made about her — the creator must have been an insanely dedicated fan! But then again, she is like a goddess in dōjin circles, she has played some of the most iconic eroge roles, like Arcueid Brunestud in Shingetsutan Tsukihime, and has even voiced Eirin Yagokoro, in the 東方Project dōjin anime!

Since Pachira is a vampire, she is naturally vain, to a silly degree — like all of the other characters, their preternatural attributes are heavily satirized — and Ms. Hirano is great at making the glove fit.

Through my long journey with anime and manga, I\'ve stumbled across many so-called ""ecchi"" series, and yet all I saw was a bland fanservice only growing up kid would laugh at. My disappointment was broken though when I decided to watch this. It was probably one of very few series that I laughed out loud thanks to. I finally felt like I was watching an ecchi that has actual jokes in them. Combined with a simplicity of the plot and more moe-like look of the characters (yet not looking like absolute children...which would gross me out in an ecchi to no end) gives its viewers something so light-hearted that is enough to light up your day and restore some energy when you really need it. It\'s not the peak of art and form, but I think it\'s still worth watching considering how little it takes for it to make someone smile with its own nonsense. which would gross me out in an ecchi to no end) gives its viewers something so light-hearted that is enough to light up your day and restore some energy when you really need it.

The characters are super charming of course, and I also love how this show isn\'t afraid to have attractive male side-characters that the girls actively fawn over. Despite ostensibly being an ecchi comedy, they are depicted with genuine agency and they\'re allowed to be silly or stupid or unattractive sometimes!Bad: There\'s a couple weird moments that don\'t really work for me, and the way the...rule of three is used almost formulaically doesn\'t always quite hit (Or rather, a lot of the time it\'s extended to a ""rule of 4"" which can feel a bit dragged out). I would also have liked if it was a bit less episodic so there could be some lasting development and an overarching story.Music: The soundtrack is actually excellent. Beautifully written and arranged, with live instruments everywhere. The way the opening theme is used as a leitmotif is really skillful and fun too. Coupled with the competent musical direction it\'s a lovely musical experience overall. Here\'s an extra sentence to emphasize how much I like this soundtrack!Best girl: In 2008 I thought Pachira was best girl, but now that I\'m older I have to change my mind to Aiko!

The fact that it\'s ecchi and even has some hentai scenes in one episode probably drives a lot of viewers away but thats ok because ""real"" anime fans are the target audience of this show. It\'s funny, it\'s cute, it\'s relaxing, it\'s got cool supernatural stories.I see some people hating on it for being episodic which I don\'t really get. Some shows are episodic, stories have been told episodically  for millennia and there\'s nothing wrong with it. I preferred being able to put this on to wind down when I felt like...watching something chill and funny. I wonder if some people who hate episodic shows just ruin them for themselves by watching them straight through? watching something chill and funny.

Starship Operators,https://myanimelist.net/anime/342/Starship_Operators,"['I must admit that I started this show because one of my favorite singers performed in it (Mami Kawada).  Though I do enjoy the science fiction genre so Starship Operators seemed to be a perfect match.  So let’s get on with the review!The story is mixed for me.  This is a serious story that for the most part is pretty good. It does a good job of giving you an overview of the universe in which the plot takes place in and moves along pretty steadily.  The story revolves around a group of cadets for the military of Kibi on their...last training cruise, when their home planet is attacked by a rival known as the Kingdom, the cadets are left to fend for themselves when their instructors all abandon ship and surrender. (Ja I thought that was silly too).  They decide to fight and their struggle is documented by a news network.  I did find myself drawn into the story however it has a number of flaws that really hurt it.  One, this series is really too short and there just isn’t enough time to develop a complex storyline.  Because of this most of the tragedy and drama that occur really garner very little emotional reaction.  Also the plot felt rushed at the end, almost like the director found out he only had 1 episode left to finish the story.  The ending was ok but it left things open that I really expected to be resolved by the end of the show.The characters are where Starship Operators really suffers.  They are interesting for the most part but we get almost no back story or development on any of them.  Several romances spring up, one in particular you expect a resolution from in the end but it seems to be forgotten about.  There is also a lot of tragedy and drama that it supposed to effect the viewer emotionally, however because we don’t have anything invested in any of the characters when a death occurs you don’t really feel anything.  I kind of relate it to the old Star Trek series, when the ""red shirts"" would meet their deaths.  I find this to be a problem with a lot of series that have so many characters.  The show is too short to develop any of them and because there are so many everyone suffers.Visually the show is great.  The battles are exciting and there is a lot of action.  The character animation is also very well done.  The OP and ED music are good too, since this was one of the things that drew me to the show in the first place.Starship Operators is a decent space opera.  It has serious themes that will appeal to older viewers and enough action that younger viewers would be entertained.  In the end this show is just average.  It does some things really well so it’s difficult for me to recommend.  If you like space battles or sci-fi then you probably would enjoy it. last training cruise, when their home planet is attacked by a rival known as the Kingdom, the cadets are left to fend for themselves when their instructors all abandon ship and surrender.

We try to review ""Starship Operators"".Starship Operators, was created in 2005. And while there has been better productions, in terms of production values (especially things made in 2005); this one stands out for a number of reasons.1). StoryFor those of us that like a good story, with a great plot, and an excellent sense of the politics connected with it; Starship Operators is very difficult to beat.The plot, while not new, is not the same as common. It involves a ships\' crew that refuses to surrender when their country (in this case a planet) is conquered. They proceed to prove themselves in...battle against the enemy, creating so much political pressure (as a result of public broadcasts of the battles on television) that a number of politicians and planets find themselves in an ethically untenable position; ending in a resolution that can only provide for better government in the future.Intrigue is afoot, and even skulduggery and outright murder is some of the occasions to cheer, in this story; that provides a satisfying beginning, middle and ending.2). ArtworkMost of the artwork is nothing to write home about, but much of the visual descriptions of technology are to die for; at least as it pertains to the available graphics of 2005. Attempts at 3d artwork are compelling, and display screens and data are interestingly accurate.For example, when an enemy vessel is 2-million miles away, the targeting information is fairly accurate to near-speed-of-light plasma cannon weaponry. Reporting of a firing solution comes up with somewhere around 10 to 12-seconds. We don\'t see attention to detail to this level very often.3). SoundWhile the basic sound and effects are fairly run of the mill, the music for events, and the OP and ED soundtrack is quite good.I will warn you, the dubbed English version of the dialog is absolutely awful, as many of the voice actors can\'t read lines and cannot emote verbally at all. Stick to the subbed english dialog, the Japanese voice actors are quite good. I don\'t say this because of a predisposition one way or another; I own anime, some of which I prefer in Japanese, and others that I prefer in English.4). CharactersEach and every one of the characters have their own personalities, activities and personal prejudices. They are three-dimensional. Hard to do in a 13-episode anime, but Starship Operators succeeds beyond my expectations.5). EnjoymentWhile this is not one of those anime easy to appreciate, since it is depressing at points, and leads the viewer to a bittersweet ending; the proper thing to say would be that the Satisfaction is very high. It\'s story succeeds, the characters do their jobs even when they are imperfect, the good guys are properly flawed rather than paragons of virtue, and the villains are (as in life) a mixture of good and bad parts in their personalities.While this show may not please folks that need mindless combat, or continuous action; and it won\'t please the other side of the spectrum that are in constant need of romantic entanglements; Starship Operators can be enjoyed by anyone that can think above the 10th grade level, and has a proper intellect that can keep depictions of personal relationships in perspective.That said, I can wholeheartedly recommend ""Starship Operators"" with a score of 9. battle against the enemy, creating so much political pressure (as a result of public broadcasts of the battles on television) that a number of politicians and planets find themselves in an ethically untenable position; ending in a resolution that can only provide for better government in the future.Intrigue is afoot, and even skulduggery and outright murder is some of the occasions to cheer, in this story; that provides a satisfying beginning, middle and ending.2).

What kind of admirer of the Golden Age of Science Fiction, especially Heinlein\'s juvenile science fiction novels, would suspect in an anime hiding behind a poster with kawaii girls a plot worthy of Robert himself? If you look at the poster you’d probably suspect that it’s another miserable harem in the space opera genre (which is certainly not) with swaying ""oppai"", lusciously slobbering pseudo-romance, giant humanoid mecha, extremely imbecile behavior and stupid motivation of characters, as well as close combat within line of sight (sic!) in outer space. However “Starship Operators” (I just wanted to write “Starship...Troopers”), minus the kawaii girls, is genuine early Heinlein - here you also have space cadets - young geniuses who are growing from boys to ..., or rather, from girls to women, very believable political intrigues and realistic battles in space (perhaps, minus the latter, which turned out to be too ""epic""). Battles here are not conducted by meaningless giant humanoid robots and not even in the line of sight, not to mention the crazy massive frontal assaults, but through tactics and maneuvers, radars and sensors, calculation and timing, with the study of the enemy\'s weaknesses, to each of which an individual approach is applied (it seems that the author of the original used real naval battles of the Second World War as inspiration) and, of course, luck - everything is like in Heinlein\'s stories, where the heroes prevail by the means of reason and calculation. It\'s really interesting to watch the battles here. However, even the actual matriarchy with kawaii girls is suspiciously reminiscent of the matriarchy of Free Traders from the ""Citizen of the Galaxy"" of ""early Heinlein "", while ""late Heinlein"" even more so was a great admirer of matriarchy.The plot here is without fillers and sagging - as it fascinates from the very beginning, from the moment when the ship was ""seized"" by cadets inspired by a small group of conspirators (through its ransom through a sponsor) in protest against the surrender of their home planet, and keeps in suspense throughout the journey of this team through battles, political intrigue and betrayal, attempts to find allies and simply a port in order to replenish supplies and repair the ship. The enemy acts not only by military means, but also through psychological and political manipulations, trying to undermine the morale and deprive the ""pirates"" of any outside support. The heroes, with a few exceptions, are not at all perfect, but not repulsive either - including the captain who panicked from time to time in battle, but who at the same time is a good and responsible administrator who forces himself to behave with dignity and uses his inherent caution to identify weaknesses in ""constructions""of his brilliant executive officer; his beloved cold-blooded and manipulative politician girl, whose fears and real feelings only rarely give out through involuntary tears; a good man - the chief engineer, nevertheless committing stupidity (I suspect that in this scene the genre of ""mecha"" with its ""humanoid giant robots"" and ""heroically"" hysterical attacks is subtly ridiculed), apparently out of a desire to show off in front of Sinon (it’s worth notion that the enemies are shown to be quite humane - they were retreating and did not even want to shoot at the ""heroic"" engineers, having done so only when absolutely necessary). Even a cynical and sneaky TV show producer turns out to be capable of an heroic act at the end (however, hardly out of philanthropy). Basically, the characters are revealed qualitatively - through their actions rather than through words.Political intrigues here do not cause irritation by absurdity, as well as heroes by being stereotypical. Perhaps there are no unequivocally positive and negative characters and ""forces"", but the ship\'s crew is written ""nicely"" enough to arouse the viewer\'s empathy. And, yes, some favorite heroes die, most often as a result of ""heroism"" (sometimes unreasonable) - there is no place for victories with hysterical screams of mentally retarded “heroes” that flooded modern anime. But there are no senseless ""murders for the sake of murders"" of characters, as well as stupid self-sacrifices (except for one, quite expected). Of the characters only Sinon sometimes causes irritation as she is too unnaturally ideal and ingenious - but for the virtual ""embodiment of Amaterasu"" it is perhaps forgivable ) So you certainly shouldn\'t judge this anime by the cover. I would even say that the cover is simply deceiving the viewer by mis-positioning Starship Operators. Those who admire serious, thoughtful anime with a good storyline, may be turned of by the cover, as it at first turned me of. For the admirers of ""kawaii"" and actual space opera genre like Star Wars, this anime simply might be a disappointment. This is for such incorrect positioning I will lower the score - after all, girls will be uninterested in the Starship Operators as well as those boys at which the positioning is aimed at, while the target audience may pass by deceived by such a poster. But, perhaps, there is no other reason to lower the assessment - 9 out of 10. Troopers”), minus the kawaii girls, is genuine early Heinlein - here you also have space cadets - young geniuses who are growing from boys to ..., or rather, from girls to women, very believable political intrigues and realistic battles in space (perhaps, minus the latter, which turned out to be too ""epic""). Battles here are not conducted by meaningless giant humanoid robots and not even in the line of sight, not to mention the crazy massive frontal assaults, but through tactics and maneuvers, radars and sensors, calculation and timing, with the study of the enemy\'s weaknesses, to each of which an individual approach is applied (it seems that the author of the original used real naval battles of the Second World War as inspiration) and, of course, luck - everything is like in Heinlein\'s stories, where the heroes prevail by the means of reason and calculation. It\'s really interesting to watch the battles here.

I almost did not finish it because the premise was almost too unbelievable (yes, I like Anime's to have some sense of reality). Artwork was very good (Animation mixed in with CGI). The thing that kept me watching was how realistically the creators portrayed the world in which the show takes place. The physics of space, maneuvering, battles, all the way down to how a teardrop should behave in zero-G made this series very interesting. Yes, yes, there is an occasional space warp, but space battles are not fever-pitched like most SF shows. The ships actually take days...to approach and fire their weapons and beams from great distances. The Anime is more about the young crew and how they deal with the political situation they find themselves in. The treatment of physical-realism in a SF show was refreshing.13 episodes.

But only partially. Story about young kids fighting whole kingdom on their own, being rejected again and again is nothing new, but it\'s the way story was told that made it enjoyable. It may not be the best story ever, but I find it to my...liking.ART:Another show I noticed similarities with is one of my favorite shows ""Crest of the stars"". Now, what I expected from this show was something similar in terms of graphics and style. What I got pleasantly surprised me. From the first shots of Amaterasu to nicely done space battles, this show had it done really good. However, biggest flaw was when there were people on screen. As fan of GBA games, I couldn\'t help but notice how some characters act like they\'re from video games, moving only image, but no visible movement of arms, legs or anything else. It just felt funny :) Other than that, it was good.SOUND:Whereas I prefer a little ""faster"" music, I must admit, I was once again surprised how well music was composed into all the action and emotions. However, I did get slightly annoyed by music sometimes, when it was playing, and there was no need for music whatsoever.

One moment a person is doing something one way, other moment that same person is doing the same thing completely different way without any explanation whatsoever. Where this show did shine was love/romance part.

However, that doesn\'t mean I enjoyed in it as much as I wanted to see how it ends. It\'s a good show, quite enjoyable, with quite a few flaws here and there, but not a bad not nevertheless. If you like space drama, something where you get to see both emotions and action, but not too much of either, look no further, you will find both here. If you look for one or other, look somewhere else. This isn\'t a show for you.So OVERALL:Yeah, even though grades for this show vary in my opinion, I felt like a 6 would be fair. As I said before, this is clearly not for everyone. Some will find it boring, some will find it lacking action. I find it to be rather good while it lasts.

It just didn\'t have THAT something other shows had, that have greater marks in my book.But, if you\'re asking yourself should I watch this or not, my answer would be simple.

The story has an original twist compared to other titles for the genre because the crew members rebel and decide to take on the entire invading military estabilisement single-handedly in their state-of-the-art vessel. In addition, the young crew is corned into making a deal with a TV network in order to gain funds to finance their campaign by accepting to be filmed 24/7 - much akin to reality tv.- ANIMATION -The series typically uses CG to handle their spaceship...animations, but it isn't overused and is pretty much reserved to animating their communication displays and panels. In terms of consistency, Starship Operators does a fine job with crisp detailed lineart and fluid motions throughout. The character designs were also carefully thought, the crew are all easily identified and support their own unique personality.Regretably there is actually few combat scenes. Mostly you should expect stills of the spaceships charging up their cannons and then short explosive bursts of CG.- SOUND -Nothing memberable, except for the opening theme. A lot of dialogue. Hardily any background music. I do commend them for not putting sound effects in the space sequences, remember its a vacuum.- CHARACTERS -Expect some of the characters to only last a few episodes. This does mean that you will not engage much with the other remaining staff apart from the leading characters. Personally, I do not agree with the idea that mostly all the crew should be females with exceptional beauty.- VALUE &amp; ENJOYMENT -Because of the nature of this anime, it's a typical 'spirit of youth shall prevail'. Although its a fine addition to the genre in its own right, I personally find the fact that an inexperienced crew can hold its own against an Imperial fleet with limitless resources, unrealistic. The Big-Brother reality tv mimic was interesting but you end up feeling that the political plot is secondary until the final episodes where all of a sudden things escalate without a decent plot development. It was well paced for 13 episodes and although climatic, leaves some room for sequels. animations, but it isn't overused and is pretty much reserved to animating their communication displays and panels.

But if my review helps even one person to decide to watch the show, I'll have felt it worth it.I saw this show some months ago now, watching it in a single sitting, and I'll be yet another person to say that this show was underrated. Yes, it had many flaws, (and I wasn't too fond of the veiled anti-Americanism near the end), but it also had a lot of good points, in my opinion.I liked...how they used a lot of realistic physics, realistic weapons, how most of the battle strategies were logical and believable, and many of the characters made believable decisions/actions, although some of the characters (esp the villains) made very unrealistic and/or rash moves, which was one of the flaws to the show.I also liked how they gave realistic considerations for things like money and supplies, and political support. Many shows in this genre tend to gloss over those, or do it in a haphazard/unbelievable way.But this is one of those show were I personally found it easy to suspend my disbelief. A lot of sci-fi shows put in so much PSG (pseudo-scientific garbage) that suspending disbelief becomes impossible (and thus the show unintentionally becomes a comedy).In Starship Operators, I didn't feel like my intelligence was being insulted, for the most part, until the latter half of the show. I guess that's kind of a good and a bad thing.As for discussions about a second season... They did use up many clever battle strategies in the show, so I don't see how they could ever pull-off a second season. They'd have to be really inventive, but I can't see how they could do that without making it unrealistic/unbelievable. Plus it aired 5 years ago, so....I'd still recommend this show to people who lean more towards hard sci-fi/realism, in spite of it's flaws.Almost forgot to mention, I watched the dubbed version of this show, and I thought it wasn't bad (I normally watch subs by the way). To anyone thinking of watching it, I'd say, at least give the dub a try, unless you're a total dub-hater, in which case, nothing I say will matter, so just stick to your subs, you closed-minded weeaboo. :D (just-kidding XP ) how they used a lot of realistic physics, realistic weapons, how most of the battle strategies were logical and believable, and many of the characters made believable decisions/actions, although some of the characters (esp the villains) made very unrealistic and/or rash moves, which was one of the flaws to the show.I also liked how they gave realistic considerations for things like money and supplies, and political support.

This is not one of them. The soundtrack is pretty good. That’s… that’s about it. The art quality is cheap looks-nice-at-first-glance-and-only-first-glance. And then there are the boob and miniskirt uniforms, the few characters with rather ridiculous anime hair, and the lack of movement or expression outside of really bad mouth animations on most characters that make this look like a bunch of screencaps with moving lips. There’s some cute guys in it and at least one sweet romance? If you want to watch a really low-quality version of a strategy space...navy game, that’s… about all the story you’re getting. Also no, the sweet romance is not the protagonist’s.The first real dialogue we get is between an asshat captain(?) and the primary protagonist and it’s arguably sexual harassment and honestly it’s all downhill from there. Also the dub isn’t the worst I’ve ever seen but given the bad script and arguably shoddy animation, the dub acting is just… bad. And is frequently poorly synched up.I liked this back when it was one of the few anime series I’d ever seen. It was shiny and neat and like a cool video game and the romances were nice. How times change. If you want good science fiction series with a focus on relationships interspersed with ship battles and/or politics focused, watch “Suisei no Gargantia”, “Macross Frontier”, or “Gankutsuou”. “Casshern Sins” is also a pretty good SF series with some fun battles to watch and a focus on philosophy (arguably). navy game, that’s… about all the story you’re getting.

As such, the story has more depth than most and the characters are less exaggerated and a tad more believable.  As with most such adaptations, it is the original work peeking through that makes you keep watching, but what you see is only a shadow of what the story should be.To my knowledge, the Starship Operators light novel has not been translated into English and so I will not have the pleasure of reading it any time soon.  But, it is clear where the anime falters in the...execution of its story.  Many of the explanations are hard to follow, especially while reading the subs and trying to watch at the same time, and the majority of the story telling elements fall flat.  Occasionally it feels like you are watching people enact an event timeline rather than telling a story.  Still, the original work must have been something, since the story was what kept me watching.The art is mediocre at best and the battle scenes are fairly lackluster.  They spend more time talking about what they are going to do instead of actually doing it.  Even then, most of the battle is spent switching between the command crew and tactical screens, only using recycled footage for the outside shots.  The only upside to the art is that most of the women are fairly attractive, if their mini-skirts are a tad ridiculous in null-G.The sound was done well-enough, and helped in large part to keep the viewer immersed in the anime.  On the other hand, there was very little to remember of it.  Thankfully, none of the voices were intolerably high-pitched, and the actors did a fair job with what they had to work with.The characters were understated, to say the least.  This isn't a bad thing, since the anime was more about the events than the people to begin with, and it is a refreshing when compared to the often excessively exaggerated people found in anime.  But it is hard to really feel for them since you only get an outline as to who they are.  The few romantic exploits and back-stories are often clipped short or else feel contrived.  However, they still feel more like real people than many anime.I enjoyed this show for what it was and it kept me engrossed until the end.

Tropical-Rouge! Precure Movie: Yuki no Princess to Kiseki no Yubiwa!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/49426/Tropical-Rouge_Precure_Movie__Yuki_no_Princess_to_Kiseki_no_Yubiwa,"[""Not gonna mince words here, I feel Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure is one of the most annoying, frustrating, and disappointing Pretty Cure seasons I've ever seen. While I can understand wanting to make a more comedic, light-hearted season after the more emotionally charged Healin Good Pretty Cure, TroPri had absolutely no interest in fleshing out its characters beyond Manatsu or Laura, it took forever to progress its plot in any real way, its villains and their actions weren't threatening which made the series lack any real tension or urgency, and as a result, the fights were as boring as eating lunch. So when the movie...was announced, I initially had zero interest in watching it because of how badly the series turned out...until it was revealed that it was going to be a crossover with Heartcatch Pretty Cure, aka my favorite Precure season ever. But having seen the Healin Good movie previously, I was convinced the Heartcatch girls would be reduced to little more than plot devices that appear in two scenes involving fighting alongside the TroPri girls and do nothing else until the plot deemed it convenient, since that's what the Healin Good movie did. So you can imagine that I wasn't exactly looking forward to watching Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure The Movie: The Snow Princess and the Miraculous Ring based on both the series' failings and what the Healin Good movie did with its crossover characters.I finally got around to watching the movie, and...holy shit, the Tropical Rouge movie actually seemed to go out of its way to not only address most of its parent series' flaws, but the flaws that the Healin Good movie had. How the hell did this movie manage to be better than its own parent series?! The plot isn't even all that groundbreaking if you think about it: The Tropical Club has been invited to a snowy kingdom called Shantia, specifically to attend Princess Sharon's coronation ceremony. Laura has even been invited to sing as part of the festivities, something she's very much looking forward to. While there, the girls tour Shantia and encounter the girls from Heartcatch Pretty Cure, getting acquainted with them before discovering secrets about Sharon and Shantia that put not only their lives, but other townspeople that were invited, in mortal danger. It's up to the Tropical Rouge and Heartcatch girls to put a stop to the evil force that threatens to keep them confined to Shantia for eternity.God, I am absolutely amazed at how much Toei seemed to learn from their mistakes both in regards to TroPri's flaws and the Healin Good movie's problems. As much as I liked the Healin Good movie, its biggest issue is that for all that the marketing empathized it being a crossover with Yes Precure 5, the actual Yes girls only appeared in two scenes, felt more like living Deus Ex Machinas to be brought in to save the day than actual characters, and they never interact with the Healin Good girls outside of battles, so they didn't feel like they were that important to the main plot. You could cut them out of that movie entirely and nothing would be lost. The TroPri movie addressed these problems tenfold, as not only do the TroPri girls interact with the Heartcatch girls both before and during the main plot, they remain integral throughout the entire movie and share just as much screentime as the TroPri girls, both outside of and during battle scenes. It helps that the Heartcatch girls' characterization remains true to their parent series, and for anybody who's worried that Erika was just going to be flanderized into the funny girl who makes cartoony faces, rest assured, that doesn't happen, and she even retains a lot of her maturity from the later parts of Heartcatch, though she does have her funny cartoony moments.Even the villain here is surprisingly a lot more compelling than the trio from the series. Yes, her motivation isn't anything new, and has probably been done lots of times and better in other stuff, but compared to how utterly lazy and bland the villain trio was in the series, her actions are actually legitimately threatening and actually manage to create palpable tension and urgency. Granted, the resolution to her plot at the very end came off as woefully cheesy and mealymouthed, and a lot of things about her backstory don't really make a whole lot of sense from a narrative standpoint, but for what its worth, she's still a better villain than Chongire, Numeri, and Elda could ever hope to be. Granted, I do find it kind of annoying that the movie decided to have Laura be the main focus of the movie and have her be the one to interact with Sharon the most, because God knows the producers just LOVE shilling Laura to high heaven, and I know many people didn't like this about the series. But I do feel that Laura did get some good material out of it, so I don't think it was all bad. The movie does have one flaw it shares with the series: It still doesn't do much with Sango, Minori, and Asuka, because heaven forbid we take the focus away from Manatsu and Laura even for five seconds, but it does make up for this by having Tsubomi and Erika receive just as much time in the limelight, even if it does result in Itsuki and Yuri not doing much.But for as much as the TroPri movie does right, it's not without its own issues. For one...for a movie, the animation is actually kind of cheap-looking. Other than a few key shots, the animation isn't much better than its parent series. It almost feels like the movie was given a TV series budget, and that should not be. Several minutes are dedicated to stock footage of transformation scenes that go uninterrupted, which I'm pretty sure was done to save on costs. The soundtrack isn't much to write home about either, though I do really like that new remix of the Heartcatch Pretty Cure transformation music, so that's a plus right there. Furthermore, near the end of the movie, various shots are edited and cut in a weirdly erratic manner, and parts of them feel like stuff happened off screen without a real explanation for why they happened, such as how a character got from point A to point B without an explanation for how they got there and why when they were occupied with something else.Despite these flaws, I can wholeheartedly say that I honestly found this movie to be far more interesting than the actual Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure series, in that it actually gave a damn about having a compelling storyline, a stronger villain, and rectifying at least some of the series' issues, even if it didn't always succeed. Plus, I'm always down for seeing more of my favorite Heartcatch girls! was announced, I initially had zero interest in watching it because of how badly the series turned out...until it was revealed that it was going to be a crossover with Heartcatch Pretty Cure, aka my favorite Precure season ever. But having seen the Healin Good movie previously, I was convinced the Heartcatch girls would be reduced to little more than plot devices that appear in two scenes involving fighting alongside the TroPri girls and do nothing else until the plot deemed it convenient, since that's what the Healin Good movie did. So you can imagine that I wasn't exactly looking forward to watching Tropical Rouge Pretty Cure The Movie: The Snow Princess and the Miraculous Ring based on both the series' failings and what the Healin Good movie did with its crossover characters.I finally got around to watching the movie, and...holy shit, the Tropical Rouge movie actually seemed to go out of its way to not only address most of its parent series' flaws, but the flaws that the Healin Good movie had. How the hell did this movie manage to be better than its own parent series?! The plot isn't even all that groundbreaking if you think about it: The Tropical Club has been invited to a snowy kingdom called Shantia, specifically to attend Princess Sharon's coronation ceremony. Laura has even been invited to sing as part of the festivities, something she's very much looking forward to. While there, the girls tour Shantia and encounter the girls from Heartcatch Pretty Cure, getting acquainted with them before discovering secrets about Sharon and Shantia that put not only their lives, but other townspeople that were invited, in mortal danger. It's up to the Tropical Rouge and Heartcatch girls to put a stop to the evil force that threatens to keep them confined to Shantia for eternity.God, I am absolutely amazed at how much Toei seemed to learn from their mistakes both in regards to TroPri's flaws and the Healin Good movie's problems. As much as I liked the Healin Good movie, its biggest issue is that for all that the marketing empathized it being a crossover with Yes Precure 5, the actual Yes girls only appeared in two scenes, felt more like living Deus Ex Machinas to be brought in to save the day than actual characters, and they never interact with the Healin Good girls outside of battles, so they didn't feel like they were that important to the main plot. You could cut them out of that movie entirely and nothing would be lost. The TroPri movie addressed these problems tenfold, as not only do the TroPri girls interact with the Heartcatch girls both before and during the main plot, they remain integral throughout the entire movie and share just as much screentime as the TroPri girls, both outside of and during battle scenes. It helps that the Heartcatch girls' characterization remains true to their parent series, and for anybody who's worried that Erika was just going to be flanderized into the funny girl who makes cartoony faces, rest assured, that doesn't happen, and she even retains a lot of her maturity from the later parts of Heartcatch, though she does have her funny cartoony moments.Even the villain here is surprisingly a lot more compelling than the trio from the series. Yes, her motivation isn't anything new, and has probably been done lots of times and better in other stuff, but compared to how utterly lazy and bland the villain trio was in the series, her actions are actually legitimately threatening and actually manage to create palpable tension and urgency. Granted, the resolution to her plot at the very end came off as woefully cheesy and mealymouthed, and a lot of things about her backstory don't really make a whole lot of sense from a narrative standpoint, but for what its worth, she's still a better villain than Chongire, Numeri, and Elda could ever hope to be. Granted, I do find it kind of annoying that the movie decided to have Laura be the main focus of the movie and have her be the one to interact with Sharon the most, because God knows the producers just LOVE shilling Laura to high heaven, and I know many people didn't like this about the series. But I do feel that Laura did get some good material out of it, so I don't think it was all bad. The movie does have one flaw it shares with the series: It still doesn't do much with Sango, Minori, and Asuka, because heaven forbid we take the focus away from Manatsu and Laura even for five seconds, but it does make up for this by having Tsubomi and Erika receive just as much time in the limelight, even if it does result in Itsuki and Yuri not doing much.But for as much as the TroPri movie does right, it's not without its own issues. For one...for a movie, the animation is actually kind of cheap-looking. Other than a few key shots, the animation isn't much better than its parent series. It almost feels like the movie was given a TV series budget, and that should not be.

It has all the right ingredients: characters we know and love, a beautiful setting, and an interesting antagonist. However, the execution is somewhat lacking, as I'll explain.Firstly, the characters were fun to watch and the two Pretty Cure teams actually had some nice interactions - like seeing what they have in common. This is a huge step up from the Healin' Good movie, where the crossover cures only appeared when plot demanded it. Erika got the most focus respectively, but the senpai cures unfortunately didn't bond much. The main character is, perhaps...unsurprisingly, Lora - which kind of puts Manatsu to shame. I did like Lora in the movie, though. She starts off as spoiled and kind of annoying but she develops a connection with princess Sharon and gets good development by the end. Princess Sharon actually surprised me - I have certain expectations from movie exclusive characters but she was pretty close to greatness.Unfortunately, the plot was dragging at times, especially at the beginning. The transformations were also really stretched-out. I did like the look of the snow kingdom, I wish we had learned more about it, as I wasn't as attached to it and the princess as I should have been. Another slightly disappointing aspect was the action. We mostly got generic monsters, and while the fight with the HeartCatch cures was awesome, they didn't contribute much to the final showdown.Overall, it's a fun movie and not a bad crossover either. Despite its slow pacing, it has some great moments and surprisingly emotional scenes. However, I do feel that the concept could have been executed better. unsurprisingly, Lora - which kind of puts Manatsu to shame. I did like Lora in the movie, though.

Appearing in the low-middle side from Winter 2023 shows and being perceived as ""one of those generic isekai"" we get in each season, what some people may not know is how the concept\'s distinctive from most out there.From the beginning, we get to learn that Mitsuha Yamano, our main character, has the ability to transport between worlds at will and at any given time. And from this information she obtained, she plans on saving 80,000...gold (which is equivalent to 2 billion yen) for her retirement where she\'ll preserve 40,000 gold in each world in case Mitsuha loses the capacity to go back and forth. Now while i wouldn\'t call the story amazing or anything close, it certainly manages to keep me entertained in every episode. Seeing the different methods she comes up with and the various items of her world she brings to the other world to sell\'s a pleasant sight. With the mix of fantasy, slice of life, comedy, adventure and even action at times, it brings a nice amount of variety to the table.As for the characters, the only notable character in this entire series\' Mitsuha. Where the enjoyment largely depends whether or not you like her. In my case, i do a lot. Even though she appears to be a cute little child, she\'s actually shown to be an intelligent, calm and a rational person. She\'s also good at acting and can even be cunning at times. I appreciate how Mitsuha isn\'t some one dimensional character or how she isn\'t those kind of self-insert protagonists we see very often within this theme. On the contrary, the rest of the cast have nothing to write home about. Some people may call them to be unremarkable and bland and while i wouldn\'t necessarily disagree with that, it doesn\'t take out the overall entertainment we get from this anime. As long as you like Mitsiha\'s antics, you will most definitely enjoy it.I admit however, that the animation and music are pretty average, which can be considered barely passable. The former being plain and unexceptional which doesn\'t make it stand out from any other series, whereas the latter are pretty forgettable and underwhelming. There were no soundtracks that wants to make me jam at the music which is a bit unfortunate.Overall, while this anime\'s not necessarily outstanding, it certainly is far from being horrible. Its\' fresh concept is a nice change of pace we see from the numberous isekai anime in recent years.

Although I\'d say it could be more appropriately named ""Tax Evasion in Another World,"" it brings something we\'ve never seen before to the table.Ultimately, the concept feels fresh and quite funny. It follows a very simple writing flowchart of giving the main character a goal and damn right she\'s going to achieve it. After the rather underwhelming 1st episode, I genuinely had fun watching her endeavours in the 2nd and 3rd one. Too bad that it\'s bedridden with...plot holes or lack of knowledge on historic facts. Namely on the topic of crop cycles (ancient practice on Earth), presence of synthetic materials in the goods she sells, conflicting fashion styles with time periods and so on. Pacing is also painfully bad, quite unfortunate really.On the topic of characters: Your opinion on Mitsuha is going to make or break the show to you. If you find her fun to watch, you\'ll feel right at home. If you find her annoying or deplorable, you\'ll feel annoyed. A big issue arises when you consider the fact she\'s kind of difficult to cheer for due to how manipulative she gets. Besides her, there are no notable characters, mostly pretty basic side characters that just...exist.Conversations and dialogue generally feel clunky or inhuman. Arguably one of the bigger issues. Check how oddly dialogue is delivered in episode 2 (interaction with Wolf Fang) and 3 (Count dinner conversations). Mitsuha\'s inner monologue is also just...weird. Like, they\'re trying to use her dead brother as an infodump device, but it\'s also how she genuinely thinks inside her head? The show tries taking on a comedic tone and it\'s not the worst but absolutely nothing to write home about.On the topic of production, I\'d like to note that this is by no means anything close to a big budget anime. In fact, this is barely the studio\'s 5th anime and barely the 3rd one without co-production. Looking at it that way, the visuals are mostly fine, but often very lacking. Backgrounds especially often feel very wonky (take the wolf chasing scene in episode 1 for example) or that teleportation scene on her bed.Sound design is fine. No big names in the VA list from the main cast except for Kaori Maeda who also got to sing the OP and Fukuyama Jun. None of them do a bad job and I have to admit that the background music slaps pretty hard. Unfortunately, no insane stand-out performances.Conclusion: The show is depressingly average. It brings a fresh concept to the table executed poorly, plagued by terrible pacing and filled with unnecessary tropes. It can be a fun watch at times but nothing to write home about.

I tend to not like Isekais where the MC can go back and forth between worlds so that was part of it but it also felt kind of all over the place. There was no flow. It felt like the creators were like “ Ou this would be cool let’s throw that in there “ “ Actually let’s add this too it will be even cooler!” And throwing a bunch of  ingredients they thought were “cool”...in the pot without thinking about if it will actually blend well together. All That bad stuff being said I did keep watching, and I’m glad I did. If I did not , I would not have gotten to episode 4.Episode 4 , was way more enjoyable to me then any other episode so far. For the first time I was like “oh so this is what this show is going to be like” . There was actually a flow and a some good humor ! I really like misunderstanding or miscommunication humor so I’m glad there was some of that in there. But finally it did not seem all over the place and actually felt like it had purpose. So I’m hoping the future episodes will be as good as this one, IF IT IS, I think it will turn out to be a fun , decent, slice of life , isekai that’s worth pushing through the first 3 episodes 👍Animation: 7Sounds: 7Concept: 7First 3 episodes: 5Episode 4: 8Overall: 7 in the pot without thinking about if it will actually blend well together.

The story follows a young woman named Yamano Mitsuha, who is transported to a fantasy world through an accident that made her fall from a cliff. She soon discovers she has a way to go between this world and her original world. Hence starts her misadventures of collecting and saving as much gold as possible for her comfy retirement.The premise of this series explores Mitsuha\'s journey as she navigates through this new world and makes friends (business partners) along the way. While it...may seem straightforward, the simplicity provides a unique twist to the popular isekai genre. As this series is not really made to be taken seriously, it presents an interesting concept of financial management and planning in a slapstick comedy format. Which is not often explored in other shows. The story is filled with various comedic moments, such as when Mitsuha tries to pursue her desire to live up to her dear late brother\'s love of everything related to otaku culture while struggling with her own greed for saving gold for her retirement.Personally, I find the similarities with the GATE anime fascinating. Both shows feature a modern-day protagonist being transported to a fantasy world with access to modern technology and knowledge. In both cases, the protagonist uses their knowledge and skills that impact the world they find themselves in. The shows also explore the political and societal differences between the two worlds, highlighting the struggles of adapting to an unfamiliar and new environment. However, while GATE is more action-oriented and focuses on military and political conflict, ""Rougo ni Sonaete Isekai de 8-manmai no Kinka wo Tamemasu"" is more of a Mitsuha\'s slice-of-life story with a focus on economic and financial management. Despite these differences, fans of GATE may find similarities in the concept to be worth a watch.The show\'s strength is it balances serious themes with comedic and light-hearted moments. The series tackles the topic of negotiation and networking, which is an important life skill. At the same time, the show is not afraid to have fun and inject humor into the story. This balance makes the show enjoyable to watch while still providing valuable lessons.The animation is admirable as it fulfills the comedic timing needed for the visual gags, with bright and colorful visuals that capture the whimsical nature of this fantasy world. The voice acting is also impressive, with each actor bringing their characters to life with passion and emotion. Special mention, of course, goes to our protagonist, as she manages to exceptionally represent Mitsuha with her voice acting.While the show may not be for everyone, it has a promising start with a strong ending for this season. The story is engaging, and the characters are likable. The series does a significant satirical play on financial management.

It would be hard to flesh out any side characters with the obvious budget limitations this show has.The MC is luckily quite nice. A young woman who\'s quite intelligent, competent and decently confident. She has her damsel in distress moments and some ""pon"" here and there.

As for animation, there isn't much to talk about, there aren't many action scenes, but even the final fight with the dragon wasn't bad.And it depends a lot if you like the protagonist, after all, she carries the anime, Mitsuha is a different type of protagonist from Isekai, she can be very manipulative for things to go well for her but at the same time she is a very empathetic person, If someone needs help, Mitsuha will be there to help,...regardless of whether it will bring you profit. I also feel that the anime dynamic could be better if her brother were alive, them as a duo would be a really nice extra to see. regardless of whether it will bring you profit. I also feel that the anime dynamic could be better if her brother were alive, them as a duo would be a really nice extra to see."", ""TLDRThis show isn't without its flaws, and if you're not into Isekai this won't convert you. It is, however, fun with a (mostly) likable protagnoist, a slightly different spin and a silly plot that rarely takes itself too seriously.Further thoughtsMitsuha is the protagonist. She's a go-getter, likable but somewhat mercenary in her convictions. While there is a fun supporting cast don't expect any found family stuff, despite the premise.

This isn't a negative, but it is worth considering if you like the found family stuff.There's no real world building here and the final arc comes out of no-where.

I know this audience can be patient AF. Just look at Steins Gate ratings (which I don't get, but it's a different story)After a few early episodes, the story normalizes. Is it trash, Isekai? Sure, it is, but it does have a twist and humor. The awkwardness of differences in culture is entertaining. The protagonist, Mitsuha, sets a seemingly simple goal - gathering 80k gold coins to be enough to live a carefree life after the goal is achieved. But vast cultural and technological differences make everyone too suspicious, like her first blunder of trying to sell jewelry early on.I...don't know why people complain about animation - looks fine to me. The forest could've done better, but it was a minor issue.After 8 episodes, It's a strong 7 from me, though early episodes were only worth 4 or 5 out of 10. don't know why people complain about animation - looks fine to me.

The story was fun, surprisingly realistic (for an isekai or sorta-isekai), and it didn't follow all the tropes (yay!). There were a lot of things done in this story that I have not seen portrayed anywhere else in anime, and that originality made this so much more enjoyable. The art might be lacking some, but a solid story is present with plenty of comedy and thoughtfulness. The realistic choices and reactions by characters are such a relief in the OP-MC Isekai story and for that alone this makes the show worth a watch within the genre.Hopefully...this story gets more followup but even if it doesn't, this season ended on a good note.

It has decent character interactions like the princess + MC. But everything else is just pandering. The plot goes way out of its way to make sure MC always wins. MC's intelligence is also inconsistent.example:She can get a realtor + carpenter to make her a shop, but doesn't do the most basic research before selling items. She displays hot water shower heads, hair driers, lighters, stoves etc.. to the first customers in her shop. This should raise questions, but customers think of it as magic. this show never actually shows *ANY* magic at all being used...by other people, even royals/military.

MC graduated highschool and lives alone. has insurance money. gets powers and the ability to transfer (including things/other people) between isekai and our world. starts climbing up in influence using modern world equipment and services like private military.

If you don't like plot devices being handwaved away, you might not like this.RouKin is evidence that the Isekai horse hasn't quite been beaten to death yet.  The whole genre has been stumbling around, bouncing between increasingly off-the-wall premises for the past eternity (we're not that far off a decade now) as writers try to find something that both hasn't been tried yet and isn't mind-numbingly stupid.  Most of the time they fall at this second hurdle.  Which is...why it's honestly shocking to me that RouKin's premise wasn't picked up on earlier.  After all, the idea of setting up a shop in another world where you sell our world's items sounds pretty obvious once you say it out loud.  But coming up with a cool and unique premise is not enough on it's own to stand out in this saturated genre.Fortunately, RouKin is very solid overall.  It's a goofy comedy built around fish out of water humor, which you're probably expecting.  However, it's clear that more than just surface-level thought went into the humor here.  Mitsuha isn't just some teenager selling knick-knacks in another world, she's carefully selecting items based on usefulness, what her target market would actually want to buy.  And that's only a small slice of the amount of planning that went into this.  There are entire episodes dedicated to it!  These early episodes show off one of Mitsuha's most engaging traits, her ability to socially engineer her way into and out of situations to suit her own ends.  The character is excellent at persuasion, and this comes across as surprisingly believable in the dialogue.  The complications of these misadventures is another great source of comedy in the series.  Not only that, the episodes still retain a sense of tension arising from Mitsuha's imperfect knowledge of the other world, as she overlooks important facts, helping to round her out as a character and keep her believable with some flaws, setting up more good comedy scenarios along the way.There are flaws, of course.  Most notably, there's a lot of handwaving of plot details at the beginning.  The circumstances of how Mitsuha travels between worlds and how she got these powers to begin with are written off as a joke, which, while understandable (and pretty funny, at least to me), I can definitely see this bothering some people.  The show takes its worldbuilding and premise seriously, but the plot devices that make everything work get a lot less care, and will fall apart under scrutiny, as I have no doubt there are inconsistencies related to this somewhere.  If you're not out looking for them they'll probably pass you by as they did with me, but, again, this is an understandable and valid flaw with the show.This anime has been a welcome surprise for me overall.  I expect there to be more of a focus on Mitsuha's backstory in later episodes, as it's been intentionally left vague.  My hope is that this will be better handled than the other main plot elements.  Definitely excited to see where it goes regardless.

This series is unique since the heroine is able to jump at will between Earth and the other world. She realizes that the worlds are different enough that something that is sold for cheap in one world might be worth a fortune in the other - and she decides to monetize, with the goal of piling up enough money for an early retirement - but obviously things don\'t always work as expected.

In this scenario, the protagonist doesn\'t die and reincarnate between worlds but can freely travel wherever and whenever she pleases. I discovered this anime through TikTok, an introduction that turned out to be a misleading preview of the actual plot. It showcased a final scene of technological warfare versus medieval, but that wasn\'t the case at all in the story.From the first glance, the series is visually appealing. The surprise lies in how the narrative deviates from the initial perspective of military technology to...immerse itself in a world where interdimensional trade takes center stage.The story unfolds rapidly and effectively, taking us through the experiences of Mitsuha Yamano, a protagonist whose life takes an unexpected turn when transported to another world. The plot, though simple, manages to capture the viewer\'s attention, allowing me to devour all 12 episodes in two sittings, a testament to its ability to maintain interest.The main allure and, simultaneously, the drawback lie in the thematic versatility of the series. The plot spans from hunting to trade and event organization, enabling a rich exploration of activities. However, the downside emerges when the protagonist, Mitsuha, proves to be an expert in practically everything, diminishing the complexity and potential for genuine challenges.Character development, supported by competent voice performances, adds an extra layer of immersion, though Mitsuha\'s omnipotence may detract from narrative depth. The season, although self-contained, leaves room for contemplation regarding the necessity of a second part, though it doesn\'t feel indispensable.The final twist, where Mitsuha reveals her magic to Earth\'s inhabitants, presents itself as a peculiar moment, defying viewer expectations. This particular point, coupled with the choice of a protagonist who excels in everything, may generate mixed opinions.In summary, ""Rougo ni Sonaete Isekai de 8-manmai no Kinka wo Tamemasu"" offers an entertaining and visually attractive experience.

Este punto particular, junto con la elección de una protagonista que domina en todo, puede generar opiniones mixtas.En resumen, ""Rougo ni Sonaete Isekai de 8-manmai no Kinka wo Tamemasu"" ofrece una experiencia entretenida y visualmente atractiva. Sin embargo, la sobreabundancia de habilidades de la protagonista y la simplicidad de la trama podrían polarizar a los espectadores. Aunque se agradece la autosuficiencia de los episodios, la serie podría beneficiarse de una mayor complejidad narrativa o que la habilidad tenga algún costo/penalidad al ser usada. En mi evaluación, comparto la calificación de 7/10, reconociendo sus puntos fuertes, pero también cuestionando su falta de profundidad en algunos aspectos clave.', ""Okay then another typical isekai where the MC end up on fantasy world (except she survived death and was given powers and wasn't hit by truck)When I saw the anime I gave it a chance cuz I liked the art style so here's how it goesMitsuha is now a Mary Sue on that world and keep thinking about money that she manipulate those people for her own gain, also a fucking military as wellI mean yeah she's alone since her family died but stillThe only time where I felt sympathy for her was when the duke family reminded of her family and started to...cryThis is the last time I'll ever watch isekai cryThis is the last time I'll ever watch isekai"", 'Let me tell you a little about our heroine, Mitsuha.Her cheerful and polite demeanor belies both a vicious pragmatism and an iron will to protect herself and her friends. She\'s a pathological liar who routinely deceives everyone, including herself, with and without reason. She is able to hurt and kill people and animals without breaking a sweat, despite no indication that she ever did anything like that before being isekai\'d. She gets all of her business advice, and indeed life advice, from her dead brother who now exists as a figment of her imagination. And she loves money.Within the first few episodes, we see her...advocate for laissez-faire tax policy, try to sell a nobleman on ""building his brand,"" defraud that same nobleman to secure funding for her import business, happily auction her underwear for a quick buck, and negotiate the support of an American PMC who will launder the precious metals she earns in the isekai and supply her with guns.Will this slightly unhinged acolyte of modern capitalism be able to survive and thrive in a feudal world? It\'s a premise that promises intrigue, bold action, and outrageous consequences when worlds collide. Just look at the OP where Mitsuha poses with a gun while money rains down from the sky. If that sounds like fun to you, then you\'ll understand why I was excited after the first few episodes.The problem is... the show writes a check that it can\'t cash. Once our heroine starts her business in earnest, she doesn\'t do all that much with it. A large portion of the show is dedicated to fairly mundane and marginally profitable adventures that have little to do with the day-to-day running of Mitsuha\'s business, which ends up getting largely glossed over.At some point, I feel like the writing staff lost sight of what they were trying to do. Mitsuha\'s characterization is wildly inconsistent. Sometimes she\'s portrayed as a mastermind opportunist driven almost mad by ambition, other times she just acts frustratingly passive or clueless. There are way too many exchanges that go something like, to paraphrase:""Hey Mitsuha! Fresh fish, like the kind that you can cheaply import from Earth, is in high demand and people will pay huge money for it.""""Well it\'s too bad I run a general store and not a fish store, not much I can do about that.""""Hey Mitsuha, our society has scarce access to salt and all our food is bland because of it, want to become a filthy rich commodity trader?""""Nah, take care of it yourself by processing sea water or something.""""Hey Mitsuha, can I buy that swimsuit magazine from you?""""Ew, no, I don\'t want to do business with perverts.""(Remember, this is the same woman who previously auctioned her underwear.)When our heroine isn\'t busy selling small quantities of dollar store merchandise to the one or two people who wander into her shop each day, she helps people with various issues and slays monsters in spectacular fashion. And that\'s cool. But what does it have to do with the commerce that the show is ostensibly about? By the end of it all, there\'s no clear sense that Mitsuha\'s business has grown or really accomplished much of anything, and we never see much of its inner workings. As much as I loved the fresh concept that this show brings to the isekai genre, I was disappointed that it lets that concept simmer in the background, while bringing more generic subplots to the foreground, all too often.In summation: a great premise, some clever and entertainingly outrageous moments, a main character who is delightfully shrewd (except when she\'s not), and a whole lot of wasted potential.Recommended if you\'re the kind of person who enjoys seeing a cool idea executed roughly and imagining how you would have executed it better. advocate for laissez-faire tax policy, try to sell a nobleman on ""building his brand,"" defraud that same nobleman to secure funding for her import business, happily auction her underwear for a quick buck, and negotiate the support of an American PMC who will launder the precious metals she earns in the isekai and supply her with guns.Will this slightly unhinged acolyte of modern capitalism be able to survive and thrive in a feudal world?

The premise of the anime is interesting and fresh, as it combines the idea of transporting to a new world with the concept of accumulating wealth for retirement.The story initially starts off slow, and it takes a few episodes for the plot to pick up. However, once it does, it becomes an enjoyable ride. The character development is well-done, and it\'s fascinating to see how Mitsuha\'s character evolves throughout the series. Her determination and willpower are inspiring, and her...intelligence in utilizing her powers to accumulate wealth is commendable.One of the anime\'s strengths is its light-hearted and relaxing nature. Unlike other anime in the same genre, there is no real conflict or danger that could give the viewers anxiety. It\'s a perfect anime to watch when you want to unwind and take a break from more intense shows.That being said, the last three episodes of the anime did not meet my expectations. The storyline involving the war was uninteresting and unnecessary. It felt like it was added just for the sake of having a conflict, and it did not add anything meaningful to the plot.Overall, ""Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for My Retirement"" is a well-crafted anime that is perfect for those who want a laid-back story. The characters are lovable, the animation is beautiful, and the idea of accumulating wealth in a new world is unique. It\'s a great anime to watch when you want to relax and unwind. Although the last few episodes were not as good as the rest of the anime, the show is still worth watching, and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good adventure anime. intelligence in utilizing her powers to accumulate wealth is commendable.One of the anime\'s strengths is its light-hearted and relaxing nature.

I thought it was going to be an lighthearted feel-good anime based on the title but nothing made any sense!The story is incredibly inconsistent and warps to make sure the MC always come out on top.She sets up a shop but doesn\'t research price of goods. She brings in modern technology and uses a solar roof to power her personal secret-but-not-really-because-they-are-literally-sitting-out-in-the-open electronics.MC is also a huge narcissist. That time she wrote a letter to Collete and all it said was ""I\'m doing great!"". Like girl, people be asking how you doing but you also gotta give some though about...them!!That time when they crossed the river, but five minutes later there\'s a massive flash flood with no rain?!?!And hello?! Towards the end, she invites  Collete to her land to work for her in front of her parents. She\'s like 10! Child labor much?! She didn\'t invite mom and pops and were 100% OK with it!!

If you are looking for an isekai with an interesting story and a female mc, this anime will likely be up your alley.In most areas, this show is average. Average animation, average characters (though most characters other than the mc are static and serve only to highlight the mc), and average writing. The only negative aspect being the jarringly unbelievable parts of the story. In episode 5, the mc casually uses a projector, laptop, and sound system in front...of a large group of people… people who have never seen such marvels before… and they only question them for a moment before it is all pushed under the rug. If the writer cared to take 5 seconds to think about what might happen in this situation, they’d realize how absurd this is and adjust the script. Other than this and a few other small flaws, there aren’t any major problems with this show (none that would make it a bad show). of a large group of people… people who have never seen such marvels before… and they only question them for a moment before it is all pushed under the rug.

And I can say this is a good one compared to other female protag isekai genres out there. Long thread bear with me. Since most female protag isekai revolves around the love interests and the main adjusting in the isekai world. Which waters down the fun in an isekai genre. The main point of isekai is the challenges a female protag faces in a foreign world to which she solves the only way they knew how: modern world techniques, and knowledge! Now notice many of the isekai stories not just the female protag ones revolves around the...fantasy world exploration, skills and love interests. This is what many animes already have! Not to mention the fact that these female protags personality remains shallow, weak, and always get carried away by their love interests really tells me how the manga/anime industry view their women..Anyways without further ado. I\'ll list out all good things and bad things i see in the anime/manga:1. The main point of the story is to save enough for a retirement plan. In which case at all is an idea a woman would really do. Generally, women always aim for security when it comes to their future which is why many of their tastes in a man is a decent job.2. Many of her decisions are driven by her own desires. Many female protag anime/manga\'s decisions are driven out of some noble cause or their genuine care and affection for their friends and love interests. Not to say this is bad at all but these kinds of tropes and motivations for a decision can be repetitive. Not to say it\'s bad really, but that feature as a main characteristic of female protagonists tells me how the industry views their women... a subordinate. Which is a characteristic that\'s no so ""main character"" at all.The main character in this manga/anime, achieves her desires and goals without stepping over other characters\' desires in fact she shares some of the rewards she reaps to them.3.  She doesn\'t get easily carried away by other people. Many of her decisions are driven by her own desire. Now this many sound similar to number 2 but oh well hear me out. Unlike many other female protag isekai she isn\'t a push over who lets other people use her skills and abilities selflessly like other female protags in isekai. She doesn\'t let people abuse her kindness.4. No mercy to enemies. Unlike many other female isekai protags who forgive or even let her offenders off on a light punishment. She\'d have no hesitation killing her enemies if it means her life and the lives of those important to her is at stake. She\'d only let them live (not free as in taken as prisoner) if there\'s benefit to be made of.5. She doesn\'t easily give in to the charms of the opposite sex. She doesn\'t easily go fuwa~ or doki doki. But when the act counts, she\'d recognize him and acknowledge his efforts (refer to the part alexis sacrificed himself for her).6. No hate on yuri but theres very few decent hetero female protag isekai genre like this one. Many good female isekai is either asexual, or yuri. The rest of hetero female isekai is mostly the female protag being weak and dependednt on their love ineterests (which disgusts me recently tbh) She hasn\'t shown direct affection to a guy or girl but she mentioned she\'d prefer the 2nd son if its marriage. She prefers younger looking guys i guess.7. She\'s smart and has a unbending personality. Many female protags of isekai genre portray strong or deviant to the usual female sterotype as boyish and/or tsundere character. In this manga/anime MC can be unbending/deviant and feminine at the same time without being too rowdy. And being smart doesn\'t really mean she\'d just sit behind a desk and let the men/her subordinates do the job. Most of the time she does things on her own naturally to keep the secret of her abilities. Her greedy/money savvy tendencies makes her so human on top of that. Like I said driven by her own desires (money) and not by a softy heart.Now onto things I find lacking:1. Her own fighting skills. Who doesn\'t want a closer to realistic mindset of a woman that can hold her own fight?? Granted her territory management, and wit is formidable but what about magic? Shooting skills is nice too but even that I find lacking if that\'s all she can do.In short for now this is good than most female protags I\'ve seen. fantasy world exploration, skills and love interests.

If you are interested in entrepreneurship you might like it even more.Animation quality and art-style is biggest letdown: it definitely feels low-budget.Protagonist uses modern knowledge and skills to make her life and others easier and better.Rest of the characters are simple and forgettable.Probably this series ends midways and is forgotten, which is a shame: by reading manga I could say it has a lot of potential to become much better than it is now, especially story-wise.If you like...kind of Civilization-type isekai, like ""I got reincarnated as a slime"" then this is definitely for you. kind of Civilization-type isekai, like ""I got reincarnated as a slime"" then this is definitely for you.', 'Isekai/fantasy MCs: I\'ll be reincarnated from being dead in real life...to be OP, get myself a harem, and the world is my oyster!Mitsuha Yamano: I\'ll be reincarnated from being dead in real life...to travel between both worlds and be rich in the fantasy world by selling items from the modern day, all in an effort to earn 80k Gold for My Retirement!Do you remember a little show called ""Watashi, Nouryoku wa Heikinchi de tte Itta yo ne! a.k.a Didn\'t I Say to Make My Abilities Average in the Next Life?!""? It was a show about the 18-year-old girl Misato Kurihara, who reincarnated into another world...as the 10-year-old noble\'s daughter Adele von ""Mile"" Ascham after meeting God and requesting to have average abilities in her second life, though that didn\'t always go according to plan. This LN got an anime adaptation courtesy of Project No. 9 all the way back in Fall 2019 to average fanfare, as it should. Well, over 4 years later, the same LN author FUNA is back to give us yet another Isekai series, the 2nd of the author\'s 3 adapted anime works (and supposedly the best out of the bunch): Rougo ni Sonaete Isekai de 8-manmai no Kinka wo Tamemasu a.k.a Saving 80,000 Gold in Another World for my Retirement. And to say that this was just as average as the show before it, it\'s kinda true and not.The beginning\'s overly used tropes of getting killed 1001 ways in real life, it\'s starting to get just as tired, but it\'s the Isekai concept that will ultimately make or break the series. This rings true for the series\'s protagonist: Mitsuha Yamano, the young high school graduate who lost her immediate family members in an accident, with karma striking her next by being pushed off a cliff from self-defense against some bullies. But not all hope is lost, for the interdimensional entity of the world, the Maneki-neko (lucky cat statue) comes to seek her at her time of loss, granting her the ability to travel between worlds and vast regenerative abilities for a second chance at life.NGL, the idea of going to another world to make money for your retirement is an entertaining story. But the problem is that it\'s so boring when it\'s all about the same thing as hundreds of other Isekai novels...as such for Rougo 8-manmai\'s case of ""implementing modern technology in a medieval fantasy world"". To be able to teleport between worlds is a unique novelty that we\'ve haven\'t seen in the Isekai/fantasy anime space, but the idea of using modern items in a medieval world, say, using knives and guns for defense, shampoos and soaps for extra fragrance, and TV dramas for the fantasy audience that\'s something that cannot be experienced in any way...the thing is, no one cares about all this high tech stuff. But when it comes to the topic of food, it suddenly goes into high gear as everyone unequivocally loses their minds, and suddenly thinks that the sole produce is the indefinite gold standard, where in the real world, it\'s just normal produce that doesn\'t cost more than a gold coin. It\'s like combining Ascendance of a Bookworm on the business side and Gate on the military defense side, and who knows what else Mitsuha has on her pile of tricks, all in an effort to acquire 80k gold coins (roughly the equivalent of 2 million Yen).At first, I would like to give an appaluse to Mitsuha for being money-conscious and being resourceful, only to almost forget that most of that knowledge rings through her deceased Otaku-dom of the older brother Takeshi, whom she always look up to for sound advice. It\'s certain to say that siblings will help each other, and absolutely in Mitsuha\'s case, earning her own retirement funds can be an exercise in frustration if things don\'t go her way, and that\'s on top of the medieval setting\'s own issues, like kingdom invasion. Sure, she has the backing of people like Coleen, the somewhat over-doting first friend she made who crushes her with her strong hugs, and Princess Sabine, who is VERY intrigued by all of the technological marvel that Mitsuha transported from Earth after visiting her merchant store, but it paints a picture where soon enough, everyone is going to be dependent on Mitsuha being an obvious monopoly to drive the fantasy world\'s market out of touch and have her speedrun all the way to achieving her goal.As expected, the production is kinda nice and neat, but still decent at best. Produced at Felix Film with debut director Hiroshi Tamada at the helm, this show is not the most complex to have it consistently running for its 12-episode run, and for what it has shown us throughout the 3 months, it\'s just fine and nothing special. Same likewise with the OST, it\'s just there to do its thing, and is also largely forgettable outside of the main show, though I\'ll give a small complement to YABI×YABI for their debut ED song, which is kinda catchy, since it\'s all about the economy at large.Just like Noukin, FUNA\'s Rougo 8-manmai...truly is nothing special in the slew of hundreds of Isekai novels and anime that the AniManga industry is seriously oversaturated with these days, but props for trying to stand out and be different somehow in the stem of so many Isekai/fantasy shows of the Winter 2023 season. If I were to gauge this, it would just sit comfortably in the middle of the pack, that\'s both memorable and not at the same time.Only try this show if you want to experience something different from an Isekai, but I wouldn\'t want to invest even a single gold coin in this show ever again. as the 10-year-old noble\'s daughter Adele von ""Mile"" Ascham after meeting God and requesting to have average abilities in her second life, though that didn\'t always go according to plan.

If I were to gauge this, it would just sit comfortably in the middle of the pack, that\'s both memorable and not at the same time.Only try this show if you want to experience something different from an Isekai, but I wouldn\'t want to invest even a single gold coin in this show ever again.', ""this show is so underwhelmingly boring. there is zero to little development in every episode even playing this in the background felt dull, it was like a goddamn ppt show. although the show's concept is quite the refresher compared to the rest of its kind (isekai), that's the only thing it offers, nothing else.mitsuha aka the female lead aka the only lead aka the only person they want you to focus on, does not provide basic entertainment. she tries to conduct antics, but the execution is so overused it just makes you go: oh, okay. but if you do enjoy a witty, ambitious/imaginative lady (or...tries to be) just trying to do her own stuff, you could settle.side characters were made like they're only here to make mitsuha glow and shine. people have random emotion breakouts and it's hard for others to empathize with the story because of how she came to be in this godforsaken world in the first place.rating:ok voice-acting, recycled trash op & ed, animation was fine, 0 side characters to like or pay attention to, mitsuha eh, bad-paced storylinetldr; don't watch unless u wanna sleep (good f-ing night) or enjoy shows providing no emotional value tries to be) just trying to do her own stuff, you could settle.side characters were made like they're only here to make mitsuha glow and shine. people have random emotion breakouts and it's hard for others to empathize with the story because of how she came to be in this godforsaken world in the first place.rating:ok voice-acting, recycled trash op & ed, animation was fine, 0 side characters to like or pay attention to, mitsuha eh, bad-paced storylinetldr; don't watch unless u wanna sleep (good f-ing night) or enjoy shows providing no emotional value"", ""This one is a doozy for me, I like the concept, the execution? Could have been better.It's bad enough we have this unending pile of Isekai, diluting the genre, it's worse anyone with an isekai fantasy can come up with an interesting concept and completely waste it, the anime is too caught up in the details, there isn't a bigger story, just characters that act in favor of their heroin when she needs them to, they are impressed by salt on food, the bar is really low, and soon enough she becomes this great at everything, so there isn't even a chance she'd be caught...off guard unprepared, nope, who wants unpredictable plots? Right?all in all, this is someone's fantasy, so they wrote it, and it's out there, not compelling writing, forgettable as soon as the episode are over, it doesn't stick to any genre well enough to be a good story, it's not funny, it's not thrilling, it's not emotional, it's aimless, and I guess despite my resistance to aimless writing, it'll exist. off guard unprepared, nope, who wants unpredictable plots?

Being able to come and go between this world and a fantasy world + having a character predominantly motivated by money + the mc’s super power is a glock = a formula for a good time; sadly the execution here wasn’t great, with some episodes having borderline awful animation. The story had enough bad plot/story developments that it sadly outweighed whatever positive base the premise had going for it. And the worst offender is this series REPEATS. REPEATS EVERYTHING. The MC...makes friends with not ONE, but THREE different little girls. The villains in this are almost ALWAYS some random, annoying, greedy old man (literally every single villain except for the monsters is an ugly b@$tard).

Animation in terms of fluidity was pretty average and unimpressive, but also occasionally a little hacky. In terms of the frame to frame... awful. Backgrounds are ugly 90% of the time, characters are drawn average a best. The characters are shallow, not really all that likeable, but occasionally they can be entertaining. Pacing is mostly average, the beginning is painfully slow though. The voice acting is strictly average, not by any means impressive, but not the worst either. Soundtrack is average if listened to by itself, but on top of that it\'s poorly scored. I hated the first half, and...could tolerate the second half.

MC even though she can go wherever with her powers, meet whoever and do whatever she just wants to mine for money.2. She is lying to everybody, manipulating their feelings just to get what...she wants, like true sociopath. Scene at the dinner table with duke is just disgusting.3.

I admit it is lousy for the director to claim that girls in panties = fashion in the Strike Witches\' world, but that alone is no reason to give a bad rating to an anime (if you do, I am sorry, you don\'t know how to rate at all). Strike Witches is MUCH deeper than one may expect to find from a fanservice-oriented series.--Updated on February 12, 2009--The Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs has recently openly endorsed Strike Witches as an example of cultural excellence.The...world of Strike Witches is pretty much parallel to our world up to 1939 (before World War II). At that time, mysterious beings known as Neuroi invaded Europe. Thus rather than the real WWII, this resulted in a war between Human VS Neuroi. The story revolves around a group of girls with special magical powers that allow them to equip the ""Striker Units"" to combat the Neuroi. The story proceeds nicely with these magical girls fighting Neuroi, but sadly the ending seem to be a bit ""wishy-washy"".The art and animation quality is great for the most part. The battle scenes, in particular, are extremely well made. In short, we see a nice blending effects from the battle animation with the regular drama scenes. All episodes seem to have highly consistent animation and of course, the DVD includes polished artwork and fanservice.The OP and ED are both good although not particularly outstanding and there\'s a good chance you\'ll forget about them after a few days. However, the melody of the songs suit the theme of the anime quite nicely. In addition, the battle themes and the Japanese version of Lili Marlene (a famous German love song that was popular during World War II) all contributed nicely to the series and are valuable assets to the show.The production group did a nice job at introducing the main/supporting characters and then slowly further develop them. Actually, the character introductions might explain why the story started out slowly (after all there are 11 girls to talk about). If there is one thing I find the characters disappointing it is that some of the witches\' specialty were not revealed until the end (most were never mentioned).Though I didn\'t like to see girls showing off their panties the way they are done in this anime, but putting that aside, the show itself (from story to art to sound to character) is very well planned out and the fact that they include references to the real WWII is just that much more interesting to watch.

In the end it was a bit disappointing though because early on I thought it had the potential to be something very special.As others have said, Strike Witches is automatically going to appeal to a certain group of people, and you probably already know who you are.  Basically SW is the battle of Britain with Loli witches riding mechanical brooms fighting mysterious aliens and carrying huge guns... without pants.  Yes I don't understand...the last part either.  If you love cute girls in their panties and LOTS of highly detailed shots of those girls in said panties, this is definitely your show!  Also judging from the amount of bath scenes there is surely to be a lot of boobs for those who watch the DVD release.Not that any of the above really offends me, because it doesn’t.  But I hate to see the story suffer because of excessive fan service, and in Strike Witches case it does.  In a 12 episode series there is very little time to develop the characters and storyline, and SW wastes at least 2 full episodes catering to fan service.  One episode is devoted entirely to the girls walking around without their panties on and stealing each others.The story which started with a lot of promise really loses steam as it winds down.  So much is left unexplained and the motives of the Neuroi are never explained.  A very significant plot hole remains unexplained in the final story arc and it just felt like a downer when you don’t get a very satisfying conclusion.You might think because of the above comments that I hated this show, but I really didn't.  The show does do a number of things right.  First the animation is really good.  The girls are really cute and I fell in love with all of them.  The show does manage to develop all their personalities pretty well.  There is a lot of action too, the air battles with the Neuroi are pretty fun.  The OP and EN songs are pretty good but aren’t really anything special.In the end the show was fun to watch but I am left feeling a bit let down.  It just didn't live up to the potential it had early on.  Some people are going to like this show a lot though.

Moe cliches and fetishism abound, you already know the audience with one glance, and if you're in that audience it's not half-bad.Strike Witches is about young girls fighting faceless enemies in an alternate WWII era. Inexplicably, they sprout animal ears and tails when they use magic and pants don't seem to exist anymore. As you can probably guess, this isn't a show heavy in plot. What makes it relatively enjoyable is that the plot (and use that word...very loosely) is often negated in favor of servicey hijinks and yuri subtext.

Best of all, there's no CG glut commonly associated with anime of this studio.The soundtrack is just a hair's breadth above mediocre, and the OP and ED are patchwork themes in music and lyrics.

And what could be more candid than a five second close up of a  girl’s camel toe?Admittedly it’s not exactly the most cultured form of entertainment around, and...certainly not one you’ll ever find yourself recommending to your parents, co-workers, prospective sexual partners or any Federal Agents that happen to be paying you a visit. However, for those of you who only need to worry about the last item on that list, Strike Witches is the perfect anime for you!But you don’t need your picture on the side of a Milk Carton in order to enjoy Strike Witches; if you just want to watch one of the most creative, action packed and entertaining anime series out there, then all you need to do is swallow your pride and take your first flight with the guys and girls of the 501st Joint Fighter Squadron.Just kidding- there aren’t any guys in Strike Witches. Honestly, who on earth would want to see men flying around in their underwear? No, that would just be silly. Yup, they’re all girls. All eleven of them. With each one representing every country in the world that matters- Japan, Britain, The United States of America, Germany, France, Japan, The Soviet Union, Finland, Italy, Germany and Germany. If you’re feeling a little disappointed with that list, you needn’t worry too much—there are more German characters introduced later on in the show.Of course, with a main character to episode ratio of almost 1:1, you might expect a few issues with character development. And you’d be right- almost half of the cast spend three quarters of the series effectively as background scenery- though the problem is alleviated to a certain degree by the fact that the whole cast has only a quarter of a personality between them.It sounds terrible, and it probably is- a cast made up entirely of stereotypes is certainly not an artistic statement- but at the same time it’s what allows Strike Witches to work. We don’t need to know about each character, because we already know everything there is to know about them- because we’ve seen them a thousand times before. It sounds a bit illogical, but what’s the use of applying logic to a show about a group of girls flying through the air with aeroplane propellers strapped to their ankles?And it’s not as if they’re unlikable characters. Quite the opposite, in fact- among the cast of eleven, you’ll end up liking at least eight of them. If nothing else, they certainly are an entertaining bunch to watch.Now we’ve covered all the key points, let’s delve a little deeper and look at the less important elements of the story, like the story itself: Post World War 2, Alien invasion, Aircraft powered by magic. Got that? Good.There is an overarching storyline here, but if you hadn’t already realised, Strike Witches isn’t exactly a work of literary genius. What does matter though are the individual episode stories, which are excellent- great fun to watch and reasonably original, which believe me is saying a lot for an ecchi anime. There’s a good mix of action packed battles, low brow humour and some melodrama that makes for some lowest common denominator entertainment of the highest calibre.On the subject of melodrama, one unintentionally amusing aspect of the show is the use of overly dramatic orchestral music during the battle sequences. When juxtaposed to the high pitched, middle of the road J-pop of the opening sequence, it’s hard not to let out a snobbish little chuckle. Talk about delusions of grandeur...Of course, when it comes to presentation, there are no delusions... just sweet, sweet grandeur. Whatever you may think of Gonzo Entertainment, of CGI visuals or of the moe aesthetic, there’s no getting around the fact that Strike Witches is quality animation at its finest. Particularly the battle sequences, which were fast paced, well choreographed and smooth.The integration of CGI with traditional animation (by which I mean digital animation) has long been a burning issue for anime fans, without any clear resolution -should those responsible for it be burned at the stake, or would tarring-and-feathering them be justifiable- where you stand on the issue is entirely up to you; but even the most unreasonable of lynch mobs should be willing to consider letting Strike Witches off the hook, because it has actually made it work. That’s right; no obvious shade-free surfaces or objects that look out of place- everything is well done and kept in the backdrop, where it should be when it can’t be where it really ought to be (off screen).This review has attempted to justify the unjustifiable. It has struggled desperately to sing the praises of a show that is little more than a cacophony of the worst vices in anime.  Cynics will say that Strike Witches is a show that was made with only one goal; to sell to as many depressing single men as possible, and the fact that it’s hugely entertaining is a mere co-incidence -and maybe they’re right.

If that’s all it takes to make you happy, then great, because Strike Witches offers very little else.This is a fanservice anime, so if you\'re expecting anything deeper than a puddle in terms of plot or people, you might as well give up now. However, that\'s not an excuse for a truly awful anime.The premise is about as dumb as it sounds. We have eleven girls with magic powers and airplane propellers strapped to their legs, who are apparently the military’s only hope of defeating a...bunch of outer space aliens.Sounds like fun, huh?The bad part is, the story doesn\'t really go anywhere from there. More than half of the episodes have absolutely nothing to do with the plot. Most of the show is just a bunch of girls running around doing goofy things, taking baths, and beating up the obligatory bad guy. The ending tries to scrape together a plot at the last minute, but it’s so full of plot holes and unresolved stories it ends up being a mess, too. If you were waiting for a conclusion to the loose ends strewn all over the place, you’re out of luck. At the end of the series, all I could say was, “zuh?”The characters are pretty paper-thin. Only about four of the eleven characters get regular screen-time, the rest of the gang is pretty much scenery. In lieu of character development we’re supposed to be satisfied watching cute girls do cute things. (But really, who doesn\'t love watching cute girls do cute things, right?) By the end of the series, the only things you’ll remember about the characters are their hair color and sexual orientation.The villains (if you can even call them that) of the story are a band of aliens called the Neuroi, and they’re among some of the most laughable bad guys in all of anime history. First of all, nobody knows a blessed thing about them, not even the military or the Strike Witches themselves. We never figure out who they are, what they are, where they come from, or what they’re doing. The design for these extraterrestrials is baffling. Most of them look like they were lifted from some bad Cinema 4D tutorial. In one episode, we have the girls fighting an alien shaped like a giant Rubik’s cube. On top of that, the enemy isn\'t even remotely threatening. Apparently they’re so little of a threat that the Strike Witches don’t even bother to go after them, they just laze around at home base until one flies overhead.The fanservice isn\'t anything you haven’t seen before. If, for some reason, you haven’t seen enough of girls scrabbling at each other’s breasts, it might amuse you. But, while I like naked lolis as much as the next guy, the fanservice is stuck in place of a coherent story. There’s literally an entire episode about panties. After a while it just feels like a waste of time.Strike Witches is an absolutely terrible anime, and I can only hope that I have saved you from the pain of watching it. In the end, the only reason you should ever watch this is if you need an anime that will make you sit back and think, ""What the hell am I doing with my life?"" bunch of outer space aliens.Sounds like fun, huh?The bad part is, the story doesn\'t really go anywhere from there.

Apparently they’re so little of a threat that the Strike Witches don’t even bother to go after them, they just laze around at home base until one flies overhead.The fanservice isn\'t anything you haven’t seen before. If, for some reason, you haven’t seen enough of girls scrabbling at each other’s breasts, it might amuse you. But, while I like naked lolis as much as the next guy, the fanservice is stuck in place of a coherent story. There’s literally an entire episode about panties. After a while it just feels like a waste of time.Strike Witches is an absolutely terrible anime, and I can only hope that I have saved you from the pain of watching it. In the end, the only reason you should ever watch this is if you need an anime that will make you sit back and think, ""What the hell am I doing with my life?""', ""Strike Witches is a fresh, entertaining anime that has been unfairly criticized by a handful of spoilsports who claim moral superiority over the rest of the internets, all the while ignoring the excellence and vibrancy of this fine series.It's a story that has been done before, of course: mysterious aliens invade earth. They attack our cities and villages one by one, and conventional military weaponry is useless against them. Luckily, an elite band of young people have been found and given experimental weaponry that can be used against the xenos. This kind of story usually creates all kinds of angst and bawwwing, but Strike Witches...avoids this cliche since it's set in the last good war. In fact the series is full of vitality and optimism, and the heroines are a squadron of cute flying catgirls that you will surely grow to love.The art style reflects the good nature and spirits of the series with a vivid palette of colors that will delight your eyes and mind. In fact, the production values in general are excellent, from the cheerful, quirky character designs to the gorgeously animated aerial battles between the witches and their alien foes. There are a few scenes of war-ravaged Europe to show the stakes of the battle, but the series in general is bright and clean. There are a few darker twists towards the end of the story, but it finishes with a positive note, even though many parts of the story are left to be wrapped up in the second season.It seems, however, that a few people known to the world as moralfags have taken offense to the fact that females in this alternate version of earth have foregone the useless and unpleasant shackles of wearing pants. Why these people would bitch about such a thing is anyone's guess, but this bit of trivia doesn't hurt the entertainment value of Strike Witches in the least, and in fact only adds to its quirky charm. avoids this cliche since it's set in the last good war.

Best anime of the year so far."", ""You've probably heard a little about Strike Witches already, I'm willing to gander.You've probably already heard something about it being a fanservice anime if anything. And have already formulated your opinion about it from that.The likelyhood of that opinion being that it's just a fanservice anime and is therefore not good. And while there are quite a few fanservice anime that would make you to think that way, being since there are a lot of poorly done fanservice anime, that is not the case here. Oh, but it is not the case at all. Strike Witches is in fact a fanservice anime. But it is...an exceptionally well done fanservice anime. In fact, it is a perfectly done fanservice anime. And a recommendation to anyone who wants to see a fanservice anime done right.And since it's given me criteria, I think it's time for me to move on from my preface and work on into the various ratings and why I rate them so.1. Story.I really wanted to rate this a ten, but...I don't know how to say this without spoiling it, it builds a decent amount of story and plot and could very well be worked on. But instead of delve into this properly, they focus almost purely on character development. Which is good, considering what it is, that's a good thing. But still, it only leaves for only development like it's an unfinished anime.It's really hard to rate this, because you have to take into account heavy character development is necessary, and that it is a fanservice anime. And that it does at to a whole which I rate a ten. Because even at it's enjoyable pace and good character development and adding to a perfect whole, I can still only rate this an 8.2. ArtArt is one of the main things that makes this anime what it is. It is truly superb and a magnificent thing to watch. I don't think an anime, much less a fanservice anime could get much better than this in terms of art. It's animated well, and the character design is flawless. It doesn't make any big deviations from the traditional Japanese animation art style, in fact it only forwards the standard style, but it forwards the style so well and perfectly it's really taking it to what we expect it to be doing, remaining, but only developing and improving that style and raising the bar for it.So in perhaps more simple words, you have the moe anthropomorphic art style fully realized and rendered. Beautifully used as ever. There's no question that the artwork is what makes this anime. It's not the only thing that's good about this anime of course, but it's something that helps it stand out and be the good anime that it is.3. SoundThis anime has superb sound. The character voicing is fantastic, the sound effects are good. And after watching the show, and going back and listening to the soundtrack, realizing, what an amazing job they did on the soundtrack so much that it stands on it's own. It may not be epic, but it does what it asks to be, it's charming. And it fits the mood perfectly. And it's a great piece of musical creation that can easily be enjoyed for hours at a time without any other thing involved.4. CharacterWell, considering I already mentioned character development is the biggest part of this story, it's needless to say it has good character development. I don't think you can say anything bad about the character development, it IS one of the main focuses of the show, and it does it well. They want you to get to know the characters, and the character and made to want to be get to known. They also spend a very decent amount of time on most all the characters. Doing a very good job not to neglect a single one. It's one of the very best parts of this show that keeps you coming back for each episode.5. EnjoymentWell I think that's what gives this a ten. Even if it's a fanservice anime, it never stops being fun for one second. It doesn't overload you with ecchi or fanservice, and when it is that way, it provides in a very amusing fashion that most fanservice anime completely and utterly lack. If I could set a standard for what even an ecchi anime should be, Strike Witches would be on the list. And way up on that list. It's easy to even forget it's an ecchi or fanservice anime, because it's just so much pure fun.Forget the words and associations that come to mind when you hear the words fanservice and ecchi. Because those things are not what makes this anime. What makes this anime is that it is just a ride of pure fun. Or might I say, a ride through the clear blue skies with a bunch of fun girls.6. OverallWell, as an anime being pure fun, this results in the same thing for me as Lucky Star. I think something is pure fun overall and a ten in the scale of enjoyment, it's a ten in the scale of overall. Because isn't that what makes an anime? I say this anime is %100 Outstanding. You just really can't be this sort of anime in the area of overall charm. I think it should become a model for what it is, and become it's own sort of mini-genre. I can already feel the influence of Sky Girls and Strike Witches.Without Sky Girls, we wouldn't have Strike Witches. And with the success of these, at least Strike Witches, I can see this helping to spread and eventually create a flood of panty clad women with guns and superpowers, it seems to be it's own genre already. And if it is, I can certainly say this is the Godfather of what's to come. It's really a masterful work, and I can really only, like many others, hope for being graced by a sequel or at least another anime along this lines.10/10.

Because of the amazing character development.You can consistently track the progress of the main character Yoshika Myafuji throughout both of the seasons and the movie, there are no jumps in the story, it feels very satisfying seeing your beloved character grow.

It may not be for everyone, but this is my thoughts and not to just speak to everyone.Story 6/10 - When You hear the story for this anime, you may think it’s going to be terrible. I’ve seen worse stories, but this isn’t one I’d brag about. There’s been a ton of historical fiction animes that have much better stories.Art 9/10 - I love the animation of this series. It’s exaggerated, comedic moments are very detailed and there’s many scenes where the animation looks beautiful. Only reason I don’t put this as a 10...is because there is some cgi animation when they could’ve just hand drawn it (but hey I don’t know what difficulties the studio was dealing with). Plus, I hate that in the subbed version, they censor more fanservice than the dubbed version.Sound 9/10 - The dubbed voice acting makes this anime for me. It’s some of the most memorable for me. Plus, the soundtrack has some great tunes. The opening and ending are catchy and the other music ranges from pretty good to uplifting or even calming.Characters 9/10 - There isn’t a main character in this series I don’t like. Then, why is it a 9? The side characters aren’t too special. Not to mention the main characters I have to admit can be considered tropes. You have the energetic loli, the main character with a dream to help people, the shy one with big boobs, and the easily flustered/irritated one. Yeah, it’s an all female cast. Take it for what it’s worth, but I love seeing them all interact off each other.Enjoyment 10/10 - I admit this is more a guilty pleasure, but there are some legit good moments in it. Although I’m really more into the dubbed version. The voices just felt more natural. Admittedly, there’s moments that even I admit are dumb that I can’t defend, but I can tolerate it.Overall 10/10 - If you can tolerate the fanservice there’s a lot to be said about this anime. I love the characters and I’m always with them and the animation is great to look at (for the most part). I’ve seen it about a million times and chances are I’ll see it a million times in the future. is because there is some cgi animation when they could’ve just hand drawn it (but hey I don’t know what difficulties the studio was dealing with).

This was amazing, absolutely fantastic, a whole ton of FUUUUN.Ecchi, a good plot, an amazing twist, a brilliant cast of characters, beautiful girls (seriously pretty), ecchi!! Strike Witches is an absolute fantastic anime.Strike Witches follows Miyafuji Yoshika, a girl who has incredible magical power capabilities and is thrown into a world she didn\'t expect to get involved in, because her wanting to protect people overcomes all her fears. The story in Strike Witches is really very good; for 80% of the anime, it\'s sort of slice of life based, revolving around magical girls who use Striker Units as...a modern replacement for ""brooms"", hence the witches in Striker Witches. Yoshika is at the center of just about everything and in every episode, helps a girl discover something about herself or simply helps out a girl and friendships are built.In Strike Witches, we have a large cast of what are essentially young girls (♥ Lolis). Yoshika, the lead, Sakamoto, a strong and brave girl who helps Yoshika train and become a Strike Witch, Lynette, a really pretty girl who ends up being Yoshika\'s best friend, and in my books, a one true pair. Perrine, a stubborn and massively jealous girl; jealous because Sakamoto is focused on training Yoshika. There are other girls too, Minna the leader of Strike Witches, Sanya, a total cutie with white hair and an extra cute voice with an awesome magic power. There is also Hartmann, Shirley, a girl with large breasts and a killer body; she\'s also a speed freak, Lucchini, the smallest of all the girls and loves to fondle breasts whenever she gets the chance and Eila, a really smart girl who is always seen with Sanya, because of an adorable crush.All the girls are pretty amazing, they\'re all cute, and the ecchi is most definitely something to be warned about. Panty shots or hot pants or whatever.... it\'s most definitely in every episode and tends to be a focus too. Heck, sometimes the artists draw out a lot of detail in the pantsu shots that... well let\'s just say that it can be very exposing as to what is being shown. Most of the pantsu\'s on the girls aren\'t on properly either, falling half way down their waists and things of that nature, or being very small. Breasts are shown all the time when there are bathing scenes and things. It should be noted, none of the girls wear skirts or anything of the sort, it\'s all very much pantsu and hot pants. The point is, Strike Witches can be very ecchi at times, but don\'t let it put you off from the story. (Though if you like ecchi, just go ahead and watch Strike Witches, you won\'t be disappointed)Speaking of which, once 8 episodes have passed and Yoshika has made a good impression on all the girls, the story really opens up. The Neuroi, the main enemy of the show sees a huge twist that honestly, I should have seen coming a mile away, but was caught up in other things. It\'s because of this that I feel like the build up, the more slice of life direction for most of the show works so well. There are so many girls and all of them have a story, not all are told, but the important girls get an episode and then some, it helps build a believable world and it\'s easy to follow the logic involved when these girls make decisions, you really feel like you understand them. I think the Neuroi are fantastic, because of what happens. I wish this was a 2-cour series instead of 1, but thankfully there is more content available.Art style in Strike Witches is freaking fantastic. Beautiful colors that symbolizes that even though this world is in a war, it\'s no where near as bad as one would think. The colors are bright, they\'re vivid, they would make you happy just watching! The detail of the girls is well done, *cough* especially the ecchi shots *cough*. The animation is fantastic, having a very smooth and well maintained animation throughout all 12 episodes. The last episode is a huge job well done to the animators, the fight scene was incredible and it just flowed so well.Music and Sound is.... I actually think I have no idea what makes something bad in this regard. I enjoyed the OP and ED a lot. I felt like the sounds were really good, the background music meld well with the corresponding emotions and scenes. Maybe I should review this section on how memorable it is, because I don\'t believe it\'s possible for most anime studios to get this part wrong.

Anyone who's read &quot;The Blond Knight of Germany-The...Story of Erich Hartmann&quot; will know how well that was translated into Erica and Gertrud.  Saburo Sakai was very well translated into Mio Sakamoto, and Chuck Yeager's spirit of adventure seemed to be very well present in Charlotte.  The aristocratic side of Pierre Clostermann was also pretty well translated into Perrine as well.Negatives:Weak plot-Yes, I understand the whole saving humanity thing, but it took about eight episodes in a twelve episode series for the plot to really pick up and things to get really juicy. And then it just ended. Lame...Animal parts-Okay, I know lots of people like this, but I don't.  It just looks rather disturbing and not very cute to me at all. While watching Strike Witches I was able to mostly overlook it, it still got on my nerves at times.Not enough done with certain characters-The biggest thing that got to me, Erica didn't play a bigger role. Come on, she was based off of the ACE OF ACES Erich Hartmann himself, the greatest fighter pilot of all time. Why didn't she get more spotlight time in air combat? Who knows, but I don't think it does the guy a lot of justice.Better archetypes could have been made-I don't understand why Minna wasn't based off of Adolf Galland and instead was based off of Wolf Dietrich Wilcke. Sure he was a high scoring during WW2 (175 kills), but if you know anything about WW2 air combat, no one ever talks about him. Lynette should have been Johnnie Johnston (highest scoring British ace of all time, 35 kills against the Luffwaffe) and not Billy Bishop, who was Canadian and not British.  While not that bad, it would have been cooler to see Sanya be based off of Alexandr Porshynkin rather then Lidiya Litvak simply because of the gender thing, but that wasn't as bad as basing Minna off of a relatively unknown ace and basing Lynette off of someone who was Canadian and not British.Archetype/characters messed up a bit-Pierre Clostermann's aristocratic side was rather overdone, and Erich Hartmann's free spiritedness was also a bit overdone. Also Billy Bishop wasn't very translated well into Lynette, the real guy was a pretty daring pilot and yet she was pretty shaky and not very confident of herself.  I can't say much about characters like Francessca, Minna, Eila, Sanya, and others on how they lived up to their pilot archetypes.Striker units-The whole idea of basing them off of other planes, well it just seemed like one more side note to make them stand out that kind of just failed. I don't understand why Erica's striker was painted black and gold when it was Gerhard Barkhorn who did that in WW2, Erich actually painted his black and red (read on how the Soviets feared what they called &quot;The Devil's Tulip&quot; when they saw him in the air).  Only really Charlotte's stood out as looking anything like the plane it was off of.One final note that's a bit sad, all but one of the aces used as pilot archeytpes are dead. Erich Hartmann (cause of death-a cold due to a weakened immune system from another disease), Gerhard Barkhorn (cause of death-car accident), Lidiya Litvak (cause of death-KIA), Billy Bishop (cause of death-natural causes), Pierre Clostermann (cause of death-natural causes), Saburo Sakai (cause of death-natural causes), Tetsuzō Iwamoto (cause of death-blood poisoning after surgery), Kaneyushi Mutoh (cause of death-KIA), Ilmari Juultainen (cause of death-natural causes), Franco Lucchini (cause of death-KIA), and Wolf Dietrich Wilcke (cause of death-KIA), those guys are all gone.  The only one that is still alive is Chuck Yeager, who as of today is 85 years old, healthy, and still alive and goes around the country to speak at various demonstrations and such. Apparently because of some fans of his on his myspace page, he may even know about Strike Witches as well.  I wonder what he thinks of all this?Well, I guess for history buffs like me, Strike Witches was an interesting watch. I guess it's worth watching again, though not without serious thought and caution. It's a fun series and one that isn't too serious, and I think that may be it's greatest charm. One thing's for sure, I can't wait to hear what Chuck Yeager has to say about all this. Story of Erich Hartmann&quot; will know how well that was translated into Erica and Gertrud.  Saburo Sakai was very well translated into Mio Sakamoto, and Chuck Yeager's spirit of adventure seemed to be very well present in Charlotte.  The aristocratic side of Pierre Clostermann was also pretty well translated into Perrine as well.Negatives:Weak plot-Yes, I understand the whole saving humanity thing, but it took about eight episodes in a twelve episode series for the plot to really pick up and things to get really juicy. And then it just ended. Lame...Animal parts-Okay, I know lots of people like this, but I don't.  It just looks rather disturbing and not very cute to me at all. While watching Strike Witches I was able to mostly overlook it, it still got on my nerves at times.Not enough done with certain characters-The biggest thing that got to me, Erica didn't play a bigger role. Come on, she was based off of the ACE OF ACES Erich Hartmann himself, the greatest fighter pilot of all time. Why didn't she get more spotlight time in air combat? Who knows, but I don't think it does the guy a lot of justice.Better archetypes could have been made-I don't understand why Minna wasn't based off of Adolf Galland and instead was based off of Wolf Dietrich Wilcke. Sure he was a high scoring during WW2 (175 kills), but if you know anything about WW2 air combat, no one ever talks about him. Lynette should have been Johnnie Johnston (highest scoring British ace of all time, 35 kills against the Luffwaffe) and not Billy Bishop, who was Canadian and not British.  While not that bad, it would have been cooler to see Sanya be based off of Alexandr Porshynkin rather then Lidiya Litvak simply because of the gender thing, but that wasn't as bad as basing Minna off of a relatively unknown ace and basing Lynette off of someone who was Canadian and not British.Archetype/characters messed up a bit-Pierre Clostermann's aristocratic side was rather overdone, and Erich Hartmann's free spiritedness was also a bit overdone. Also Billy Bishop wasn't very translated well into Lynette, the real guy was a pretty daring pilot and yet she was pretty shaky and not very confident of herself.  I can't say much about characters like Francessca, Minna, Eila, Sanya, and others on how they lived up to their pilot archetypes.Striker units-The whole idea of basing them off of other planes, well it just seemed like one more side note to make them stand out that kind of just failed. I don't understand why Erica's striker was painted black and gold when it was Gerhard Barkhorn who did that in WW2, Erich actually painted his black and red (read on how the Soviets feared what they called &quot;The Devil's Tulip&quot; when they saw him in the air).  Only really Charlotte's stood out as looking anything like the plane it was off of.One final note that's a bit sad, all but one of the aces used as pilot archeytpes are dead. Erich Hartmann (cause of death-a cold due to a weakened immune system from another disease), Gerhard Barkhorn (cause of death-car accident), Lidiya Litvak (cause of death-KIA), Billy Bishop (cause of death-natural causes), Pierre Clostermann (cause of death-natural causes), Saburo Sakai (cause of death-natural causes), Tetsuzō Iwamoto (cause of death-blood poisoning after surgery), Kaneyushi Mutoh (cause of death-KIA), Ilmari Juultainen (cause of death-natural causes), Franco Lucchini (cause of death-KIA), and Wolf Dietrich Wilcke (cause of death-KIA), those guys are all gone.  The only one that is still alive is Chuck Yeager, who as of today is 85 years old, healthy, and still alive and goes around the country to speak at various demonstrations and such.

The art isn't all that bad, generic character designs and such, but the boots modelled off of WWII aircraft do look good. Also the designs of the Neuroi enemies based on prototype aircraft were also pretty good.The sound wasn't terrible. The OP and ED weren't...very memorable and the actual sound design didn't really have any faults.The story is full of plot devices designed for fanservice. Only gender with magical powers are women, and they 'reach their magical peak' at 18 years old. The lack of trousers and skirts is put down to the girls needing to be ready at a moments notice to sortie, although in this version of Japan, it seems young girls generally just only wear underwear.The actual plot is full of rehashed ideas and tired cliches borrowed from a variety of other anime. Unassuming young teenage protagonist is thrust into a world of magic and/or battles against mysterious and powerful enemy, and suprisingly has great untapped potential. Each episode revolves around some plot point for minor character development which is resolved in the end by usually overcoming a challenge to destroy a bad guy. The required forseeable plot twist near the end is also present.Character development is incredibly minimal for characters outside of the protagonist Yoshika, which leaves the show with a cast of one dimensional stereotypes with different body design to appeal to varying fetishes.All in all, its a terrible show, and only for those who need more loli fapping material. very memorable and the actual sound design didn't really have any faults.The story is full of plot devices designed for fanservice.

Honestly, before I even get into the review I'll say something kind of contradictory.  I'm not going to sit here typing to try and convince you that this is a must watch for everyone because of amazing the story , art, music, etc are.  I believe wholeheartedly that Strike Witches is a series...that only people who like shows that handle 11 main/side characters being present all for a good amount of screen time well, beautiful sky scenes and lower-upper age teenage girls drawn not wearing actual pants, a story about a new Witch wanting to become stronger and help everyone she can even if it means taking reckless moves, etc.  Basically, there are many things that I believe can turn someone off from Strike Witches , although I'd definitely say it's way above average,  and I don't find it likely that the anime would convince you to like it, if you're extremely off put by something beforehand.   It's just not a show that you can talk about how well written it is, like Death Note, and Fullmetal Alchemist, how great the characters are, how stunning all the different visual types are, etc.  It's a fairly simplistic show that I don't think would change people's opinions much if they're inclined to not like it before viewing.  Anyway, I've rambled on enough now.  Time to start the review.  I won't be rating each category individually like I've been doing recently though, since it's a perfect 10 for me.As I said, the story is fairly simplistic.  Yoshika Miyafuji is going to a normal school, until she receives a letter from her dead father handed to her from Mio Sakamoto.  Mio is attempting to recruit her into the Strike Witches since she has an amazing healing ability, but Yoshika refuses at first.  She doesn't even agree to join the Strike Witches until after being taken on a carrier ship in order to see her father's grave, and equipping a striker unit for the first time, the device the witches use to fly, and helping to fight off a neuroi during her travels with Mio.  Her journey of self growth and her meetings with all the wonderful members of the 501st joint fighter wing, the Strike Witches, start.  Unlike other stories of self growth, the main character doesn't go from being one of the weakest to one of the strongest.  Yoshika at best, moves up into a middle spot, but she still remains lower in power rankings among the unit.  She may act rashly at times, but she's also the one who encourages everyone else when they have doubts and brings about conclusions that nobody expected until they saw it.  You find out the internal struggles of most of the remaining cast, as well.  Minna, Mio, Gertrude, and most others all have something that bothers them internally during the season and it's generally about something in the past that affects them in such a way that they don't act like themselves, until Yoshika ends up breaking them out of their shell, and sometimes other people help a little too.  It's not that she's a plot device, but that's just the way she is.  Yoshika is very good at giving and or inspiring hope to/in others.  One of the bests parts of the story definitely has to be that it doesn't try to be tear jerking despite the tragic events that occurred in many of the girl's lives.  There will be some boob jokes and playful grabbing now and again too, along with other comedy, but it just makes the experience so much better.  it's world war 2 based as well, but with the unknown neuroi attacking earth and Witches rather than feuding countries.  I believe the ships are suppose to be modeled after war war 2 ships as well.The art is fantastic, at least on blue-ray.  All the surroundings from the sky to the water to the ships, and everything seemed so realistic,  even though you can tell it's a drawing.  the neuroi may have weird designs, but it doesn't matter.  All the Witches have such memorable character designs, despite that they're drawn not wearing pants.  No female character in the Strike Witches universe ever wears actual pants, and tights are the closet it ever comes.  It's certainly a weird choice to make, but it actually makes their designs so much more memorable, a long with allowing the show to have an easy way to go about providing some fan service, making the striker units more noticeable, and eliminating any hindrance the pants may have made to the visual appeal while the witches are flying through the sky.  It's an art style that i'll never forget.The sound is similar to the story, in the fact that it may not seem special at first.  I'd say that the opening and ending theme convey one of the best messages of encouragement and working to discover your potential along side your friends out of all the theme songs that convey similar messages.  The songs are extremely memorable , if you're a fan at least and don't try to forget them.  The background music is fantastic too.  It's  not that it's the best calming music out there, the best pumping up music, or anything like that.  The music just has a unique feel to it that can only be experienced in Strike Witches show or something, like Brave Witches, which is very similar but different;  Brave Witches suffers in the art department a bit due to the sub par 3d cgi used though.  the animation is also amazingly well done in Strike Witches.  The fights are not the most action packed, but everything is so fluid and lively.The characters are all unique in their own way too.  I already said most of my thoughts on Yoshika so I'll just leave it at that.  Unfortunately, Strike Witches is another show where I don't think describing the characters will actually convince people.  Strike Witches, Brave Witches, Armed Girl's Machiavellism, and Seven Mortal Sins, are four shows that I have this opinion about their characters, for the most part.  I wouldn't mind going into how great of a singer Minna is and describing her past, talking about Gertrude's past, the problems Mio faces, and many other characteristics and personalities.  It would just make for too long of a character section when they are 11 Strike Witches and I don't think it would convince many people because the cast would sound generic paper, despite their liveliness and colorful personalities.  It's kind of a shame, but I'd rather keep it shorter and not make my favorite cast sound generic unintentionally.  It's a cast that needs to be experienced, as long as any prior knowledge you have about the show doesn't deter you from watching it already.Now for the enjoyment.  Strike Witches was one of those shows that I always loved and didn't watch for a particularly good reason.  I read in a review or something that the main character grew dog ears and a tail when she fights and I wanted to try and discover the reasoning behind that.  I already started to like cat girls at the time, so the humanoid aspect pulled me in, especially since it sounded so bizarre.  My question was not answered until I read one of the manga series, Maidens in the Sky, though.  I still loved it even though my question was not answered.  I realized it was one of my top 5 favorites when i thought about it a few months later.  After another 2 or 3 months, I was thinking about what my favorite anime is, and after Noir, which was the first anime i saw, being my favorite for a while, I realized after thinking about my opinions on it after i started to re-watch it, that it doesn't hold the title of my favorite anime anymore.  as I watched more shows, Noir wasn't even in my top 10 anymore.  I decided that Strike Witches is my favorite anime after Noir lost it's place, and I just re-watched this season over a period of four days.  I enjoy watching Strike Witches so much and it definitely brings the most joy to me, overall, when I consider every aspect.  It's well deserving of being my favorite anime and I don't regret giving it that title.  I hope that many people who read this at least have a positive experience while watching the season. that only people who like shows that handle 11 main/side characters being present all for a good amount of screen time well, beautiful sky scenes and lower-upper age teenage girls drawn not wearing actual pants, a story about a new Witch wanting to become stronger and help everyone she can even if it means taking reckless moves, etc.  Basically, there are many things that I believe can turn someone off from Strike Witches , although I'd definitely say it's way above average,  and I don't find it likely that the anime would convince you to like it, if you're extremely off put by something beforehand.

This anime is just plainly too innocent, naive, happy, friendly, whatever you want to call it. The &quot;problems&quot; that are presented in the anime are all very dumb and not interesting, and the way the characters act is too childish. If you like fast-paced animes, with good action in it, you can stop reading this immediately and look elsewhere.The story starts out with some mysterious &quot;Neuroi&quot; race that has appeared on Earth and has suddenly started attacking humans all around the world. That's about as much as...you get to understand about Neurois since, after the first episode, they appear spontaneously only to disturb some other, not-entertaining activity the witches were holding. They suddenly decide to keep developing the Neuroi story in the last two episodes of the series, but they just act as if they're getting somewhere, as if they're going to uncover and explain something new, just to leave the viewer expecting something that never happens.Art is alright, it's better than many other anime series, but it's nothing astonishing; you can find the same art and animation quality, even better, in many other series.Voice acting happens to be good, and the intro song might be just a little bit catchy, but it's nothing to be surprised or &quot;touched&quot; by. Sound effects are alright as well. It has a fairly good sound, overall.I must admit that the characters are explained in a nice manner; you get to know a bit about everyone, enough as to understand them. However, the characters are all based on anime standards; in other words, every character in this series resembles some other character from another series. And, as stated before, they all act too childish; extremely childish. For some reason, too, female characters apparently hate wearing pants; they always hang around wearing panties and some shirt (although Perrine wears pantyhose, too).This series lies in the borderline of &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;just acceptable&quot;.  I wouldn't invite anyone to see this anime, though; do so under your own risk (although it might be good to watch it at night, in order to fall asleep quickly). you get to understand about Neurois since, after the first episode, they appear spontaneously only to disturb some other, not-entertaining activity the witches were holding.

Thankfully, I was pleasantly surprised by its actual depth than what common hearsay has informed me of.  Allow me to elaborate.Picking up slowly, with the introduction of the setting and characters, it eases us in to a somewhat formulaic format.  We begin with our heroine, Yoshika Miyafuji and her initial anti-war sentiment and her joining the titular organisation.  It then segues in to the exploration of the respective members of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing with a Neuroi usually present to showcase the ability of that particular member.  There...is a twist of course, but I leave that for you to discover on your own.  I have a particular gripe about the plot's pacing though.  It feels like the plot twist was constructed in a hurry and tacked on for the last few episodes.  All in all, not too shabby.The 501st Joint Fighter Wing is an aerial unit circa WW2 and its task is to stop Neuroi who deploy in the air.  Beautiful aerial dogfights ensue with pretty explosions and very &quot;nice views&quot;.  Many seem to discredit Strike Witches solely for the fanservice and in a sense I understand, its enough to cause a fatal nosebleed.  But that isn't the only fault it has.  Rendered English countrysides look plastic when the 501st have some field exercises.  My god do they look plastic.  Otherwise, the 3D rendered art looks detailed, especially the Japanese Carrier Akagi, the 2D backgrounds look up to snuff and the lighting is justly positioned.The sound is not spectacular though it does a good job of providing us with good audio cues.  Few parts have audio that I feel does not go with a scene.  Sound effects too sound a bit off kilter and it feels like all the guns sound the same.  Those who watch quite a lot of anime may recognise some familiar voices too but this is where your mileage may vary.At its heart, Strike Witches is the 501st's war story and in war stories, it explores the characters and their relations to each other.  Some of it feels too sudden though, such as Yoshika's sudden change of heart to enlist.  However, as the bulk of character development is on a per episode basis, we get enough of a feeling for each of the characters, showing interpersonal relationships, personalities, hopes and fears, particularly of the veterans of the conflict.This was a fun and mostly light show.  In fact, if you look past the fanservice and the initial blood loss involved, its something that could be recommended to anyone interested in magical girls or aerial combat action.  However, it was more the little parallels to our history that had me appreciating Strike Witches, especially mirroring Erich Hartmann wearing Hitler's hat with Erica Hartmann's wearing someone else's &quot;pants&quot; (they have the gall to call them pants) as a result of their stupor. As far as enjoyment goes, taking an alien threat and putting it in a WW2 era setting while replacing actual ace pilots with loli magical girls with no pants sounds like a winner to me. is a twist of course, but I leave that for you to discover on your own.

Originally based on a light novel series, it first spawned an OVA in 2007 and a 13 episode anime series in 2008.The story of &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; takes place during the 1940's on an alternate version of our earth, where magic and technology coexist and most countries have different names. Thrust into a conflict that spreads across the globe by an unknown race or entity called Neuroi, the human race is put on the defensive after the Neuroi quickly wipe out several nations. Humanity's best hope to defeat...the airborne Neuroi lies with the 'strike witches' of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, young girls with high magical powers that are able to fly when donning their striker units, propulsion devices that envelop each leg.Undoubtedly one of the series' prime and most visually obvious aspects are its copious amounts of fanservice. One could judge &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; solely by its abundant fanservice, but this would be a short-sighted judgement.The level of fanservice is obvious from episode one on, as in the alternate world that &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; takes place in, women do not wear pants or skirts, they simply walk around with their panties or swimsuit bottoms showing in plain view.  Each episode is packed with blatant pantsu shots and is rife with other fanservice scenes such as glances at character's bosoms, scantily clad bed attire or bikini's while during the obligatory beach scenes. On top of that each of the witches displays animal ears and tail when activating her magical powers, most likely this was intentionally added to appeal to the fans of animal eared girls.To fully enjoy the series viewers must be willing to accept these high amounts of fanservice, so &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; might not be for all audiences.At first I was reluctant, assuming the series would be mere mindless fanservice of a questionable level such as in &ldquo;Kanokon&rdquo; or &ldquo;To Love RU&rdquo;. Watching the first few episodes I was quickly proven wrong and discovered this terrific series holds much more. Though present in large amounts, the fanservice stays digestible and never becomes offensively rude or of poor taste. &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; shows how fanservice laden series should be, cute and even daring or sensual, but never without reserve and all in sufficient good taste.Furthermore, the series offers other well executed elements, such as its homage and accurate references to World War II era air combat, it has flawless animation, and classic but well executed plots such as personal growth, overcoming challenges.Character design for the anime series as well as artwork for the &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; light novels was done by Humikane Shimada, who was also responsible for the character designs of &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo;, hence associations between both series can easily be made. Next to character design similarities, both series show young girls on the front lines of an apocalyptic war where the human race must defend itself against annihilation from an inhuman entity.There are also quite a bit of differences, from more obvious ones such as the series' length, &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo; being animated by JC Staff while &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; is animated by Gonzo, &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo; with its post-modern setting has the girls use futuristic mecha while &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; used the concept of magic to have the girls fly around with propulsion units inspired on World War II era aircraft.With this World War II air combat element one of the other main themes in &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; becomes apparent, all of the witches' striker units are reminiscent of existing propeller fighter planes such as the Mustang P51, Mitsubishi Zero, Messerschmitt Bf-109,...The witches themselves are based or named after famous World War II ace pilots such as Pierre Clostermann, Erich Hartmann, Chuck Yeager,...&ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; is full of references and homages to combat aviation from that era, including these direct references to air planes and pilots but also showing accurate recreations of fighter plane combat manoeuvres and tactics.Furthermore the series accurate and detailed depiction of historic weapons and military equipment is remarkable and helps immerse the viewer into a World War II era atmosphere. Plenty of attention to historical details was made to accurately recreate era weaponry and equipment, such as the Maschinengewehr 42 or M1918 Browning Automatic Rifle.While most characters may seem generic, they never come off as uninteresting. &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; features quite a large cast, there are no less than 11 witches in the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, nearly four times as much as the girls of &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo;, yet &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; has only half the episode count. With those time constraints it is to be expected that not all characters get the same amount of airtime or background depth, yet &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; manages to give every character its moment in the spotlights which introduces her better to the viewer or reveals more about her past background.No characters jump off-screen as being novel or unexpectedly deep, most are based on well known character formula, but because we are either shown their background story or they get enough scenes to make them familiar so that we as viewers will end up knowing all of the witches well enough to care for each of them.The writers did a terrific job, certainly so seeing the number of characters and time constraints.  While we're never told much about the pasts of Lynette, Perrine, Erica or Lucchini, their actions and interaction with the others firmly establishes their characters. We're shown scenes or sub plots about the pasts of Minna, Gertrud and Shirley, which immediately makes us feel more involved. So even though there's so many girls next to Yoshika, the leading character, throughout the episodes the viewer will become attached to each and everyone of them.With an all female cast, several yuri or shoujo-ai pairings and scenes are a given. While some of the girls have strong bonds of friendship, like Lucchini and Shirley or Mio and Minna, others are hinted or plainly shown to be more than friends, which either leads to humorous scenes such as Perrine's jealous fits, Yoshika's infatuation with Lynette's bosom or to more endearing, romantic scenes like those between Sanya and Eila.Animation by Gonzo is absolutely stellar in the series. Quality almost never drops and retains a high level throughout all of the episodes, with gorgeous scenes and renderings of all the cute witches with a lot of attention to detail. The many air combat action scenes are fluid, fast and well done.The 3D CGI generated Neuroi are portrayed as alien flying entities built up from black honeycomb structures which makes them not only simple but also makes them seem more realistic and acceptable compared to the Worms from &ldquo;Sky Girls&rdquo; which appeared as large animal-like things.Many series should have consistent animation levels like &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo;, especially the characters are so well animated, a true feat Gonzo accomplished here when compared to their other creations.The first Japanese DVD releases of &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; have shown Gonzo took it a bit further for the DVD versions, removing any censoring present in the episodes of the television broadcast, where steam, rays of light, shadows or other obstacles obscured full view of the character's bare breasts and the likes. Hence the DVD versions seems more niche oriented than the television broadcast version and as such may not appeal to the viewers who are not keen on the fanservice element of the series. Such casual viewers may be best served by watching the regular television broadcast episodes.Music is more generic in &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo;, while the soundtrack is solid, it does not particularly excel on its own but contents itself by accompanying and supporting what is seen on screen, a job it does well. The opening track 'Watashi Ni Dekiru Koto' (the things I can do) is an upbeat song full of hope, which accentuates the theme of Yoshika's struggle to be able to achieve her goals as a witch.I do recommend &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; to everyone looking for a nice series with a good mix of action and humour, regardless of the more niche elements it has like its fanservice it will no doubt be a fun series to watch for all. the airborne Neuroi lies with the 'strike witches' of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, young girls with high magical powers that are able to fly when donning their striker units, propulsion devices that envelop each leg.Undoubtedly one of the series' prime and most visually obvious aspects are its copious amounts of fanservice. One could judge &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; solely by its abundant fanservice, but this would be a short-sighted judgement.The level of fanservice is obvious from episode one on, as in the alternate world that &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; takes place in, women do not wear pants or skirts, they simply walk around with their panties or swimsuit bottoms showing in plain view.  Each episode is packed with blatant pantsu shots and is rife with other fanservice scenes such as glances at character's bosoms, scantily clad bed attire or bikini's while during the obligatory beach scenes. On top of that each of the witches displays animal ears and tail when activating her magical powers, most likely this was intentionally added to appeal to the fans of animal eared girls.To fully enjoy the series viewers must be willing to accept these high amounts of fanservice, so &ldquo;Strike Witches&rdquo; might not be for all audiences.At first I was reluctant, assuming the series would be mere mindless fanservice of a questionable level such as in &ldquo;Kanokon&rdquo; or &ldquo;To Love RU&rdquo;.

Her father, Dr. Miyafuji, the inventor of the Striker Unit (what you're here for, if not the butts) has been MIA for some time. Yoshika, appalled by war, ends up enlisting in the navy in order to find out about the fate of her father. Hilarity ensues as she enters the boob-and-butt-festival that is the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, a group of elite ace pilots, even though she has no combat experience whatsoever. Doesn't it sound idiotic? Guess...what? It's actually not half bad.As part of the Strike Witches fandom, I've endured many a slight against my favorite anime. Every single one has been accurate. Yes, this show is 75% fanservice and 25% inaccurate WWII history. Yes, it caters to fanboys who just want to see boobies and big guns. But does it have potential? You bet. Nearly every character has the major components of a good one. They have reasons for their behavior, they have motives, they're relatable. The writers and animators could have focused on this aspect, and Strike Witches would have been a whole lot better. Hell, they could have kept in all the butts and cameltoe if they wanted. A little character development would have made this show a great challenge to the general flat-as-a-board ecchi character group. However, they decided to appeal to a mishmash of historical buffs and drooling, mindless fanboys.Despite all this, I think that Strike Witches is worth watching. As a SW fan, I've learned more about WWII than I ever learned in high school. People claim the same thing of Hetalia, but somehow Hetalia manages to annoy me even more than Strike Witches does. That's beside the point. Strike Witches has a huge universe to build on, appealing animation, and is basically a big bundle of untapped potential. Until that potential is tapped, I'll keep searching for an anime with character, story, and sweet butts. what?

Then I let you borrow mine.""And so, she got started taking her panties off.(from the episode 7 of Strike Witches)Strike Witches, is a light-hearted military based anime with some magical abilities such as healing wounds just by concentration itself; seeing distant things clearly and even its hidden inner parts with a magical eye. And, I think this is one of most ecchi fanservice-orientated anime in the Japan animation history.For some mysterious reason, in the world of Strike Witches all young girls seem like they don\'t...put any skirts or pants on their bottom. Therefore, their underwears of their bottom parts, or at least their barely-covered crotches can always be seen by everyone around them so easily. This hilarious- I mean terrible habit of the world made me in a panic before I realized that they probably *have to* be without skirts or pants at all times in order to immediately mount the Striker Units on their legs whenever the alien invasion warning issued. My goodness. That perfectly makes sense because the aliens would appear possiblly in every minutes and wearing a skirt for the witches might be a problem when mounting the Striker Units. I was pretty impressed by those young fighters. Although the witch girls look young and cute, they are professional army officers after all. Showing people their underwears or barely-covered crotches doesn\'t make them feel embarrassment because of their high-spirited sense of mission. With this rational conclusion, I finally managed to settle myself on watching their brilliant actions in peace... until I had happend to see a nurse with no skirt! She was not a member of the witches for sure. What the heck were she doing in a hospital? What is wrong with this Strike Witches world? So, I eventually learnt that no skirts for girls is like a principle nature of this anime. Furthermore, interestingly enough, the girls seem like they have no question nor a complaint about it.Now, please let me review the other aspects of this anime other than just about panties. To be my good surprise, the other aspects like the battle with the enemies, and the plots of each episode were also very nice, unlike the saying of some other reviews. The battle scenes with the aliens is very loud and exciting, thrilling that is worth watching. The plots may seem typical to anime buffs but it suits the whole relaxed mood of this show. The opening/ending themes are maybe not super great but still they are pretty fine and I like its innocent, optimistic lyrics, which I listened to it almost every time I watched the show.I have given it a \'great\' score because the show is totally very well balanced as a fanservice-orientated entertainment piece of work mainly for anime freak gentlemen. So, make sure if you are an airhead \'freak\' before trying it. :) put any skirts or pants on their bottom.

It reeks of otaku pandering nonsense, and is sure to alienate just about anyone who does not take pleasure in voyeurism. Really, all this appears to be is another reason to show half-naked girls using big weapons, and in truth, that is exactly what it is. The funny thing is this show is not bad. In fact, once you get over the unspeakably absurd premise and all the shameless fan-service (or already like this sort of thing), this show is actually quite enjoyable.Yoshika Miyafuji is a kind-spirited, perky 14-year old. She also happens...to be able to heal others with magic. She leads a peaceful life, that is until she decides to join the fight against the Neuroi, the mysterious enemy threatening the Earth, with a little prodding from commander Mio Sakamoto. Yoshika becomes a member of the Strike Witches, young women with magical powers who are the strongest defense against the Neuroi. Yoshika\'s reputation precedes her, as her father is the designer of the ""Striker"" units the Witches use to fly. Together with her new comrades in the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, Yoshika is bound to have some big battles ahead of her, as well as some silly mishaps.On the technical-side, Strike Witches is a pretty little package. The character designs are not anything especially innovative, but they look lively, and are well proportioned (which is important considering the rampant fan-service). The backgrounds are also well detailed, everything from the vast sky to the interior of the witches outpost looks stellar. The animation is fluid overall, though it is clear most of the focus went to the spectacular air battles. The camera angles do a good job of getting maximum exposure of the girls, even in the midst of battle, which is a big plus for the ecchi fans out there. Gonzo\'s habit of inserting CGI into their works is present here, but it is used accordingly; it is mainly used for the Neuroi. The music is probably the least memorable thing here. It is not at all bad, and fits the series quite well, but somehow it just does not stand out much compared to what you are seeing.Well, the problems this show has are pretty obvious. For one, it caters to otaku, or more precisely ecchi fans, rather than casual viewers. Anyone who is not into animated teenage girls having their privates exposed while fighting a seemingly faceless adversary will likely avoid this after a single glance. Even if they did though, they will still find a plot that is lacking. Very little is explained about this world, which is in fact an alternative version of the WWII era, a fact I left out in my summery because it has very little barring on the plot (other than the characters\' names). The Neuroi are given no understandable motive, not that it matters since they only serve as opponents for the witches and little more. Heck, the powers of the witches are barely even explored. Why do they sprout animal appendages when they activate their powers? To please the otaku masses is my guess. Why do witches lose their magic around the age of 20? Well, they needed some reason the military would rely on a bunch of teenage girls. This is all haphazard writing, and it shows. However, all these short comings are remedied by the fact that the show does not take itself too seriously. Most of the shows run is spent on ecchi shenanigans and visually spectacular battles against the Neuroi, and it works. This is what makes the show enjoyable despite its poor writing.One thing that the writing did get right was the characters. The witches are a collection of surprisingly refreshing personalities. They all have distinctive personality quirks that make them likable, from shy Lynette to free-spirited (and boob obsessed) Francesca. Even the snobbish Perrine is likable. The girls play off each other well, especially within the duos the show seems to pair them in. Whether they are kindred spirits, like the mischievous  Charlotte and Francesca, or an odd couple like disciplined Trude and laid-back Erica, the chemistry between them is delightful. This is not really masterful characterization, as characters have difficulty carrying more dramatic moments, but it cannot be said that any of the characters are unlikable (with the exception of the hard-ass general, who\'s whole purpose was to be unlikable).Strike Witches is a show that knows its viewership and aims straight for them. It does not even try to appeal to anyone outside of its demographic, and therein lies its biggest strength and weakness. Those who like this kind of thing will love this show; those who don\'t will avoid it like a plague. As for this reviewer, I\'m on the fence, torn between the guilty pleasure that is the ecchi genre and the sensibility of better penned stories. to be able to heal others with magic.

Alienated towards the otaku culture, I felt depressed looking for a war anime that can suit my tastes; Grave of the Fireflies was not enough for me. I entered into a forest one night. Night came and none appeared before me. I ate all my Kitkats by then. Hungry, I killed Pikachu and devoured its tender meat over a campfire. I continued journeying, but my vision blurred; everything around me turns misty and foggy. I hear the flapping of the wings and...the rustle of the trees. The forest was laughing at me. Losing hope, I fell down to the mud. Writhing in agony, I looked towards the dark night sky. I called up to the heavens, “Save me, God. Save me from this despair.”God said, “Okie dokey, dude. Check out this anime. It’s called Sora no Woto. You’ll love it; it’s pretty radical, man!”Today, I am back at home well-fed. My mom cried when I told her Pikachu was killed by the characters from K-On!. Nevertheless, the miracle known as Sora no Woto made me ponder about the future of war animes.A few weeks ago, Professor Oak gave me Charmander along a copy of Strike Witches. He boasted, “It’s uncensored. Consider it a rite of passage.” He patted me on the shoulder, winking. I had never heard of Strike Witches until the professor told me so. Judging from the synopsis, it looked like a war anime. I went into the MyAnimeList database, reading the synopsis and the reviews; many people likened this work to Sora no Woto, the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs awarded this work for cultural excellence, and God told me to review works through Fox News before that. I decided to watch this work and review the work.Strike Witches is set in an alternate World War II setting, specifically the Battle of Britain. Considered one of the toughest battles in World War II history, the Battle of Britain setting has the potential to set up thought-provoking characters and themes. It can make us ponder about the effects of the appeasement effort led by Neville Chamberlain, war in different people’s perspectives, shell shock, and more. Sora no Woto might actually lose to the work’s possible themes; its themes are environmental, cultural, and anti-war by nature, criticizing warmongers for making the world it is today. Consider Strike Witches’s setting for a minute. Wouldn’t this be a fascinating show for everyone to watch?I remembered Professor Oak’s winking. As I began to watch, I realized why he winked. Oh dear, I’m seeing young girls’ reproductive organs and underwear for no apparent reason except Freudian imaginations. The alternate history made little sense whatsoever. This did not bode well.In this alternate historical setting, Japan worked with the Allies and stationed their troops at London. The Neurois, aka the Nazis, were unknown sentient creatures that kept blasting away Europe for no particular reason. Their aircrafts looked starkly similar to US stealth fighters. The Allies were stumped, losing all of Europe except England. How could anyone damage the aircrafts when they clearly had force fields protecting them?Japan’s answer: girls with jetpacks and basic weaponry.Strike Witches’s setting combined the Battle of Britain, mecha logic, and the mahou shoujo genre so weirdly it made little sense. Questionable aspects of how things worked were never answered throughout the course of this anime.As I began to write this review, God cried out through Hannity’s mouth, “What about the characters? This show is all about the characters just like Sora no Woto is!”What made Sora no Woto’s characters so special was that they felt necessary in contributing the story and the themes. Strike Witches’s characters could go into that direction, but most of the times want to, you know, go in an upper direction.Take Lynette, one of the few likable characters in the work. When she was introduced in the work, she was shown as a shy girl character; a good comparison would be a girly version of Ikari Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion. In the end of the episode, she began to open up towards Miyafuji by squishing her to death; suffocating and dying between Lynette’s cleavage sounded like a nice way to die, but it was no example of good storytelling.Gertrud Barkhorn and the two white-haired girls are the only characters to go completely into characterization. The episode with Barkhorn has some fantastic exposition added in; people can understand her mindset more clearly. The two white-haired girls have interesting stories as well.Everyone else feels stale. All we really know from Sakamoto Mio is that she laughs like Jack from The Shining and does whatever cos a pirate is free. Perrine is a stalker of Mio. Erica is a clumsy ace pilot. Miyafuji can heal. Francesca is Ed from Cowboy Bebop. There isn’t many characteristics that make these characters involving or realistic; they are just there. Cardboard boxes make better characters than these people.Like Sora no Woto, it is somewhat episodic. Most of the plot involves the fascinating premise of “cute girls doing cute things”. A particular episode involved about underwear. Very few of them are memorable. When the show adds tension, it does not feel tense; it looks plain silly. The dramatic story and conclusion emerges at the end. Predictable and silly, the conclusion to the work does not pay off well; things get solved with a deus ex machina. There is also a cliffhanger, pointing people to watch Strike Witches 2.No thanks, Gonzo. I might watch it someday, but it’s not due to your cliffhanger.I returned the set to Professor Oak and yawned. I do not think this work was the worst work I’ve seen. It did not piss me off a lot; though, I ate a boiled skewed Charmander on a satay stick in the end because of how bored I was. There are things I disliked -- the fanservice, the wasted potential, the unfunny side characters. However, they don’t cause me to hate this work. Instead, I just thought this work as really average; it did not offend me at all. I was just really bored.There are definitely people who loved it; some may say it is thought-provoking, maybe even more against Sora no Woto. I don’t see it that way nor do I think the endorsement by the government is needed. Say all you want, but I see it as a government-endorsed loli pantsu anime with girls on jetpacks beating up Nazis. It’s no Sora no Woto, that’s for sure. I suppose it can be entertaining to people -- it is possible that I have no soul. As a work of artistic and cultural achievement, now that’s a great joke to laugh about. the rustle of the trees. The forest was laughing at me. Losing hope, I fell down to the mud.

As a work of artistic and cultural achievement, now that’s a great joke to laugh about.', 'Three years ago, I watched this anime and slapped it a rotten score. After all, an anime featuring pantless, gun-bopping teenage girls couldn’t possibly ascribe anything of depth to the varied community of anime goers and entertainment seekers today, right?Right.Then during my second time through, I realized something unbelievable about this series. This anime isn’t about half-naked chicks shooting down big, black cocks with guns. Right?Right…ish.So yes…by my THIRD time through I realized: Strike Witches is an idiot savant of an anime. It is an attempted excuse for Japan’s WWII guilt, and combined with incidental, radical feminism investigates a unique reality of victory for...all humans and absolution of the original Axis Powers. Furthermore, rather than to be undone by fellow man, the retribution for all the anger of that era is instead unleashed upon an enigmatic alien race bent on aimless worldwide destruction.Your 501st Fighter Wing. All the guns, less of the garments. (9/10)Despite my rather despicable claims, this simple, misdirected story eagerly rakes in a “bare” perspective on Japanese postwar culture more than anything other anime series I’ve ever watched. Yoshika Miyafuji, our protagonist from the Fuso Nation, has after a series of misadventures found herself smack dab in the middle of an international war between humans and a hostile alien invader known as the Neuroi. Though the Neuroi’s intentions and methods are unknown, Miyafuji and the 501st Joint Fighters—the Strike Witches, or gun-wielding teenage girls utilizing magic-powered, leg-mounted rocket engines known as “Strikers” to fly—dedicate their lives (and panties) to the survival of mankind.One of the most misunderstood things about this anime is its high degree of fanservice. Nearly every ten seconds the viewer is exposed to some sort of sexual innuendo, be it the slightest visual of pantsu or a blatant bath scene with boobs flopping about like custard. The delivery is unabashed in consistency, if not almost bewildering considering the depth of the alternate historical content. Indeed, this deceitful mask of perversion disguises a highly controversial possibility for this alternate universe as follows:Despite being a relative time frame to what we live, there is no evidence for existing non-Japanese Asians, Jews, or Blacks in the entire series INCLUDING doujin and movie-based media. In the series, the closest to being black might be the Italian girl, Francesca, but considering the brutal circumstances of World War II it freaks me out that neither a Jew or a Chinese exists among the ranks of survivors.For some reason only a small group of magical women between the ages of 12-20 seem to be effective as combatants. Men, older women, and machines seem to be rather defenseless, rendering none but Highly Effeminate Teenage Vixens (HETV) as our only hope.What are the Neuroi? The mysterious qualities of the enemy are vividly explored, but some answers aren’t given. I find it fascinating that the Neuroi have chosen a spot of the world between Karlsland (Germany) and eastern Russia (Orussia) as their hive. If we consider the alignment of world powers during the war era, isn’t it interesting that the brutal enemy of humanity is stationed somewhere in Central Asia? Also, isn’t it just as interesting that the “good guys” in this series happen to hail from Japan (Fuso), Karlsland, and Orussia? Does anyone see what I’m getting at here?My conclusion is that Strike Witches presents as an innocent peep show, when it ruthlessly stakes on radicalism and nationalism as the true berth of survival. The weakest races have been eliminated, and a unique gift of power to women establishes a rather unanticipated form of feminism—perhaps with the intent to balance out the missing historical factors of this show.This is particularly true with feminism. Throughout the series we CLEARLY see the reduced sexuality of women’s legs, as nearly all women in the show do not wear pants. For the otaku this is obnoxiously fanservice; to the alternate reality, this is a normal getup. In this setting, men would have to start from this specific style of dress to find sexual arousal, and thus would be presented less opportunities to think perverse thoughts. Women, too, lose power through arousal of men, and are then more focused on careers and independence. I’m sure many a fan has tried to excuse this by saying that “in order to fit into the Strikers they can’t wear pants—blah blah—requiem stop talking—I’ll bite you” sort of argument is the most cogent.The sad truth is that they’re only halfway there. Feminism wins simply by the lifestyle of this series, and—considering that all other types of Asians are missing—it is winning much more than races or gender stereotypes by default.We also have evidence for radicalism through the consistent failures of men throughout both seasons. Airplanes, battleships, and maritime weapons are all rendered useless, bereaved of all duty but to serve as cannon fodder for the elite Witch squadrons. Commanders shrug helplessly while their ships are mercilessly crushed and sunk, and whatever authority they might even have over Witches is easily bypassed.Next, if the Bechdel test were to be applied to this series, hardly a moment in it would fail. The entire series voids men of any appeal or authority, focusing the entire story on the Witches and their sisterhood. This is fascinating, especially considering that a tit or ass flies across the screen with all but sexual abandon. Even Yoshika’s awkward tit fetish remains effeminate, keeping the perversion limited only to women without delving into yuri or shoujo ai. Also, in great relief there are absolutely no random peeping scenes involving half-naked men getting punched by tiny women into the stratosphere while shouting “I AM LIKE…SO SORRY.” Or at least not as in the exhausting case of practically EVERY ecchi harem series known to otakukind.Altogether, though the creator himself may not have even dreamed of this, his lewd creation defines “unique” in its background, plot, and style. It may have been designed to make men horny and stupid, but it could still be insightful enough for any informed viewer. For reasons such as this, I can offer a ridiculously high score.Two-dimensional, but well-grown. (6/10)While stock characters are expected for a series focused on as many pantsu shots as possible, making sure the characters actually fit together is not as such required. Strike Witches makes several attempts to go beyond that, particularly with complicated ladies like Minna, Eila, or Gertrud. I should not be spoiling this series at all in saying that our main protagonist lives up to our expectations, as her limitations and delimiters all come and go as expected. There are a few good moments for everyone, even support characters such as Shirley, Perrine, and Francesca.Regardless, all of the girls make up for their limited personalities with well-placed anecdotes of growth. Mio, in particular, encounters a struggle that puts the entire squadron through many hardships, yet we see with her continued passion to save humanity a constant state of perseverance. When not enthused by boobs and butts, we actually start to see a little bit of depth to everyone as they fight their own personal battles, (at least moreso than the drooling we do while they fight the actual enemy.)My personal favorite? Definitely Perrine. Not because she’s a prissy, tsuntsun nerd that offers the best personality-to-sexual-exploitation ratio; mainly just because she is easy to figure out. In fact, each witch has some sort of spice to her that feeds the lonely wolves like me. While it is designed as an advertisement net to catch and draw my attention, it is at least nice to get a little more differential between the women than a typical 21st century harem series with the same visual appeal.Incidental music WIN. OP/ED fail. (8/10)Neither the opening nor closing theme of either season was particularly fascinating. Though well composed and nicely sung, the openings are unfortunately the same, drab Ishida Yoko dancepop ditties that dominate such a small market with upbeat feel and trendy melody. Even though they are in the same court as Ishida, the I’ve Sound girls always manage to harness a stronger or more atmospheric melody. To its own justice the series should have had its own personal opening theme. Or perhaps rather than dance music, why not something on the side of a tune from the WWII era? Either way, another pop song about “Doing what I can do” and “loving some certain, undistinguished person” is justifiable for me to skip ahead one and a half minutes as soon as possible every time.Meanwhile, the real groundwork is done by a time tested artist like Seikou Nagaoka. His track “Witch no Tatakai,” or “A Witch’s Fight” is a driving force for perhaps the entire series’ climactic moments. Written with a very powerful bass line, we can feel the surge of excitement build up as the melody creeps in at some point seconds later. The sort of “champion melody” rises out of the trumpets (or in some cases, an electric guitar) through the oscillating strings, and builds up more and more intensity when recapitulating for a second time through. This track is perfectly aligned for underdog victories, high speeds, and pretty much most highly emotional scenes on the battlefield. For something that he probably threw together in 20 minutes, the perfectly chained elements make it quite unforgettable—I still could recall it several years after my first viewing of the show!Nagaoka also empowers more endearing moments with his gentle strings in “Eikou no Kiroku.” He draws out mystery with “Kunou” and its Dorian harp. He demonstrates his mastery of orchestration with the grinding bass harmonies in “Neuroi no Su he.” Without a doubt, the musical programming for a show like this fit all too perfectly to serve as distraction from the fanservice, or at least more than the jumpy tunes that surround each episode.An animation behest to bre-hests. Ha. Ha. Ha. (7/10)As a healthy male I would be criminalizing this series for giving the animation a score lower than 70 points. It is literally as though the animation studio took an extensive class on drawing vaginal protrusions and ample bosoms while studying butlery.Seriously. Every few seconds, however subtle or obvious, a boob or butt is “served warm” to our eyes as a feast, delivering the most intoxicating form of perversion so much so that we are left passively molested by our screens. While many other series might put this one to shame in this regard, very few can deliver with the same degree of tastefulness.My biggest detractor for score here is solely the key animation. Often during fight scenes the characters shapely figures would become too fluid and perhaps not-so-shapely. In fact, within the first five minutes of the series we see a rather terribly drawn view of Gertrud’s patooty, as it is quite clear that somebody was too busy completing key frames to actually bother providing detail to her shape. This same mistake happens several times, showing that despite the “ample” details, the budget wasn’t exactly such.That said, the action scenes were made with good intention. The weapons are drawn badass—even to the extent that they can be as exciting as the…yep, you guessed it…perhaps the best action scene in the entire show might be the part in season one concerning Shirley and Mach 1; though not very detailed, the desired effect came through quite well. (As for the best episode, it is without debate the infamous sukebe-mushi of Season 2, episode 7.)Uncomfortable for many at first, but the wounds will heal. (8/10)And that is perhaps the best thing about Strike Witches, considering the great deal of socially unacceptable content unleashed over 8 hours visually. If you are a Forever Alone, this series will provide great comfort. If you want to see something controversial and can choke down the hypnotizing amount of female parts, give it a shot. OR even if you are looking for unique Feminist propaganda, this would be great material for a write up.If you are a married man who wants to pick up a good series to watch with the family…while I would personally think how awesome you are for even trying to suggest this series, you might just want to save it for when the family goes to sleep (or if you watch in sprees, when they go to see the old folks for the weekend.) all humans and absolution of the original Axis Powers.

OR even if you are looking for unique Feminist propaganda, this would be great material for a write up.If you are a married man who wants to pick up a good series to watch with the family…while I would personally think how awesome you are for even trying to suggest this series, you might just want to save it for when the family goes to sleep (or if you watch in sprees, when they go to see the old folks for the weekend.)', ""This is pretty much another one of those kind of animes where Action and Comedy blend in like Bread and Butter. Its a great anime to watch just for some Enjoyment if you haven't already whored enough Ecchi, Comedy, or Action animu yet.First lets go over some cons.SPOILERS-I have a issue with the very last episode of the first season and how every other Strike Witches girl knew that Miyafuji was driving the last Striker unit. I know not to use logic when it comes to anime but, how? She is about 500 meters away and yet everyone knew it was her. Not counting Perrine-San...and Mio.-The Cliffhanger. This has got to be the most laziest ways to include more writing to hint at another season. I mean, I guess I can understand it might have a messaging error and it was just now registering but seriously. Really?-Its a bit generic. At the very least a lot of these characters have probably been done to death but its kinda offsetted by a big assortment of characters-The Art style is nothing exactly special.END OF SPOILERSAnd now the Pros.-Episode 7: Need I say more?-Very Likeable characters. Nearly every character has there own set of personalities. Like Lucchini is the obvious Loli, Shirley-San is the speed devil, Hartman is very lazy, and Miyafuji is the strong heart girl that will do anything to save her friends. I do have to say though a lot of these personalities seem a bit generic but at least there is a variety to it-The Action: The battles with the Neuroi are just fantastic and show how teamwork can be portrayed as. It also shows how Miyafuji is evolving in her skill set-The Comedy: Again, need I say anything about this?-A simple yet great story. This pretty much is kinda like a Rocky story. A person who is a underdog in her class goes out to show the world what she can do and as a result it earns her recognition. It also shows some training moments almost exactly like Rocky, except its not Apollo Creed she's not facing. It also explains her feelings towards a certain Neuroi and to show that not everyone in the same grouping is bad. Its a bit simple though, nothing complex like Black Rock Shooter (TV).Overall: 9. Its a great show with likeable characters, great story, good comedy and action and its an overall great show. You won't regret watching this show.

Everyone else, I\'d say give it a try! :)For the first 2 or 3 episodes, the biggest question in my mind was ""where are their pants?"" I could not get over the fact that about 90% of girls wore panties, bikini bottoms, or school swimsuits under there uniform top....and that\'s about it.  However, the story is actually good, so you will actually end up forgetting about the unnecessarily often pantie shots.Story - 9The story is very interesting. It puts you...in the mind of Sky Girls, but was pulled off so well that you don\'t mind the similarities.Art - 9The characters are your average characters. When you have an anime with a mostly all girl cast, the characteristics of the girls are always similar between all the shows. There wasn\'t anything special, but it was very well drawn.........ok, but I did have one little issue. I forgot this was going to be ecchi, so I was not mentally prepared for some of what I saw. It was mostly panty, a few boobs, the occasional buttock, lots of crack, and there were 2 or 3 full on nude shots of the most private are of a women\'s body :) But the story is so good that it\'s easily overlooked (for those that don\'t want to see). And also, unlike most fan service anime, the boobies are a reasonable size.Sound - 9I was ok with there voices, which is usually one of the things to what I am most attentive and critical, when it comes to anime. The music was good, even though I skipped the opener and ending every time, LOL!Character - 9I feel like I\'ve seen some of these characters before. Look wise, some were similar to others in other anime, but there were a few that had their own looks....but characteristically, they all remind me of characters I\'ve seen before. It\'s 12 ep show, so you don\'t get to know the girls as much as you would like to, however :)Enjoyment - 9Once one gets past all the fan service (if you aren\'t into that kind of thing), then this show is easy to enjoy :) I do recommend it to anyone! Unless you absolutely hate fan service, you will love this show ;DSo Overall, it\'s a 9!It\'s a really good show; you should try it! :D in the mind of Sky Girls, but was pulled off so well that you don\'t mind the similarities.Art - 9The characters are your average characters.

It has since been adapted into light novels, manga, anime and video games. The first anime series was brought to us by Gonzo. You may remember them from their work on Gantz, Brave Story, Bakuretsu Tenshi, Basilisk & Zettai Boei Leviathan, just to name some of them I've reviewed. So, how does this one compare to the others? Let's delve into it and see.Story:Strike Witches is set in an alternate world where an enigmatic enemy called the Neuroi has appeared and started attacking people. Humanity's best line of defense is a group...of young girls, most of whom range in age from twelve to sixteen, with magical powers. These are the titular witches. With the background stuff out of the way, our story proper opens with fourteen year old Miyafuji getting approached by one of the few characters who isn't disturbingly young, Major Sakamoto Mio. Sakamoto wants to recruit her for the Witches but Miyafuji refuses, not wanting to use her powers for violence. Things change, because the setup is so obvious that of course they do, when Miyafuji receives a letter from her deceased father, the man who designed the “brooms” that the witches use to fly through the sky. She reluctantly agrees to go with Sakamoto.Let's start with what's wrong with the series. The biggest thing is that it wastes a lot of time on really disturbing fan-service scenes. Keep in mind, most of the major characters are twelve to sixteen years old. There are only three of eleven who are adults. And I thought Devil Hunter Yohko was bad about sexualising a young girl, which it is but at least she's not twelve nor did they have an episode about undergarment pilfering. What were they thinking? The series also doesn't fully develop its aspects that have potential. There are some interesting ideas that get brought up but never fully taken advantage of. The stuff with the girls trying to unravel the truth about the Neuroi is really interesting, but they only give you a small chunk of it. I guess showing a twelve year old in the bath was more important. Way to keep things the complete opposite of classy and to have your priorities completely ass backwards at the same time. I'm sure the multi-tasking was very hard. Maybe they're saving it for the sequel, which wouldn't be a problem if they at least gave you something compelling in the meantime as opposed to really sick fan-service involving girls who are way too young for that shit.To the series' credit, it does have some legitimately good stuff too. When the focus is on the characters, rather than the characters' underage bodies, it has some really good moments. The story proper, in spite of being filler heavy, is legitimately interesting and the last couple episodes are actually really strong. I like that they start things out looking like it's just going to be a monster of the week type thing but quickly start introducing plot elements that move it beyond that, even if they don't take full advantage of their potential. The story elements for the major story had a lot of really good ideas that could have made for a really compelling work if not for all the sleaziness.Characters:This is an area where I'll give Strike Witches credit. In spite of having almost as many major characters as they have episodes, they manage to flesh them out pretty well and there are some really good character moments and interactions. Unfortunately, the villains aren't particularly compelling. You know that there's more to them then is readily apparent and there are some interesting bits to go with it, but it's not fully realised. If only they'd had something pointless and disgusting to cut out, like fan-service scenes of barely pubescent girls. Then they might have been able to go somewhere with it. Oh wait... they did. They chose to keep the fan-service scenes instead.Art:There are a lot of issues with the art. For one thing, most of our heroines don't wear pants or anything that covers their legs. Instead, we get shirts and panties. They fly around in the air at high velocities, how do their nethers not get really cold and uncomfortable? Now, you might say “But Ktulu, they use magic. Isn't it possible that their magic regulates their body temperature?” Which might be a fair point, except that several of them actually talk about being cold during the panty pilfering episode. Because a single pair of panties was so much protection, apparently. You might shift to “well, maybe the lack of fabric helps their flying units work.” Except that they show three of the girls actually covering their legs and it works out just fine for them. You might also wonder if, maybe, their machines heat up a lot and it's more comfortable. The problem is that they wear the same outfits when they're on the ground and in the air. No, these outfits are because some sick bastard wanted to see barely pubescent girls in their panties.The outfits would be bad enough by themselves, but the series really pushes the sleaziness bar by showing these girls, most of whom are twelve to sixteen (I can't emphasise that fact enough), completely starkers. There's a continuing tradition in this series of unnecessary group bath scenes involving full breasts, nipples included. Did you want to see a twelve year old's breasts? You're probably replying in the negative since you're sane, but this series will show you anyway. Now, I will be fair to the series. It does have really good action sequences and the designs of the Neuroi are pretty cool. They also did a pretty decent job with the background scenery.Sound:Here's another area where I'll give the series quite a bit of credit. The cast does do well in their roles. Tanaka Rie and Ohashi Ayuru in particular but there aren't any bad performances by any means. The music is also nicely done. I'll give Nagaoka Seikou credit on that one.Ho-yay:There's quite a bit of les-yay in Strike Witches. Miyafuji has a thing for Lynne. At one point she even has what is heavily implied to be a sex dream about her, and there are certainly indications that the feeling is mutual. Perrine explicitely has a crush on Major Sakamoto. Barkhorn and Hartmann seem to have a romance going. Eila and Sanya definitely have a romance going, and I will say that the stuff between the two of them is absolutely adorable and, surprisingly for this series, unsexualised. Lucchini gropes the other girls on multiple occasions, Shirley taking the brunt of it. There are also some moments where Minna and Sakamoto seem to have a thing. So, the ho-yay factor is an 8/10. Expect a lot of les-yay.Final Thoughts:Strike Witches could have been a good series. Possibly even really good. It has some strong story elements and characters. It does really well with action sequences and the vocal cast is solid. Unfortunately, it's held back by an absurd level of sleaziness. It wastes time that could have been spent on plot or strengthening the characters with barely pubescent girl fan-service and it makes it a really uncomfortable series to watch at times. Does that aspect make it a bad series? No, but it certainly has a severe detrimental effect on it. If you can tolerate the exploitative shit, and that's a big if, you might enjoy it. If you're an ill-supervised horny young teenager who likes girls, then this might just be for you. Seek it out, Young Lady. For me, the positive aspects and negative ones do balance pretty evenly so my rating is a 5/10. Maybe I'll look at Strike Witches 2 at some point, either because I get curious or because someone requests it, but for next week I'll look at Choujigen Game Neptune: The Animation.

IntroductionStrike witches is a show that is very appealing to the general /a/ masses because it contains all the ""best"" parts of shitty animu. But before we get into that, let\'s talk about the characters themselves. The show dumps a metric fuck ton of characters on your lap that are just a name and a face that you\'re expected to recognize and love immediately. Even after watching the most part of season 1, I can\'t even name a single character without watching an episode over again. Each character has bland personalities that too easily fit how they look. The one with an eye patch...is strong and wise, the young ones are stupid and bubbly, and the oldest and most endowed one always pokes fun at the younger ones. Enough of my banter, let\'s dive in.II. The ""Best"" BitsAs I said before, the show contains all the best parts of shitty anime. First to the characters appearance. This is what would attract people to the show, and possibly keep them watching this shit. There\'s the entire spectrum of builds and body types for all newfags to fap over : Lolis, huge tits, and ass as far as the eye can see. During the coarse of each episode, there\'s more tits and shots of girls asses than a maxim magazine and they don\'t wear pants. But oh no, that\'s not all. They\'re also all Cat-girl Witches! I\'m being entirely fucking serious. When they don their magical flying legs, they pop out a pair of cat ears and a tail and power the legs with magic. Besides the characters, the show also panders /k/ and other military / WWII buffs. The guns they use while flying (so cat-girl-witch-soldiers?) are all guns that any CoD zombies player could drool over.III. Episode StructureBelieve it or not, there is some structure to each episode. I never said it was good, but there is an obvious flow in each of the episodes. They generally start off with a waking up or morning scene. The girls all do remedial shit like brush their teeth, eat and clean. Fun. There are occasionally some ""plot development"" scenes and flashbacks, but nothing to really make this more than a weak, drawn out hentai made for daytime television. Then it gets to the good stuff : girls playing with each others tits. Whether they\'re on the beach, doing chores, or training, they play with each others sugoi tits till the cows come home. There are also frequent bathing / sauna scenes with pointless full frontal nudity and the girls talking about how one of the others is so hawt. It\'s not like they have shower scenes in one episode to pander the fans like some other, more respectable shows. It\'s almost every goddamn episode they have the girls fully bearing themselves. The circle jerk comes to a subtle end when the cookie-cutter enemies show up.  The enemies in question are the worst fucking enemies ever. They can only be described as ""black and red honeycombed shapes"". They all shoot red lasers of undefined power and have armor that is too strong for their guns, rendering them basically useless. One of them is even just a Rubik\'s Cube that splits into all the individual squares. Fucking original amiright? It\'s not until one of the characters uses some Deus Ex Macnina to kill them that they can finally destroy the damn things. Why are these enemies attacking? Well let me tell you : No reason whatsoever. They just attack something for no obviously foreseeable goal besides firing lasers around.IV. ConclusionThis entire show has doomed itself to Inuyasha Syndrome. No matter what happens in each episode, nothing happens. No overlying story arcs to speak of here. I\'d say that it\'s a slice of life anime, but the issue is, it\'s not. It\'s just hentai modified for the general viewing public. It gets into your pants before even touching your heartstrings, even in the most sad or happy scenes.

This series was just unbearable.It takes place on an alternate earth in World War II-era and focuses on a government-assembled air force squad formally named ""Strike Witches."" It may seem interesting on the surface, but what we expected was far from what we got.I am completely aware that this anime was heavy on the fan-service. But when the fan-service eclipses any traces of intended plot, the series will drag on for what feels like eternity. Every time I thought that things were about to get interesting, the creators instead slapped me with more insignificant loli ecchi. You can...do fan-service right, but the creators in question exceeded the acceptable limit ten-fold. Strike Witches beat the dead horse and inconveniently used characters that could only realistically consent in third-world countries. Eventually you come to a point where you sense the disappointment radiating from your deceased ancestors and you will find yourself contemplating whether or not this life on earth is all that there is.There is definitely a target-audience for this type of series, but I just want to point out that if every girl was replaced with a middle-aged man, there would be a unanimous distaste for the progression of the plot. If you\'ve been challenged to try out a fan-service anime like I was, stay far away from this one.To conclude, I really wouldn\'t recommend this anime to my worst enemy. I gave it a 2 because despite everything terrible about it, there was a lot of production and effort that went into this. But still, save yourself the 5 hours. do fan-service right, but the creators in question exceeded the acceptable limit ten-fold.

But still, save yourself the 5 hours.', 'Strike Witches is one of those animes that are so bad that it makes you wonder if Japan holds a yearly competition to find the worst piece of work in existence. Strike Witches is 2008\'s would-be winner, hands-down.Now let\'s get down to business--major points only:THE GOOD:Many will point you to the excessive ecchi scenes and tell you this anime is trash. This is not true.The fact is, the single redeeming factor in this anime is the panty shots. They are drawn and animated with extreme detail and grace so that the viewer immediately knows that the creators put a considerable amount of work into them....Too bad nothing else in Strike Witches is worth noting--not even the battle sequences, for which there is maybe one or two nice, though unfortunately short, ones.THE BAD:The story is about as predictable and idiotic as they come. It\'s the type of story we must bear with--to try with all of our might not to surf reddit on the side, lest we gouge our eyes out with a rusty spoon. The ludicrous gear invented by possibly the most moronic of engineers that somehow drives the existence of the Strike Witches may be enough to turn some away. Giant robots would have been better.The plot? Easy: we are witches (magical girls), and we are fighting aliens and there may or may not be a twist at the very end. Please don\'t fall asleep.THE UGLY:The most dreadful part of this anime is the characters.Miyafuji, Yoshika is about as annoying as they come. She is the ""I want to protect everyone pacifist with uncommonly strong feelings"" type that seems unfortunately common in most Animes.Strike Witches takes it one step further and makes her out to be some kind of angel (yes, she\'s that flawless). Everyone else is just there to slow her down. Strike Witches pretty much becomes a show about a Japanese Loli angel going about unleashing her latent awesomeness at key moments and fixing everyone\'s problems with her feelings.By the end of Strike Witches, it is clear that Miyafuji could probably win the war by herself and achieve world peace if it wasn\'t for her strong feelings and her annoying comrades/higher-ups. Her personality is pure, unadulterated molasses, flawless to the core. It\'s acceptable to some, but many may want something more than unchanging perfection so that we might witness something grow, or watch more than a single angle for the duration of 12 episodes.Too bad the creators didn\'t stop at Miyafuji. They decide to inflict upon the viewers another near-angel type character: Sakamoto, Mio.Sakamoto, Mio is seemingly the only other character that doesn\'t do too much to get in the way of Miyafuji\'s greatness. She is equipped with the most annoying laugh in the show and a personality that can only be described as strong-willed but with hidden super feelings on reserve. Sakamoto is the one who has discovered Miyafuji and wants train her and watch her ""grow"" to surpass her. She is in the end, without fault. Her personality is infused with enough sugar to make the sweet-tooth puke. While she isn\'t even half as annoying as Miyafuji, she still ranks as the second worst character in the show.All other characters are there for comic relief, ecchi scene composition, and getting in the way of Japanese Loli Angel Miyafuji so as to drive the ""plot"". They follow typical character models, which for some viewers may become a tad tedious, but their dialogue is thankfully terse and useless anyway. They can be grouped into the the ""white loli girls"" or ""evil white higher-ups"" categories. They are ostensibly essential.Overall, one must have a stomach for this type of holier-than-thou type story in order to truly enjoy Strike Witches. The ecchi, while serving its purpose in pulling the Anime back into the realm of the watchable, may not be enough for some. Watch at your own risk.

I have whatched the seiries over and over so the story to me is very strong and clear even in the infamous episode 7 it shows the girls running around stealing each others pantsu very nice I might add but mind blowing with the extra uncensored you can get it at gogoanime .com minus the space just search up strike witches there. Anyway it shows some comedy and personality of the strike witches story wise sometimes this is forgotten amoung the panties flying this way and that. There is also some strory builders at the begining and end.The art by gonzo is extremly good, sound qaulity was perfect, as i kinda said befor you fall in love with the character and get to know them all very well, I cant say how much I enjoy this andnow if youve read this far you will too, overall a great peice of work yummylishous (if thats a word) and absolutly the most epic thing ever. different parts of the world (i.e. Scotland/England, Japan, Russia, Germany, Finland, America, Italy, ect.) one for each personal preference in body type and most preferences in attiude tundere, shy, brat, lazy, uncaring, sometimes a mix of multiple, fighting alien crafts saving the world all while (prepare your mind) wearing no pants........mindf**k.The only small downside is not a flawless story because even i\'ll admit all the wonderful fanservice does cloud over some of the story but very little.

Yes, go watch it. No, it’s not for perverts… sometimes…The Synopsis gives a pretty good synopsis. Year 1944. Instead of WW2, we have the war against alieny Neuroi. And who we should send to fight them? Mahou Shoujo of course. Equipped with machine guns and “brooms”, magical lolis sacrifice their lives to save humanity.12 episodes = 5 episodes of fanservice, 4 episodes of feels and 3 episodes of plot. Well… as close to feels as you can get in this kind of anime. Plot isn’t elaborate, but it fits the setting… which is loli magical girls with machine guns again, so… yeah....It’s anime alright. It’s japanese alright. What you will see here is different from western cartoons. They deal with nudity… differently. But we’re adults here, right? (R+ means something kiddo) Maybe you want to watch it for fan service, enjoy it then. But if you’re used to these kind of things and treat a naked body like something regular, Strike Witches is great. I really enjoyed it. Especially the comedy parts (If you can see the jokes through the bewbs). It’s also about friendship, striving to be better and sometimes being sad over what’s lost in the war. There’s even little mystery, but that part wasn’t really completed, maybe in season 2.“It’s been 5 minutes without panty shots. Am I still watching Strike Witches?” That’s what you can think about halfway through. I didn’t like panties thrown at my face every few seconds, but that was only in the beginning. I believe 6th episode opens the part, where fanservice is more moderate. That’s where I really enjoyed it. And I hope you enjoy Strike Witches too. It’s anime alright. It’s japanese alright.

"", 'Opinions on Strike Witches are quite varried.  Among those who found fault with the show, there are some common complaints (fanservice and lack of central plot, to name a few).  While the series certainly isn\'t perfect, it has the potential to be very enjoyable if approached with the right frame of mind.  I almost missed out on this show after reading some of the negative reviews, but I am glad that I gave it a chance.  The show already has plenty of reviews describing the art, sound, etc., so this review is structured to address some of the common complaints from...a different standpoint.  If you keep these points in mind while watching, you will be less dissapointed when the show doesn\'t go the way you expect.Note: This review actually applies to both season 1 and 2, but is spoiler free.Fanservice.There\'s no denying it--Strike Witches has a lot of fanservice.  However, it is generally tasteful, and I use that term loosely, especially when compared with some of the other animes out there. Yes, there are an abundance of low camera angles, but most of these are easy to ignore.  Most episodes have a bath scene, but these are mostly about humor rather than naked women.  If you find nudity, the occasional upskirt shot, and some yuri themes morally objectionable, than Strike Witches is probably not the show for you.  However, if you can get past it, there is SO MUCH MORE to this series than fanservice.Central, underlying plot.There isn\'t one--Strike Witches is episodic.  It is an alternative history series where a mysterious alien force attacks Earth at what would otherwise have been the outset of WWII.  That\'s it.  From here on theshow is essentially a slice-of-life comedy.  While the lack of a plot definately makes it an outlyer for anime, this concept shouldn\'t seem so strange, especially to American audiences--think of it as a sitcom.Alien invaders are never explained or developed.You will never learn who the invaders really are or why they attacked.  I can see why this would bother a lot of folks, but remember that this is really a slice-of-life comedy.  Rather than being slice-of-everyday life, it is slice-of-teenage female pilots fighting aliens-life.  Also, this is the 1940s.  Even today, if we were attacked by aliens would we really know anything about them?  I argue that it is more realistic not to ever find out details about the aliens.  I would be more upset if a Japanese Jeff Goldblum showed up to explain everything in five minutes, with no logical explanation as to how he acquired this knowledge.Now, for a caveat: towards the end of season 1 the producers will tease you by making you think there is more to the aliens than meets the eye, and that this will somehow be explained.  Even in season 2 this never happens, and it is kind of annoying.  As with a lot of anime, sometimes you just have to go with it.  Remember, there is NO DEEPER PLOT.Lack of Character Development.Yes and no.  Over the course of the two seasons, every member of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing gets an episode solely devoted to somehow expanding the character, whether through backstory or through growth.  I really enjoyed this aspect of the show, but it is fair to say that, even with the dedicated episode, some of the characters never really develop and stay kind of flat.  However, let\'s cut the writers some slack.  In two seasons there are only 24 episodes, and there are 11 pilots.  There just isn\'t enough time to really develop all of them, but the ones who do receive focus are very well developed.""Plot"" holes.This is anime--expect them.I hope this gives you another perspective on Strike Witches.  Like I said at the beginning, you must approach this series with the proper mindset.  It is episodic, it is silly, and there is no deeper plot or major plot twists.  Even when things happen that may lead you to believe otherwise, trust me, there are no plot twists (you can\'t twist something that isn\'t there to begin with).  If you keep these things in mind, it will help you to just sit back and enjoy the show.  It is very funny and exciting.Side note:  I strongly recommend reading up on WWII history a little bit before watching this show.  While not required for enjoyment, you will catch a lot of nuances that may otherwise go unnoticed.  You will also realize that the writers actaully put a LOT more thought into this show than just what color each girl\'s panties ought to be.Specific recommended topics (in order of relevance):(1) WWII top aces from each country (for specific aces look at the character pages on the Strike Witches myAnimeList page)(2) WWII-era fighter aircraft and weaponry from each country(3) The Battle of Britain(4) Imperial Japanese Navy sea vessles (specifically Akagi and Yamato) a different standpoint.

While the anime began with an interesting premise of combating an unknown force with magic and modern weaponry, any merit that has is quickly dismantled by the fact this show is an excuse to look at small girls with their pants off.  Strike Witches cannot even afford to have it's female characters wear skirts. Instead all the women wear dark black rubber panties that are several sizes too small for them. In the first episode alone there are seven unnecessary pantie shots - yes I counted. The blatant sexual nature of...the show pummels the small amount of good that the art and premise bring to the table under the weight of all the perverts masturbating furiously to this ridiculous joke of an anime. the show pummels the small amount of good that the art and premise bring to the table under the weight of all the perverts masturbating furiously to this ridiculous joke of an anime."", ""The first thing that you notice about this anime is that none of the girls wear pants.  It seems that panties = pants.  Multiple things about the story just do not make sense. The time period is 1944, but the technology does not match.  For example how they fly.  A device that go's on the legs and is powered my magic, while at the same time it acts as if it were a fighter plane from that era.  They can use magic shields, but the weapons that are used are guns from that era also.  That is probably what...the creator was going for, so ....... yeah.  I don't want to keep ranting on so i'll stop.  To put it simply this is a total fan service anime.Very nice artwork.  Other than all the magical stuff, everything just give off the vibe that you really are in 1944.  The cars, train, ships, uniforms, even the base.  (can't forget the girls too)  All the little things really do make this anime that much better.Not much to say about the sound.  The strikers sound like old fighter planes, guns sound like how you think they should sound, the alarm that sounds when the enemy is attacking, all of which really help set the mood.Now on to the main focus and the biggest selling point that the anime has to offer, the characters.  All of the witches seem to be fairly young.  They can only use magic powers when they... transform?  Well not really transform, but they get car ears and a tail.  Did I mention they walk around half naked everywhere?  Anyway, non stop ecchi action.  Multiple naked scenes.  Although I said this anime is mainly about the characters not much info is given about them.  Everything is based around sex appeal.Fairly good anime, if you like the ecchi genre.  If not I say you should stay away because that is all the anime is about.  It is not one of a kind, but it is something different i'll give it that.  Slightly boring because all the fights are very repetitive.  In the end I kept watching because of the half naked girls, and that is probably why you will too.

The main characters are unlikable. Yoshika is unbelievable as the hero, Mio Sakamoto though a mostly like character has a laugh that grates on your soul and then there is Perrine after a few episodes my wife who likes most everything about anime was jumping off the...couch screaming for someone to punch her in the face.The secondary characters make the show, there interactions are fun and thought out and enjoyable to watch.

All the pantyshots were made up for by the Pechapai, school swimsuit-clad kemonomimi protagonist. I also liked the English girl, half because I'm English, half because of her oversized gun, because she does have the the largest gun compared to size of the character.

Our only hope is the Witches (loli that has some kind of super power) to drive a flying machine to save the day haha.The Art is very good, everything is bright, colorful and beautiful (especially the pantsu).

To which I have to say, ""What the hell are you on about that is this anime\'s one redeeming factor?""Strike Witches is easily the most overly mechanical show I\'ve seen in a long time, and that is not a compliment. To showcase exactly what I mean, the following is a list of overly mechanical, nonsensical issues that take place in the first episode alone:1. Nothing important happens...until our main character decides to dump an entire expositional onslaught upon her best friend about her dead dad, which is completely nonsensical because why wouldn\'t her best friend already know all this given that her dad died many years ago, and its too much information to just be a passing mention. It\'s obvious this scene only exists to give our character a ""want"" (the driving force behind her actions).2. During this same scene she mentions how much she hates the war because it took her dad from her, but her feelings about the war are completely irrational. She wants to do what her dad told her, which was basically to save people, but despite this she hates the idea of fighting in the war, because it killed her dad, like not fighting in it is somehow going to make the war not exist? It\'s a completely irrational and illogical way of thinking, which was clearly constructed just to create a point for internal conflict.3. A character who wants to recruit the MC into fighting in the war happens to be spying on them during this conversation, and it just so happens that the cart they are riding on crashes. This crash gives the MCs best friend a completely illogical injury--she was thrown from a cart into the grass and somehow her chest was bleeding after? Like, I could understand a broken bone or something, but whatever, not the core issue here. Beside the illogicalness of her injury, the real kicker is that this is so obviously done only for the purpose of showcasing the girls powers in front of the recruiter.4. After this a letter just so happens to arrive from her dead dad, which JUST SO HAPPENS to have a picture in it, and in the picture is the girl who was trying to recruit the MC, WHAT AN AMAZING COINCIDENCE. Okay, okay, I\'ll chill out with the caps lock. Point is, this is the most overly orchestrated bullshit to force the main character to come to the conclusion to go with the recruiter even though she, ""isn\'t going to help fight a war"" which she\'s definitely going to end up fighting in. I can go on with more examples, but let\'s just skip that and talk about how Strike Witches scores in each category:Story: 2, The start of the story is very similar to a hero\'s journey story. Basically, the first couple steps of a hero\'s journey simplifies down to: a hero(es) has a cry for adventure, they\'re reluctant at first, but they ultimately overcome this reluctance, and they set out on their journey. This is exactly how the first episode goes, but after that the story-telling shifts to an episodic style with every episode focusing on ""building"" the character of a particular member of the Strike Witches (plot twist, all of the characters are exceptionally flat). Last couple episodes switch back to a linear story-telling style, where you actually need to see the episodes in order to understand what\'s going on (well, kinda, truth is every ""plot development"" has one thing in common, which is that none of them are threaded through the story in a way that makes you go, ""oh that made sense"". No, instead, they\'re just randomly happening, because fuck foreshadowing). Small example: there\'s a scene where someone says, ""but who would do this"", and then another character is like, ""I can think of one guy"", then proceeds to mention someone we\'ve never heard of before, who (I know epic plot-twist) ends up being the villain of the season, woooo.(PS. I actually thought the strike gear was kinda cool, but I can\'t help but feel like they made no sense and weren\'t explained in any actual depth, oh wait, that\'s because all of that is true...)Art: 7, I\'m not sure why there\'s a law in the Strike Witches universe that all women must never wear pants, but I\'m for it! All joking aside, this is clearly another OVERLY MECHANICAL decision in order to provide the viewer with an absurd amount of fan service. Ultimately, while I felt it worth discussing, this doesn\'t actually have any weight in my scoring; this scoring in fact is completely representative of the overall quality and consistency of the art work, which is fairly standard, but satisfactory.Sound: 4, While generic, a few of the OSTs served as a redeeming factor here, but both the OP and ED were so bad that I couldn\'t even listen the full way through once, and every time after that, I immediately hit fast forward the second I heard them start. A couple VA\'s were decent, the MC\'s VA was annoying as hell and if I ever have to hear Sakamoto\'s fake laugh again I might have to commit sudoku (yes, I\'m memeing, calm down).Character: 2, Strike Witches has two fundamental problems. First there\'s like 11 ""main"" characters and 12 episodes, and while it\'s not impossible to write a story with 11 strong characters in that amount of time, this story fails to make a single one of them more dynamic that a cardboard cutout. Second, they\'re all ridiculously troupe-based, and even though none of them have actual character arcs, they all say they\'ve changed a lot because of the MC. The truth is that the writer just wanted that overly idealized protagonist who just magically changes the people around them because they are so cool and awesome.Enjoyment: 5, This number feels like it might be inflated, because I\'ve basically forked over some pity points to Strike Witches because it gave me ironic enjoyment. Don\'t get me wrong, there was plenty to be annoyed by, but the level of nonsensical bullshit that Strike Witches achieves is actually kind of enjoyable ... to make fun of. It\'s definitely not something I\'ll ever rewatch, but I\'m actually tempted to watch season 2 just to continue making fun of it.Overall 4, I didn\'t know much about Strike Witches going into it, and my expectations were anything but high, but somehow this still fell below them. I don\'t really want to quote this again, but don\'t listen to anyone saying, ""Please don\'t say it is bad just because you find girls in panties horrifying"", because Strike Witches is very bad and the only way I can think you might be able to milk even an ounce of enjoyment out of it is because either you really want to make fun of a bad anime or because you really want to see girls in panties. until our main character decides to dump an entire expositional onslaught upon her best friend about her dead dad, which is completely nonsensical because why wouldn\'t her best friend already know all this given that her dad died many years ago, and its too much information to just be a passing mention.

It\'s a fun show that has a pretty diverse cast, some interesting fanservice choices, but albeit is a forgettable experience.The story of Strike Witches is a definite example of ""playing it safe"".  We get a few intro episodes that do a decent job introducing the world, premise, and squad-mates of our MC, several episodes in the middle to further develop relationships and highlight some tension, and finally a ""big bad"" is introduced near the end (as...well as a poor attempt at some political backstabbing) to cement our casts values in one last big battle.It\'s not a bad story by any means, and can actually be quite fun at times, but it is certainly not the most memorable story I have watched.I did have a gripe with how the show tried to convey it\'s atmosphere at times. It is established early on that the Strike Witches are a magical special ops team solely designed to combat the worldwide threat, but there seemed to be very little structure at all when reinforcing that military mindset.  The girls adhere to an extremely loose military protocol, and almost no penalties are administered for mistakes/in-fighting/or insubordination. Our MC does get in quite a bit of trouble near the end, but even then it feels like an underwhelming punishment. And that punishment (and its consequences) are immediately swept away by the appearance of the ""big bad"" in those final few episodes.The show did a solid job of reminding you that the world was at war against a common enemy, but would then alleviate that tension with some awkwardly placed nudity (Group bath scenes appear frequently during ""heavier"" episodes).  This doesn\'t necessarily detract from the overall experience, since none of the girls (even background characters in episode 1) wear pants, but it can be a bit jarring for your average watcher.The animation is actually a point that really bounced around for me throughout the show.  Some episodes/scenes were incredibly well animated, with characters running, jumping, or flying at a much smoother frame rate than a show of that era would believe you to have.  Unfortunately these scenes stand to highlight how average the rest of the animation is, with an excellent shot of a character running to greet her friends followed by a rather cheap-looking shot of everyone standing around in the background while only one character moves at a time.  Keep in mind none of these excellent scenes are even used as high-points in episodes, they are usually done during in-between shots (I am not sure if that is the right phrase to use, I\'m talking about scenes in-between important ones, sort of build-up shots).The cast of characters in Strike Witches suffers from the typical problem that a show like this (One with 8+ characters to flesh out) in that a lot of the supporting cast seem way more interesting than our lead.  Because our MC is a fresh faced recruit, she spends a lot of her time being barked at, or trained, while the rest of the cast is able to show off their individual personalities, relationships, and specialties.  Of course our MC is given preference over other girls when it comes to missions or important events, and while this is standard fare for a show of this type, it is still a bit tiring to see an excellent cast of characters pushed to the way side.If you are looking for a fun, easy-going, ecchi (Nudity does appear in the DVD release), action-oriented ship-girl anime than Strike Witches could definitely scratch the itch you are looking for but it will be a temporary fix at best.  Be prepared to struggle to complete the show, and want to find something a bit more memorable to watch almost as soon as it is over to scratch the itch anew. well as a poor attempt at some political backstabbing) to cement our casts values in one last big battle.It\'s not a bad story by any means, and can actually be quite fun at times, but it is certainly not the most memorable story I have watched.I did have a gripe with how the show tried to convey it\'s atmosphere at times.

The story focuses on an alternate take of the world circa WWIIish when aliens called Neuroi invade the Earth. In this world, the world's only hope of survival depends on the Strike Witches, a group of women (girls really...) who utilize their magical abilities to power propeller-propulsion systems (Striker units) mounted on their feet. If you've heard of Kantai, this is the airborne equivalent of that.Like in Kantai, all the important characters are female and a large majority of the show focuses on a...single newbie, in this case the protagonist Miyafuji. In this way, it sort of feels like Sora no Woto, with a bit more Shoujo-ai. However, the later part of the series becomes strangely plot-based leading to bizarre encounters that are not quite explicated enough.So what is this series and what is its target audience? It mixes a bit of action, yuri, girl-bonding, and a lot of ecchi sans the normal harem male character. Therefore, if you're into girls in borderline-H situations or girls with guns, then by all means dig in. If you're looking for a compelling character development or story, this one is iffy.Animation:The most memorable (good or bad?) thing about this series is the character styling and design. I guess because the striker packs are mounted on their feet, the girls can't wear long skirts or pants, therefore all Witches pretty much are always just in panties or tights. This series is definitely one of the more daring ones for its time, though I might have unknowingly picked up the DVD version. You have ~14-18 year old girls that are often found topless (and even occasionally bottomless).As for the general animation style, it's fairly typical in styling, though backgrounds are notably plain and occasionally blurry. There is also an abnormally high amount of CGI though it isn't too painful most of the time, probably because you're looking at something else on the screen...Despite the setting being in a war, like in Sora no Woto, there aren't a lot of signs of imminent battle or horrific signs of warfare. Battles are basic with many scenes just showing twirling contrails. There's occasional blood but nothing of an overly serious nature.There are a LOT of girls in this series, and luckily most of them are visually distinguishable.Sound:The OP is a fitting, if slightly light tune, though not my favorite melody. The ED is likewise lighthearted and likewise not a terribly good melody. The BGM is fittingly war-like with a heavy emphasis on drums.VAs give each character a fitting persona, despite most of them having minimal air time (11 main girls for 12 episodes...). As for FX, I'm not a terrible fan of propeller blades so I eventually got annoyed at the sound.Story:As I explained in the overview, the story in Strike Witches is a bit of a flop. After Miyafuji gets recruited, the series becomes episodic as Miyafuji befriends each of the other witches and learns about their strenghs/past. After a total fan-service episode (ep 7), the series decides to get a bit more serious and you get a really rushed rising action leading to a very contrived climax.While there were a lot of interesting elements added in the last few episodes, many aspects were poorly explained, and too many other aspects completely unaddressed. I assume the second series will clarify some of these aspects.Character:Despite the short introductions, I actually liked the personality given to many of the witches, as well as their interactions, which were sometimes borderline yuri and other times just comical. You get the sense that there is indeed growth and development as the series progresses.However, a lot of the goodwill created in the early episodes is eroded by the seemingly random antagonist introduced with barely any background near the very end of the show. Ignoring this interruption, however, the characters are well explored considering the length of the show.Value:Strike Witches is definitely not for everyone, and is especially NSFW. It's a unique series that combines historic/sci-fi with loli aspects. It isn't a very good story but hey you're not going to be starving for fan service after this. This is a casual watch that will literally force certain body parts in your face.

But If you don't care about being called a loli then keep reading. (I bet half of you are AFK right now arent you)Starting with plot, I wont give a synopsis since If you scroll like for two seconds up you'll see it, but basiclly it was good.While it does kinda start of a little slow, it picks up fairly early enough.Also, the whole mechamasume thing was quite original & I liked the...whole Idea of the witches fighting in a war against some evil being, it was original for me at least which Is why I loved it.It also threw alot of twists at you that worked quite well in the second half of the series.  Though im not really sure why they have no trousers. (trousers=pants in america) But its so lol'zy I have not need to question it XDThe characters were great & fun (again with the loli jokes) all of the witches had their own unique personally though all very likable & memorable, Its hard to hate any of them by the time you finish this series & you'll most likly have a favourite to. Even the side characters e.g the proffesor has alot of mystery behind him, though still cool.Along with the men members of the war were cool for the brief part of the series they were in, though the ship crew members were meh, they were really just there for being there.Art was really nice, I now in the dvd they fix up the animation which is great, though even without it was very vibrant & I don't really know much to say other than it was pretty good & also they character designs were very likable & fit well, all which is sometimes rare. (I is a sucker for them little girls)Sound was fine, some epic backround music & also buitiful tracks in certain scenes, also the I really liked the Op & ED themes (both on my Ipod were they belong) not the best music ever but still really nice.Overall, it comes down to my enjoyment (now im really sounding like a loli) Im not going to be nit picky however admitidly theres really nothing that I hated though one thing to note is that theres a fair share of fan service, though I found it more funny than discusting (unlike a certain servebot I know) in fact I diden't really find it to overshadow anything.(note for loli's:The DVD Version is Uncensored, half of you just came am I right?)In the end, it was highly enjoyable & reccomendable & I can't wait for season 2 hoping it's just as good if not Better!! That's my 1st Anime review, I hope you enjoyed. Goodbye & sionare (hur, hur, hur its funny because they both mean the same thing, am I cool now Giaz!?!?) whole Idea of the witches fighting in a war against some evil being, it was original for me at least which Is why I loved it.It also threw alot of twists at you that worked quite well in the second half of the series.

Even the side characters e.g the proffesor has alot of mystery behind him, though still cool.Along with the men members of the war were cool for the brief part of the series they were in, though the ship crew members were meh, they were really just there for being there.Art was really nice, I now in the dvd they fix up the animation which is great, though even without it was very vibrant & I don't really know much to say other than it was pretty good & also they character designs were very likable & fit well, all which is sometimes rare. (I is a sucker for them little girls)Sound was fine, some epic backround music & also buitiful tracks in certain scenes, also the I really liked the Op & ED themes (both on my Ipod were they belong) not the best music ever but still really nice.Overall, it comes down to my enjoyment (now im really sounding like a loli) Im not going to be nit picky however admitidly theres really nothing that I hated though one thing to note is that theres a fair share of fan service, though I found it more funny than discusting (unlike a certain servebot I know) in fact I diden't really find it to overshadow anything.(note for loli's:The DVD Version is Uncensored, half of you just came am I right?)In the end, it was highly enjoyable & reccomendable & I can't wait for season 2 hoping it's just as good if not Better!! That's my 1st Anime review, I hope you enjoyed.

Now every grammar school boy and girl knows how World War II started, so I won\'t bore you with the details(unless you want me to).  This anime takes the start of WWII and gives it a twist.  I am not very fond of many magical girl anime but this one was well done.  The story is new and inventive.  It takes ideas put in place at the end of WWII and puts them in play to stop an invasion of unknown creatures.  As was most of the equipment used by all...sides at the start of the war nothing would work against this new menace.  One scientist had an idea that was just crazy enough to work.  If I go any farther you will star screaming spoiler so I will move along.  The characters are great.  Based off real aces and pilots from the country that the witches represent.  I am a fan of old war birds but not those who flew them so I don\'t know much about the pilots that the girls are based off of, most of my heroes were ""ground pounders"" and were routinely strafed, bombed and rocketed by these men.  As far as the pants less state of all female characters I can only guess as to the reason but I have to agree with the explanation of ""fan service"" because there really is no other reason.

It can be hard to get into, given what it is - but under the surface it's actually full of redeeming qualities.  Art style and sound design get good marks, and oddly enough, most of the characters (most, I say...) are pretty good, and though the plot is pretty predictable and has been done before, more or less, it still manages to keep itself interesting enough to make you want to see what happens to the characters next.

At this point I feel this show is a complete loss. The show feels like it struggles with what it should be. Ecchi? Military? Magic girl? Unfortunately it dabbles with all of them yet doesn\'t do any of them well. I feel as though the author was new or just trying to ride the waves of similar series that sold well. The show is based on the premise that monsters presumably from another dimension are invading. The world is forced to rely on young witches who display their magic...by popping out various animal ears/tail, and fly around with WWII heavy machine guns, and shoot the enemy down, with endless panty shots.Where are all the pants? The girls in the show never seem to wear more then underwear and shirts. This would be fine if it was some offbeat ecchi comedy however the setup and the punchline never come. The occasional un censored breast shots come once an episode but seem completely out of place. They don\'t serve for some bloody nose joke nor are they necessary for the show itself. It would seem they are only there for some lonely teen to get off on.The voice acting on this feels UN-naturally sub par. Perhaps this was a low budget that had to pick from the leftovers, however the relative tone of all the girls is so similar you cant really decipher one from another with your eyes closed. Looking at the main cast of voice actors I really feel let down. So much talent seems tossed to the wolves.The Characters are each given motivations but none really seem true to their ""tropes"" beliefs, or personal convictions.

Strike Witches sadly, has nothing to offer except poor acting, a really loose plot, no real character development and a whole host of plot holes leaving you scratching your head wondering what you just watched.The art style was about on par with the times (2008 iirc) The soundtrack however was forgettable and didn\'t really fit the show or its theme. However the ABUSE of panty/boob shots as well as above mentioned flaws DE-railed this show for me.  Ecchi can be done in a tasteful way to add to a show or can be the prevailing theme. However this show didn\'t take the tasteful approach and yet it didn\'t really seem like it wanted to be Ecchi either.All in all I Give Strike witches 3/10. It remains somewhat coherent as the story progresses. As well as gives an attempt to fill in the void for certain genres. However this show I fear will be lost in the vast ocean of garbage series.

Such a pity', 'I think Shimada Humikane and company primarily wanted to do one scene: A young Japanese Navy pilot decides to take off from a burning carrier on a suicide mission, and though his commanders try to stop him and there are enemy aircraft littering the skies, somehow he manages to save the ragtag fleet and drive away the attacking enemy.The only problem is, Shimada evidently has a thing for young girls without skirts (if memory serves, he also did the original character designs for Sky Girls, an anime about young girls without skirts flying to defeat enigmatic foes).My primary gripe about Strike Witches is that it...features Japan prominently, but writes everything but the European theater out of a story about World War II. Yup, in order to avoid pissing off the Chinese and Koreans, we\'re just pretending they (along with Latin America, the Middle East, all of Asia aside from Russia, various Pacific islands, and Africa) simply don\'t exist, even though significant parts of the world were affected by the Second World War. And it\'s not like there\'s no opportunity to fight the Neuroi in the Pacific allied with the US Navy, so I believe this to be a deliberate omission. It\'s not nearly as bad as GATE, but reading the premise of the show regarding the Americans really made me think the writers from a country that attacked a sleeping giant and paid the price for it have a serious case of sour grapes. What\'s even more ridiculous about this is, the show is telling another story of that war from the Allied perspective (and in one instance makes an RAF Air Marshal into a moustache-twirling villain). In terms of setting and premise, High School Fleet was a bit more coherent and respectful.So what we have here is a drama with a ""historical"" context that\'s laughably ridiculous, and all of the young girls do not wear skirts and call panties ""trousers"". Yes, drama-- this isn\'t a farcical comedy like Girls und Panzer.So why does this show work? Well, remember that scene I mentioned at the beginning of this review? That\'s why-- the pre-flight drama was so effective, it became parodized in other series. Watching Yoshika fly when everything is stacked against her is probably the biggest reason why people watch this franchise (and it\'s the main reason why Brave Witches didn\'t fare quite as well).The character of Yoshika is equal parts a girl of her time, a determined surgeon, and later, a fighter ace. While the main conflict of the show is between the squadron and a mysterious race of entities called the Neuroi, the early episodes of the show pit Yoshika against squad mates who are hostile towards her or indifferent, mainly members who have a painful past. What\'s really good about the series is that the characters who are the main players in the drama have stories that are in limbo, and Yoshika is just the catalyst they needed to start moving on. The remaining girls are largely comic relief, which is good because we need a balance of conflict and friendship to establish the chemistry not just with Yoshika, but also among the rest of the 501st. The voice cast is where a good deal of resources were spent, as there are veteran actresses like Kaori Nazuka, Sakura Nogawa and Rie Tanaka.The character designs help ensure that each member of the squadron is distinct, and the European members are just a bit stereotypical without resorting to ludicrous designs that involve ringlets. I don\'t know if this production is the first to employ 3D models for the ""aircraft"", but the use of light-emissive materials for the propellers and magic circles is a good touch, reinforcing the fact that the setting isn\'t normal reality/history.In my opinion the soundtrack was what made this show a fun one for me-- like the story premise, this show is the opposite of High School Fleet, well-arranged and balanced despite the full-synth instrumentation. One of the Strike Witches BGM themes begins with a string orchestra spicatto beat that gradually builds up to the full orchestra led by the horns and trumpets, and another (also the ""episode preview"" theme) is a catchy brass fanfare that the violins later join. A quieter but no less important theme starts with pizzicato strings and a woodwind melody/harmony, a perfect accompaniment to a lonely flight scene in the blue sky. What made the soundtrack for me is the sparing use of fully-electronic instruments, which I think they reserved for scenes heavily involving the Neuroi; the scenes that focus on the girls generally use the (synthesized) ""acoustic"" instruments.The opening theme will probably hit you in the face, but I think that\'s largely because the accompaniment is entirely synthesized. The ending featuring the voice cast is all right, but nothing I really cared to listen to 10+ times.So to sum up, a good character show, a premise that\'s iffy if you care about history, good visuals, and a fantastic soundtrack. features Japan prominently, but writes everything but the European theater out of a story about World War II.

This show borrows heavily from the same dumpster the train of thought used in shows like Agent Aika. Whereas panties, and the occasional boobs fill the majority of the story's time making one question why is there a plot anyways, you can still manage to make out a semblence...of a story and some quasi generic characters that still caters to a broader audience. For most people however the panties will be enough of a sendoff to say goodbye to this one forever but if you can get beyond this you can actually enjoy this. I liked the designs for the flight and enemies and combat in this series enough to rate it a 7 overall but it certainly could have been far better.

Sure enough I was interested enough to give this a chance.Do not judge this anime by how it looks. Trust me, despite the absence of pants in the entirety of this anime, it was not made for pants fetishists and the anime should not be based on what ANYONE wears whatsoever. So ignore that crap and let\'s get down to the story..It is extremely slow at first, it starts out explaining a war between humans and some sort of lifefrom called the ""Neriod"". Then...moves on to the main character Miyafuji Yoshika who lives in the countryside. Her friend gets hurt and she attempts to heal her with magic. Of course she isn\'t a master at this craft and passes out from over exhaustion and wakes up back at home. Then comes in a military official Sakamoto Mio who happened to see Miyafuji\'s healing magic and wants to recruit her into a military fraction called the ""Strike Witches"" that fight the Neriods. She turns it down at first but eventually accepts being attracted to learn more about her father presumably died in war fighting the Neriod.Story: I don\'t expect anyone to be hooked on the first episode. You have to keep watching to let the characters sink in and for that universe to be interesting enough to keep on going. Take my word for it, it gets better as you watch on. Nothing too emotionally deep here. The main antagonist (the Neriod) seemingly has no conscious and is  just there for the witches to fight, nothing important really explained about them, although they seem to have affected the lives of many characters in this anime, being somewhat generic, works to it\'s advantages. Somewhat predictable, doesn\'t really tie up every loose end. It does stray off on the subject of Miyafuji\'s father, but returns at the end in a very nice plot twist.Score - 7, Nice story, it works very well.Art - The animation fantastic, the Neriods look very nice being  a sort of shiny black aircraft type beings that they are. Action is nicely presented. Being an anime with a lot of flying the sky is also done beautifully for the people that are into those types of thing. It\'s worth watching uncensored although they should have had a little bit more work on the with the ecchi segments of the animation.Score - 8, Good.Sound - The voice acting was fantastic in this one. Featuring a few seiyuus that I\'ve come to love. A few lines that had me laughing just for the way it was said. The voices add more to the characters and i admire that in an anime. The OD and ED, I\'ll be frank, are forgettable however.Score - 9, Awesome can\'t get enough.Characters - A huge part of the anime, and hardly would have been interesting had some of these characters been missing from the anime. Since it might be somewhat difficult to get through the earlier parts without knowing what characters are in store, I\'ll go over a few one by one to give you a basic idea.Miyafuji Yoshika - Not that deep of a character in my opinion. She hates to fight if she doesn\'t have too, stays away from guns. A pacifist basically. One would describe her as ""that new girl"" in terms of personality. She\'s innocent and just wants the best for everybody but not afraid to break some rules if she thinks it\'s wrong.Sakamoto Mio - She is that tough superior, older sister type character, while being somewhat strict, takes Miyafuji under her wing and teachers her about being a witch. Very diligent, wakes up early to train every morning, goes out to combat even if she\'s in no fit condition to do so. While not being the highest of the ranks, she gives out more of a leader feel than anyone else in the series.Clostermann Perrine - Indeed my favorite of the bunch. She might come as that spoiled \'I am better than you\' type character that dislikes Miyafuji at first. As you watch on you learn that the princess has some weaknesses as well. She is pretty much in love with Sakamoto Mio stalking her, fantasizing about being with her, and worships her to the point you\'re hoping for a hot Yuri scene every time the two are together. She\'s somewhat shy around Mio however and is jealous that Miyafuji gets most of the attention and is obsessed with being Mio\'s favorite.That\'s pretty much it for the characters, there are much more to look forward to and that should help you get past the slow first episodes. These characters are much more interesting to watch than to read about in a review and in no way did I spoil anything worth spoiling.Score - 8,  a very high eight if you ask me, if it\'d has done a bit better it would\'ve been deserving of a nine.Enjoyment - It was a good experience for me. It does come to mind a lot that these girls are in a universe where neither proper pants or skirts exist because they\'re running in around in basically underwear most of the time. It never bothered me. However showing too much loses some of the appeal of showing it in the first place.  That\'s just my opinion though, I\'m sure people are into stuff like that. The twist at the end leaves the viewer very much anticipating the second season.On another note, the Witches in the anime use some type of flying device called a \'Striker Unit\'. Think of it as big bulky leg attachments with little fans at the end so they can fly around. It had me wondering what sorts of accidents and decapitations having little fans strong enough to propel a person in the air at top speeds attached to the legs may cause. I wish they would\'ve used something different, like wings or something. But I do admit those leg attachments work to some great fan service and are very imaginative in their own rights.I repeat, watch it uncensored or the experience will not be the same.Score - 7Overallthis was pretty awesome to say the least. I can\'t wait to get into the second season. I hope all of of you think to try this anime out as I did. I doubt you\'ll need this review to convince you. moves on to the main character Miyafuji Yoshika who lives in the countryside. Her friend gets hurt and she attempts to heal her with magic. Of course she isn\'t a master at this craft and passes out from over exhaustion and wakes up back at home. Then comes in a military official Sakamoto Mio who happened to see Miyafuji\'s healing magic and wants to recruit her into a military fraction called the ""Strike Witches"" that fight the Neriods. She turns it down at first but eventually accepts being attracted to learn more about her father presumably died in war fighting the Neriod.Story: I don\'t expect anyone to be hooked on the first episode. You have to keep watching to let the characters sink in and for that universe to be interesting enough to keep on going. Take my word for it, it gets better as you watch on. Nothing too emotionally deep here. The main antagonist (the Neriod) seemingly has no conscious and is  just there for the witches to fight, nothing important really explained about them, although they seem to have affected the lives of many characters in this anime, being somewhat generic, works to it\'s advantages. Somewhat predictable, doesn\'t really tie up every loose end. It does stray off on the subject of Miyafuji\'s father, but returns at the end in a very nice plot twist.Score - 7, Nice story, it works very well.Art - The animation fantastic, the Neriods look very nice being  a sort of shiny black aircraft type beings that they are. Action is nicely presented. Being an anime with a lot of flying the sky is also done beautifully for the people that are into those types of thing. It\'s worth watching uncensored although they should have had a little bit more work on the with the ecchi segments of the animation.Score - 8, Good.Sound - The voice acting was fantastic in this one. Featuring a few seiyuus that I\'ve come to love. A few lines that had me laughing just for the way it was said. The voices add more to the characters and i admire that in an anime. The OD and ED, I\'ll be frank, are forgettable however.Score - 9, Awesome can\'t get enough.Characters - A huge part of the anime, and hardly would have been interesting had some of these characters been missing from the anime. Since it might be somewhat difficult to get through the earlier parts without knowing what characters are in store, I\'ll go over a few one by one to give you a basic idea.Miyafuji Yoshika - Not that deep of a character in my opinion. She hates to fight if she doesn\'t have too, stays away from guns. A pacifist basically. One would describe her as ""that new girl"" in terms of personality. She\'s innocent and just wants the best for everybody but not afraid to break some rules if she thinks it\'s wrong.Sakamoto Mio - She is that tough superior, older sister type character, while being somewhat strict, takes Miyafuji under her wing and teachers her about being a witch. Very diligent, wakes up early to train every morning, goes out to combat even if she\'s in no fit condition to do so. While not being the highest of the ranks, she gives out more of a leader feel than anyone else in the series.Clostermann Perrine - Indeed my favorite of the bunch. She might come as that spoiled \'I am better than you\' type character that dislikes Miyafuji at first. As you watch on you learn that the princess has some weaknesses as well. She is pretty much in love with Sakamoto Mio stalking her, fantasizing about being with her, and worships her to the point you\'re hoping for a hot Yuri scene every time the two are together. She\'s somewhat shy around Mio however and is jealous that Miyafuji gets most of the attention and is obsessed with being Mio\'s favorite.That\'s pretty much it for the characters, there are much more to look forward to and that should help you get past the slow first episodes. These characters are much more interesting to watch than to read about in a review and in no way did I spoil anything worth spoiling.Score - 8,  a very high eight if you ask me, if it\'d has done a bit better it would\'ve been deserving of a nine.Enjoyment - It was a good experience for me. It does come to mind a lot that these girls are in a universe where neither proper pants or skirts exist because they\'re running in around in basically underwear most of the time. It never bothered me. However showing too much loses some of the appeal of showing it in the first place.  That\'s just my opinion though, I\'m sure people are into stuff like that. The twist at the end leaves the viewer very much anticipating the second season.On another note, the Witches in the anime use some type of flying device called a \'Striker Unit\'. Think of it as big bulky leg attachments with little fans at the end so they can fly around. It had me wondering what sorts of accidents and decapitations having little fans strong enough to propel a person in the air at top speeds attached to the legs may cause. I wish they would\'ve used something different, like wings or something. But I do admit those leg attachments work to some great fan service and are very imaginative in their own rights.I repeat, watch it uncensored or the experience will not be the same.Score - 7Overallthis was pretty awesome to say the least. I can\'t wait to get into the second season. I hope all of of you think to try this anime out as I did.

Tie this in with a massive amount of ecchi and you have this show.As far as it goes it isn't bad. It is very ecchi especially since you see nudity and all the girls no matter where they work tend to be clothed in the top half...only with a bottom of underwear or swimsuit. This is just the world dynamics they went for I guess. It isn't bad though but please remember the girls are young. The nudity seen is also from the same young girls but then its a show don't take it too seriously it is not sexual.The art is actually really well done and obviously had a good budget when it was released. The girls do get some very close up shots of questionable angles and you see as much as you don't.The sounds of flying are great. The battle noises are well done too. Voices fit very well in Japanese.Characters do all develop nicely.Best girl award goes to two girls and that is Sanya V. Litvyak and Francesca Lucchini. They have very different personalities but both fit a great niche.The characters you get to know quite intimately and also you get the usual in the middle of battle everyone sort of stops to have a moment to give a speech which is annoying. It is however just how they did the show and therefore accepted.The show itself on the ecchi side is very enjoyable.

Zhen Hun Jie: Bei Luo Shi Men Pian Part 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/42359/Zhen_Hun_Jie__Bei_Luo_Shi_Men_Pian_Part_2,"['Zhen Hun Jie, also known as Rakshasa Street, is an anime adaptation of a manhua by the same name. As with any other adaptation, the producers tread a fine line between taking artistic liberties and staying faithful to the source material.Preamble: (some background for confused anime watchers)If you are reading this review, you were likely attracted to this series through the huge success of Season 1, which presented a unique Yin-Yang style of storytelling which showcased the deep bond between two brothers. Season 1 was hugely experimental, but it was successful in that it retained the basic feel of the manhua, while adding more...depth of emotion through flashbacks, new characters, and the cutting of some unnecessary details from the manhua. It was successful precisely because it adapted the single weakest arc from the source material (in which the author Xu Chen was still developing his style and trying to gain popularity), and made certain strategic changes that, while being somewhat controversial in the manhua community, were generally well received in light of the anime’s overall success.It was in this atmosphere of success that Zhen Hun Jie Season 2 Part 1 was announced. Both anime-onlys and manhua-readers had high hopes for the series, and it certainly seemed to be living up to expectations. While the excessive CGI for fight scenes was a little off-putting, I think most watchers would agree that the general flow of the story in the first two episodes was definitely on par with Season 1. The anime-onlys were pleased by the new setting and story, while the manhua-readers were curious to see how the removed details that were supposed to be in Season 1 would be added to enhance Season 2. What nobody expected, however, was an abrupt break after only 5 episodes of the series, and the return of a Remake (or Part 2) that baffled everybody.This, Zhen Hun Jie: Bei Luo Shi Men Pian Part 2, is that Remake of Part 1. The first three episodes are entirely old content, which presents a condensed version of Part 1. Episode 4 marks the point where the director gave up halfway through his original draft and decided “screw it, I’m out of good story ideas, let’s just go back to faithfully rendering every frame of the original manhua.” Whether that is in response to disillusioned manhua readers who grew displeased with the development of the story in Part 1, or whether it was due to something else entirely, I do not know. In the review below, I will focus on my thoughts on the quality of the remake, and what I personally think could have been done differently.Body: (actual review starts here)Story 6/10 - If the first arc of Rakshasa Street showcased the bond between “blood brothers”, then this second arc develops that tension to “found family”. The story is action-packed, with good inclusion of flashback scenes for emotion building and conflict/intrigue to entice the viewer into wanting more. If you look at the first 3 episodes alone or the last 6 episodes alone, they would both be solid 7-8/10. However, the problem arises in that the initial 3 episodes have very little to do with the remaining episodes. Because while the initial episodes showcase anime-original content, the later episodes are entirely verbatim from the manhua, and the resulting plot holes that come out of the discontinuity are TERRIBLY explained.Art 7/10 - Similar to the story, the art style of the first 3 episodes is very different from the remaining episodes. Personally, I actually enjoyed the later art style better because it is more faithful to the manhua that I originally fell in love with. I also think it was a good choice to ditch the 3D animation, because while it was very flashy, it was overly distracting. The animation suffers a bit from budget limitations, as there is decent proportion of resting/panning shots in which the only thing that distinguishes the anime from a PowerPoint presentation is a single set of moving lips or a few strands of flowing hair. However, I think given the difficulty of the adaptation, the animators did a fairly decent job.Sound 6/10 - The sound is a bit of hit-and-miss. While there are some moments where I thought “wow, the BGM is an amazing fit for the action”, there are other parts where I cringed at the choice. The producers recycled the original three theme songs from Season 1 to use for Season 2, which I thought was a good choice since they convey the right motifs of “baddassery”, “melancholy”, and “the journey continues”, respectively. I was less impressed by the other musical inserts, because they were a very strange blend of eastern and western music that just don’t go coherently together. In one scene, you would get a cover of “Silent Night”, a classic Christmas carol, while in the following scene you would get an OST taken straight from the 1997 version of the Monkey King. Normally, I would not be so picky about the sound, but since it is the one thing that could easily be changed to unify two otherwise completely disjoint segments of animation and storytelling, I cannot help but be disappointed by the lack of attention to detail in this matter.Character 7/10 - In terms of main characters, I personally love Bei Luo Shi Men. He’s a great character with a well developed backstory and clearly explained motives. I also like Cao Yan Bing for his bravery and pigheadedness. Xia Ling is the only main character I never felt much for, but she gets some character development here that makes her easier to tolerate. Unfortunately, the character development was not treated well due to the random addition and subtraction of plot points, which means I can’t give more than 7/10 in this category. There’s also the issue of the “Guardian Spirits” not having enough screen time outside of fight scenes which makes them seem more like mecha robots than dead historical figures...but that is another can of worms. Does anybody else feel like this season turned into Three Kingdoms x Evangelion?Enjoyment 7/10 - Overall, I think I enjoyed this season. While it suffered from numerous problems, it ended on a strong note that makes me hopeful for Season 3. If you are reading this review and have yet to watch the series, I recommend reading chapters 1-26 of the manhua first before starting Part 2. A lot of the abrupt changes will make more sense, and you can get a relatively enjoyable experience.Overall: (concluding rant)As a faithful manhua adaptation, the second half of Season 2 is strong and enjoyable. As an anime-original, the first half of Season 2 has its merits. However, blended together, the two halves just DO NOT go well together. The character I feel the most sorry for is Bai Shuier, who was given a horrendous treatment due to having two conflicting backstories that imposed dissociative identity disorder on an individual who already has enough mental trauma on her plate.I really believe what would have made this season so much stronger was to remake the entirety of the Bei Luo arc. Not too much was changed in Season 1, which the director could have easily explained in half an episode AT THE BEGINNING of the arc. Then they could have gotten away with doing a full faithful manhua adaptation from that point forward with limited problems and I wouldn’t have to write such a huge review just to establish the context of everything I’m talking about.Hopefully you found this review to be decently informative. Thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts on the matter. depth of emotion through flashbacks, new characters, and the cutting of some unnecessary details from the manhua.

Episode 4 marks the point where the director gave up halfway through his original draft and decided “screw it, I’m out of good story ideas, let’s just go back to faithfully rendering every frame of the original manhua.” Whether that is in response to disillusioned manhua readers who grew displeased with the development of the story in Part 1, or whether it was due to something else entirely, I do not know. In the review below, I will focus on my thoughts on the quality of the remake, and what I personally think could have been done differently.Body: (actual review starts here)Story 6/10 - If the first arc of Rakshasa Street showcased the bond between “blood brothers”, then this second arc develops that tension to “found family”. The story is action-packed, with good inclusion of flashback scenes for emotion building and conflict/intrigue to entice the viewer into wanting more. If you look at the first 3 episodes alone or the last 6 episodes alone, they would both be solid 7-8/10. However, the problem arises in that the initial 3 episodes have very little to do with the remaining episodes. Because while the initial episodes showcase anime-original content, the later episodes are entirely verbatim from the manhua, and the resulting plot holes that come out of the discontinuity are TERRIBLY explained.Art 7/10 - Similar to the story, the art style of the first 3 episodes is very different from the remaining episodes. Personally, I actually enjoyed the later art style better because it is more faithful to the manhua that I originally fell in love with. I also think it was a good choice to ditch the 3D animation, because while it was very flashy, it was overly distracting. The animation suffers a bit from budget limitations, as there is decent proportion of resting/panning shots in which the only thing that distinguishes the anime from a PowerPoint presentation is a single set of moving lips or a few strands of flowing hair. However, I think given the difficulty of the adaptation, the animators did a fairly decent job.Sound 6/10 - The sound is a bit of hit-and-miss. While there are some moments where I thought “wow, the BGM is an amazing fit for the action”, there are other parts where I cringed at the choice. The producers recycled the original three theme songs from Season 1 to use for Season 2, which I thought was a good choice since they convey the right motifs of “baddassery”, “melancholy”, and “the journey continues”, respectively. I was less impressed by the other musical inserts, because they were a very strange blend of eastern and western music that just don’t go coherently together. In one scene, you would get a cover of “Silent Night”, a classic Christmas carol, while in the following scene you would get an OST taken straight from the 1997 version of the Monkey King. Normally, I would not be so picky about the sound, but since it is the one thing that could easily be changed to unify two otherwise completely disjoint segments of animation and storytelling, I cannot help but be disappointed by the lack of attention to detail in this matter.Character 7/10 - In terms of main characters, I personally love Bei Luo Shi Men. He’s a great character with a well developed backstory and clearly explained motives. I also like Cao Yan Bing for his bravery and pigheadedness. Xia Ling is the only main character I never felt much for, but she gets some character development here that makes her easier to tolerate. Unfortunately, the character development was not treated well due to the random addition and subtraction of plot points, which means I can’t give more than 7/10 in this category. There’s also the issue of the “Guardian Spirits” not having enough screen time outside of fight scenes which makes them seem more like mecha robots than dead historical figures...but that is another can of worms. Does anybody else feel like this season turned into Three Kingdoms x Evangelion?Enjoyment 7/10 - Overall, I think I enjoyed this season. While it suffered from numerous problems, it ended on a strong note that makes me hopeful for Season 3. If you are reading this review and have yet to watch the series, I recommend reading chapters 1-26 of the manhua first before starting Part 2. A lot of the abrupt changes will make more sense, and you can get a relatively enjoyable experience.Overall: (concluding rant)As a faithful manhua adaptation, the second half of Season 2 is strong and enjoyable. As an anime-original, the first half of Season 2 has its merits. However, blended together, the two halves just DO NOT go well together. The character I feel the most sorry for is Bai Shuier, who was given a horrendous treatment due to having two conflicting backstories that imposed dissociative identity disorder on an individual who already has enough mental trauma on her plate.I really believe what would have made this season so much stronger was to remake the entirety of the Bei Luo arc. Not too much was changed in Season 1, which the director could have easily explained in half an episode AT THE BEGINNING of the arc. Then they could have gotten away with doing a full faithful manhua adaptation from that point forward with limited problems and I wouldn’t have to write such a huge review just to establish the context of everything I’m talking about.Hopefully you found this review to be decently informative. Thank you for taking your time to read my thoughts on the matter.']"

With an anime title this long, sometimes, it feels like we're reading a meme. For the sake of your sanity and this review, I'll just call this show Banished from the Hero's Party. And you may have guessed it, the hero gets banished from a hero's party.As the premise detailed, we follow protagonist Red, a D-rank adventurer who was banished from a party. He was formerly known as Gideon Ragnason, before being banished by his party members when they...surpassed him in skill and level. The general premise sets up for his adventure and life in a fantasy world although his past continously comes back to haunt him. Meanwhile, we also meet Rit, a young charismatic woman who has developed feelings for Red during their time together. Of course, she has her own reasons to live such a carefree life and we find out more about her identity and past later on. For now, let's just say that the anime subscribes to a charming couple together.Yet, I don't want to call designate this show entirely as a romance because at its heart, the show is more than just about Red and Rit. Treat it more as a blend between slice of life, romance, fantasy, and adventure. When we first meet Red and Rit though, it's obvious they have a mutual attraction towards each other. The anime makes it pretty much straightforward and doesn't do the usual ship teases. It's right to the point early to mid-season with Red and Rit admitting their feelings to each other. In essence, it's doesn't hold back establishing Red and Rit as a character pair bought together by different circumstances. And personally, this stands out as the best way to create a couple. It doesn't make the viewers wait or ask the 'what if' question. Plus, their personalities are compatible with their kindhearted yet also courgeous nature.On the other hand, we meet also meet Ruti, a prominent hero and sister of Red. Being perhaps of the most emotional prone character in the how, as well as having a tragic past, she represents the darker side of the story. However, Ruti still holds a strong love towards Red, and her actions speaks louder than words. Ruthless and intimidating, Ruti carries an emotional burden on herself. Red seems to be the only light in her dark tunnel, who is able to suppress her emotional outbursts. The show offers a platonic relationship between the two built on trust. Because let's face it, Ruti never wanted Red to be banished by their hero party, namely Ares Srowa.And speak of the devil. Ares Srowa serves as the antagonistic foil to Red. I can easily say that he is borderline psychotic fueled by jealousy. You ever played an online MMORPG member before and got scammed by one of your own guild leader, then banned forever? That's pretty much how Ares treated Red and banished him from the hero party. It's harsh but also reveals Ares' true dangerous nature: a selfish, greedy sociopath driven by his personal agendas. When we see him meet Red later in the story, it really shows how deeply resentful he is towards him. So yes, the show makes its a priority to make us hate Ares and succeeds. He is easily the least likable character for his actions, personality, and just about every single damn deed he's ever done in the story.Watching Banished from the Hero's Party feels like it knew the type of anime it wanted to shows  to us from the beginning. From background stories to the main character relationships, it's about as crystal clear as it gets. On the other hand, I am also somewhat disappointed by some episodes with its story pacing. There are a few episodes mid-season that drops in us in complex society conflicts, that feels needlessly rushed. Other times, you may also be bored by Red and Rit's relationship, especially if you're not a fan of fairy tale-like romances. However, at its core, the anime maintains a stable balance of storytelling and knows what the audience wants.I won't be the first to say it or the last, but it appears the anime feels very JRPG-ish, in terms of its world setting. The towns, adventurous landscapes, magic, swordsmanship, battles, and overall, characters look like something that came out of an JRPG game. Hell, there's an actual game to be released on Steam although that has no ties to this story. Studio Flad and Wolfsbane combined their talents together to draw us into its fictional world. The visual quality overall looks colorful, vibrant of fantasy elements, but also contains darker tones of violence. Character expressions also play a key role in showing us emotions, most noticably for Ruti. However, there are some noticable drop in key animation in some episodes. Overall however, it's an anime that used its visual quality to success.Fantasy adventures are usually a hit or a miss but it can even be more risky when you add in romance or slice of life. However, I can say that after these 13 episodes, Banished from the Hero's Party is without a shadow of a doubt one of the better light novel adaptations of the year. surpassed him in skill and level.

I absolutely LOVE Romance/Slice of Life/Fantasy mixed with a little action! If you don't enjoy those genres this is not for you! I'm writing this review because their aren't any reviews yet. Seeing that there aren't any, I figured I'd help some people out who are on the fence about watching this one.To start, I will say that I am a sucker for wholesome romance so I am really biased towards stories like these. If you're looking for a nice Fantasy/Romance with well developed characters and a super wholesome relationship, it's a MUST WATCH! The two MCs...(Red and Rit) have amazing chemistry. For me, their relationship is what really makes this story stand out. Most Fantasy/Slice of Life tend to have an extremely dense MC who has a ton of girls falling all over him. This story caught my eye because it's the exact opposite. Without spoiling anything, their relationship develops quickly and realistically. There isn't any jealousy or forced relationship drama, just two people with a really strong bond. They aren't afraid to show affection and it's just super wholesome. It really is a breath of fresh air to see that type of thing in a genre that's oversaturated with harems and random relationship drama. I absolutely love how the romance is written!Alright so I explained a bit about the romance (which is clearly my favorite part), lets dive into the story next. As much as I love the romance, the story is also really entertaining. It does a really good job throwing in twists and turns that you don't expect to keep it interesting. I feel like it's hard to blend Slice of Life/Romance with Action/Adventure and keep a nice balance between the two. Following the hero's party and slowly learning more and more about them is a nice way to mix things up. It's almost like you are experiencing two stories at once. One that's Action/Adventure which follows the hero's party and one that's Romance/Slice of Life which follows the wholesome everyday lives of our MCs. When the two stories end up intertwining with each other it's really well done and better than a ton of other stories trying the same concept.Again, this review is mostly based off the manga so I'm not quiet sure exactly how the anime will handle everything. That being said, so far it has done a great job of adapting the story. It's almost exactly how the manga adapted everything from the LNs. There are a few changes that helped progress the story a bit faster (like cutting out extra details when they aren't needed or shortening backstories a bit), but overall it's been great so far!A quick side note: THE OP AND ED ARE BOTH AMAZING!!!Final thoughts:I can't wait to watch how the rest of this story is adapted! If you like Romance/Fantasy/Slice of Life with bits of action or just love wholesome romance it's a MUST WATCH! I really can't stress this enough, if you enjoy those genres it's a MUST WATCH!!!! The romance and daily life between our two MCs is some of the most wholesome stuff you can find. The action is used really well to contrast the slice of life aspect. Honestly it's just a really sweet story to sit down and smile to. I also highly recommend the manga! I know all manga readers always preach about the manga so you're probably sick about hearing this, but it's totally worth checking out if you enjoy the story!Anyway, I hope this review helped you decide whether or not this anime is for you! Thanks for reading and have a great day! (Red and Rit) have amazing chemistry. For me, their relationship is what really makes this story stand out.

It was amazing to watch said quiet life.I thought I\'d get into this seasonal because it looked good despite it being a ""generic isekai"" which is somehow synonymous with modern fantasy, but that is a debate for another time. Anyhow, Shin no Nakama is an exceptional anime with the correct amount of everything mixed perfectly enough for it to be taken seriously without any kind of creases being visible enough for it to tumble on itself as quickly as it started up. It\'s even good enough to come up with some...thought-provoking ideas.What may look like a run-of-the-mill story is actually a genuinely developed work featuring a detailed plot, enough so that there is a substantial amount of info and lore to at the very least keep you immersed. It\'s true, that relative to other fantasy anime out there, this one fails to bring out some kind of unique content (although, more on that soon), however with the story managing to make use of literally everything you\'d expect in a grand story, this just comes across as surface-level masterpiece, or in other words, it is there on the ground waiting to take off as other supposed masterpieces out there in the medium. What makes it a little faulty was the start-up mix between the slow life side and the fantasy side of things having awkward match-ups with easy transitions that\'d kill the former side with boring content of the latter. Boring is a little harsh though, it is more, ironically enough, slow. This all changes around episode 7 onwards, however, where the quality drastically improves as every set-up piece serves its purpose well enough to enhance characters and the setting. That for me, not only improved the watching experience but also brought around some nice philosophy I wouldn\'t have really expected to see here. Truth be told, such ideas come later in the series so I have no intention of spoiling them in this review, but the questions that arise here are interesting to even reflect on in reality as you watch it. It\'s a good idea.What honestly made me want to watch this was how this was a romance (who doesn\'t like wholesome love??). I have to say, in a series as Shin no Nakama, the romantic chemistry is indeed amazing, literally chef d\'oeuvre relationship between Red and Rit, I haven\'t seen something this natural in a long while, and it isn\'t the kind of romance to shoujo its way to a *confession* in the final episode. It is like, already happening. Happening well. It\'s a healthy relationship between two individuals who actually understand each other and indeed do love each other. It\'s one of the selling points in the series and if I had to suggest this for fans of the genre, this is a real go-to if anything. I wouldn\'t even advise being cynical about the relationship, I really mean it when these two characters love each other, it is a truly wholesome bliss that doesn\'t find its way into the medium without something drama or the likes taking place. A very natural bond that can only be equally as loved as the couple are with each other.The production values kinda annoy me here. It isn\'t bad, it\'s baseline, but this really tried to push itself to the point where a few awkward moments would show up. Of course, this is a minor complaint, but it kinda ruins some intense scenes so it isn\'t something that I can honestly praise in a down-to-earth fashion. But honestly, this looks pretty good for a fantasy anime and ignoring the imperfections, most scenes here are something that even impresses its own standards. Otherwise, I wouldn\'t expect the world here, that\'s also true for most of the OST. I do bang on about how sometimes memorable stuff makes the moments and what have you better, because it is true, and whilst I would like to say that something simple doesn\'t necessarily need a true punch in the memory of you to like something, I\'ve seen actual good simple anime manage to pull off some amazing OST regardless. Kinda a shame the same is true for this anime but hey, it is what it is.So, would I recommend this? 100%, stuff here is truly amazing, and nothing like the other fantasy anime that I\'ve seen before. It\'s a dark horse in my eyes, in this dry season with literally 3 good shows and that is it. I am happy that this fantasy anime, overshadowed by the garbage history of Japanese light novel copypasta, is actually something very decent and worthy of immense praise. It\'s a blessing this has come to be, being very serious here, and I wish to see more as such in the future. thought-provoking ideas.What may look like a run-of-the-mill story is actually a genuinely developed work featuring a detailed plot, enough so that there is a substantial amount of info and lore to at the very least keep you immersed.

The first half actually follows the premise; a slow life romance, with some cool moments here and there. And then the second half just goes to flames. I get what they were trying to do, but the execution was just garbage.So the plot is basically, as the tittle says, slow life. It actually does a good job in handling that, mc living with his wife, just having fun and sometimes, being a hero in secret. As the story goes on, his past catches up to him as he has to do more and more...hero stuff. BUT THEN HERE COMES THE SECOND HALF. His past catches up to him, and now he\'s basically back to being a hero, nothing too bad. The first act as a hero was done fairly okay, it was well developed and had moderate pacing. However, it was a bit uncomfortable seeing the center of the conflict being kids, and random character popping out of no where, but okay ig. Then the second act was just collision of plot points, that weren\'t even developed, only stated once or even never. Everyone is here, and now it\'s just too much to handle, and it\'s just done so poorly. We don\'t get any hints or time to unpack the plot; ""slow life"" remember?The characters are so so, some are done good and some are just garbage. MC actually has decent to no development, the only development he gets is his romance development, but other than that, nothing. He remains the same perfect guy as he always is, in flashbacks and now (note: I\'m saying perfect, because he is, he isn\'t the strongest person, but he\'s mc material). Next it Rit, also little to no development, she just becomes red\'s wife ig. Ruti was actually done pretty well, though kinda cliché at times, her growth as a person was well-written. Then there\'s Ares, actually a decent portrayal to a decent into madness, just a crazy guy, that\'s all. Tisse was a good friend, and that\'s about it, nicely written friend. Last is the rest of the cast, which just appear out of nowhere, ulterior motives and important events? not even hinted at, just all handled poorly.I get the theme of the show ""Don\'t let other people (the gods) decide your life, you get to live how you want to"". However, the bad writing and random plot bullcrap weigh it down so much, the only saving grace of this show is the actual slow life. Decent anime hero stuff. BUT THEN HERE COMES THE SECOND HALF.

Watching this is like watching a child throw a loaded wasp nest into your bathroom while you\'re on the toilet with an empty role of TP.Not that it\'s exciting, no. It\'s that kind of dread when you see another episode has released. That\'s what I\'m saying.There is no story here, not really.

Oh,...the ""hero"" is a loli. So is the ""hero\'s"" sidekick.Then they have tits mcgee who offers little more than her stripper name implies, and some boring, half-assed villains who don\'t really matter.Why am I so negative here? Easy: This whole thing is filler. Nothing of substance is going on. It\'s not even a pleasant slice of life. It\'s just characters spewing info-dumps to get to the next thing as dictated by the ""plot"" to move towards who knows what end. I sure don\'t, and I don\'t care.It\'s rare you see such a waste of resources as this.

I thought I would sleep on this slow-life anime. It seems like a plain fantasy adventure anime with nothing special in it to make me continue watching. I was wrong.The story is simple. Red is formerly a member of the Hero\'s party who got pushed out for being a liability in the party. He then decided to open an apothecary and live a quiet life in a town named Zoltan. There Rit, a friend from his past adventuring days, shows up and asks to move in with him in exchange for helping out in his business.Surprisingly, it has something to offer...a very wholesome romance between Rit and Red. I have no idea what the two of them were back then, which led Red to easily accept her offer to live together since little was presented yet in the anime, but the interactions between Rit and Red are the sweetest thing I had ever seen. It is worth watching the show only for these two, although they aren\'t an official couple yet. The other characters in the town of Zoltan are nice, and some are annoying. Then there\'s Red\'s former Hero party who is looking for him to return. In which I hoped the author left it out instead. Since focusing on the comedic-wholesome daily lives of Red and Rit is the best feature of the anime.The animation is beautiful and the colors are vibrant. Both the opening and ending are very soothing, and it just makes me smile every time I listen to it. To wrap up, it is worth watching for relaxing and wholesomeness, but I can\'t recommend it if you are interested in the action as a fantasy adventure anime.If you still can\'t get enough sweetness from ""Banished from the Hero\'s Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside."". I recommend trying out ""Slow living with Princess."" an official spin-off game of the anime. It is available on Steam. a very wholesome romance between Rit and Red.

It has no real plot and half the time makes no sense at all. It has all the worst tripes with some new lows thrown in like villains diatribing, pointlessly endless self justications and explanations, and for good measure, the good guys are doing more damage to each other than the villains 99% of the time. Every one almost dies at least once but then magically gets healed to new as if it never happened. The story extols the virtue of abdicating responsibility. From the heroes brother who leaves the party to live the boring...life (emphasis on boring), to the hero herself who forsakes humanity to selfishly just be a normal girl. There are no repercussions at all. Can they really live in lala land forever like the inevitable war won't ever destroy everything they hold dear? We have no idea since the story comfortably ignores that elephant in the room. Or does it really not matter, in which case, what was the point of being a hero in the first place?! I've watched hundreds of animes but never one this bad.

Shin No Nakama has the plot of ""hero"" needing to beat the ""demon lord"" but doesn\'t really revolves around it(currently), which makes it unique compared to other ""average"" anime which mostly speaks about Isekai but this anime is not an isekai anime. The ""hero"" is Red\'s sister which makes things a bit more complicated: Red was kicked out of the hero\'s party due to his ""incompetency"" according to one of the squad members, which ended up encouraging Red to leave the hero\'s party and now the hero\'s party is apparently in jeopardy.Story: 9/10, it\'s too wholesome to be given lower than 9, well part of it is because it fills my desires, though the main story itself about ""hero"" and ""demon lord"" is quite the generic but who cares, as long as I enjoy this show.Art: 9/10, well what could I say about the art? It just matches perfectly with the show, though it\'s not ""perfect"", but as everyone said, ""nothing is perfect in life.""Sound: 8/10, well same goes for the art, just what could I say about the sound? Other than the fact that the voice actors/actress do be matching with the characters as intended.Enjoyment: 10/10, well do I really need to explain it after writing how I felt watching through these 4 episodes? Well just in case some of you are indeed curious and couldn\'t really come to a conclusion on why I rated it a 10, here\'s why: It\'s because this show has most of the elements needed in an anime to make it entertaining, though it\'s cliche as hell but who cares when it\'s wholesome right? Well yeah, in short, I gave it a 10 because I have been really looking forward to the latest episodes every week.Well, there\'s only so much I could say in 4 eps, to get to the point I basically rate Shin No Nakama a 9/10 because of the wholesomeness that hits diff.

This would definitely be noticeable if you are beginning the show if I could notice it weekly.The decision to make it a 24 episode anime surely would have helped the pacing is a bit off and we are suddenly thrust in and out between slice of life and action, this is a really bad combination if not done properly because take for example Rit, we don’t know when to take her seriously and when not to since she switches from champion rit to must proteccc waifu way too fast.But on the bright the studios behind this do deserve all the credit since they made it a very digestible work even with the very bad hand they were dealt with, I must appreciate their ambition to take up a unique and challenging project rather than go with sure hit moe or ecchi shows.Now coming to the individual scoresStory[6/10]The plot and setting are great. the anime, strictly speaking, suffers from severe pacing issues and shoves action or slice of life at random intervals on your face[this is not a problem in manga or LN].

Literally I was thinking why don\'t they change the name of fantasy genre to isekai. But well here we are with a fantasy show. That is not a isekai but still good.Story 8Well the story of the anime is quite unique in fantasy genre. I personally didn\'t see many shows with a story this unique in fantasy. As the story progresses we get to know about various things going on as a side story in the anime. And well this show had some things that...were it\'s original. So 8 in the story sectionArt 10Yeah well, It\'s literally quite obvious we will get see some stunning animations in the show. The visuals were really pretty. The fight scenes were very neat and well choreographed. I will give it a 10 in art & animation.Sound 8The basic theme of the anime is really quite good. It\'s kind of relaxing. The opening & ending are fairy good too. And the OST\'s have a relaxing vibe to it. I really enjoyed the sounds used in this anime. I would give it a solid 8 in sounds.Character 8The characters where give fairy decent spotlight & screen time. No unnecessary screen time was dragged into the anime for some specific character. The character development was pretty good too. We get to know about a lot of characters in such short time. So I would give it an 8.Enjoyment 9This show is kind of my guilty pleasure thing. I really enjoyed the show despite it\'s flaws and drawbacks. It never bored me at any point. So if it is just for enjoyment. I would give this anime a 9.ConclusionOverall judging as a critique this anime was fairly decent. This anime can come under ""Consider Watching"" tier. In the long run this show fails to compete with other shows coming out this season. Still I think deserves an 8 at the very best. were it\'s original.

Despite its rating it is definitely one of the better fantasy stories out there. The character development is stellar and the interactions between them is great. This anime feels like an isekai but all the characters are from this world which makes the story pure fantasy fun. One thing from watching this anime is it definitely starts off slow which is my theory for its poor rating. The story really ramps up midway through and episodes 12 and 13 feel like movies lol.

This show started off on course to be another normal, generic fantasy show jumping through the usual hoops I've seen many times before, which is fine. These kinds of shows can be enjoyable enough in their own way, so I kept watching. Slice of life and fantasy are both genres I generally enjoy afterall. But quite quickly this show devolves into some of the worst shit I've ever had the misfortune of...sitting through, and by the time I'm at the last couple of episodes I feel like a fucking idiot for having watched it all. I can't think of a single redeeming factor of this show -- the story and characters are just so unbelievably stupid and disingenuous I find it hard to even understand how a whole team of real people could have produced and released this. The characters are incredibly shallow and it's like they've been written by an individual who has no idea how people act and is just going off of written references of how different anime archetypes behave. The story could've been such an incredibly simple springboard to just launch a slice of life show off of, but instead they revolve almost the entire show around this generic demon lord plot and the MC's momentary insecurities.The only meaning one could possibly derive from this show is how a person is free to live their life how they see fit, regardless of what they are inherently talented at. They spend the entire show shoving this simple rhetoric down your throat, as if anyone was under a different impression to begin with.

I can't think of a single redeeming factor of this show -- the story and characters are just so unbelievably stupid and disingenuous I find it hard to even understand how a whole team of real people could have produced and released this. The characters are incredibly shallow and it's like they've been written by an individual who has no idea how people act and is just going off of written references of how different anime archetypes behave. The story could've been such an incredibly simple springboard to just launch a slice of life show off of, but instead they revolve almost the entire show around this generic demon lord plot and the MC's momentary insecurities.The only meaning one could possibly derive from this show is how a person is free to live their life how they see fit, regardless of what they are inherently talented at. They spend the entire show shoving this simple rhetoric down your throat, as if anyone was under a different impression to begin with.

I saw someone saying that this anime was getting a second season and I wondered why the hell something so low rated and possibly very, very bad was getting more episodes. The thing is, I started looking for hidden gems and underrated animes about a week ago, since I started getting tired of many hyped up animes that delivers nothing at all. Some of them are always so well rated and they are so bad that I was even scared of picking low rated animes on...MAL, because I thought they would be even worse. But I NEVER imagined that the risk of watching low rated animes in MAL could bring me something as good as this show. As I write this review, the score of this anime is 6.95, something to be very suspicious right? I can tell you, dear reader, that I have watched my share of anime already. I don\'t update my MAL list and I am not used to writing reviews, but I think I should do a favor to the community by sharing my feelings and my opinion about how good this anime is.After being severely broken by the frustration of losing what he you once believed was meaning of his life, the mc finds his new purpose. As the title suggests, we start with our mc being kicked out of the hero\'s party with the argument that his skill didn\'t scale as well as the other characters in the group and he started getting in their way, needing protection from other members and not being useful in combat. He then gives up on being an adventurer and to life in the countryside, in a place where nothing happens and he could live a peaceful life as an apothecary. Soon, a princess disguised as an adventurer that he helped in past adventures find him in this city and she is also seeking a quiet place to live, away from the intrigues of the royal family. These two have actually quite the chemistry together and it is very satisfying to see their relationship grow and they becoming closer and more intimate to each other.The history does more than just focus on the romance of the mc and the princess. That are mysterious events in town to shaking the plot a little bit, the dynamic of the party after the mc left and the feelings of his old partners about it. The anime also invested some philosophy concerning the blessing/skill each person is born with in this world. It can determine what your profession is going to be, what your personality is going to be like and the feelings that people have about their own unique skill. It doesn\'t go super deep about it, but it was pretty interesting that it brought to question people\'s free will versus their supposed ""fate"" and obligations to god and society according to their skill.It\'s a hidden gem of romance, adventure, slice of life and action. If I could, I would give it an 8,5, but since I cannot I\'m rounding it up, this show deserves it. Try to stick with it until episode 4. If you didn\'t like it by then, give up and watch something else MAL, because I thought they would be even worse.

It\'s very wholesome, has an actual decent romance plot that isn\'t the MC getting a harem of 47 wives, has enough action spread throughout and was, in my eyes, just a nice, easy-to-watch anime.There\'s flashback scenes to explain how characters got to where they are and act like they do and there\'s also scenes that delve into world-building and setting up the plot. Each of the main cast has ample time to be developed, although I will say that one of the later additions doesn\'t really have much outside of ""this is who she is"", but maybe she\'ll be developed in Season 2. The romance plot feels quite legitimate and natural, especially when compared to harem stories - here, the MC has one love-interest and although he is a little bit clueless at the start, he very quickly catches on, without there needing to be 6 episodes of major fanfare or fan-service (although there is fan-service here). The family development and self-discovery parts are also, in my opinion, well done, with a nice ending-note to close out Season 1 with (although, again, it does leave the over-arching thread quite open).Lastly, art and animation are certainly nothing special, but serviceable for this type of show.I will personally rate this a 7/10 - Good, enjoyable and worth a watch - I probably would have given this an 8/10 had I not watched so many ""very good"" anime in 2023. ties huge parts of the story together.Now, I will admit that some parts of the negative reviews are correct in saying ""well, if this happens at the end, what happens with the whole demon lord thing?"", as it is a valid concern in regards to the plot, but - well - as I said at the start, Season 2 is upon us in a few short days of me writing this review, so I can only hope that it will get brought up, as Season 1 does leave it a little open as to what is going to happen to the world; it also leaves an opening for another plot thread of ""what is going on with the god and the blessings?"".I cannot hold this against the reviewers though, as for shows like this, it is rare for them to get continuation seasons and Season 1 did initially air just over 2 years ago.As for the main meat and potatoes of the review -I personally found this anime extremely enjoyable, as it was definitely a change-up from the typical ""isekai trash"" that gets pumped out (and that I watch).

Very minor unimportant spoilers ahead.This is the slice-of-life anime equivalent of a B-action movie. Everything about it is aggressively average. This is the type of anime you can leave running in the background while you\'re washing dishes or cooking. If you like romance and slice-of-life in a fantasy setting and just want to turn off your brain and destress, this is the anime for you.STORY 3/10: The premise of this anime is fantastic. Unfortunately the entire plot is...written like amateur fanfiction. If the average anime-watcher decided to write their own anime, this would be the result. It has all the elements of romance and isekai, but none of the skill in crafting a cohesive story. The plot is all over the place and the dialogue is overwhelmingly cliche and almost painfully bad.So much time is wasted by people overexplaining or exposition dumping. They handhold the audience through the story because the plot-points themselves just barely make sense. ""Now X is doing this because so and so happened so now we have to do this."" <-basically sums it upThe entire skill/magic system is unfinished. Don\'t even try to understand it because it\'s obvious they don\'t either.ART & SOUND 4/10: The world is slapped together with no real cohesive creative direction. The doctor has modern doctor clothes. Ancient elven ruins look the same as a generic underground science research lab.Music is sub-par. The OP is actually fantastic, but the background music is really not. I usually don\'t notice background music much, but their quirky-jazzy-flirting music actually pulled me out of the anime (which was a first).CHARACTERS 3/10: I love romance animes. But in order to love them, the characters have to be real people. Only the MC and his sister (the hero) come close to feeling like real characters. It is refreshing to have an MC who is mature, kind, and un-angsty even if he is basically written with no flaws. His relationship with his sister is wholesome and the only part that kept me watching. The premise of the Hero is incredibly interesting, however, again actual execution of her character is lacking. I still like her though.Everybody else in the story can be described as a 3-word caricature. Dumb, strong warrior. Quiet, mature paladin. Shy, cute ninja. Generic Isekai checkmarks.THE LOVE INTEREST: She can basically be described as Boobs, the girl. She is basically a perfect ditzy fantasy girl with no real personality of her own. And with the amount of time her boobs are on display and how the MC seems to only feel flushed when he sees her boobs, the boobs might as well be the love interest and the girl just a body. Her character = super-fighter who also happens to be a princess who loves food and the MC. You never really understand why they\'re in love with each other except for ""because it\'s a romance anime.""However, the romance scenes are cute and there\'s no unnecessary drama either. It\'s easy to watch for fuzzy feelings but nothing deeper than that.OVERALL 5/10: Just watch it as a generic Romance, Slice-of-Life anime. The more you expect from it, the more you will be disappointed. It really is a shame.

Having been dismissed, the main character feels no obligation now to resolving worldly problems and has instead decided to settle in a quiet town far-removed from most walks of life.The premise of the story fails for 2 reasons almost immediately: the setting's hero is the protagonist's sister and never once mentioned her brother being a liability, and the second reason becomes unignorably apparent quickly, and that is that the main character protagonist...is far from being a liability at all. Just the opposite, the writing establishes his competency as being head-and-shoulders above most of the rest of the cast. When working with this information one cannot help but cast doubt upon the narrative, regarding it as little more than being forced and not at all persuasive.The writing overall is bland, fluctuating from slice-of-life to having interludes of stakes and plot, which does little else but create dissonance in the tone of the show. You have nothing to expect from episode to episode. The viewer is not given anything to look forward to and because of this lack of promises and commitment to any overarching themes or ideas dissuades an audience from becoming invested in any of the characters or the things they are doing. There is a climactic ending which was rushed and haphazardly introduced seemingly for the sole purpose of saying the anime had a peak it climbed. The show is trying to accomplish too much and, as a consequence, ends up accomplishing little well.The animation is fair.

It has a bushel of interesting ideas included in its writing but these all suffer from underwhelming execution. It is disappointing as the anime has enough visible effort put into it that one cannot help but speculate how differently it may have turned out had it taken its time with its themes.As it stands I cannot recommend this anime to anyone who values their time. is far from being a liability at all.

That's the best way I can describe the show so far simple yet entertaining enough to make you continue the series.It's kind of rare for a fantasy/isekai like show to have a slice of life involved with it.

Shin no Nakama is no different, and for all the similarities I could point to with other series, it's the differences and the conceit that were striking to me. That being said, in spite of how much I like this series in concept, I found the delivery to be lacking.The general conceit of this first season is the idea that a person isn't born for anything; they aren't supposed to BE anything. Nothing decides what...a person is other than them. I think this concept is hammered in a bit too far considering that it runs across the entire 13 episodes, only reaching a crescendo in the final two episodes. In dragging out the point as far as the show did I found myself losing interest along the way. In my mind it really shouldn't take 4 hours to tell me that one big thing, and while the romance between the leads, Red and Rit, was something of a salve to tide me over, I kept wanting the show to be about more. The drippings of lore presented in the last arc felt like they were the solution, but at that point in the story that lore was intersecting with the climax of Ruti's arc, which detracted massively from the impact for me.I felt the world-building was lacking slightly. When the fantasy world has a combination of steampunk airships AND future-tech AND magic it sort of makes me scratch my head a bit. You want the things contained within to make some semblance of sense, but here I don't think they do. This isn't to disparage to the lore, whatever it may be, but it's to say that the world sort of feels hollow, like the things within it aren't because of a past society that crumbled to dust, but merely placed there by the author because they're cool. The only heart to be found is in the show's core; Red.Red's relationship with Rit is what saves the show's first half. Their romance is small and understated. It progresses smoothly and in a way that makes sense. It's simple and uncomplicated; the quintessential slow-life romance. Red's relationship with his sister, Ruti, is what almost saves the second half. Ruti on her own is a somewhat compelling character, and her kuudere nature is used to its fullest to express the things that can't be said. Red's devotion to her is also compelling, and the bond between them is tangible and believable. What ruins this completely is the antagonist, Ares. He devolves very quickly into a cartoon-y mustache twirling madman who can't tell up from down and it breaks verisimilitude for me. This is a story that takes itself seriously and when you've got a cackling madman in the middle of it, it's hard to accept the things that are happening especially when the main characters are still as serious as they were to begin with.If I had to say whether or not I liked Shin no Nakama I would say I like it. There's undoubtedly good elements to the show, but as far as recommending it, I don't think I can unless you're really hankerin' for a fantasy romance that develops quickly and you think that spending an entire cour hammering the same point home is a worthwhile investment. I don't, but I can see the argument for it, especially considering the show doesn't really repeat itself in the plot department. All things in moderation I say. a person is other than them.

Shortly after, a woman named Rit, someone whom Red knew from his life in the hero\'s party, appears at his shop and decides to retire from being an adventurer in order to live a life with Red and run his shop with him.While all of this is occurring, especially near the beginning of the show, many episodes are half taken up by flashbacks used to give contexts to relationships or situations. As well as this, at the end of each episode the story turns to the present day hero\'s party to show their situation without Gideon, which, surprisingly, is not an ideal situation, with the man who convinced Gideon to leave the party trying to control the other party members by filling Gideon\'s previous roll (that being a strategist and mediator of normalcy among the odd extremes of personalities the members of the party all bear, as well as the person who keeps the Hero herself grounded).*End Spoiler*Despite telling you a bit about the story, I\'m not spoiling anything too extreme, just the first three or four episodes, so feel free to read my summary even if you do care for spoilers, it has nothing about the end or anything close to the end of the series.This show is about a man who tries to leave everything behind, but while living his dream is eventually forced to confront his past in order to protect the people he loves, not just from external forces, but from themselves as well. There\'s no world saving, no grand adventure forged by destiny, and no demon lord the protagonist defeats. The show is all about being able to live the life you want and create a life meant for you, by you, instead of succumbing to the pressures of those around you and slowly losing your ability to live your own life in order to please those other than yourself.Before I finish this review, don\'t be fooled, this is, in essence, the same formula as an isekai, it\'s just that the world the main character comes from happens to be part of the same physical existence as the world he\'s in throughout the series. It\'s still a guy who\'s way more powerful than he should be for the kind of place he\'s in, and he comes from a completely different ""world"" than the one he\'s living in now. So, though not technically an isekai, it contains much of the same elements. Not to say this is an isekai in all ways except technicality, that\'s not it at all, however, if you happen to enjoy isekai style shows, you will probably enjoy this show as well.It\'s really a great show, with a great message, and a great story. There are long stretches of slow parts in this show, so don\'t go into it expecting a fantasy show like an isekai where the protagonist gains a new ability and has a major battle every two episodes or so. There\'s only one major fight in the entire show. If you\'re alright with that then I sincerely recommend this show to anyone willing to watch it. begins his life as Red.

The story actually moves forward and character relationships are masterfully handled in a mature, natural, and wholesome/cute way especially with regard to the romance. In addition,...it is a fantasy setting and comes with good action. I don't like slice of life shows so I rarely watch them because I find them boring or too slow since usually nothing happens. This show is the rare exception. On top of that it's actually a fantasy show and not an isekai so it gets bonus points for being original.The Details:This show is misleading in the sense that it's a slice of life show, it's actually more than just living the slow life. It's a show about discovering what you really want to do in life, what you want for yourself, and how you want to live your own life. It dives into the dilemma of a skilled adventurer who tries to live a slow, relaxing life after retiring early after being kicked out of the Hero's party. Throughout the show, there are interruptions to his idle life such as events threatening the town, petty or jealous disputes from rivals, and old acquaintances asking for old favors. As a result, it also isn't boring, it actually has a dynamic story as well as enjoyable action segments. The ending was a little bit rushed, but aside from that the show maintains good pacing.Side characters won't be super memorable months after finishing the show but they weren't annoying or written in poor taste, they're actually cool neighbors. The MC and his lover however will be memorable as a testament to their spectacularly sweet budding romance. This show somehow doesn't have a romance tag yet it manages to build up a great couple in less than 6 episodes in a way that's done better than most other romcoms/romance shows. And the romance is handled wonderfully and realistically without relying on anime tropes such as tsunderes playing hard to get, or the generic nerd who turns into a handsome hero who suddenly gets all the girls by simply breathing or saying nice things about their hair from your typical power fantasy isekai. This couple actually has history as a couple and goes through things together as a human couple, blossoming with each further step they take with their love life. It's an equal relationship where both partners want and need each other in their life, as well as one where they don't shy away from holding hands and acting shy as if they were still middle schoolers. Essentially, it's an adult relationship, and we don't get a lot of those in anime these days, so seeing something cute, wholesome, and spicy definitely brought this anime up on my tier list. it is a fantasy setting and comes with good action.

The anime\'s animation, while functional, fails to excel and leaves much to be desired.One of the noticeable aspects of the show is its inconsistent identity. The storyline fluctuates between several genres, making it challenging for viewers to grasp a clear sense of direction. What begins as a tranquil portrayal of a quiet life in the countryside takes unexpected...turns that can be confusing and disorienting.While the moments of ecchi add an entertaining element to the series, they often feel out of place given the overall tone of the show. These instances might be enjoyable for fans of the genre, but for others, they can detract from the coherence of the narrative.The anime\'s downfall lies in its inability to establish a consistent and engaging identity. It ventures into different genres without truly succeeding in any, leaving viewers with a sense of dissatisfaction.

If the main focus was on the development of the relationship between the main characters it wouldn’t be so uninteresting. Unfortunately, it strays away from the most important element all the time and provides an extremely boring plot. And as the show continues, it gets only worse. Episode 12 was such a mess, it is not even worth discussing.Art: 5Art is far from beautiful. The characters are designed...well but that’s the most positive adjective I can use.

I mean yes, if you essentially hate wholesome romance/slice of life, then I understand you won\'t like this. But this anime can also offer something completely different and unique. Although the main focus of the story is the relationship between our main characters, the world and it\'s mechanisms are far too interesting for me to not write something about them. Just the whole blessing system shows us, how imperfect the world is and how unreliable their god is. Blessing is something everyone is...born with and every blessing has its purpose, be it armorsmith, warrior or a thief. And you don\'t have anything to say in this matter. What you\'ll be doing is, basically set in stone from the day you were born. And if you refuse to subdue to these blessings, they will force you by altering your behaviour and personality. If you have a thief blessing but you don\'t want to live as a thief, the blessing will force you to steal, mostly unconciously. This is something that cought my interest. The other thing I loved is a completely new way of seeing the whole ""hero"" thing. In the anime, hero\'s party isn\'t shown as some knights in shining armor. And the hero herself, is something that very intrigued me. You see, a ""Hero"" is just another blessing, but far more powerful than other ones. But everything has a cost. You will gain immense power and strenght, but at a cost of losing your own humanity. Those with the blessing of a hero don\'t need to eat, drink or sleep. They also lose any unnecessary emotions and feelings. That is a price someone pays, just for being born, because you don\'t choose your own blessing.Even though the initial story would probably keep me going, because the romance is pretty good and enjoyable, it was the worldbuilding with its systems and mechanics that hooked me in completely. This one is a hidden gem - literally. Completely new way of viewing the whole ""Hero goes to defeat demon lord"" cliché.

I don't know why so much anime insists on portraying otherwise relatively competent adults as the emotional equivalent of young teens when it comes to romance. I guess we're supposed to believe that adventurers who've been on countless quests slaying fearsome monsters managed to never even so much as kiss another sentient being in all the traveling they've done.So the story basically turns into a woman who had a crush on the protagonist from their previous adventures deciding to insert herself fully...into his life by moving in with him and joining his business, rather than doing something normal like asking for a date. And of course neither one of them talks about their feelings directly, content to just blush and act awkwardly around each other whenever a hint of attraction arises.The fight scenes aren't given much effort either, where you see one power move that immediately brings down the opponent. The scenes feel like they were placed there begrudgingly because some semblance of story needed to be advanced, before we quickly return to the protagonists refusing to handle attraction like adults.The art is decent and the inherent talent skills concept in the DnD setting are a vague move in a novel direction in terms of RPGs, but otherwise this doesn't separate itself from so many tired cliches. into his life by moving in with him and joining his business, rather than doing something normal like asking for a date.

Banished from the Hero's Party (etc.) is an underrated fantasy anime that doesn't feature any isekai aspects. This mix of action and slice-of-life was unique since most anime in the fantasy genre rarely touch on the concept of a slow and quiet life these days. However, that doesn't mean that they don't work the combination of those genres made this series enjoyable. With those in mind, these are the parts of the anime that I liked and what could've been improved more.The plot focused on two stories at once, the Hero...and her former party member living their lives. Even though the main protagonist got kicked out of the hero's party, I like how they managed to supplement it, showcasing how he focused on his retirement from his heroic life after getting banished. From that beginning, the story introduces the other central female protagonist, and things start to get interesting there. Eventually, the hero's journey and the couple's developing relationship merge into one story. I loved how they managed to do that, but the pacing for those events seemed off at times, especially with the action scenes, and it left out a bit of detail from the source material. There were some unanswered questions left out from the thirteen episodes, and I wished they could've covered most of those parts of the anime. Nevertheless, the slice-of-life features can be considered the best aspect of this series.In terms of the story, it's simple, from the long title. The main protagonist got banished from the hero's party, so he decides to live a quiet life in the countryside for his retirement. Throughout the thirteen episodes, the primary focus was the protagonist taking his banishment into stride and eventually getting to live with a beautiful warrior who wanted to be with him. Soon, their relationship blossomed quickly, and the two reunited with the hero, who's also the protagonist's sister. Overall, the story of Red and Ruti was an intriguing part of the series, as it reminds me of a double-sided story eventually merging into one whole plot in total. Once again, it's rare for fantasy anime to also be a slice-of-life series, but it works out so well. I enjoyed how they eventually reunited with each other and let the hero be free. However, the only part that I didn't find most of the action scenes enjoyable, as they were underwhelming at times, and the time I got to know the main couple made me look forward to their wholesome story than any more exciting parts.For the characters, I loved seeing the relationship between Red and Rit getting developed at a nice pace throughout the episodes. I'll be entirely honest, I felt kind of jealous at the chemistry they had, and it reminded me that single, but I still liked their relationship. You can say that their love is the one thing that kept the interest in this anime alive. In terms of character development, Ruti had the best one in the series. It's a nice change to see that the hero needed to save the world doesn't want to be that person, and I'm so glad that Ruti achieved freedom from her blessing in the end. The character design is generic to other fantasy anime, as it features goblins, elves, and even hybrid monsters, which is nothing new to me. However, one of the character designs was changed from the manga from a demonic woman to a goat, and I felt disappointed how they made that decision. Overall, the characters were very endearing, and seeing how much impact they had on Ruti and how the Red's influence is crucial to her life was bittersweet. Red and Rit are definitely in the contender for best anime couple of fall season. And it was surprising to see their relationship eventually reaching to doing the deed, which is rare for me in other anime.My one main criticism is the quality of the animation. I  understand that a slice-of-life series wouldn't be too flashy, but the action scenes are another story. I've never heard of the studios that animated this series, but the fight scenes were too underwhelming to me. The fluidity for those action scenes got cut into slideshow animation at times. But not as much, but this adaptation got created that way due to the budget for the series. Ironically, the slice-of-life moments between Red and Rit were oddly well animated, which is strange, but I didn't complain about it at all. If this anime gets a second season, I hope the animation quality can improve, even if it's a tiny bit of it.The soundtrack for this series is generic. As someone who watched tons of fantasy anime, it's nothing special at times. For both the opening and the ending song, they both match the theme of the anime. Just listening to those songs put me at ease, and I loved how it sets the tone for what to expect for each episode. The opening described how Red and Rit will get to experience the start of a new day while living with each other. The ending felt like the end of the day, and the main couple will eventually take it easy for the remainder of their time together. If this series had more action, then those songs would be out of place with the vibe of the anime. In short, the music was a nice change of pace to the other anime music I've heard this season.Overall, Banished from the Hero's Party is an underrated fantasy anime that did a great job developing the relationship between Red and Rit. It also did a great job portraying Ruti's character development, allowing her to achieve freedom from her Hero's Blessing. The soundtrack and animation isn't the best part of the anime, but I still enjoyed how decent it was, and there is still room for improvements in those aspects. I'm relieved that this series isn't an isekai because I'm starting to get tired of watching many of those despite them being goated. The mix of fantasy and slice-of-life genres in this anime is well done. From how Red and Rit's relationship got further, I'm interested in a second season to see how the story will progress from there. and her former party member living their lives.

Ironically, the slice-of-life moments between Red and Rit were oddly well animated, which is strange, but I didn't complain about it at all. If this anime gets a second season, I hope the animation quality can improve, even if it's a tiny bit of it.The soundtrack for this series is generic. As someone who watched tons of fantasy anime, it's nothing special at times. For both the opening and the ending song, they both match the theme of the anime. Just listening to those songs put me at ease, and I loved how it sets the tone for what to expect for each episode. The opening described how Red and Rit will get to experience the start of a new day while living with each other. The ending felt like the end of the day, and the main couple will eventually take it easy for the remainder of their time together. If this series had more action, then those songs would be out of place with the vibe of the anime. In short, the music was a nice change of pace to the other anime music I've heard this season.Overall, Banished from the Hero's Party is an underrated fantasy anime that did a great job developing the relationship between Red and Rit. It also did a great job portraying Ruti's character development, allowing her to achieve freedom from her Hero's Blessing. The soundtrack and animation isn't the best part of the anime, but I still enjoyed how decent it was, and there is still room for improvements in those aspects. I'm relieved that this series isn't an isekai because I'm starting to get tired of watching many of those despite them being goated. The mix of fantasy and slice-of-life genres in this anime is well done. From how Red and Rit's relationship got further, I'm interested in a second season to see how the story will progress from there."", ""The story isn't the greatest, the pacing have some flaws, but at the end, this is the one and only anime that bring so much smile to my face.I feel genuinely happy experiencing this anime.As I say, the only downside is ep 10-12 where the story kind of go crazy, but not that really. The antagonist is boring af. And the story trope is repetitive and cliche.The OSTs are amazing and really get the mood down.The best part is the relationship between the male and female mc though, it just a genuinely happy wholesome nice romantic relationship for once.Gotta also hand them for actually...developing the mc relationship though, the progression is really nice and good.Overall just a joy to enjoy, if you arent into serious anime right now, I recommend this anime strongly! :)Good times man good times. developing the mc relationship though, the progression is really nice and good.Overall just a joy to enjoy, if you arent into serious anime right now, I recommend this anime strongly! :)Good times man good times."", 'I should mention first that the title of the anime is a lie. In a way it is very similar to the chilling in my 30s series, as both pretend to be chill/relaxing, but instead continuously have a LOT of combat/drama going on for the majority of the episodes. Most of it is low quality isekai template stuff, so don\'t expect anything.SettingIn this world, god gives all living things something called ""blessing"". This is basically your ""class"" / ""role"" in role playing games. your blessing will actually affect your personality while giving you certain buffs and debuffs eg: a sword master blessing will make you...feel happy when you use a sword and unhappy if you don\'t . And finally we can ""level"" up our blessing by killing someone with a higher level than you. there\'s also skills which are separate from blessing.PlotMC\'s sister is hero and they need to defeat demon king. One of the party members forces MC to leave (secretly), as MC is relatively weaker compared to other party members. MC goes out to a remote village and starts a pharmacy. meets a princess he helped in the past, and starts living together. pretty chill until now. and suddenly we have drugs, kids taking drugs, overdosed deaths, overdosed madness where people kill each other, kidnapping, blackmail etc.. well, you get the point. It escalates really fast after episode 3.CharactersThis is a generic show filled with generic characters. Usually, isekai uses some kind of past trauma to create drama, but this show uses the blessing concept. that a person struggling to not let the blessing affect their character.nobody will watch this show for characters, as none of them will be worth remembering even while watching.OverallThe main problem is obviously the generic-ness of the show and how it drops all the pretense about slow life within the first three episodes. and even in terms of an average isekai, i wouldn\'t place it very high. Even after the whole season, i have no idea who the villain of the show is. people die, and smh come back to life by using heal -_-. In fact, in the climax arc there are 3 characters who died once (the demon, 2 members of hero party). So, i recommend not taking this seriously. just don\'t question anything or anyone. just accept that things happen and characters do stuff because we need to move forward until the next episode.If you are bored and just want something as background noise, this is an okay show.

I think what this show does fantastically is it takes a few of the old cliches and flips them on its head like the MC isn't afraid of women! It's both parts slice of life and action/fantasy. The story/lore is really good so far and has lots of character development. The opening song is fantastic, might be one of my favorite anime openings of all time. The animation for the fight scenes is good, every aspect of the show slaps and I really couldn't recommend...it enough for anyone that's looking to add another anime to their lineup.

At first, I hesitate to watch it because I thought it's just the same as Cheat Pharmacist but I am wrong.The romance here is really wholesome and heartwarming, everytime I see them together my mind and heart feel like it's gonna explode with mixed emotions. The plot about the MC being banished from the hero's party is still there unlike other anime that is only relevant from the start and gets derailed from the original plot later. You can still feel the fantasy settings here but have a wholesome romance and slice of life story that you can just enjoy and...relax while watching it.I regret not watching it earlier but it is still better late than never. I highly recommend it for people that want romance in a fantasy setting without strong drama and just a chill and wholesome story. relax while watching it.I regret not watching it earlier but it is still better late than never.

This was one of those shows that, as the season went along and things unfolded, the score started going up. Usually a show catches me with a good strong first few episodes before slowly devolving into lazy writing and tropes to try to give us the safe ""more of the same old thing"", so the score starts to deteriorate as the season goes on.So, for those of you who only watched 2-3 episodes and wondered why it\'s a 9 when it doesn\'t seem like it, trust me... I gave...it a 6 or 7 when it first came out.Story (8/10): The initial premise is an interesting concept. I doubt it\'s a spoiler, since it happens pretty much first episode (and it\'s the title of the show), but the main character was banished from the hero\'s party. He was basically told, ""Hey, look, you\'re a liability to us now.. you served your purpose, now scram"". It\'s a bit of a frustrating moment for our MC, since his sister is the ""Hero"" (and it\'s nice that the MC isn\'t the one who\'s destined to save the world, but the whole Hero\'s Journey is actually just a side-plot so far).The whole story past that is relatively stable although scenes from the Hero\'s party, as well as certain plot elements introduced in later episodes, add wrinkles to this mostly slice of life story. Not much else that can be said without spoiling the plot. Granted, it\'s not a hard hitting plot, but it\'s like drinking a Monster Rehab instead of a Monster. It does its job, just in its own unique way.(As a side-note, it\'s refreshing to watch something relatively novel that isn\'t some author trying to ride the Isekai wave with a ""hey, look, I\'m trying something TOTALLY different with this premise, just trust"".)Art (7/10): Nothing spectacular. Nothing bad. Animation isn\'t something that I\'m falling completely for (but I have been spoiled by Jobless Reincarnation, so I may be slightly unfair to any show this season in the art department), but it isn\'t bad in a way as to be actively detracting from the viewing experience (see: a majority the CG in So I\'m A Spider, So What, especially in the later episodes).We could do with far less fanservice every single episode, to be honest. This isn\'t DxD or Date A Live, where that genre\'s conventions almost necessitate such elements. The story and show itself can survive with a little less of shoving the creative license and interpretation afforded to Rit in our face. Honestly, cheap fanservice like this usually is a staple of shows not good enough to stand on their own; having it here unnecessarily is actually why it loses a point.Sound (8/10): Just like the art, nothing special. Nothing that really stands out in a good or bad way. The OP is bouncy and catchy, but doesn\'t really stick with you. The ED is wistful and almost introspective, but doesn\'t really evoke a feeling that sticks with you after the credits end. (Again, I might be biased slightly, because World\'s Finest Assassin has a banger of an OP that might have set the bar a bit higher than normal.)Character (9/10): This is the bread and butter of not just this show, but the genre itself. A slower, slice of life type show needs a strong cast to support the amounts of downtime between plot events.Red is more than a standard braindead MC that you get in shonen and slice of life anime. He\'s relatively realistic about things and, honestly, feels just like a mood. He isn\'t some teenager with delusions of grandeur, trying to start a rebellion to slaughter the demon lord. He isn\'t some over-confident high schooler, oblivious to the advances of the swath of females he had encountered after X event kicked off the show. He\'s refreshingly low-key and relatable.Rit has her moments of being a little bothersome, but they are relatively muted as well as few and far in-between. The chemistry she has with Red starts off a little weird (seemed to start off as if they were playing a dating sim on easy mode with a head-start), but after that initial contact, the way they grow together is really believably organic.The side characters are what took away a point. The hero, Ruti, has her own set of issues that she struggles to deal with and is a fascinating character in her own right, but the rest of her party could do with a bit more fleshing out. Some of the townspeople in Red\'s town feel almost one-note with little to no time really giving them any kind of purpose other than to progress whatever scene is at hand.Enjoyment (10/10): I give this score with the caveat that I went into this show expecting a fantasy slice of life, judging it as a fantasy slice of life, and enjoyed it as a fantasy slice of life. The first episode basically sets the scene and the mood for everything that follows. It doesn\'t present a big and grandiose first episode hook, only to completely switch gears, lose traction, and completely change the vibe (see: The Detective is Dead). It establishes the premise, the feel of the show, and sets expectations on what kind of journey we will be going along... and it has hit on every note it presented.Overall (9/10): In conclusion, if you are looking for a nice slice of life with a bit of action to act as a foil for the peaceful scenes, this is a solid watch (so far). It doesn\'t stay one-note the whole time and bore you to death with a formula, it doesn\'t randomly change gears into some action-packed shonen, and it doesn\'t go from slice of life with romance to an over-the-top harem. It sets its course, takes us on a journey, and does a darn good job of entertaining us along the way.~UHW it a 6 or 7 when it first came out.Story (8/10): The initial premise is an interesting concept.

Starting off as a relaxed slice-of-life, the stakes slowly increased with episode number until it was indistinguishable from (insert generic anti-demon isekai).I liked the main character because though there was nothing too unique about him, by the same ticket there was nothing to dislike. Kind, not-OP, emotionally intelligent, the only complaint you could possibly have about the character itself is the undiagnosed siscon.By far issue I have with the show is the inconsistency of tone,...content, and pace. Starting out as a slice-of-life, the viewer expects some clever problem solving and a dozen episodes worth of helping the locals and relaxed viewing. Halfway through, things start going awry and hands start getting chopped off and axes start swinging and whatnot.I won\'t lie the idea of an innate blessing that you level up doesn\'t sound unique but it certainly sounds interesting enough to watch. But not in the middle of my chill SOL anime for pete\'s sake.Lastly, the creators should take a long hard look at how character development should work. It felt artificial, more ""told"" rather than ""shown"". It certainly didn\'t help that the love interest had a rushed half-episode of origin before she basically became a girlfriend, or that the assassin character which had so much potential was just used as comedic relief.Art was not my style, but that\'s a personal issue I suppose. I will say that the ending theme had no business being so good. If I were collecting anime themes that would certainly make it into the list.Overall, mediocre and in my opinion not worth the watch.

Our main character, named Gideon, is cast out from his adventuring party. This party consists of Ruti, the hero, who is also Gideon\'s sister, Ares, the party\'s mage, Danan, a martial artist, Theodora, a spearmaster, and Yarandrala, a high elf. Then we have Gideon, a mediocre guy with a mediocre...""blessing"" as it\'s called, but with all his stats at max.

The premise of this anime is an ongoing trend in mangas by the names ""Slow life"" and ""Banned from the Hero Party"" but this anime differs from the others in one sense, it ultimately focuses on the relationships and state of characters such as the development...of the character\'s relationships (Romantic/Familial/Friendship/Hostile) and the characters themselves (discovering there goals and such). Hopefully, the anime does its job flawlessly.The story is demonstrated from two root viewpoints. First, Red (Main Protagonist) living his new peaceful life in the countryside with his newly founded partner Rit (Red\'s potential love interest). Second root viewpoint, The hero party continuing their journey without Red.

It is quite simple, to be honest, and despite what is depicted within the general isekai definitions, there's just not have an overabundance of war or seemingly mundane challenge that gets stale with so many other shows.There aren't an overabundance of tropes and I greatly appreciate that. Red/Gideon is a real guy and doesn't have some sort of either permanently perverse nature that seems irreversible nor is he an idiot like so many other shows portray the male protag as. He is dedicated to a new life and is happy. He has...a woman that loves him and he loves back. They talk about every day and they talk about the future. This feels like a realistic romance. It's wholesome and makes me happy. Rit is one of my favorite heroines ever (my #2 waifu of all time, to be honest.) These people are real and whoever wrote it knew what they wanted. They broke the mold and sure as hell delivered.In respect to all of that, there is a lack of true conflict that kind of makes me feel lost or empty. There is a war against the Devil King that really isn't all that addressed. He shows up at the beginning and at the end when there is no ongoing war. There are low level idiots that are there just to give the characters some sort of perception of resistance, but they're cowards and have no trait of being a threat to anything.The relationship between Red and Rit doesn't face any challenges. They're always on the same page and doing the same thing. It's really disappointing to see that there's not some sort of conflict personally because Rit is a princess.After revisiting this, I have to admit that I am quite satisfied with this. It's a really a nice watch and I certainly would recommend it. It's a nice change of pace.This is a super easy watch, so if you've had a more intense show or something that's not typical to the genre, give this a shot.

After he met Rit..And its not even isekai too, there was no mention even once about reincarnations or smth.So ye, it's simple anime to pass time, dont expect something great out of it.It's just my own opinion. like that power..MC is also not the strongest bust also not the weakers.. like above average, simply wanted live normal life thats all.

It's basically a story about two outcasts who once were involved in god-appointed hero's quest to destroy the demon lord and his armies, but fell out of their roles and found themselves yearning for a quiet life at the fringes of civilized world. Gideon, brother of the hero, becomes outclassed by her other companions in martial prowess and is convinced to leave, in a way that makes the world presume he died on a scouting mission. Rit, a princess of a small militaristic kingdom, is driven out of her country due to succession...dispute and uses her warrior skills as a travelling adventurer. When their paths cross again, they seem to only wish to stay with each in peace, but slowly, their past starts to catch up with them.This series is cliched, really slow and set in a fantasy world with BS RPG mechanics that decides people's destinies, often against their wishes. The writing is very average and the story progresses at snail's pace. If you feel these might be major issues for you, you'll probably die of boredom watching it. On the other hand, the slow, gentle story and slow burn romance are definitely the point here and can be decently satisfying to follow. And even with that slow pacing, the series menages to resolve the hero plot in a surprising way, wrapping up what seemed like an unsolvable conflict with a satisfying conclusion.Honestly, with slightly better writing I would consider this series a hidden gem. The core ideas are more than good – Gideon's blessing being an all-rounder that is extremely versatile, but lacks unique, flashy skills and is thus underappreciated until people feel his absence is a great starting point. The backstory of his relationship with Rit is well-concieved, making their affection believable. The conspiracies they face are okay, along with the whole plot of hero's blessing being more a curse and a burden. It's just all realized in a pretty mediocre manner, with uninspired dialogue and juvenile romantic tension straight out of teen drama. Thankfully the humour is appropriately toned down and the chill vibe dominates the story outside of few dramatic moments, making it all very pleasant to follow if you're in the intended audience.

The wise man would be the only one not affected, that's why he...tries to keep Gideon away from the group so that the heroine can continue her quest.

Even our dreams."" ~May ParkerYeah this anime is just Spider-Man 2. It asks essentially the same questions. If being a hero is an inconvenience, if it forces you to live a hard life that you never asked for, if it makes you give up the thing you want the most, even your dreams, why continue doing it? And the great answer...of course come from May\'s late husband with the famous line: ""With great power, comes great responsibility."" The hero is the only one who can do it, so he has to do it. It\'s not fair, even heartbreaking at times, but a true hero has to live up to that responsibility anyway.This anime says screw that, just live your only life and let other people do the hero stuff, because Spider-Man was made in the mid 2000\'s when adults were still occasionally allowed into writer\'s rooms. I\'m not saying I hated this show, just know that if you\'re here for the plot or politics of an isekai for some reason, there\'s plenty to complain about.But that\'s not why I watch isekai, I watch it to find all the latest waifus.

She may be revealed to be a huge brocon or something somewhere down the line in the original light novel (I don\'t know, haven\'t read it) but this anime adaptation so far just shows her as a regular, non-sexualized little sister character. All very refreshing after watching way too many harem anime.So my advice overall is to watch this show for the cute romance dynamic and the sweet slice of life stuff, and ignore the boring isekai drama in the middle.

On the one hand you have the adventure life and demon war in this fantasy world, focused on the hero party and how the world is affected by this war. On the other side you have one of the best romance shows I have seen in a very long time, even non-anime shows.To start off with the best part of the show, the romance between Rit and Red. This was written in a wholesome and mature way to the point where it seems fantasy-esque because it was that good.

Because of these moments I enjoyed the show so much.Obviously, I mentioned the other part for a reason, since that is not as good. The world building of this story really leaves a lot to be desired.

Even in this final part, where someone is able to copy someone, I have no clue what is happening, which is a shame.But what the show lacks in world building and storytelling, it compensates with the best romance of the year and its amazing realistic characters.

At its core this anime is a romance, with the backdrop of an isekai adventure story. The focus is not on the adventures, but rather on the romance. If you were hoping for a swash-buckling tale of slaying dragons and such, this isn't your anime.I think the main characters are well developed, nuanced, and easy to relate to. I like how its a story of a guy who chooses to chill out and pursue the wholesome pleasures of life. There are moments of action that punctuate that chill lifestyle story, but what...I really enjoy is the interactions of the main character with his love interest and his friends. It makes me smile and feel good and that is what I like about it. Just fun wholesome goodness. The title of the series is a promise to you the viewer and the story stays faithful to that promise without it becoming boring or repetitive.I've watched a lot of the top rated anime listed on MAL, from dark dystopian stories to high adventure, to straight shojo love stories, and this series makes me happy and satisfied in a very pleasant way.

If you’ve been a reading my reviews then you know that I’m not particularly a fan of most...fantasy light novel adaptations, but Hero’s Party is another example of how good character and story writing can help a show break away from it’s mediocre contemporaries and into the realms of good, enjoyable fantasy anime.Formerly known as Gideon, Red was once a member of the hero’s party who was banished to live a quiet life in the frontier and opens up his own pharmaceutical store. Later his old adventuring friend Rit comes across his store by chance and decides to quit adventuring to live with him and help out.It’s a very simple premise which expands in scope as the season goes on, but one which it does very well in my opinion. Red is a kind, mature, jack of all traits kind of character who is well love by his adopted village, but it’s very easy to root for him thanks to his humble personality and his very active nature. He and Rit have really good screen chemistry and I’m glad the show didn’t try to blue balls me for the entire season with a ‘will they won’t they’ cliche, relationship storyline. However, I will say their relationship can sometimes cross the line from being sweet to a bit cringe. Even though they’re both adults in their 20’s they act more like high school romance manga characters when it come to expressing themselves to each other and Rit makes some… questionable foreplay moves when in the bedroom. But when the show gets the romance right it’s really rewarding to watch the two of them get closer and more comfortable with each other and the romance can be genuinely quite sexy compared to other examples set by other shows. Rit may come across as the most manufactured waifu to end all manufactured waifu’s with big anime tiddies, but she's actually a pretty interesting, likeable character and it’s just as easy to root for her as it is for Red.One of my favourite things about the show is how it makes the concept of “skills” interesting. Video game-esque “Skills”, “Leveling”, the concept of “the Hero” and “the Demon Lord” and other light novel fantasy/isekai cliches are some of my pet peeves and this show unfortunately has them to various degrees. However, the show manages to take the concept of “skills” and make them a fundamental part of the world instead of a ‘get-out-of-jail’ card for the writer to fall back on. Every person in this world has a ‘blessing’ which can range from being a smith to thief to champion and they have integral effect of how a person behaves, grows up and even their chosen path in life and interests. The concept of “the Hero” is actually just someone with an all powerful skill of the same name that gives them the strength to save the world, but robs them of other things the blessing deems unessential like, taste, sleep and feelings robbing that person of some of their humanity. I like how the show uses “skills” to comment on whether or not your own personal abilities should define who you are and through Ruti the hero, Reds little sister the show explores what it means to be a hero and whether or not a “skill” should define a person as such. I don’t think I’ve seen “skills” have actual meaning in world since Danmachi which is pretty cool.The art and animation is very nice when the show is going at a slow pace, but as soon as any combat happens it feels like I’m watching characters moving through cement on screen. Movements are clunky and awkward and clashing weapons and magic have no feeling of impact or ‘oomph’. This is a shame. Combat is clearly not the studios strongest area of animation and it really hurts the show, but for the rest of the time it looks great. Vibrant colours and pallets make the countryside look lush and calming and the characters are well designed and expressive.I also think some of the pacing can be sloppy. Episode 2 was a real offender in this regard as half the episode was dedicated to a flashback to introduce Rit, but we had no context for who she was and her relationship with Red who we also barely knew at that point so it just felt meaningless. However, the pacing issues didn’t come up that often so it wasn’t that much of a deal breaker.Like the name suggests this is a slow, chill anime which focuses more on people and their relationships rather than on fighting and big battles so if that’s not your thing then it probably won’t be for you, but if it is your thing then I can definitely suggest giving this anime a go.7/10 Good. fantasy light novel adaptations, but Hero’s Party is another example of how good character and story writing can help a show break away from it’s mediocre contemporaries and into the realms of good, enjoyable fantasy anime.Formerly known as Gideon, Red was once a member of the hero’s party who was banished to live a quiet life in the frontier and opens up his own pharmaceutical store.

Rit may come across as the most manufactured waifu to end all manufactured waifu’s with big anime tiddies, but she's actually a pretty interesting, likeable character and it’s just as easy to root for her as it is for Red.One of my favourite things about the show is how it makes the concept of “skills” interesting. Video game-esque “Skills”, “Leveling”, the concept of “the Hero” and “the Demon Lord” and other light novel fantasy/isekai cliches are some of my pet peeves and this show unfortunately has them to various degrees. However, the show manages to take the concept of “skills” and make them a fundamental part of the world instead of a ‘get-out-of-jail’ card for the writer to fall back on. Every person in this world has a ‘blessing’ which can range from being a smith to thief to champion and they have integral effect of how a person behaves, grows up and even their chosen path in life and interests. The concept of “the Hero” is actually just someone with an all powerful skill of the same name that gives them the strength to save the world, but robs them of other things the blessing deems unessential like, taste, sleep and feelings robbing that person of some of their humanity. I like how the show uses “skills” to comment on whether or not your own personal abilities should define who you are and through Ruti the hero, Reds little sister the show explores what it means to be a hero and whether or not a “skill” should define a person as such. I don’t think I’ve seen “skills” have actual meaning in world since Danmachi which is pretty cool.The art and animation is very nice when the show is going at a slow pace, but as soon as any combat happens it feels like I’m watching characters moving through cement on screen. Movements are clunky and awkward and clashing weapons and magic have no feeling of impact or ‘oomph’. This is a shame. Combat is clearly not the studios strongest area of animation and it really hurts the show, but for the rest of the time it looks great. Vibrant colours and pallets make the countryside look lush and calming and the characters are well designed and expressive.I also think some of the pacing can be sloppy. Episode 2 was a real offender in this regard as half the episode was dedicated to a flashback to introduce Rit, but we had no context for who she was and her relationship with Red who we also barely knew at that point so it just felt meaningless. However, the pacing issues didn’t come up that often so it wasn’t that much of a deal breaker.Like the name suggests this is a slow, chill anime which focuses more on people and their relationships rather than on fighting and big battles so if that’s not your thing then it probably won’t be for you, but if it is your thing then I can definitely suggest giving this anime a go.7/10 Good."", 'I felt like this anime tried to compact many things at once, adult romance, various character development, growing sibling bond, and somehow incorporate some action into it. I would not say it is the worst anime that I have watched but I was I definitely felt disappointed halfway through watching the season.When I watched the trailer I was excited for a non-ecchi, slice of life fantasy, with a little romance and comedy. ( I know there are many people who are interested in this kinda anime ( you do you)  but that is not what I signed up for. I was not completely...incorrect about my assumption of the show but the trailer was also not the best at providing a holistic preview of the anime either.The sibling development was well done, that is to say, that it was clear that person A missed their sibling whom they relied on. This becomes something that becomes too much to ignore and they work together to build back the bond.That being said on the relationship/ romance side I felt like the fact that the MC and ""wife"" attempts at a serious adult relationship was lackluster and took away from the good parts of the anime. There were points in which the two would get ""heated"" however it seemed more like two children who we\'re pretending to be adults. It felt like the MC was taken from a  shounen/ slice of life and plopped into this anime. The depiction of the relationship\'s development was quite segmented. I am not an expert on relationships but I would assume that if you are portraying a relationship in a mature and adult fashion every part of their life would somehow add to the relationship ( as they are learning more of each other). It felt like I watching a slice of life/ fantasy/ action anime then boom relationship. If you have ever watched an American 2010 rom-com I think this anime would fit well into that category. Little development of characters somehow they find each other the movie climaxing in a sexual encounter and/or happy ending. I may be biased because I did not think that the romance aspect of this anime would turn out like this but this is just what I think of the anime.Looking back I wish I knew what I was getting into maybe I would have a better opinion of the anime but the fact that I came into it thinking differently I am disappointed. The anime itself is based on a quite fragmented storytelling style. The use of multiple perspectives especially the perspective of the sibling was something that I kept wanting to watch.Lastly, I wish there was a rating between pg-13 and R. I did not think it was necessary 7 months ago however a lot of the anime that was released recently ( last 6-8 months especially) should be recategorized in between these two or given an R rating. I feel like it would be better to know what you are getting yourself into- but I am sure that the producers had a reason. incorrect about my assumption of the show but the trailer was also not the best at providing a holistic preview of the anime either.The sibling development was well done, that is to say, that it was clear that person A missed their sibling whom they relied on.

But in this case it was implemented impeccably.The MC that we see is someone that is strong but not exaggeratedly, that is smart and know what to do in most of the cases but not most of the time, and also the relationship that he makes with her lover is splendid and feels correct. The MC that is presented is someone with a good hart, that tries to take care of everybody that is around him, but he isn't perfect and all mighty after all, so we see some scenes where he needs help from others and the way that is done feels satisfactory.And as for the plot I have to say that I love it, we always say that the hero is the one that has the duty to save all of us, that the only purpose of their lives is to save us from the darkness and the devil, but we never wonder that if the ones that are gifted with that blessing really want to follow that path, and this anime brings the discussion to the table. Which is not too common to see.Overall, all the character in this work are well done, for example we think that only one antagonist could be in this kind of anime but surprisingly, it does not. The way that everything is developed brings me calm, joy and happiness since everything feels well executed and situations that could ruin the plot do not happen.Definitely is worth the time to watch it since it has a lot to offer, don't have feelings at all.But this wasn't the case since the author managed to find the valance between these two cases, and yeah we have seen some anime that combine these two factors to create a balance protagonist but in some cases it leads to a worse character development if is not used correctly.

I hate writing long reviews unless it is absolutely necessary. So here we go.This anime is severely underrated. If this was released in the spring, it wouldve been rated higher. A lot of solid anime this season so this is facing HARD competition.The story is solid, but contrived. This is the same as ""Drug store to another world"", but a little more serious and has a more rom dram than a slice of life comedy like Drug store.

I havent read the light novel so i cant speak for how good of a adaption this was. But this was clearly very bad done. The pacing was all over the place, they jump from scenes to scenes without break and made it hard to follow and enjoy. The build up for everything was so badly done.Story: 5Very bland and mediocre story. Should had been better if the pacing was properly done but i guess it cant be helped. They most likely wanted to reach a conclusion in limited episode....Art: 4Mediocre art, the fights was badly done and you could feel it. I got headache watching some scene. They most likely didnt have so much budget for this adaption, so its acceptable.Sound: 5Op and ED was good and fit the ""slow life"" premise this story should had been about. The voice acting didnt leave so much to desire, but i wont blame the seiyuu and put the blame on the one writing the scripts for the anime.Character: 5Average at best, felt no attachment to any of the character beside the female lead.Enjoyment: 3The only thing i enjoyed was some lovey dovey moments between or main pair. The rest was awful.It was clear that they wanted to rush this adaption. If this was in a manga format then you could had said it was axed. The director did a bad job and it feels amateurish.

However its probably still a typical Demon Lord v Hero fantasy if Im to be realistic; but I wasn\'t disappointed at all.Art/Sound: I combined this bc like the story it really isn\'t anything that stands out and no where near a Violet Evergarden type, but I don\'t think...that\'s a down side at all and over all it has very pretty moments like any other fantasy anime. Music wasn\'t half bad either.The characters, especially the main characters, are so amazing and have just perfect development for this type of anime honestly it left me just satisfied watching them develop. Also the side character development is very nice too. (～￣▽￣)～Seriously recommend :D that\'s a down side at all and over all it has very pretty moments like any other fantasy anime.

(～￣▽￣)～Seriously recommend :D', 'So I would warn whoever is watching this that the reason I have rated it highly is not because of the action or the plot related to the hero or the demon lord but actually because of the quite deep themes that it covers.First of all the the theme of determinism wherein most people\'s lives are determined from birth based on their blessing. Leaving the timid forced into a life of violence, the adventurous restrained by crafting blessings etc. It covers one of the main plot devices used in a lot of fantasy literature of blessings and path being determined at birth and how in...most likelihood this would cause a great deal of suffering and anguish among those in receipt of it.Further it covers the compounded pain of the blessing forcing a person to act in a particular way according to this blessing, often times against their nature. This is often encountered in anime with reference to nobility and responsibility but this was, I found, a refreshing take on it.Finally and, most importantly, it covers the concept of an almighty god overseeing the direction of people\'s lives. People often revere some omniscient, omnipotent entity with little regard for whether that entity is actually benevolent or not. This show clearly outlines the drawbacks of an entity like this by showing the suffering that can be inflicted by forcing someone to go against their nature to serve as part of a ""greater plan"" to save the world.Ironically the greatest victim of this is the villain of the anime, Ares. Had the ""almighty"" not made the blessing force their wielders to act in a certain way, then Ruti might have wanted to be the hero. Further, had they not mind-controlled their carriers so much, Ares might have been able to accept Ruti giving up her title as hero, or even Gideon\'s place in the party. Finally, the entire plot could have been precluded had the ""almighty"" bothered to give the hero blessing to someone who actually wanted it.This show, viewed in a certain way provokes the argument of suffering versus divinity in the context of ""god\'s plan"".Outside of this the show was pretty mundane with the standard animation, tropes and plot devices you\'d expect from generic fantasy. I only rated it highly because I saw a critique of both the concept of the almighty as well as many aspects of standard fantasy anime. Your experience may differ. most likelihood this would cause a great deal of suffering and anguish among those in receipt of it.Further it covers the compounded pain of the blessing forcing a person to act in a particular way according to this blessing, often times against their nature.

Your experience may differ.', 'This was so fundamentally horrible that I just couldn\'t resist writing a review to recommend people not to watch it. I usually just write reviews for novels as far more time is dedicated to read through a novel and you truly get to get immersed in everything the story has to offer compared to the short-lived and often disappointing format of anime adaptations.This is... really, it\'s almost infuriatingly bad, yet you\'re left feeling more melancholic about how this garbage had resources wasted on it instead.The music is crap. The setting is badly executed. The characters can\'t make you give a single f*ck, not even...one of them. The story is just childish at best and the animation feels both low budget and low skill.We have the protagonist, the dude lacking both will and motivation, who spends every day preaching how abandoning responsibility is great and clearly having no idea of his own worth, not even telling his ""hero"" sister that he was leaving because the most idiotic in the party chased him away. Now he just spends his time in some godforsaken land where he aims to be an apothecary and live every day the same.Then we have the big boobs that somehow found him there and forcibly moved in with no warning. This girl loves him and they quickly start flirting, kissing, hugging and whatever. We get some tiny snippets of backstory every now and then. Overall, she\'s also a boring character we have no incentive to like and that doesn\'t act human in the least.Go on and we have various villagers who are only there to be hurt, healed and be friendly. Not a single one of them has even half decent character development, they might as well be villager A and B.Villains in this story are either instantly finished off or easily screw themselves over, none of them appear particularly evil or interesting. Even demons are either soulless shells or morons that just seem to be yet another stupid human.His sister, the hero, and the entire hero party are also cardboard cutouts. The foolish half-evil but mainly stupid sage who apparently want to get into the hero\'s pants or something, some emotionless add-on heroes and then the hero herself, the emotionless brocon who can\'t do what she wants because the oh-so horrible blessing dictates she be a hero without feelings, completely unappealing.There\'s nothing happening in this story. Nothing. Just some forced events. It\'s painfully slow, every episode seems to be filler, nothing interesting happens and worst of all, none of the characters have anything resembling a soul, it\'s not funny in any way nor does it even have a real story. We don\'t get any build up, imagine suddenly starting an anime at the end of a story and just showing some filler episodes of the after-story.We\'re supposed to care about the characters with just some words. Life sucks for this guy because he doesn\'t have a good blessing, this girl is awesome because she likes the protagonist and has big boobs, this hero is pitiful because her blessing actually secretly sucks. He\'s done so much to deserve this now slow life. Nah, sorry, it doesn\'t work like that. If you don\'t show us gradually why we should like them and build their characters up by the actions they take, no one is going to care about them. This is a story of side characters that aren\'t explained properly, it\'s just shoved down our throat.Adding insult to injury, these characters are basically unlikable from the get go. They don\'t show much in the way of emotion, not a single one of them. All of them are painfully robotic in everything they do. The animation makes a great job of emphasizing their soullessness by being horribly bland, there\'s no real change in expressions, people are just static dolls, even supposedly emotional scenes are ruined by crap skills. They don\'t even properly animate a lot of stuff, like just making fluctuating brightness values for almost static candles, not showing movements, instead just the end position, cutting out most parts and for things like lightning, they just phase in and out 1-2 frames of yellow light at high value rapidly, it also does stuff like just moving around a static hand on a static map, not even changing lighting or perspective slightly. Everyone moves like some damn sloths at best. Truly, the animation serves to make this already bland show a disaster piece of shit, I didn\'t realize just how shit things could get if BOTH story and animation was this bad.Can only believe this was written as some escapist fantasy by yet another overworked japanese dude or just someone jumping on the bandwagon of that cliché. The blessings are just a shoutout to people\'s talents and fates to usually just be a cog in society and the protagonist is simply a burned out dude who has given up on life and is now avoiding reality. Not sure about the studio, but if this is their usual quality, they should shut down or boot most of the staff and hire people that actually know what they\'re doing and doesn\'t do everything they can to cut down on everything that makes an anime an anime, that is, animation.Not recommended, ever.

But this is where the charm largely ends. The narrative often falls flat, except for the fleeting moments when the couple\'s romantic involvement takes center stage, which unfortunately only accounts for a small fraction of the show.The fight sequences are passable, often culminating in one-hit wins over the antagonists. While it could be argued that the fighting is secondary to the romantic and slice-of-life elements, the plot frequently circles back to themes of responsibility, where the...protagonist is called upon to help those around him.The story begins at a party hosted by the protagonist\'s sister, a formidable ""Hero"" whose power is a double-edged sword that threatens her well-being. The protagonist\'s abrupt departure from the party sets the plot in motion, leaving his sister and the party in a state of disarray due to his integral role. His infrequent contact and almost complete disregard for the previous party eventually leads to a rushed plot progression after several boring episodes.The anime introduces an intriguing concept where all beings possess blessings, but this idea often feels underutilized. For example, one could be born with a medical blessing that eases the path to becoming a doctor, but could choose to reject it and become a warrior instead. This theme of self-determination is central to the season, emphasizing that one\'s destiny is not set in stone. Despite his attempts to distance himself from conflict, our protagonist is always drawn back to help others with his formidable fighting skills. Unfortunately, his apothecary only plays a significant role in the story a few times.The animation quality is commendable, as is typical for modern anime. The soundtrack, however, falls short of expectations, which is especially disappointing considering the rural setting of the anime. This, combined with the uneven pacing, detracts from the overall atmosphere and leaves it without magic.Despite these criticisms, I find myself intrigued by the prospect of a second season.

The problem is that this series really has a difficult time keeping up the momentum after...a decent start to their tale.Story: Banished from the Hero\'s Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside tells of an adventurer, Gideon Ragnason, who is part of the ""Heroes Party"".  They\'re basically an MMO group where everyone has very defined roles and the \'Hero\' is his own sister, Ruti, with the goal of defeating the Demon Lord.  Everyone in this world is blessing with a Divine Blessing, which is basically everyone\'s special ability or something that defines their job.  Gideon is defined as a D-Rank adventure, which means he\'s not the greatest party member in terms of physical skills.  When the rest of his party ups their rank above his, one of the members, Ares, deems Gideon unfit to be in the party.  This causes Gideon to abruptly leave the party, create a new name for himself known as Red, and open an apothecary in a small village known as Zoltan.The series itself makes you feel like you\'re watching an MMO because they do so many things that many MMOs usually add in - special abilities, announcing spell casts, naming each Divine Blessing, etc.  Like I said in the intro, this is actually just a fantasy anime that has multiple MMO themes included.  It\'s weird, but really, it\'s just a different world than we\'re used to seeing.  That in itself isn\'t bad.  All major characters have interesting Divine Blessings.  When Red finally starts to settle into his new life as an apothecary owner, Rit, who once travelled with the Heroes Party, seeks out Red and they start to live together in a new life.The start of the story is actually a ton of fun.  Red\'s new adventurer in this, seemingly, quiet town takes some interesting turns and his willingness to help others makes you realize he\'s a fantastic character.  The story takes on a romantic aspect when Rit enters the picture and their goal seems to be going for a really wholesome romance story.  The minor hiccup in all this is that romance is very hit or miss.  Some nail that goal while other moments feel really awkward.  Late into the story, Ruti\'s party starts to get involved with Red and Rit\'s little story, but I was horribly underwhelmed by it.  There are a lot of aspects that feel like they\'re missing important points and the writing in general feels really sloppy.  For example, does everyone\'s weapon have to magically break in the final bunch of action scenes?  The ending is fine so the decent start and poor third quarter balance off each other.  (6/10)Characters: I really liked Red.  He\'s really smart and, a fantastic character to teach us through the story.  He has his own talents that aren\'t really combat driven, and these characters can thrive, when done well.  Rit has more combat experience behind her character, but I feel like they could have shown more about her backstory.  I did find it odd that they didn\'t really do anything special with her offensive abilities though.  Ruti, as said earlier, is the Hero, which allows her to gain immense power, but is unfortunately void of many human emotions as a drawback.  Due to this, she comes as having a bland character, but her condition does improve as the story carries on.Side characters mostly consist of either the heroes party, or villages that interact with Red.  The villagers are all fairly close to each other and it creates a village mostly free of conflict on its own.  This really does link to why the start does so well, but the story starts to fall apart at the back half because the Heroes Party gets to Zoltan, and everything just becomes a mess.  (6/10)Art: I wasn\'t the biggest fan of the animation style here.  The romantic parts actually look decent, but the animation starts to fail during the action scenes, most noticeably during spell casts, which almost never look good.  It just doesn\'t feel like this was given the amount of care that many other series were, especially when you consider this to be a fantasy anime.  (5/10)Sound: The other aspect of presentation - sound - wasn\'t anything special either.  The OST wasn\'t noticeable and the OP and ED play out too similarly.  I wasn\'t the biggest fan of the VO cast either.  Aaron Campbell (Red) was probably the best of the bunch, but Dani Chambers (Rit), Brandon McInnis (Ares) and even Tia Ballard (Ruti) didn\'t feel like they had everything in it for this one.  They all had very awkward moments and the lack of polish kind of matched the questionable art. (6/10)OVerall Enjoyment: Banished from the Hero\'s Party, I Decided to Live a Quiet Life in the Countryside was pretty mediocre from top to bottom.  It had a very promising start to it, but not only did they halt momentum, but the story just had way too many holes in it.  Presentation didn\'t help it\'s cause, as there were too many random blips present.  There were decent moments throughout the runtime, but there weren\'t enough highs to even off the lows.

Still, I don\'t want to wait six months before reviewing.To start, I really love the premise. The MC is the brother of the Hero. On their way to kill the demon lord or whatever, one of the members of the party tells MC that he\'s trash and holding everyone back, etc. MC accepts this and leaves. Most of the time the viewer is following the MC as he goes about his...life, and it has major slice-of-life vibes, which I appreciate. It gives us time to get to know him and the people around him.We also get small glimpses into the Hero\'s party without MC. Things aren\'t great. Seems like everyone loved MC, respected him, and really wants him back, except for the guy who told him to leave. It was somewhat unclear to me, but I believe the Hero didn\'t know that her brother was TOLD to leave. She seems kinda pissed about it.Meanwhile, MC is living his life and having a great time, actually not broken up at all about not being in the Hero\'s party anymore.So far it\'s a very character-driven narrative and I really appreciate that. The character building is on point. A lot of ""adventurer\'s guild fantasy""-style stories are really lazy about writing believable characters, recently. But the shows that have stood out have focused more on the characters and their relationships than on the setting/only big fighting scenes.I expect there to be more shonen and less slice of life in future episodes, but I like where it\'s going. life, and it has major slice-of-life vibes, which I appreciate.

That kind of plot seems to be getting some traction and it also got me interested. Like, we get curious on an MCs story after leaving the party, right? That's why we're even here. Basically it became like a SOL. However, his past won't just let him have a quiet life. So he has to face them once and for all.ART:Very simple Imo. Not good, not bad.

Unfortunately that didn’t last for long. After Rit showed up it was just a big hot mess.

If anything I’m only left with 1000 questions that never got answered. Why are there good and bad goblins? What is really a...Blessing?

UGH!I watch a lot of tr@sh anime, but this one was on another level.*spoiler alert*The only positive thing in this show: I did kind of enjoy the romance part.

Big bad demon king wants to conquer the world and the heroes want to defeat him.But this is only the secondary basic setting of world building.

On first glances I had really low hopes with whatever this anime was to offer. The rating definitely lowered my expectations as well. I told myself I would drop it if the anime wasn't as promising. That seems to be the opposite though.Genre.I am really into my romance-anime mood and this definitely satisfied my crave for a romance anime. The romance and slice of life genre was absolutely marvelous. Why? For one the romance didn't feel as forced as most other anime. It was written absolutely well imo. The scenes between Rit and Gideon felt natural and was really nice....This anime obviously has a brother complex and it wasn't annoying like how other anime do it. The focus on a simple life is well balanced with the history of Gideon's life. The adventure genre was good, nothing to note but satisfies if you are in a mood for an isekai-like world. A basic fantasy world of heroes and demons that didn't go wrong I suppose. The action was nice as the animations were quite mediocre.Story 8/10It's nothing special but it does the work. The flow of the story wasn't irritating though I would probably enjoy it more if it touched more upon the members of the hero party. The only con of that is that it wouldn't be a 13 episode series and would've dragged it to a 24 episode series. That being said the anime isn't about the hero party but is about Gideon's life and I think it was done perfectly as I don't have any complaints for it.  The story take's a turn of that cliche hero anime where the MC has that sense of pride of being the hero and having to live up to that name. This anime, well if it isn't obvious from the title takes the other route. What if you were manipulated by your teammate? What happens to your team without you? From then on the anime's-well written story stuck to it's idea throughout.Character 9/10I can't say I enjoyed the characters personalities in an anime in a while. This anime really did it. Gideon isn't your pushover MC that constantly looks like a wimp and acts like a 12 year old boy, Rit is the main female lead with a really clear written romance story, she also isn't too afraid to project her feelings and accepts the fact she is in love with Gideon from their first meeting. Ruti, might just be one of the most well written kuudere characters i've seen. With her emotions surpressed due to the hero blessing, The ending made it feel perfect for her character development. I like her brother complex too, it's not forced.I absolutely loved this anime. The romance was perfect. The way they hinted a next season is also very cool. That is my only doubt about this anime though, I can't see the direction of the sequel, it feels like the anime had a good ending already. I am left wondering how a sequel would compliment the idea and name of the anime. That all depends on how they write it huh, only thing you can do is read the LN/manga or wait for the new season I guess. It's a good anime to waste your time with if you want a romance anime. No forced harems, just good ol' romance.Would give it 8 but the anime wasn't memorable enough, I simply just enjoyed it lol7/10 This anime obviously has a brother complex and it wasn't annoying like how other anime do it.

If you're here for fantasy and action then you might want to reconsider. The show does have this but it's not the spotlight.I'll be giving a very brief overview of the first two episodes, so there will be spoilers from here on,...you've been warned.The show follows the story of our first main character Red. He is the brother to the Hero Ruti, and he has been banished from her party by one of the other members.We join him in a lazy backwater region called Zoltan, where life is slow and things are peaceful. He has been taking on low rank adventure requests gathering herbs, saving up to one day open his own apothecary. By the end of episode one he's achieved his dream and opened his shop - this is the beginning of his slow life.It's at the beginning of his new life that we're introduced to our next main character, Rit.Rit is an old comrade-in-arms from Red's days as part of the Hero's party. Now that she's reunited with Red she decides that she wants to stay in Zoltan with him and give the slow life a try too. To that end she convinces Red to let her stay with him in his new shop and help him run it.This show is at it's strongest when it's focusing on Red and Rit. The chemistry between these two characters was the greatest source of enjoyment for me while watching this series. They're both cute and charming, and watching their relationship blossom over the course of the series was a delight.I mark the show down a bit for some lack-luster art and animation in places. It's never bad, but it's not often good either. The SFX and music weren't anything to write home about either. Very middling.There's more I could say really, but I think I've said what I really wanted to communicate. you've been warned.The show follows the story of our first main character Red.

When it puts the focus on this slow life part, the anime is at its best. Romance, making food, interacting with friends in the village, having fun and such. However a large portion of the show is dedicated to a more typical isekai plotline with sinister plots, demons, magic power and combat at the forefront. These parts are not executed very well and detract from that which the show should be about.The reason these parts do not work well is first and foremost terrible worldbuilding, but outside of...that character interactions/relations are a bit odd. To explain this spoilers will be required.Spoilers:In this world each person is born with a ""blessing"" which in essence is a class like knight, carpenter, thief and such. To level these up one must kill, yes kill, others with blessings. This fact is randomly mentioned in the middle of the anime and serves no purpose in the rest of the show. If everyone needs to kill in order to improve, even the people with non combat blessings, this should have MAJOR implications on society. It is however merely brushed off by the show.The blessing you get quite literally determines your future in this world, as you can only really become better at what your class is, you cannot achieve much outside of it. This a major point in many a character arc in the show. Your blessing even influences your mind to do certain things. However this is used only when convenient to the story and ignored otherwise.As for the existence of the hero, who abandons her role as the hero and chooses not to go out and slay the demon lord. This seemingly has no consequences at all. Then what was the point in the first place? Just another case where something in the world building is set up just to be forgotten or abandoned right after.These are just some examples of how this anime fails in world building, however characters also suffer from writing problems.The biggest problem is in the very event that this entire anime is about, the hero being banished from the party. One evil member tells him to leave, and basically on a whim he just decides to do so. Later it is shown that all other party members consider him very important and are all good friends with him, especially the hero who is his little sister. It makes NO sense at all for him to leave just like that without a word. All things considered he practically abandons his little sister, who we are supposed to believe he really loves.All in all this show is quite fun when it delivers on what it should be about. However it spends a lot of time setting up a story that is falling apart due to the myriad of issues with it, and in the end only serves to drag the show down.

Most of the adventure, plot progression & character development happens here, but still contains moments centered on slice of life & romance. The genre-switching between scenes can be a bit abrupt & so may feel like a disruption to the main adventure or romance (depending...on which you're expecting from this anime). The pace also significantly speeds up, & some leaps in world logic & character motivations are made towards the end. This may make the plot feel rushed & confusing.Characters:Character development for the main characters (Red & Rit) is mostly shown through their backstories, which only occupy a short segment of total viewing time. Hence, they may feel a bit flat/lackluster as characters to some.Arguably though, the main focus of this anime is on the blossoming romance between Red & Rit - how they first meet, reconcile their differing lifestyles/worldviews & build a life together. It's a straightforward romance made up of everyday moments, with no melodrama or mind games.Interestingly, it's the supporting characters who undergo the most character development, especially Ruti whose motivations, relationships, dilemmas & growth we get to see in the second half of the series. The majority of the plot & drama centers around this.Themes:Stays true to its premise of living a quiet life away from the Hero's party. This anime may appear simple at first glance. However, a deeper look will reveal that it explores themes like fate vs free will, responsibilities/expectations others place upon us vs our own desires, talent vs diligence in achieving mastery, following our calling vs appreciating everyday pleasures to find fulfilment in life.Art:Adequate to portray the everyday life of Red, Rit & the townsfolk. Good enough where it counts, e.g. a few of the battle sequences, how Ruti's character development is conveyed through her facial expressions. A bit heavy on the fan service in some episodes.Sound:Nothing spectacular. A pretty chill OP & ED. Voice-acting was good enough to make the romance, conflict & battle scenes convincing.Overall:• A blend of everyday romance & simple adventures in a fantasy world. Could leave you feeling dissatisfied if you're looking for the emotional kind of romantic drama or a story-rich adventure with a complicated plot/mind-blowing twists.• More focused on the character relationships than character development.• Unique in its take on the usual overpowered hero trope, which it then uses to explore deeper themes.

However, Red’s life is anything but slow, as he encounters numerous obstacles that could hinder his slow life in the countryside. It also features a side story with the Hero, Ruti, on a quest to gather a party to defeat the Demon Lord.Story: 5The story in this show is mediocre at best. It’s basically about how each person has a special gift, or “Blessing” that makes them good at something. The show explores a common trope in Japanese culture...in that it should be okay to move beyond the confines of one’s chosen role and live life as you see fit. Japan is a very collectivist society, so seeing a message like this is not surprising.The main reason why people came to this show (myself included) was the romance between the main characters Red and Rit. The romance was the only good thing about the story, in my opinion. Anytime the story tried to get serious and dramatic, it came off as boring, average, and contrived. There was nothing there to make the story interesting. Each episode (except episodes 10-12) are comprised of 80% boring drama and 20% romance. Episodes 10-12 are purely drama, which make them easily the worst episodes of the season. The show would have benefitted greatly from more slice of life moments and romance and little to no drama. Some drama is okay to keep things interesting, but the drama needs to be interesting in the first place to make the show better.Art: 7Overall, when used in the slice of life/quieter moments, the art is nice. There are scenes in this show that are very well designed and drawn, such as some of the scenes that take place at night. The characters are all well drawn. Rit is especially beautiful (and voluptuous). She is the best designed and drawn character (other than maybe Ruti) in the show. However, the art begins to falter when action occurs on screen. The action is poorly animated and framed. The fights are all boring and poorly choreographed. The fights feel lazy and rushed, which only brings down the show more. Once again, the slice of life aspects of the far exceed any drama or action the show tries to throw in.Sound: 5The sound is average. The music and sound effects aren’t bad, but they’re not good either. There is nothing that makes it stand out in any way. The music is a list of extremely generic tracks that simply exist to meet the mood of the moment. Sound effects are pretty standard. Nothing spectacular in that department.Character: 6Overall, I liked most of the characters in this show. The main ones seemed to have some sort of character growth throughout the show, especially Ruti. Of course, there are some characters who are extremely one-note (mostly the side characters).One of my biggest problems with this show is how the writer’s treat Rit’s character in the show. After introducing her to the audience, we learn why she arrived in Zoltan and her history with Red. Her and Red’s relationship soon escalates after that. Once their relationship is established, however, Rit’s character development seems to fall right off a cliff. She becomes a one-note fan-service character with a large boob window for viewers to gawk at. We see her in numerous nude scenes just because she can be. She feels more like a plot device for developing Red’s character than she does her own character. It’s quite a shame, as she is perfectly capable of being top tier waifu material, both in her character and looks. If there is a second season, she needs to have significant character development alongside her inevitable nude scenes. While she had one character flaw that she was trying to overcome throughout the show, it wasn’t really wrapped up well enough in the last episode.Enjoyment: 6When there were happy slice of life scenes and romance, I immensely enjoyed the show. Whenever there was drama, I really didn’t like the show. The best way to watch this show is to skip all of the drama and just watch the slice of life moments and romance.Overall: 6I came back to anime after a long time to watch this show after seeing clips of it online. I am definitely disappointed that the show didn’t live up to my expectations of being primarily slice of life, but it had its good moments. If the show was purely slice of life and romance, it could easily be an 8 or 9/10 for me. On the contrary, if the show was strictly drama, it would probably be a 4 or 5/10 at best.I definitely can’t give this show a 7/10 or call it “good,” but it has enough good moments that make me believe it is an okay show for the most part. Therefore, I’m giving this show a 6/10.If there is a season 2 planned, I hope the team behind the show can improve it for the future. in that it should be okay to move beyond the confines of one’s chosen role and live life as you see fit.

Was watching it worthwhile? Undoubtedly, the series as a whole is pretty good.The first few episodes of the show were somewhat slow-paced, focusing on Gideon's attempts to lead a quiet life after being expelled from the Heroes Party by opening an apothecary and moving to a small town. One of the series' positive aspects was the Blessings concept, which gave the show a little more depth as it began to explore topics like fate, beliefs, etc. Blessings are seen in this world as God's chosen route that a person cannot deviate from and must follow for the rest...of his life, these themes were only briefly discussed, but they can nevertheless teach viewers one or two valuable lessons.The show also has a fair amount of sugar because Rit and Red began to live together and manage the apothecary together, notwithstanding their speedy courtship was out of this world. Rit and Red are the primary focus of the story throughout the majority of it, and while there are little disputes in the town occasionally, the more significant stuff happens in the final few episodes.Although the way it ended wasn't the best, it wasn't all that horrible either. Overall, it isn't really memorable enough to stick in viewers' minds for a long time. In particular, the final episode's easy release of Ruti by Red after the Sacred Avenger reactivated her Hero Blessing could have been made better by a more competitive battle between Red and Ruti, who are siblings.Regarding animation and character designs, it is what you would expect from a fantasy program: the colors are vibrant; the monsters look like the monsters from any other programs, which is not particularly eye-catching; the weapons, armor, and buildings are also fairly standard, with the exception of the Elven Ruins, which resemble something out of a space movie. of his life, these themes were only briefly discussed, but they can nevertheless teach viewers one or two valuable lessons.The show also has a fair amount of sugar because Rit and Red began to live together and manage the apothecary together, notwithstanding their speedy courtship was out of this world.

Where the protagonists spend all day doing boring everyday tasks instead of fighting epic battles and solving ancient mysteries and whatnot.The title of the show really spoils this idea quite well. ""Slow Life in the countryside"". No kidding. It\'s slow alright.There\'s so much slice of life, there\'s hardly anything left beside it.There\'s a surprising amount of backstory given and characters explored, yet nothing really happens. And nothing really makes you care for any of these people. So it feels so very wasted, when all the cool stuff...gets a few minutes of flashbacks and exposition, but the actual ""in the moment"" story is utterly mundane and boring slice of life.The high ratings for the show kinda baffle me. Who exactly wants to watch a show with a fantasy action adventure protagonist, who simply bakes cookies and collects flowers one episode after another and awkwardly tries to handle a romance interest?This show is basically ""what the NPC\'s get up to when your main character is out adventuring"", lol. gets a few minutes of flashbacks and exposition, but the actual ""in the moment"" story is utterly mundane and boring slice of life.The high ratings for the show kinda baffle me.

So how did this show measure up to those two standard? Pretty damn good. I gave it an 8/10, although the true score is more 7.5/10, but since there isn't an option for 0.5 points, I rounded up.So what makes this show so good? There's a few, but I'll name 2 reasons why it's worth watching.1.) The characters are really well written. The MC Gideon or Red, is really likable. He's kind of like if you and I were thrust...into this world and kicked out of the hero party- well yeah why not settle down with a beauitful girlfriend and start a business. I also like that he isn't cliche. He isn't dumb/oblivious to obvious signs, especailly when it comes to his love life. He's also pretty strong, but at the same time pretty weak compared to the hero and his other team members. His gal is Rit, and she is also amazing. She's very forward, which is an A+ for me. Those two's relationship mostly carries the show. There's also plenty of character development and a peak into their past, which makes their actions more heavy. Speaking of which, I really like the hero Rit. Maaann they really did a great job with her development. At first when you see her, you might think oh boy another cute loli hero, but no- they actually make her story really interesting.2.) The world this anime is set in. The way humans get their powers is through Blessings, but there is a twist. I won't ruin it, but the more the show revealed, the more I wanted to know! It's quite different from any other fantasy world I've seen, and brings up many good delimmas.So what are the weak points? Well, there really isn't a true villain. We don't even get to see the Demon Lord. Also, halfway through the series, it kind of drops off because they go into a rather...pointless storyline that I think could've been cut out completely to make more room for Red/Rit/Ruti's development. The ending is solid. Nothing special, but it leaves a lot to wonder, and I would definitely watch a season 2 if it gets made.I don't wanna bore ya any more than this, but if you want to watch a laid back and different fantasy anime, this one hits the spot.

I started it last night, went to sleep, woke up, and immediately kept watching. The story is fantastic and makes sure not to give you too much anxiety, even in the most dire situations. The art was amazing and really helped give you that lazy town feel. The sounds were realistic. The characters were masterfully planned out, watching each of them change was satisfying (Mild yet obvious spoiler: especially Red and Rit’s relationship developing and the tragic downfall of Ares). I...enjoyed every second of this anime. Not once did it feel boring or dragged out. I love wholesome animes and this delivered on so many fronts. You can usually tell how good a fantasy anime is gonna be from the creatures/monsters that reside in the world as well as the quality of fights and this anime has all that down to a T.

The second half plays some pathetic attempt at a story that is equivalent to putting ideas in a hat, shaking it, then giving a 5 year old child 2 seconds to memorize them before coming up with a story. I understand they may have been trying to incorporate an intriguing story into the already expected elements of an isekai show, but man was it absolutely terrible.Taking a break from...the slice of life you get thrusted into this side plot of investigating this drug which gives people an extra blessing but makes them violent, created by an evil demon who somehow isnt evil and after getting found out by another demon who reveals that the drug is actually great for unlocking human potential he escapes and informs the hero who gets... You get the point, I hope. The author tried to flip the script but was just reading it upside down the whole time. It makes no sense and focuses on such uninteresting topics pushing the demon king out of the story and thrusting in whoever women the mc finds himself in bed with.Moving on to the main character and fan service extraordinaire Rit, she is as one dimensional as expected(could be biased as I just didnt like her tbh). While working as an adventurer she runs into Red who she developed a crush on in the past and proceeds to drop everything in her life to be the main character in his,quite crazy even by anime women standard if you ask me. While she does actually make moves which I appreciate I just dont understand any sort of appeal for her that doesn't exist between her shoulders and stomach.If she was just used for fanservice that's fine but she constantly needs to be validated that the mc likes her which is just annoying considering the fact that any normal human would detest her for her creepy actions. She also gets shoved into the main story by being connected to the main villain but all she does is rant about friendship, make sub par fight scenes and get beaten up for the mc to be faced with a tough choice. Again mentioning the story but if she just stayed the one dimensional puppet she was supposed to be then it would be fine but the author decided against it trying to make her likable which in my opinion backfired.Overall just covering the main things i disliked about this anime the experience is like someone tying your shoes for you to go walking with them, then once they're done you stand up and immediately fall over and realize they tied your shoes together.Story:2/10Characters:4/10Animation:4/10Music:4/10Fanservice:6/10 the slice of life you get thrusted into this side plot of investigating this drug which gives people an extra blessing but makes them violent, created by an evil demon who somehow isnt evil and after getting found out by another demon who reveals that the drug is actually great for unlocking human potential he escapes and informs the hero who gets...

I thought this was a really good anime. I agree that in terms of story it feels like fillers but I think that’s because the point of the anime was to discuss an idea. That idea being about figuring out your “blessings” and learning how to use them. As well as whether you need to use them. Red is a guide, essentially a mentor that help people understand their “blessings”, and how they will influence the individuals life. There are a lot of characters who feel that because these blessings are given to them, that they have to follow...them. That being said I wouldn’t call this a deep anime simply because the message is kinda obvious from the start. They aren’t really subtle about the message they are trying to present. How ever I really liked it. I think it definitely deserves a much higher rating. Though that is just my opinion based on the fact that I prefer anime’s with some type of message or anime’s that explore ideas rather than a good shallow story line. It’s get tiring watching anime’s that make super complex stories but have no real message or idea they are trying to explore. I think this anime is great because they don’t bother developing the characters, the idea doesn’t need the characters to be overly complex. It’s not about the individuals, it more about the idea of blessings and the way they influence our life’s. them.

Our MC our boy Red Aka Gideon is convinced by some dill hole in the party that he has met his skills cap and can’t keep up with his sister (the hero) or the party anymore and that he should leave. Long story short he sets off with a new name to start his new life. An S-tier adventure whom once traveled with the destined one to defeat the Demon Lord and everything standing before them. Is now opening an apothecary shop and living a simple life. The story telling had great elements where we would go back in time...to when he was in the party with the hero. We got to see so much of the past that it really felt like this season is the second season and we already know all these characters somehow.The romance in this was top tier, I like the story of Gideon and Rit it felt like one of those stories from a show that you have watched in the past where one of the MC's meets a girl on their travels and they instantly have a huge connection and hit it off, just to see them separated by the end of the episode/arc because the main plot/adventure needs to go on. But in this you actually get to see those two finally come together after the main quest is over and actually end up together. So heart warming and amazing.The art and animation was great. Surprisingly this anime has a little bit of gore, which was pretty dope to be honest. At first it seemed like it was going to be just a straight feels good romance anime until you see someone getting their upper torso punched threw by the hero and blood splattering all over the wall and floor! The action scenes in this were top notch with full animation with each sword swing, punch and kick. This anime felt like it was going to be like “Hidden Dungeon Only I can Enter” which is an anime I like, but they really took some short cuts on the fight scenes and focused on the jiggling of the girls boobs and size of the MC’s harem in that anime. It also gave me feelings of SAO at parts. When the MC and heroine are alone and living their lives while the hero's party was still on the front lines, it felt like when Asuna and Kirito when they took a few weeks off the front line to have their honeymoon on floor 22.

Red, formally known as Gideon has been kicked from the “Hero’s party” which led him to seek a quiet life amongst the commoners as the title very well implies. From there he makes the choice to open up an apothecary and uses his skills that he acquired from his past life as a knight to gather his supplies from forests where monsters roam…owl bears to be specific. LmaoThis is also where the term “Blessing” would be introduced, the fantasy element of the series aside from the setting. Within the story, every living thing...whether it be humans or animals, are given a Blessing at birth. Of course some are stronger and more resourceful than others. Blessings are not so straightforward as a power or ability per se but the influence to it. For instance a Blessing of “The Champion” would push you to obsessive over succeeding with ambition. Or a “Wise Blessing” would drive you to read and seek knowledge. It also has a huge impact on your personality as well. Interesting right? I will leave as to what blessings the characters have out of this review for your enjoyment, watch to find out!This anime also has one of the most wholesome romance of the genre, Red is accompanied by a former acquaintance that adventured with him previously. Rit. She is a popular adventurer that joined Red’s former party for aid to stop the war with the Demon Lord. They met once again after Red leaves and together they make the choice to work together for a peaceful common life style springing a cute wholehearted relationship between the two. Having a casual aspect as a series, these two are the center point of it all.The plot comes with his former comrades noticing after him being gone that he was the “glue” that held everyone together and without him everyone and everything is falling apart. So they go out to find and recruit him to their party and wish to go back to the old good days.The anime hasn’t finished airing just yet, but its worth a watch with how things are playing out as of now.

The relationship between Rit and Gedeon started quite early. The pacing of their love was really good and their love was well developed (even though the dialogues between them were avarage). They even had the balls...to commit heresy by not stopping with hot steamy handholding and a kiss. Like you know what teen would do more than that? None, I suppose.Sarcasm aside, it was refreshing to see a couple who acted like people would in real life, despite how generic they were. It was really joyful to watch how they just enjoyed they slow life and the company of each other without worring much about anything. There were a few advanture, but they were so powerful it was like a little bit of holyday fun for them.I can recommend this to everybody who wants a little bit of relaxation. to commit heresy by not stopping with hot steamy handholding and a kiss.

Literally everything that wasn't part of it was poorly written, thus giving the overall score only a 7. The last episodes didn't make sense, were very skippable and villains were extremely bland.Overall it felt like they could've focused on the apothecary life and romance instead of throwing ideas out there and leaving them undeveloped. Main characters like Ruti and Rit could've used more explanations on why they act and feel the...way they did in the show, the village could have more time to get properly developed and the overall world building around that remote area could've added different unique perspectives that come with living a calm lifestyle such as Red's. way they did in the show, the village could have more time to get properly developed and the overall world building around that remote area could've added different unique perspectives that come with living a calm lifestyle such as Red's."", 'Extremely stupid story about a guy who for some reason abandon his little sister, whom he trained (supported) to become a hero.

That slow pace of life with only a few action scenes plus some romance really worked, as it was like the epilogue of a great adventure story.  Nothing was amazing, but it was super entertaining.

It has the perfect balance of action, romance, drama and mystery, but the central point of this anime is largely misunderstood. It\'s not about the romance or the action or even the drama - although there\'s plenty of all of it in the storyline and it\'s nicely interwoven to keep your attention!No, the underlying theme of this anime is choosing your own path in life. I love the way the anime forces you to register the struggle each character has accepting their current role as something they don\'t like or want to do, but are resigned to, as...a facet of the character.I love watching the slow realization that, although their god gave them a ""purpose"" in life, it isn\'t set in stone. S/he also gave them the free-will to choose what they do with their blessing. They aren\'t being forced into anything they don\'t want to do.I also love the fact that the male MC\'s rank and blessing are kept a mystery until the very end, even though it\'s quite obvious throughout the anime that he is much stronger than he pretends to be.

I think they did a good job selecting voice actors for the anime as well. I don\'t know about you, but in some anime the voices just don\'t seem to fit the characters. Sometimes, I can barely stand to watch anime because the female voices are too grating on my ears or the males sound like girls.

Now since this is a slow pace anime it doesn´t mean it won´t have action, which in this case it does and does a decent job of implementing it by the use of flashbacks or current events in the story., SO IF YOU ARE SOMEONE THAT LIKES FAST PACE AND ACTION PACKED ANIME PROBABLY ISN´T FOR YOU.Now the story is about a heroes party on a quest to defeat the...Demon Lord, which is pretty cliche in most fantasy or isekai animes, however the direction that this story takes is non that I´ve seen in other anime/manga. The MC is part of the heroes party but for some various reasons he quits the heroes party to go and live a slow life in a remote backwater town. So far it´s not that interesting however once the story starts to dwell onto the power system known as ""Blessings"" you start to notice why the MC is the way he is and what his ambitions are because of it.As the story goes on we get introduced to the MC´s love interest (Rit) and let´s just say there´s MAJOR developments in their relationship unlike most MC´s love interest in other animes. My boy is the DEFINITION of CHAD at times you could say their relationship is too sweet but you´ll keep on wanting to see more as their relationship progresses. I just hope more animes/mangas would take note of how it´s done here. Instead of the usual MC that just gets flustered from just making eye contact with girls or is just too scare to even hold hands or have a normal conversation. The guy actually takes initiative in some moments and accepts the love interest feelings. The story doesn´t just focus on the romance of the MC and Rit. It expands it by having a series of events in town that creates drama to keep us entertained as well as showing us the dynamics of the heroes party after the MC left and the current state of affairs. As well as introducing us the MC´s sister which we come to find SHE IS THE HERO!!!. I will say the story does take a bit of a dark turn when it comes to explaining the sister´s backstory but that just builds more emotions with the charcaters.Further on in the story we see how the world works and why the ""Blessings"" are such a big important factor that affect daily life is!. Now I really like how the author makes these such ""Blessing"" seem on the surface to be this miracle from the gods but they are much deeper than we think. It does question ""Free will"" and ""Fate"" but is essential in my opinion since it explains certain actions and behaviour of the characters across the series.Overall, I highly recommned this anime, if you have some spare time or just wnat a purifying anime this is it!!!

The problem lies within the ""big plot"".While being generic, it somehow still doesn\'t make sense. The twists are hard to follow and the hype/drama moments completely miss and come out laughable since it takes literally 2 minutes of screen time between a character making an epic entry to the scene and being dispatched. Some of the characters\' motivations are an absolute mystery (either because it wasn\'t adapted or the original source was...missing it in the first place), while the others\' are not only primitive but also repeated over and over again.The last arc\'s mess could be written off as a poor adaptation, but the whole drugs/politics bulshittery makes you really question the quality of the source material since it didn\'t have nearly as much moving parts and action scenes as the latter arcs while lasting approximately as many episodes and still being the same mess.Overall it\'s disappointing on multiple levels at once: first, how much of a confusing mess everything beyond the slice-of-life bits is in this show; and second, how much better this anime could\'ve been if the story (and by that I mean the original as well) only stuck to either the chill slice-of-life or the character drama instead of trying to implement everything at once with some kind of evil-plot epic saga on the side — it just seems redundant, especially with such poor execution.Despite that, I must admit that I had a blast with first 5 episodes or so. missing it in the first place), while the others\' are not only primitive but also repeated over and over again.The last arc\'s mess could be written off as a poor adaptation, but the whole drugs/politics bulshittery makes you really question the quality of the source material since it didn\'t have nearly as much moving parts and action scenes as the latter arcs while lasting approximately as many episodes and still being the same mess.Overall it\'s disappointing on multiple levels at once: first, how much of a confusing mess everything beyond the slice-of-life bits is in this show; and second, how much better this anime could\'ve been if the story (and by that I mean the original as well) only stuck to either the chill slice-of-life or the character drama instead of trying to implement everything at once with some kind of evil-plot epic saga on the side — it just seems redundant, especially with such poor execution.Despite that, I must admit that I had a blast with first 5 episodes or so.', ""It's taken me a while to write this review as this anime left a sour taste in my mouth when I finished it.I will keep this spoiler free, as I will talk about things in an extremely vague way.I'll be blunt, this starts off as a nice comfy anime, with Red and Rit settling down and enjoying their slow life together.As such, we have the making of a romantic slice of life comedy in a fantasy setting.That is what we were mostly expecting, that is what we were sold on...And then the second half of the series happens...It starts off 'fine' but it marks the...start of the shift away from being a comfy romantic slice of life comedy.The really bad part is the last few episodes, where everything is thrown out of the window.Pacing is gone, a coherent plot is gone, all set-up is gone. These episodes feel like they belong to a totally different anime.This series was on pace to being a good anime, but the second half saw it start to decline, and then the last few episodes are just so bad that it irreparably tarnished this series.

Absurd premises. Why did the MC left then? No idea, the plot doesn't explain with logical consistency.And lets talk about plot inconsistency.

Like how? Are their day made of 240 hrs?"", 'Shin no Nakama is ground zero for the new subgenre of isekai shows in which a member of the Hero™’s party gets kicked out for one reason or other and has to start a new life on their own. Shield Hero is arguably the principal precursor of the genre proper, but Shin no Nakama is the first official title on the list.Nowadays I am often left to wonder why I decided to watch any given show, because from the moment I write down a title on my to-watch list, until the moment I actually get around to watching it, years pass – routinely. As such,...I often forget what was behind the original impulse. Fortunately, I have a good idea how Shin no Nakama found its way on my list. The show was pretty popular in 2021, when it was airing, and plenty of people seemed to be very taken with Ruti, the Hero™ character, spamming my FB timeline with all manner of screenshots and memes of her. I vaguely remember thinking her design was cool, and so I decided to one day give it a shot.Watching this felt like rewatching Chillin’ in my 30s. If anything, Shin no Nakama felt like the beta version of Chillin’ – much of the same, just less polish and skill. As such, I really don’t have much to say I haven’t already, so I encourage you to read that essay for a more detailed analysis, for effectively everything I’ve said about that one applies here.The only real difference is that Shin no Nakama feels a lot more amateurish, as though the team behind it weren’t quite ready to put out a show for TV broadcast. A lot of the facial expressions looked rather janky and did not fit the voice acting, especially in the series’ more dramatic moments. Still, it’s a generally nice-enough looking show.Chillin’ also felt a lot more down-to-earth and believably wholesome. Not than Shin no Nakama isn’t also mighty wholesome – it is. It just feels less competently put together. A lot of the verisimilitude or lack thereof comes from the design of the protagonist. Dariel literally looked like a regular dude in his 30s. Gideon, or Red, as he calls himself since his exile, by comparison sports a much more LightNovelGuy™-type look to him, sharper textures, sleek eyes, spiky hair, the works.Shin no Nakama also attempts to create a bit more dramatic tension by way of a plot device that is supposed to pose a philosophical question to the audience. What is more important? To do what you choose of your own free will? Or to do that which you are destined for? I didn’t personally find that whole shpiel terribly interesting, but your mileage will vary.Lastly, while the romance was a welcome and important element of Chillin’, it was not the main element. Here, the OTP is put front and center much earlier and takes up a lot more oxygen. In some ways, this show doesn’t go as far with its romance. Yet again, in other ways – awesome ways – it goes so much further.What can I say? The Japanese government really wants weebs to leave their basements and have sex. Nippon needs babies!

So terrible that it has prompted me to write my very first review. I find it jarring that majority of the reviews on this anime are mostly positive. Did we watch the same thing? Am I stupid? Did I watch the wrong anime?From the first episode to the last, this anime brings nothing. The animation, art style, soundtrack, characters, and plot are just... bad.The animation is very slow. The fight scenes make...One Punch Man season 2 look good. The art in the anime feels as if everything was colored using the fill tool in microsoft paint. There\'s no shading, color variance, or detail in the designs. The backgrounds look similar to popular 2000s children show, Caillou.In the later episodes of the anime, it is implied that the weather is cold. You would genuinely not know this if the characters did not say they were cold. The background is vibrant, the grass is green, the trees are blooming, the sun is in full brightness, and the female characters look like they\'re about to go to the beach. How the hell does this imply a wintery, cold season? Snowflakes are literally animated over this vibrant warm background. It\'s just weird.The soundtrack. If I had one positive thing to say about this anime, the opening is a banger. Its the most well animated portion of this anime and its really catchy. That\'s it. The rest of the soundtrack throughout the anime is fucking terrible. The rest of the soundtrack is not memorable. The soundtrack is really loud. Background music is meant to be in the fucking background. Why the fuck is the background music louder than the characters talking?The characters. The characters in this anime are uninteresting and not memorable. Every character is a typical anime trope. Red - secretly powerful white knight good guy. Rit - typical protagonist love interest. Ruti - the ""hero"" of this anime who doesn\'t know how to socialize. Ares - bad guy because evil.The plot. What the fuck happened to the plot. I thought this was supposed to be a laid back anime about a character living a simple life. How did we get to a terrible action anime about a character who doesn\'t want to be the hero anymore. I went into this expecting a slice of life about the main character being banished from his party. The anime tries to be dramatic and rope viewers into the uninteresting ""blessings"" in this world. How some blessings result in evil urges, or others dictate your occupation and lifestyle. Bad guy do bad thing because they\'re bad. That\'s the main antagonist of this anime.In all, I knew this anime would be bad based off the title alone. I hoped it would be so bad, it might be good. Think Domestic Girlfriend, Redo of Healer, Future Diary, all objectively flawed, but still entertaining. So bad, but you can\'t stop watching. Unfortunately, this anime isn\'t like that. The story isn\'t interesting, the artwork looks like it was done in microsoft paint, the soundtrack is overbearing, and the characters are cringe. This anime is just bad.

Aki no Kanade,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29513/Aki_no_Kanade,"[""This movie is as sweet as it is short. Sadly, we don't get more than about 20 minutes to get to know our main character, Aki, and her story growing up. The story starts showing us how her life has turned out as a professional drummer, and then jumps back to show us how she was introduced to, and came to love, the art. We follow her life from this point and watch her as she grows up.It's a cute personal story, focused heavily around the points where drumming has affected her life. I think the main point that can be taken from Aki no...Kanade is to follow your dream and work hard to make something you love a reality, and not stopping at the first hindrance. It doesn't offer too much else really; it's charming, it's comfy and it's worth the 20 minutes it takes to watch.As arbitrary as number-ratings are, MAL has them, so I will use them.Story 7 - Art 8 - Sound 8 - Character 8 - Enjoyment 8. None of which I feel like I need to justify with an explanation.

Okay I guess.', ""Here we are at the end of this year's film festival week. Aki no Kanade\xa0was created as a part of 2015's Anime Mirai project. For those of you who aren't familiar with what that is, it's designed to train young animators. Harmonie was also created as a part of it, just for the 2014 Anime Mirai. JC Staff headed the project. Yes, the Toradora, Azumanga Daioh studio.Story:We open with a drumming performance. Then we cut to the performers having some beers and chatting. One of them, Aki, seems to be feeling down. Probably because all of them have to have side jobs. The next morning...she gets a phone call from her former teacher asking her to return to her home town in order to teach the drums. She agrees and quickly takes the train back.The biggest flaw with this film is simply that it tries to do a bit too much. There's this ongoing theme about past traditions being lost. There's also quite a bit that ties into the difficulties of pursuing your dreams as an artist, specifically a musician in this, in the modern world. And all of that gets tied into flashbacks about how Aki became enamoured with the drums. And this isn't a decent length film. It's about as long as an ordinary episode of an anime. Which, basically, means that it can't handle all of those ideas in any amount of detail. So, we get a cursory handling of the topics that basically relies on them being immediately relatable. Which, to be fair, they are.That being said, what we do get of them is really well done. You get enough of a glimpse of Aki's troubles as a musician to make it relatable. You see enough changes to convey the idea of traditions being laid to rest in the name of progress. And you see enough of Aki's journey as a musician to give you a decent idea of what the drums mean to her. And it's good enough that you want to see more. Seriously, I would watch a full anime that was just this as a more fully fleshed out narrative. It also does have a good amount of charm to it.Characters:The main focus is on Aki herself. And she is a very strong character. Her arc of returning to her roots and regaining her passion is well handled. The characters around her are, fortunately, developed enough that they have verisimilitude. They might not be the most complex characters of all time, but they have enough to them to make them feel like real people. And they're probably the best you'll get from a twenty five minute film.Art:I'll give the young animators full credit on this one. The film is well animated and the art just looks great in general. With nice backgrounds, good looking musical performances and characters that look pretty nice. About the worst it gets is that the driving animation is a bit hovery due to them not liking to show the wheels.Sound:JC Staff got some strong actors. Satou Rina takes the leading role. Nakahara Mai & Kugimiya Rie take secondary roles. And they all deliver strong performances. The music is really good as well. There are some nice, traditional drum performances.Ho-yay:Aki's friends, Megumi & Akane, hang onto each other in a way that's pretty homo-erotic.Final Thoughts:Aki no Kanade\xa0is a solid short film. For twenty five minutes, it does everything it needs to do and handles its themes as well as it can given the time constraints. I quite enjoyed it. Ultimately, I give it an 8/10. she gets a phone call from her former teacher asking her to return to her home town in order to teach the drums.

Which, basically, means that it can't handle all of those ideas in any amount of detail. So, we get a cursory handling of the topics that basically relies on them being immediately relatable. Which, to be fair, they are.That being said, what we do get of them is really well done. You get enough of a glimpse of Aki's troubles as a musician to make it relatable. You see enough changes to convey the idea of traditions being laid to rest in the name of progress. And you see enough of Aki's journey as a musician to give you a decent idea of what the drums mean to her. And it's good enough that you want to see more. Seriously, I would watch a full anime that was just this as a more fully fleshed out narrative. It also does have a good amount of charm to it.Characters:The main focus is on Aki herself. And she is a very strong character. Her arc of returning to her roots and regaining her passion is well handled. The characters around her are, fortunately, developed enough that they have verisimilitude. They might not be the most complex characters of all time, but they have enough to them to make them feel like real people. And they're probably the best you'll get from a twenty five minute film.Art:I'll give the young animators full credit on this one. The film is well animated and the art just looks great in general. With nice backgrounds, good looking musical performances and characters that look pretty nice. About the worst it gets is that the driving animation is a bit hovery due to them not liking to show the wheels.Sound:JC Staff got some strong actors. Satou Rina takes the leading role. Nakahara Mai & Kugimiya Rie take secondary roles. And they all deliver strong performances. The music is really good as well. There are some nice, traditional drum performances.Ho-yay:Aki's friends, Megumi & Akane, hang onto each other in a way that's pretty homo-erotic.Final Thoughts:Aki no Kanade\xa0is a solid short film. For twenty five minutes, it does everything it needs to do and handles its themes as well as it can given the time constraints. I quite enjoyed it. Ultimately, I give it an 8/10."", ""Story: 8Art: 7Sound: 7Character: 8Enjoyment: 8Overall: 6Yeah that may be confusing, 3 out of the five categories are 8of 10 and the other three are 7 out of 10 but overall it's 6/10? Well that's because Aki no Kanade ruined its ending. Basically this pro drummer in Tokyo goes back to her hometown to revive a drum festival, most of the episode is a flashback to her old drumming days as a child and that's fine, actually I liked the flashback and it really made me like her as well. But the thing is that after she gets to her hometown, instead of building up...and making the characters go through some sort of hardship to revive the festival, it literally just happens. And also there are some unresolved issues; this one guy who has had a crush on her for like four years straight and her father who didn't like her to be a drummer but just randomly comest ot the festival, their relationship was broken from the day her father had told her that drumming was useless and he never came to any of her performances, and not once did they show her and her father reconciling, instead they just skip it completely. Look, I know this was a competition entry of sorts and was only allowed to be 23 mins long, but with a few tweaks here and there it could have easily gotten an 8/10 from me whilst sticking to the given time limit.All I can say is, if this was turned into a 12 ep anime, with its potential, it could have been great. and making the characters go through some sort of hardship to revive the festival, it literally just happens.

Objectively, this OVA would probably get a 9/10. However, I loved it enough that I gave it a 10. If you have a problem with this scoring system, feel free to express that.I just finished reviewing Charlotte, which took a lot of time and energy out of me. This time, as a way of spiritually cleansing myself of that show, I am reviewing something that I actually really like. There aren't too many spoilers, simply because there isn't much to spoil. It's only one episode. This anime is about a girl who...likes to play the drums. The rest of the synopsis is on the page already, so I'm not spending time talking about it here.Plot: 10/10With this being a one shot OVA, the plot is very simple. There just isn't enough time for a deep, complex story full of twists and turns. However, that does not make it bad. There are things in it that admittedly are kinda stupid, for example when the stage breaks right before they're about to perform the drum festival. Like really? Did they not check beforehand for any signs that it was unstable? And what caused it to collapse in the first place? It stood up fine in the strong winds of the typhoon the night before. Maybe it was weakened by the wind and rain? But there still wasn't any obvious reason for the collapse. These are just speculative defenses. It gave a good reason for why the festival didn't happen anymore. Who'd want their kid to be there? I mean it almost killed at least three little kids already. But the cause for it is kinda stupid. Regardless, the plot is strong and heartwarming. The ending feels nice and was conclusive enough.Characters: 9/10This is where the OVA really shines. The characters in this are almost all interesting in some way. However, there are a few that are kinda iffy, which is what keeps this from being a solid 10. Let's start out with out main character Aki. She's a girl who's currently a professional drummer in Tokyo. In this short 22 minute OVA, we learn about her backstory, motivations, family situation, and friends, giving us a deep understanding of her character. Given that every other character is basically a side character, they don't get that much development. One of my favorite characters in the whole OVA though was the boy (who's name I forget) who sat next to Aki when in their first lesson preparing for the festival. His awkwardness around her at first felt so realistic. He kind of reflected my personality at that age. Especially the scene when they're in middle school and he is going to give his button to Aki, but then chickens out at the last second and runs away felt a lot more human and realistic than him being 100% super smooth guy. It made him more sympathetic. The other characters with names, Megumi and Akane don't really have much personality. They're cute and charming and Akane's skull necklace is so fucking cool, but they're really there just to be Aki's friends. This is fine since this anime is only 22 minutes long. They don't need to be deeply developed because the story doesn't focus on them. Aki's dad is what brings down the score a little bit, simply because of my personal feelings. I just flat out didn't like the dad. Without sugar-coating it, he was a dick. I mean, I get that he didn't like her playing the drums, but seriously? Not only did he not see any of her performances, he didn't even see her off at the train station when she was leaving for Tokyo. He doesn't even greet her when she returns home after 15 years. Thankfully, he shows up at the final performance at the end of the OVA, which redeemed him a bit in my eyes. But still. What a dick.Art: 8/10The art in this was decent. It wasn't beautiful, but the scenery was pleasant to look at and the girls were very cute. And let's be honest, cute girls is enough to score any anime an 8 on artwork right?Animation:I don't usually talk about animation, but there's something I'd like to point out that I thought was a nice touch. When the girls play the drums, their mallets actually come down and hit in rhythm with the audio. The animators didn't need to do that, but they took the extra step and made it look more realistic. Reminds me a lot of Kyoto Animation.Sound: 8/10Literally nothing to say. It sounded good. I liked the voice acting. I'm sorry I'm really bad at writing about sound.Aki no Kanade is a perfect example of what can be accomplished in a single episode. The characters (at least the important ones) are fleshed out, the story is interesting, and the ending is satisfying. I recommend this anime to anyone who hasn't watched it.

It's a true masterpiece in my opinion."", ""A simple but superbly-done story about a 25-year-old Aki Miyagawa and the events in her life that brought her to pursue a career in drumming. The bulk of this short film is set in the past, seamlessly transitioning between different stages of her life to tell her story.There are two main conflicts: one implicit, internal conflict about self-worth, and another explicit, external conflict between Aki and her father who's disappointed in her career choice. The internal conflict takes the helm of the story, but it's shifted aside rather quickly in favour of the other and it's a little oddly-done, though it's not necessarily a negative.That...sort of summarizes the flaws with this film, because it's basically just rough around the edges and holds up quite well otherwise. The same applies to the art/animation and characters. Aesthetically, the film is incredibly polished and vibrant, looking like it's straight out of Your Lie in April. Everything is beautiful. The characters are handled as well as they could've been within the 25-minute time frame. Many of them are fairly one-note but in a way that they each complement the story a bit without interrupting the flow or direction of the story.There's nothing much else to say. It's a great film with a few small missteps here and there, but no pressing issues. sort of summarizes the flaws with this film, because it's basically just rough around the edges and holds up quite well otherwise.

Don’t get wrong, the movies are not bad… just mediocre.Have you ever see a movie and something stupid happed; something that doesn’t make sense, you ask yourself why it happens and answer is “well, y it’s a movie”. You haven realize (or don’t want to accept it) but  suspension of disbelief has die...in front of your eyes, in that moment, the  30-40 minutes that the movie has left  will be a tedious job ratter that an entertainment. Things like “my plan depend of this bottom, when I push it I win and you lose and … oh you fire at the bottom, now a will not be able to push it, now we will go with plan b that is the real climax of the movie”. This happens in the first movie (Appleseed 2004), without spoilers i will say that i didn’t care in what follow that scene. Every cliché of sci-fi, cyberpunk and action movies will be developed during the entire series.The original OVA of 1988 its the best movie, its mediocre, but mediocre 30 years ago, its a masterpiece, (adding that i watch this one  in third place), Deunan doesn’t fight between being a badass and a damsel  in distress for Briareos, they’re just a team , there is a debate of Olympus as a necessary evil ratter OUR ONLY HOPE, even the death of nameless characters matters more, because  are presented as uncontrollable casualties, and not the “people dying, shit gets serious” way.I guess I should talk about Alfa. It’s Metal Gear (Revengeance to be specific) direct by Michael Bay, its one hour dubstep video with a couple of cool designed characters (designed, not develop), and you can’t complain about dubstep,   the soundtrack of all four movies is nothing more that whatever people was hearing a that time (like I say entertainment for a wider audience). Appleseed isn’t bad, none of the for movie are bad, but don’t compare it with Ghost in the Shell, don’t compare the bioroids with the ones in Blade Runner (this ones are flat and un-dimensional, their emotions have being restricted so they have an excuse), don’t compare soundtrack, visuals, story, nothing with the big names of this genre, Appleseed will always lose, its not bad … Just Mediocre. in front of your eyes, in that moment, the  30-40 minutes that the movie has left  will be a tedious job ratter that an entertainment.

It had an advance digital release on July 15, 2014. The movie is set in different series of events, so you will not have to watch alternative versions of it, which aired a long time ago, only to understand it.Appleseed Alpha focuses on the early days of Deunan Knute and Briareos in the 22nd century, as they start their journey throughout the ruins of New York in search of the mysterious city called Olympus. Deunan Knute and Briareos are hired by criminals to help them deal with the robots that seem...to hinder them a lot. On one of these missions, our duo encounters Iris and Olson, who are on a mission, too. It is later revealed that Iris and Olson’s mission is somehow connected with what Deunan and Briareos are looking for.Appleseed Alpha’s weakest part is, of course, its story-line. One can write a novel simply by listing things that the story-line of Appleseed Alpha does not explain. And believe me, there are many aspects this movie does not touch upon. Indeed, it has one of the worst story-lines you will ever find, but the good thing is that you will not have to watch prequels, read manga, or look for some additional information only to understand it. No. Appleseed Alpha relies only on a) animation and b) soundtrack.All in all, I would not argue that this movie has, perhaps, the most stunning animation I have ever seen in my life and that its soundtrack is amazing, too.

I do, however, have a positive bias towards the sci-fi, cyberpunk and post-apocalyptic genres in general. I have no strong opinions on CGI. I knew nothing about the film before watching it, but had a vague memory of someone telling me that it looked pretty good. With that in mind, this is my short review:The aesthetics impressed me. The enviroment, sets, landscapes or whatever you want to call them, are appealing in the post-apocalyptic way.Quite a few cool action sequences, explosions, gun fights etc. Entertaining and well made!Characters look cool...and the dialogue is ok - but don't expect too much when it comes to depth.I ended up caring little for the story, I was more invested in the cyborgs, the action and the landscape design while watching this.I'd say: If you like the genre, think this looks somewhat appealing and need some entertainment, chances are you'll think it's ok - kick back and relax with some cyberpunk action. It won't change your life, but you probably won't feel mad you'll never get those 90 mins back either. and the dialogue is ok - but don't expect too much when it comes to depth.I ended up caring little for the story, I was more invested in the cyborgs, the action and the landscape design while watching this.I'd say: If you like the genre, think this looks somewhat appealing and need some entertainment, chances are you'll think it's ok - kick back and relax with some cyberpunk action.

It's basically an action flick.I do think it has a better dynamic between Deunan and Briareos, but the whole plot and characters are pretty basic - Deuman design got pretty dumb too using some tactical gear the protects her back and shoulder but has a huge cleavage to show boobs, this kind of fan service is quite pathetic in my opinion. What really impressed me is the CGI, it is quite an eye candy, this movie has fantastic looks and...it kinda compensates for all the rest, I'd give it a 7.5 but since I cant it's an 8. it kinda compensates for all the rest, I'd give it a 7.5 but since I cant it's an 8."", 'Yikes is the best word to sum up Appleseed Alpha.This alternative story takes place in what looks to be the most cliché post-apocalyptic world with a cast that is equally cliché in every way possible, from the misunderstood pretentious villain who wants to ""control"" the world through destruction by justifying pseudo-philosophical beliefs that don\'t even apply; to the damsel in Distress troupe and most annoyingly the main cast have so much plot armour that it would make a Battle Shonen protagonist envious.Most combat encounters are also ridiculously scripted, and nothing feels natural. No amount of battle tactics or thought matters because almost every...combat scenario has some sort of ""coincidence"" that occurs to either get the main cast out safely or to further push the narrative with villains who apparently can teleport and kidnap characters off-screen.Typically, animes attempt to hide where the narrative is going to keep viewers excited and on their toes; Appleseed Alpha, however, does the opposite but tries to play off story elements as if they\'re surprises. This is called bad writing.Additionally, the main issue with the story and combat scenarios is that many events throughout this movie could easily have been avoided if the characters hadn\'t been intentionally made dumb, blind, or conveniently deaf to make the plot work.Honestly, the only good part of Appleseed Alpha is that it is beautiful for its time. It looks like a video game, and its art style is quite unique, but sadly, that is not enough to save the anime from a low score as the music wasn\'t very good; as we know, music is vital to give scenes emotional weight. Instead, the selection of soundtracks often ruined the suspense of some of the darker scenes and made battle sequences feel dissonant to what was really happening on screen. Whoever thought it was a good idea to have dubstep play during serious and dialogue-heavy scenes needs to reconsider their creative career, as it made their movie a worse product and took away from those scenes; it\'s a shame.Conclusion:While the Appleseed series isn\'t the best in the story department and is often littered with a ridiculous amount of coincidences and clichés, this one takes the cake. In simple terms, Appleseed Alpha is a bad anime and is easily the worst movie in the Appleseed series. I wouldn\'t even recommend this anime movie to hardcore Appleseed fans, as it\'s that bad. combat scenario has some sort of ""coincidence"" that occurs to either get the main cast out safely or to further push the narrative with villains who apparently can teleport and kidnap characters off-screen.Typically, animes attempt to hide where the narrative is going to keep viewers excited and on their toes; Appleseed Alpha, however, does the opposite but tries to play off story elements as if they\'re surprises.

Battle Spirits: Shounen Gekiha Dan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/6901/Battle_Spirits__Shounen_Gekiha_Dan,"['First of all, I apologize for my bad English.Battle Spirits: Shounen Gekiha Dan is an anime series centered on the card game ""Battle Spirits"" and is, to this day, one of the best anime of the genre.Art: 8. except for the dated CGI, the whole series is quite beautiful, even if the animation is not spectacular, it is quite pleasant to watch.Characters: 10. wow. Of all the card anime I\'ve watched, I can easily say that ""Gekiha Dan"" has one of the best cast of characters, Dan, for example, is awesome!Sound: score 7. The soundtrack is okay, not the best thing in the world, but...the opening and closing themes are good and punchy!Fun: score... 10 ! Not much to say here.Conclusion: don\'t skip watching ""Battle Spirits: Shounen Gekiha Dan""!!! Every episode is worth it, I guarantee it! the opening and closing themes are good and punchy!Fun: score... 10 ! Not much to say here.Conclusion: don\'t skip watching ""Battle Spirits: Shounen Gekiha Dan""!!! Every episode is worth it, I guarantee it!', ""This story starts with Bashin Dan who was taken into another world by siblings Kajitsu and Yuki, after dan pursues Kajitsu when she defeated him. At first it does seem ordinary and confusing. This confusion persists only for the first episode as the scene of Dan defeated by Kajitsu was shown at the beginning of the episode. I did not get to understand when and how these two siblings come across with Dan. I was in a dilemma that it may be a prelogue to the content of the episode. It  seems as if the scene is fastforwarded. But from Episode 2 it captured...my interest and till the end of the series it is too good. Kajitsu calls Dan as red soldier and in subsequent episodes there will come 5 more soldiers who came from Earth like him to Grand Rolo. All of the 6 soldiers (including Yuki) had to win over otherworld king who abuses his power by torturing the otherworld original people.Art:  It is good. But at the same time this anime series is not available in good quality in online. It's video quality degrades by the end of the series. But story development made it possible to adjust with this. One of the amazing thing of the series is that the spirits and their fighting is shown fiercely. None can take their eyes from the heated battles. Graphics were used well to make it touching and emotional intensity.Music : First Opening song is good and also while battle seems to be intensely in favor of our hero, then the background music is superb. I got immersed with our hero group fighting style.Characters: It is the only anime for which i can not pinpoint one character as good or more positive than others. Every character is shown sympathetic in their own way. For example, Leon is one of the three heads under other-world king, whom one thinks as overambitious. But when it is shown that his desire to have power is to overcome the low status which he experienced in his own era, one can understand how a person's economic status affects the course of action he takes. Every character in the series is needed.Overall Enjoyment : I scored it 8 because of the quality of the video i saw. But it is wonderful Battle Spirit series, which overcame all the flaws of the prequel Battle Spirits: Shounen Bashin Toppa my interest and till the end of the series it is too good.

Along with 5 others, where they are core soldiers with a color-soldier, where they are the ones who can become the king if they win against the otherworld king, or in short the chosen ones.The battle system- when a character takes damage you get hurt with pain. The battle is super easy to understand it\'s always explained. Draw step, core step, refresh step, main step all of that, probably forgot one. Just follow along and you will not have any problem, like how did he beat that.Cgi...better- than past, I watched 480p choppy on youtube and could tell real video source would be way better, I couldn\'t find it anywhere else, you probably will have better chance.""otherworld"" is a place where everything is decided by battle spirits.

Biohazard: Degeneration,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3446/Biohazard__Degeneration,"[""&quot;A perfectly realistic story on bio-terrorism.&quot;Biohazard: Degeneration (aka Resident Evil: Degeneration) is the first full length CG animated film fully based upon the Resident Evil game series. Starring the hero (Leon S. Kennedy) and heroine (Claire Redfield) of Resident Evil 2 (for Play Station), Degeneration is a film much anticipated by fans. Please note that the live movie trilogy is unrelated to the games beside the borrowed character names and the fate of Raccoon City.Story:There are quite a bit of background story to understand if one wish to fully understand the movie. Taking place seven years after the events in Resident Evil 2 (one year...after the event in Resident Evil 4), the demands to reveal the truth of what happened at Raccoon City continues to heat up and an extremist ended up threatening to release the T-Virus to all major cities around the globe, turning all population into zombies.A few years after Resident Evil 2, the company responsible for the outbreak in Raccoon City (Umbrella Cooperation) was in complete ruin after their stock prices plummeted and legal proceedings against them. After the downfall of the Umbrella Cooperation, many ambitious businesses try to take over the leftover viruses invented by the company which lead to many political and social unrest. The story in this movie will be focusing on one of these companies that took over what's left of Umbrella Cooperation.Animation:As stated earlier, the film is fully animated in CG thus fans can expect the familiar faces to remain the same as in the games (though I find Leon's face slightly different than in Resident Evil 4).In terms of animation quality, it is without a doubt better than the cut scenes from Resident Evil 4. But there are still much room for improvement. Take this, this, or even this for comparison, there are simply much better CG films out there. Resident Evil: Degeneration simply can't beat this level of CG.*note* In case people are wondering, the images above are from Mobile Suit Gundam MS IGLOO 2: Gravity of the Battlefront.Sound:While the ED song is nothing out of the ordinary, the sound effects in the movie is very worth mentioning. The gun fires, explosions, even the water rushing sounds are very realistic. In terms of the character voice acting, it should not be a surprise that the main voices are the same as the games (ie. Leon is voiced by Paul Mercier, who is the VA in Resident Evil 4). There is a Japanese dub version as well for those who enjoy Japanese voicing over anything else (but I have yet to see that version, so I'll not comment on it for now).Character:In addition to the return of Leon and Claire, we also see other familiar faces from the games (not going to spoil it for you, go watch it yourself). But perhaps what was most disappointing was that Ada Wong (Leon's &quot;partner&quot; in both Resident Evil 2 and 4) did not show up to aid him. Other than that, everything else is pretty average with a decent among of character development and backgrounds for the main movie characters.Final Thoughts:As a Resident Evil fan since its debut in the mid 90s in Japan, I had very high expectations for this game. In some sense, it gave me most of what I wanted to see. Although there's just so much more room for improvement ranging from the graphics to character to story plot.Lastly, I would like to say after what Leon had been through in Resident Evil 4, the event in this movie should be child's play for me (at least there's no chainsaw or nasty parasites this time :P) after the event in Resident Evil 4), the demands to reveal the truth of what happened at Raccoon City continues to heat up and an extremist ended up threatening to release the T-Virus to all major cities around the globe, turning all population into zombies.A few years after Resident Evil 2, the company responsible for the outbreak in Raccoon City (Umbrella Cooperation) was in complete ruin after their stock prices plummeted and legal proceedings against them.

That said, this movie really feels more like a long trailer for the upcoming RE:5 than an actual movie.  The story's basically the same thing as most of the games: two characters, Leon and Claire, are propelled through a series of action packed gunfights with zombies and all sorts of twisted T and G virus mutants.  While some of the earlier fight scenes are nice,  the latter half of the movie has a dreadful amount of drama in it. I...watched the dub, which was just horrid. Besides the fact that the lip synching was really off, which I kind of expect when it comes to CGI anime,  the faces weren't able to hold a wide range of features, and that makes all the characters look like dolls when they're trying to convey emotions.The art itself was decent. It's certainly no more advanced than Square Enix's previous Final Fantasy movies. Degeneration actually looks a lot more like a really nice X-box 360 ingame cutscene to be honest. Lets face it: these graphics are really only a little bit better than the game will look.  The graphics on this movie are pretty sorry for a movie coming out recently. Some of the characters have rather jerky animations, too, and it gets really noticeable when you see the crowds. Some things look really fantastic in this, though: billowing fire and explosions in particular.The sound was decent, I have no real complaints. It didn't wow me or anything, but it got the job done. Some of the instrumental music was decent, but the guitar riffs in some of the later parts of the movie weren't really necessary.Character is where it gets interesting, sort of. If you're already a RE fan, there's a few nods to the players out there. Once again, Claire gets stuck with the kid, while Leon's off attempting to seduce the lady-cop, Angela.  Leon's aide Hunnigan has a cameo,  but the real lady every fan would want to see never makes an appearance.  I don't know why Capcom chose to keep Claire from really getting into the action like Leon (she goes through almost half of the movie without a weapon), but I thought it was a really poor decision.I had fun with this, but I'd imagine that if I weren't already a fan of both horror movies (not that this was all too gory) and Resident Evil, I wouldn't have cared for it as much. Still, its not too bad, and its a good way to get friends to watch anime (possibly). watched the dub, which was just horrid.

But, after watching this...thing... I have to say that I am mega-disappointed.The story started rather nice, but after about half an hour it got very very lame. Lots of uber-predictable and silly scenes like, for instance the water-kissing scene or the matrix bullet-time.Not to mention how...the picture with Angela's family popped up 2 times in the perfect place, right on time to trigger a lame dramatic bulls**t scene.Everything just sucked. If you don't believe me, just watch the movie. You'll understand.I mean, I'd rather watch a bad Lorenzo Lamas action movie.Art : 9/10If it weren't for the nearly-flawless art, this movie would have been a perfect failure. The CG-style was awesome, and was, in my opinion the only good thing about this movie. Because of the art, I won't consider that I lost an hour and a half of my life. If only every part of this movie were as good as the art...Sound : 3/10Besides Leon's superficial and &quot;bad-a**&quot; voice acting , which failed miserably, I really liked the ending song. It was great... NOT !I mean, come on. Something like Papa Roach or Mudvayne would have fitted a lot better with the ending. Not that pop-rock-like song.Also, what was with the super-modern cellphones that had some old brick-like phone  monophonic ringtone? And how come at the end, everyone had their clothes and hairstyles absolutely identical ? Like, what the f**k? Didn't they shoot, tumble, swim and jump throughout the whole damn movie??Character : 4/10What happened to the cool Resident Evil 4 Leon? What's with this Arnold Schwarzenegger-like guy? The only thing that was similar to the movie Leon and the RE4 one, was his leather jacket and the hairstyle.At least Claire was okay (besides being slightly retarded).Enjoyment : 3/10All I have to say for this part is that, after the first 45 minutes, I was eager to finish it faster. And that can't be a good thing when watching a movie. If it wasn't Resident Evil I wouldn't have watched it all the way.Overall : 4/10Overall, this movie blew. If you're not a hardcore die-hard Resident Evil fan, don't watch it. There are lots of other horror movies that you'd be better off watching; like for example :Dark Water, Shutter, Saw and even the Silent Hill movie, which was pretty bad.Or better yet, go watch all three Resident Evil movies, because they can't even be compared to this piece o' trash. the picture with Angela's family popped up 2 times in the perfect place, right on time to trigger a lame dramatic bulls**t scene.Everything just sucked.

There you have it 1 movie ready to go.Although it wasn't a brilliant piece with the story, it was acceptable, going with the trend of main character leon rampaging through zombies with abit if bullet-time motion wasn't bad at all. i admit, this was'nt...the masterpiece that obviosuly some people expected, but it was a valid sequel to the games. world is on the verge of crisis, and you have the main characters defeat bosses, and whole horde of zombies. worth watching for zombie/resident evil fans, but dont expect too much.As for the Art, in terms of CG i have yet to see better. i personally found this absolutely outstanding. but saying that, the fact it isn't played by real people tones down the horror to the movie. From the games i got huge suspense and true horror from playing leon and claire, even with resident evil movies i got scared slightly. you wont get the same feeling with a CG movie, it's all for the action. we'll just have to wait for next gen CG when we can't tell the difference between real acting and CG!As for Sound, i dont know if it's because the animation was molded to fit japanese speech, but most of it was fairly poor voice acting combined with CG. most of the time, both of which never fitted together. sayign that though, leon's voice was acceptable, it fit his chacacter and it was more or less the same to Resident evil 4, far more mature.And for the music at the end, it was a poor song overall. i dont personally like it, but im sure some of you out there might like it. nothing to put you down on watching the movie though. (i dont think most of you will put off watching a movie because the credit music was abit rubbish, right?)Well, coming from a movie i dont really expect much chacacter development. but for claire i felt deeply disappointed. she played such a big role in the games, and sometimes cooperated with leon as well. i really wanted to see that incorporated in the movie. she was also really played down as a self surviving woman. the producers most of the time didn't give her a gun or proper weapon? she was more of a damsel in distress! (but most people know she's amazing in the games).Leon i dont really have much of an opinion over, he kept to his protognaist role and did a fine job of it, more than happy with that. as for the &quot;new&quot; characters one word that descibes them best &quot;lame&quot; and maybe a second, &quot;sterotypical&quot;. you have a bossy stuck up senator. Arnie cop that wants all the point blank shots and gets owned &gt;_&gt;, and lastly the hot cop that fills the role for claire. saying that Angela wasn't bad to look at for 2 hours of the movie lol :POverll, i really enjoyed this movie. that's probably because im a zombie/horror/action movie fan, but regardless it's definately a movie worth a watch. the masterpiece that obviosuly some people expected, but it was a valid sequel to the games. world is on the verge of crisis, and you have the main characters defeat bosses, and whole horde of zombies. worth watching for zombie/resident evil fans, but dont expect too much.As for the Art, in terms of CG i have yet to see better. i personally found this absolutely outstanding. but saying that, the fact it isn't played by real people tones down the horror to the movie.

But it was quite disappointing. While the CG art was decent (the characters looked great), the story was uninspired and character development was somewhat rushed.Flashbacks didn't flesh out each character's identity in full and there was needless development of a romantic possibility between two characters.To put it in a few words to encapsulate how I felt about it: Degeneration is nothing more than a series of gameplay cut scenes stitched together in a way which wasn't fulfilling enough.Should you watch it if you're a Resident Evil...fan? Why not? You won't hate it but I doubt you'll find it a masterpiece as well. Should you watch if you're new to Resident Evil? I would say.. only if you have the time. There are much better animes out there and your time might be better off spent catching them instead. fan? Why not? You won't hate it but I doubt you'll find it a masterpiece as well.

They have us slipping between different characters, making all three of them feel like the main character. They also have Claire in her always pretty looking; somehow, she never seems to get dirty even when a plain crashes about a foot away blowing up almost everything. It has everything we need from a horror movie, guns, zombies, tention, and a bit of Romance.I want to say one thing about one of the characters, I cannot STAND Senator Ron Davis. He’s a jackass and buts into everything. They did a really good job...in making look as stuck up and snobby as most fat politicians (no offence to those in that department). I do have one problem with him and that is that I think I have seen him somewhere else and it wasn’t in the Resident Evil storyline.Now, I actually really like Clare, and I also liked the girl that pretty much looks like her, Angela Miller. She has a bit of the same spunk as Clare has, though at times, she feels just like a copy of Clare.They stay pretty close to the storyline of the games and that’s one thing I really love about this. It keeps true and though I haven’t played all the games, it feels like a branch of the games like you can’t watch without knowing the games.Well, the animation feels like one big cut scene actually. But it’s not saying that it’s not good. The animation texture is really well done, making people actually look real, and that’s were we get some problems. The characters look almost too real and so when the movements feel choppy, it takes away from it. The clothing also feels a bit stiff and glossy which again makes things feel a little off. I actually like when the textures became dark and dirty because then it felt much more real. The bright look didn’t look right.Voices are pretty good though the matching of the lip-sink isn’t all that great.

I grew up with the video game series and I remember long, dark nights of sitting in front of my TV with my Playstation running Resident Evil 1. This is, as I stated in my About Me section, my favorite video game franchise. After Screen Gems took a huge runny dump over the series with the 3 live action movies, I was begging God for a CGI movie. Square Enix did it with Final Fantasy VII so why couldn't Capcom do it with RE?...Well thank God they did. I bought this movie on it's release day and I must say, it more then lived up to my expectations. It made me forget about the 3 live action abominations and for once, it felt like I was watching the games come to life. The story centers around Leon and Claire from Resident Evil 2 but I won't get into the plot. The animation is great, even though it feels more like a CGI cutscene from the games at times. The characters are well acted and portrayed the way they should be..except for Leon just because he seems like a mannequin at times. Alyson Court returns to play Claire just as she has in RE2 and RE:Code Veronica. Paul Mercier also returns from RE4 to once again play the voice of Leon which is fantastic fan-fare. The music is stellar once again, as all Resident Evil soundtracks are. It's not as action-packed as I had hoped, with a long section of the movie just leading up to the finale. Let me talk about the finale for a minute. It's incredible. I won't spoil it but it plays out just like EVERY Resident Evil game's finale has, pitting our heroes against an unforgiving mutation. Typical Resident Evil style and that's what we F'ing love! Overall, I would have liked to have seen more of the characters from the RE universe make a come back, but I guess they did in Resident Evil 5. Long story short, Capcom really knows how to treat their fans =) Well thank God they did. I bought this movie on it's release day and I must say, it more then lived up to my expectations.

I've waited so long for a good Resident Evil movie. The first one was decent but nothing special. The second was really bad, and the third could have been good but ended up being terrible.It wasn't until Capcom decided to make their own movie, animated through CGI that we got a good RE movie. The story is a hell of a lot better than the life action movie following some terrorist releasing the T-Virus, and corporate espionage.The main characters are Leon and Claire from...Resident Evil 2. The are clearly brought to life through CGI. Along with other great characters you end up caring for. The voice acting is really well done, a excellent job.The CGI is breathtaking and is truly life like.Overall skip the bad fake Resident Evil movies and see the real life one, that you'll love whether you're a fan of the games or not.

"", 'Webster\'s defines the word Anime as, ""a style of animation originating in Japan that is characterized by stark colorful graphics depicting vibrant characters in action-filled plots often with fantastic or futuristic themes."" So, for those of you questioning if ""Resident Evil (or Biohazard) Degeneration"" counts as an ""Anime"", according to the definition, yes. This is a film originating from Japan, with lots of colorful graphics and vibrant characters with an action filled plot with a fantastic and somewhat futuristic theme. It fits the criteria. Is it any good? That\'s another story...This is essentially a massive cutscene straight out of a video game connecting ""Resident Evil...4"" with ""Resident Evil 5"". Loosely at that, too. It has many of the same characters with the same voice actors from the games and if you are unfamiliar with the history and plots associated with the franchise, you might get a little lost. I was a big fan of the ""Resident Evil"" franchise growing up, but even with my extensive knowledge of the universe this takes place in, I found the whole piece rather forced and pointless from start to end. The plot is basic for the franchise. A zombie outbreak happens at an airport where one of our heroes, Claire Redfield happens to be, and where another, Leon S. Kennedy, soon arrives. It is a re-teaming of the duo from the second game in the franchise, a nice concept for fans, but kind of trivial in the eyes of the uninitiated. From there it\'s mostly \'splosions, zombies getting shot up, some odd creatures, and a plot that has a few predictable twists that ends up leading to a forced prelude to ""Resident Evil 5"".I will grant the film did a decent job with sound effects and graphics in a CG film that comes from a CG source. You really can\'t complain when a spin off stays true to the look and style of it\'s source material. It looks and feels like a video game. The same voice actors are used. Also the reason I only watched the English cast, because it\'s the voices I\'m used to hearing. So, I cannot vouch for the Japanese cast. The new characters introduced are all rather pointless, I don\'t really care if these new people survive or not, and I knew for a fact that the main characters from the game will and that the bad guys would not win. Emotional investment was non-existent.Overall, this film is a love letter to ""Resident Evil"" fans designed to wet our appetites for the next game and indulge in a little nostalgia. Aside from some mildly entertaining action and watching a ""Resident Evil"" film that stays true to the franchise and doesn\'t go off a cliff like the Milla Jovovich movies did, it\'s easily skipped. This movie fails on arrival because you are essentially watching a video game, watching the animators, producers, writers, and director play a video game. And anyone who\'s ever done so knows there is nothing worse than watching someone else play a video game! 4/10. Skip it. Cheers! 4"" with ""Resident Evil 5"". Loosely at that, too.

I'm not terribly impressed by the animation but it's still well done. I didn't really feel anything from the characters though. I thought Leon and Claire were the couple, especially when she mentioned her boyfriend in the start of the movie. Turns out they paired Leon with the cop in the end. Just didn't feel right about that. The backstory of the cop and her brother seemed a little bit forced too. It's hard for me to imagine that someone would turn himselve into a monster just to reveal a government conspiracy. I also think that the story...would be better if everything happened in one place instead of going from the airport to the research center, for example just focus on how they get out of the airport. I actually did feel the horror elements in the airport section but not in the research center. Overall it's a decent movie but many areas could've been improved. would be better if everything happened in one place instead of going from the airport to the research center, for example just focus on how they get out of the airport.

I felt it was lacking something solid, and more extreme, I mean it just seemed to me, there wasn't enough character development, and it felt rushed in a sense, and was kinda too short.But that might be because I am not a real fan of resident evil.Overall the action was decent, and...I didn't feel like it was a waste of time.

A franchise of great games and what sometimes feels the most average of average films. Live actions are great then gets a bit meh. These CGI versions are sometimes great but most often than not just meh. A lot happens during this and not all of it is necessary since it feels like 5 hours compressed into an hour and a half.The art is very much reminiscent of the older games CGI, especially for cutscenes. I appreciate that this is from 2008 but just feels very lacklustre if I am honest. Nothing really jumps...at you as amazing even though everything is generally quite nicely animated.The OST is pretty standard and nothing special. Sounds are pretty good with some nice SFX.Characters are the very generic let us have a child that could ruin it all, a greedy set of businessmen and emotions causing mayhem. No one really stands out as particularly great.It is about as average as it gets. It is not bad in any way but at the same time does absolutely nothing particularly. Feels very much like a game that was turned into a film because they expected it to nose dive.5/10.

For instance, this movie is boring. There, you have now experienced this movie. No need to read any further. Unless you are some kind of masochist. Oh, who am I kidding I\'m watching Biohazard: Damnation later this month, so I guess I\'m some kind of masochist.Story 5/10I mean, the plot works for what it is. It\'s a Resident Evil/Biohazard plot. Cool. It\'s a shame that all the action takes place either at the beginning or the end of the movie. I\'ve seen a lot of exposition.  I\'ve watched countless scenes of people talking in a cafe, but man I have...never watched a movie with so much exposition just lumped right into the 2nd act. I came to watch Leon kick ass, not to watch Leon talk to some asshole Senator. The first part of the movie that takes place in the airport is good. It\'s a classic Resident Evil/Biohazard patient zero scenario. The end of the movie is good. It\'s a classic find the hidden lab and escape with the evidence scenario. The middle of the movie is like one giant cutscene. Imagine if in Resident Evil 4, Leon had every conversation with Luis Sera in a single cutscene. That\'s essentially the 2nd act of this film.Art 7/10It was good. Nothing too great about it, but that was probably intentional since they were going for a Resident Evil/Biohazard vibe.Sound 7/10Again, just good. Nothing really stands out. Gunfire feels real and makes you worry about zombies swarming the area. All the normal stuff. Music sucks, though. Typical for Resident Evil/Biohazard.Character 6/10I only cared about Leon and Claire. Everyone else could\'ve died and I really just wouldn\'t have cared. Maybe it\'s because one of the characters has a backstory that\'s smack dab in the middle of the fucking boring ass 2nd act. It is really hard to connect with a character if you bore me to death. Oh and I saw the betrayal from the one dude coming. Come on, he looks like he\'s Wesker\'s long lost brother. The instant I saw him I thought ""bad guy."" The Senator was a pretty obvious red herring as well. Claire acts all fucking offended like she\'s never heard a politician speak off the record. They all talk like that asshole.Enjoyment 5/10The action is fun and exciting, but the 2nd act really kills it for me. If I wanted to watch cutscenes for 45 minutes , I\'d just play Resident Evil/Biohazard 6. If they hadn\'t spent a third of the movie boring me to tears with information that should\'ve been given to us in short bursts throughout the 2nd act (you know, like the games), this would\'ve been more enjoyable.Overall 5/10Just play the games, if you want my honest opinion. This movie doesn\'t include anything that changes the universe in any tangible way. It\'s like Resident Evil/Biohazard 4 but with all the cutscenes mashed together into one act.Don\'t make movies out of games. We see how that turned out with the Western Resident Evil movies. This movie is certainly more loyal to the games, but that only gets it so far. I had to pause this movie out of boredom to go eat a sandwich and watch YouTube. The movie was a chore.

Starting off in the calm before the storm soon a T virus outbreak causes panic and chaos and returning cast characters Leon S Kennedy and Jill Valentine are the only thing to stop them.The story follows a bio terrorist plot to stop the outbreak of a new strain of T Virus.The whole film is CGI and beautifully motion captured they do a really great job of the whole cinematic experience.The voice cast and sound effects are done well and accompanied by a gripping sound track and score.This is really what resident evil is all about and...they do it well. This is a great action film with amazing production value and i really cant describe it much better than amazing. Straight 10s across the board, being a huge fan of resident evil i enjoyed this a lot but even had i not been this film would still be great.The plot is isolated and doesn't require prior knowledge of the game or live action movies.

And bingo! XDAnyway, everyone is aware about this series so let's recap for the newbies.Origin:Resident Evil (Biohazard in Japan) is know as the most critical acclaimed is the most well received survival/horror/action genre. You know about and heck your parents know about it. It was consider Capcom's best selling video game series in 1996. It's gimmick was about surving with little ammo and inventory of health items, solving puzzles and uncovering mystery's in the spencer mansion back when it first launched....Over time it started to evolve into it's own child for capcome with a few bad eggs left and right. Despite some of the critics towards the original series because of the well know ''tank controller'' it still manages to subvert my expactions with good story telling. What makes it stand out is it's well creative puzzle system in a labyrant sort of sutiation with jumpscares and that's the shocher. It's story mainly focused on the Farmusutical company Umbrella who made two mutipal viruses and unleashed them on the world. The G and T samples who's cells allows for human organs to quickly repair and becoming like animals/zombies. This is where the events of the game takes places in the Spencer's Mansion where it all started. But, you wanna know something that actually grinds my gears. The Live Action Movies started a chain of events I like to call ''Cash-Cow' 101'' which lead to this being made because i wanna adress something my review is mostly about what i feel about this series because over time it kinda became ups and downs - thanks Capcom!Movie Connection and Backstory:In 2002 Sony Pictures released 1 of 6 films for newcomers who wanted to see RE in the big screams and we got was a total cluster fuck of a series that felt like it had nothing to do with the serries - it was too focused on too much shooting and flashy action than the usally surival horror theme because it didin't make any sense. So after 3 films Capcom decide to go for a full CGI film staring Leon from RE 2 and 4 with connection to all the video games. For examples this movie takes place after Re 2 and before RE 4.The Film is more focused on story telling and actually character developtment than being a video game intead we got 3 more after this one and all of them are good, but Inifite Darkness which i heard rumors was original planned as movie got scrapped and instead solve on Neflix as a some exlusive web-series like whatever that they wanted it done either good or bad.This movie's whole story is about Leon and Clair one again expriencing the horror from RE 2's events in a more bizzare and action setting. I know giving it a 10 is a bad ideas, since most fans hated it, but it was good and still holds well even after all these years. Heck, it was made before CGI became a cluster fuck for anime fans.Enjoy and grab a beer or two! Over time it started to evolve into it's own child for capcome with a few bad eggs left and right.

I know his hair is shorter than the womens\'...but it\'s still too long to be frozen in space, if you know what I mean.Sound:1) Awesome voice work from the seiyuus.2) soundtrack and sound effects are okayStory and characters:1) all the mediocre hollywood clichés are present into this film. It was awful.2) the pacing of this movie is all over the place. It starts off awesome and then just sloooooooooooooooooooooooows doooooooooooooooooown. And then we get more action and it draaaaaaaaaaaaaaaags out until the end.3) SPOILER: Curtis sets his family photo across from the door, sets everything on fire and leaves. The viewer sees a prettly clear shot that this photo cannot be retrieved without a fire extinguisher or something. Later, Leon and Angela arrive at the scene, only to find Curtis\' house ablaze. On the ground, several meters from the house in flames, the same picture can be found and it\'s only partially burnt. There\'s no flipping way this could ever happen.4) SPOILER: once Curtis transforms into the big scary monster, Leon states the obvious. He\'s dead. However, at the ""climax"" of the movie, Angela drops the impossible-to-get photo and Curtis\' takes over the monster momentarily. This was extremely stupid and it just contradicted the franchise.5) SPOILER: romance between Leon and Angela was so unnecessary and felt out of place6)SPOILER: Claire\'s role in the last ""arc"" of the movie (when she\'s stuck in the president\'s room) was almost non-existent. She spent ages in there without doing anything. It would\'ve been better for her to stay unconscious somewhere than waste pointless frames with her doing anything remotely useful.7) SPOILER: when Leon and Angela are holding onto each other but the big scary monster is also grabbing Angela, it only takes one miraculous Leon bullet to get it to let go. This is really funny because in the first scene after Curtis transforms into the big scary monster, he gets showered with machine gun bullets and he doesn\'t even bat his eye and it\'s not like the bullet hit the body part that was grabbing Angela. It was ridiculous in the worst sense.8) SPOILER: how the heck was Frederic found at the end of the movie????????????????????I am aware that I spoiled a lot about the story (which you may or may not skip as you read through the review) but I don\'t think I could explain me giving this movie a 5/10 without adressing the issues I have with the story and characters. but it\'s still too long to be frozen in space, if you know what I mean.Sound:1) Awesome voice work from the seiyuus.2) soundtrack and sound effects are okayStory and characters:1) all the mediocre hollywood clichés are present into this film.

I had already seen the trailer and pictures from the upcoming CGI film and to me they looked really outstanding. After seeing the film, I was lost for words. I found myself sitting on the edge of my sofa starring at the TV screen, blanking my surroundings out. Along the storyline I was able to clearly understand the characters stance aswell as there basis to why they were acutally part of the film.The voice actors including ""Paul Mercier"" as ""Leon S Kennedy"" were all kept the same...from pervious Resident Evil titles which I felt worked especially well.I wasn\'t at all disapointed with this film, but I can\'t speak for everyone else as its my opinion alone.

(At the time of writing MAL has it listed as JUST a recap and nothing says its a sequel even though it is...)There really isn't much to say about this since its mostly a recap with the start, middle and end all being the sequel. This sequel takes place 2 years later from the end of the Chobits anime. Its as good as the prequel imo, however, because the recap was completely unnecessary, this lowers the overall...rating I have for it. If you liked the Chobits anime I'd recommend seeing this sequel/recap, you can just skip the recap parts but be careful you don't miss the new material being the sequel parts. For a sequel it would've been nicer to see more but its better than nothing I suppose. My Love Score is 7.0 but my rating for it is 6.0 due to the recap part being unnecessary. rating I have for it.

All of the usual gang is back again this time with the introduction of new space companions Roppuru and Chammy. These characters are fine enough on their own, though their obvious inherent similarity to Nobita and Doraemon leaves less of a lasting impression in the long run and leaves little room to distinguish them during the film. The villains too are entirely one-note, as you would largely expect from this type of film. The animation and...music were standard for Doraemon, with the usual opening and ending sequences recurring as always. I did also wonder throughout the movie why Doraemon had no way of giving the gang a baseball field to play on when it really does not feel like that outlandish of a task for him, although that is more of a general critique or issue of the franchise given Doraemon's permanent role as a deus ex machina. In all, while this may not have lived up to the standard set by the first film it was still a perfectly fine sequel that serves its duty of giving some light family entertainment. music were standard for Doraemon, with the usual opening and ending sequences recurring as always.

Not quite my cup of tea.In this movie, Nobita and Doraemon meet the pioneering settlers of a distant planet and protect them from an evil corporation that wants to mine the planet's resources. This is an unusual Doraemon movie in a number of ways, probably due to it being such an early film installment in the franchise. Something that is well known to Doraemon fans is that the main characters tend to come across as better friends in the movies than in the regular manga chapters or anime episodes. (For example,...in typical Doraemon stories, Gian and Suneo are much more likely to bully Nobita than to show concern for him.) In this film, however, the character interactions feel more similar to those in the mainline series.There is also the fact that Shizuka, Gian, and Suneo aren't involved with most of the adventure in this story. Doraemon and Nobita are the only mainline protagonists present for most of the film, and much more emphasis is placed establishing their friendship with new, movie-exclusive characters. I can see how that could make for a compelling narrative to some viewers, but being generally more invested in the relationships among the series regulars, it didn't do too much for me. in typical Doraemon stories, Gian and Suneo are much more likely to bully Nobita than to show concern for him.)

Inazuma Eleven Go vs. Danball Senki W Movie,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15785/Inazuma_Eleven_Go_vs_Danball_Senki_W_Movie,"[""There is no information about this movie, which I thought was pretty annoying, so I will wright a review to give you an impression of the movie.Before watching this movie, I had only watched the Inazuma Eleven (Go) series. So the combination of Inazuma Eleven and Danball Senki W was something new for me.Story 8/10The story starts with Tenma and his team playing a match against coach Endou and his team. Then they suddenly get attacked by LBXs. At that moment the guys from Danball Senki W come into action. With the help of everybody of Raimon, they defeat de LBXs but then something else...happens. Pieces of the world disapear. After that, Tenma and his team, along with Ban and his friends will try to safe the world from being erased by the enemy.For me, who hadn't seen Danball Senki W, was de mecha element of the movie something new. Because there is no mecha in the Inazuma Eleven series. The overall main story is a bit of the same as always, I expect that it's also the main concept of the Danball Senki series. They get attacked and try to safe everybody. They argue sometimes, but it always ends well. Even though it's not original, it always gets me excited and brings a smile at my face. It's a bit of thrill that sports can bring to you.Art 7,5/10The art was good, the drawing style of both animes was pretty much the same so it wasn't that the characters from one anime were more detailed drawn then the other.Sound 7,5/10I also don't really have anything to say about the sound. The sound was good, it fit the moments.Character 8/10The characters of the animes are also alike. Ban is like Tenma, they're both optimistic and help their team go through tough times. Other characters have also a bit in common. I'm not really sure if it's the same for Danball Senki W, but in this movie, some characters from Inazuma Eleven Go who don't really play a big role in the series, are also in this movie. (Like Hakuryuu from the other Inazuma Eleven Go movie.)Enjoyment 8,5/10I really enjoyed this movie. Because I didn't know Danball Senki W, it added something new for me in the movie. It's also that, except from just one soccer match, there are two different matches, soccer and LBX. The difference is that, while soccer is physical, LBX is more mentally, because, to control a LBX you should just toutch buttons, and willpower is more important. I'm not saying that it isn't important for soccer, ofcourse. Watching movies like this leaves a kind of happieness in me and a smile on my face. I also liked it to see the way that the characters of both series became friends.Overall 8/10I hope that my review helped a bit, I recommend this movie, I liked it more than the other Inazuma Eleven go movie. It is a bit different and I enjoyed watching it. I hope you will too :). happens. Pieces of the world disapear.

While not mind-blowing or beautifully crafted, the animation maintains consistency with its predecessors, providing a visually satisfying experience but still lacking of lots powerful turn-table scene to hype like in original series.However, when it comes to the story, the movie falls short of expectations. It can be described as weak, failing to engage viewers with its one-dimensional narrative. The characters, particularly those introduced specifically for the movie, lack depth and complexity. Their motivations revolve around a single-minded desire...for revenge, which limits their development and leaves them feeling one-dimensional.The soundtrack of the movie is merely average, failing to leave a lasting impression. While it serves its purpose, it doesn\'t elevate the viewing experience with outstanding or memorable compositions. The voice acting is mediocre, with performances that don\'t stand out but also don\'t detract from the overall experience.In terms of pacing, the movie maintains a typical runtime of 1.30 hours, which is insufficient to introduce a multitude of characters. Tthere are moments of occasional pacing issues, leading to rushed or slow segments that could have been better balanced.Inazuma Eleven Go vs. Danball Senki W Movie also falls short in the themes and messages department. The film touches on some ideas but fails to explore them thoroughly, resulting in a shallow treatment of potentially intriguing concepts.Viewing enjoyment for this movie is a mixed bag. While it may provide some entertainment, it leaves viewers with mixed feelings due to its weak story, underdeveloped characters, and lackluster themes. It doesn\'t reach the level of absolute joy or high enjoyment as original series but also doesn\'t descend into the realm of torture to watch.Overall, ""Inazuma Eleven Go vs. Danball Senki W Movie"" is a movie that delivers animation consistent with its series but falters in its storytelling, character development, and thematic exploration.

Devil May Cry,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1726/Devil_May_Cry,"['Devil May Cry is a very strange series. It does its thing nicely for a bit but then goes and ruins it with some silly nonsense. I have no idea why or how that happened. I mean, the games are pretty consistently decent—so why isn\'t this show the same?Let\'s begin with this totally alien concept called the story. Of which you won\'t be getting any for about 9 episodes in a row (yes, out of 12 total). No joke—this is essentially a slice-of-life series about Dante showing off. And before you ask the obvious question—yes, it has less of a story than the action games...the setting is taken from. Furthermore—just to tease you—at several points you get an impression that some general plot is about to emerge (it eventually does, but already after you have lost all hope for it), but the very next moment you have your expectations casually ruined once again. You could probably even watch episodes 2–9 in any order without disturbing the narrative. For that exact reason you shouldn\'t worry about spoilers when discussing this series, as it\'s virtually impossible to spoil anything of substance. Rating the story with 3 is me being generous here, owing it mostly to the universe created by the DMC game series.Oh yeah, Dante. As I mentioned earlier, everything in this series is about showing Dante in the process of, uh... being cool? He tries so hard he transcends the meaning of the word ""cool"", being the living embodiment of coolness never seen since the cool came to cool town. He always has that swag going, and his sense of fashion oozes style—as imagined by a 14-year-old. Obviously, he only eats the most badass food in existence... you guessed it, as imagined by a 14-year-old: pizza, strawberry sundae, beer—none of your chump gourmet garbage. He has the craziest, totally overpowered weapons—because dramatic stakes are for pussies. Even his name has that aristocratic feel to it. Unsurprisingly, every time he\'s up for a job, he always does it single-handedly—be it a bike race, gambling, or butchering a several-stories-tall demon in mere seconds—always with that detached facial expression that serves to underline his towering superiority. Yet somehow he always fails to complete his primary objective because he\'s just too damn righteous or whatever. Ermagherd, what an impossibly cool dude! And even during all that action, he appears to be bored out of his mind, almost depressed by doing something so utterly mundane. One-Punch Man too popular for you? Take a look at this gem then: DMC did the ""overpowered MC bored by flaccid antagonists"" shtick some 8 years before everyone\'s favorite egghead came into being. Hellsing Ultimate has too much of that annoying character development? DMC should be right up your alley—it doesn\'t have any of that. Ladies and gentlemen, we have officially reached peak shallow. If you aren\'t sure what ""peak shallow"" looks like, imagine a zit on the ground; that should work.On the topic of characters, the entire cast is mainly there to support Dante by... yes, being glorified foils, looking deliberately uncool in comparison. First, we have Morrison, who is old-fashioned, intelligent, and an exemplary gentleman, almost a polar opposite of Dante. Then there\'s Patty, the token loli moe-blob comic relief character whose presence is never justified despite screenwriter\'s best efforts (which fail spectacularly, of course). A notable character is the creatively-named Lady, who is also quite a cool, uh, lady—but... still not quite there, you know? This, however, doesn\'t prevent her from being far more capable at her job. But hey, if Dante doesn\'t bother doing the thing, it must not be very cool after all, right? There\'s also Trish, who is somewhere between Lady and Dante on the scale on coolness and never gets any screen time. The distribution of screen time in general seems to be decided by a coin toss, befitting the interchangeable, meandering nature of the support cast. (That said, I gotta give some credit to designs and the fact that they\'re occasionally entertaining (if only because they try so hard) and evoke memories of better-written characters from the action anime of the days past; really makes you wish they were put in capable hands.) Lastly, there is that typical cartoony small fry antagonist who, despite being an obnoxious eyesore, behaves like a plot-significant character and—in a great plot twist (gasp!)—actually ends up being one. At that point you\'ll just have to be a man and brace yourself for the trainwreck. Even if you\'re a woman, become a man and then brace yourself; there is no sweeter imagery than a man bracing himself for a trainwreck.There isn\'t much to say about the show\'s sound and visuals. They\'re generally competently made and adequate for the subject matter, though some scenes could have definitely been animated better (as in *actually animated* rather than panned across the screen), and the music somewhat lacks variety—almost all of it is mere variations on the three dominant themes.All in all, DMC is the kind of show you\'d want for some simple braindead entertainment when you\'ve run out of the more entertaining content to watch. Don\'t expect anything beyond that, as you\'ll be met with nothing but disappointment. Just get your beverage of choice, a pack of favorite snacks, press play, and tune out.

If you’re a fan of the video games and want to see more stylish ass-kickery, prepare to be disappointed.Story: Dante is running his business, performing mundane tasks for clients like demon-slaying, saving the world, the usual. Almost every episode starts and concludes one of Dante’s assigned cases, involving nasty monsters that inevitably end up dead. There is some cheap drama that focuses on a young girl whom Dante saved and a loser demon who wants to become a god, but you’re not seriously...here for the plot are you?Art: The art style is able to create a dark, gothic atmosphere where Dante spills plenty of demon blood. However, it is not enough to keep you tense at all since fight scenes are way too short. Battles involve more talking than fighting and tend to be settled with one stroke (by guess who). There is a significant lack of spectacularly choreographed fight sequences as seen in the games, which will no doubt be a major letdown. Animation quality is only mediocre for when there is actually action. If you're hoping Dante will pull devil trigger, unleash some insane combos, or wield his other devil arms, guess what? He won't!Oh and yes, Trish and Lady are in this, but they’re drawn rather unattractively. No eye candy here.Sound: Some heavy rock, some gothic choir tracks, all very forgettable. Seems even the lowliest of demons can speak Japanese. Voice acting and sound effects are acceptable, but nothing noteworthy.Characters: Here it is, the reason you may be considering this anime: to see Dante kick plenty of ass. And here is also the show’s main failure: Dante is simply overpowered. Yes we know he’s super cool and skilled, but he faces absolutely no challenging adversaries at all. This entire anime is a series of totally one sided fights like I've never seen. Dante spends some time cracking jokes, his opponent says something stupid like “I stand a chance!”, and then Dante proceeds with delivering the pain. Except not in a spectacular, SSSmoking SSSick fashion. More like finishing it with one bullet from Ebony/Ivory or a couple swings of Rebellion. For fans of the games, this is a major kick to the balls and won’t leave you satisfied at all.Oh, and apparently Dante loves eating strawberry sundaes on sunny afternoons, while getting bossed around by a precocious little girl. Who would've thought.Enjoyment: I loved the video games for their dramatic fight sequences, challenging bosses, cheesy humor and impossible physics. What the anime tries to duplicate, it does so without success. Dante is not so much kicking ass in this show as he is absentmindedly swatting flies. Your time would be better spent trying/ replaying the DMC video games. Except DMC2, let’s just forget that ever existed.5/10 here for the plot are you?Art: The art style is able to create a dark, gothic atmosphere where Dante spills plenty of demon blood. However, it is not enough to keep you tense at all since fight scenes are way too short. Battles involve more talking than fighting and tend to be settled with one stroke (by guess who). There is a significant lack of spectacularly choreographed fight sequences as seen in the games, which will no doubt be a major letdown. Animation quality is only mediocre for when there is actually action. If you're hoping Dante will pull devil trigger, unleash some insane combos, or wield his other devil arms, guess what? He won't!Oh and yes, Trish and Lady are in this, but they’re drawn rather unattractively. No eye candy here.Sound: Some heavy rock, some gothic choir tracks, all very forgettable.

Now can you name a good videogame that was turned into an anime that wasn't terrible?  Alright...you can probably name a whole bunch, alot from the choose-your-own-adventure genres.  However Devil May Cry is more like a terrible video game movie.  If you've ever played, or seen someone play, Devil May Cry then you know the style of the game quite well.  The quality and feel of the anime is nothing like that of the original videogame.Story:...Lame.  That single, bland word perfectly describes the storyline of this anime.  I wonder sometimes what the storywriters were thinking when they sat down to write this anime.  They clearly didn't put any heart or soul into this, and I hope that they had other projects that they deemed more important than this.  The real storyline begins in about episode 4-5.  When you have 12 episodes to tell a story in, and you spend the first third of the anime doing self contained episodes you know that you're off to a terrible start.  Even the story that they decide to throw in is terrible and quickly forgettable.Art: Some people praise the art, I however find it terrible to anything it tries to do.  The art is very clunky, the people seem to be squares and triangles and circles thrown together, the fluidity of the people is nonexistant.  Anyone who's seen the game knows what Dante looks like, and in the anime version he loses everything that makes him so cool in the game.  I got a very generic feeling from the art, it didn't seem that they were taking any risks, they were just doing the same old things over and over and the art seemed really stale.Sound: The sound is good, the effects are good, the music is good.  I believe with almost absolute certainty that they took a lot of the music from the game itself and I found it was the single thing that I was connecting with as I watched with.Character: On the outside Dante is a badass. A pizza-eating, Strawberry Sundae drinking badass.  And on the inside?  Well...he's a badass.  And he's lazy.  He will beat up anyone, especially demons, because they piss him off.  And while he's exorcising the demons and doing whatever it is he does he doesn't seem to care at all.  Cause nothing is more badass than killing bad guys while not seeming to care about it at all.  Now....as the writers sat down they must have thought &quot;hmm...how exactly do we make a better anime when the main character is a rude, pizza-eating badass?&quot; and some guy went &quot;OH! MY! GOD! We add....a CUTE LITTLE GIRL! Who talks a lot and is a central part of the storyline so basically Dante is forced to stick beside her...people will LOVE IT!&quot; However...it doesn't work because it's been done a thousand times before, and it was original 10 years ago....and it was fresh then too.  But now it's not.  They also throw in characters from the games, but it feels forced and is quite annoying for anyone who's played the games.Enjoyment: Honestly, after episode 4 I stopped paying attention at all.  I really, really didn't care after episode 6. After episode 8 I could barely sit through each episode.  So I can honestly say that I didn't enjoy this anime at all.  At all.I wouldn't really recommend this to anyone who enjoys the game series.  It's such a huge disappointment if you're expecting it to be the game. However some people might really enjoy this anime, however I've never met anyone who enjoyed it.  The only good point is that it's only 12 episodes, so even if you hate it it's only 4 hours of your life....that you'll never get back. Lame.

Really? H-How? H-How did you make this game into an anime. I-I-- (sigh)... Alright... Just, let me review this anime...Devil May Cry: The Animated Series... Is by far, THE WORST ANIME THAT I\'VE WATCHED IN MY LIFE... FROM MADHOUSE ENTERTAINMENT?! REALLY? THE ONE WHO GAVES US DEATH NOTE, AND KISEIJUU COMES WITH THIS HORRIFYING PIECE OF S... Ahh... Fuu-- (sigh) okay... Okay... Settle down, Vaas... Just... Let me... Just me relax and focus on my review... Okay (Inhaling) (Exhaling)...Alright, let me review this, I was so...shocked when my beloved video game franchise, Devil May Cry, became an anime. And, the most shockingly thing that I\'ve been seen when I watch this English dub is that, it was came from MadHouse Entertainment! I mean, come on... At first I was like, ""Hmm... MadHouse? What more could I ask for? It was like, the best anime corporations out there, there\'s nothing hideous when I watch this anime, right? Devil May Cry: The Animated Series is going to be a BLAST."" And then, when I watch it from first to the last, I-- I don\'t know... I don\'t freaking know what am I going to say to both CAPCOM (the gaming developers of Devil May Cry) and MadHouse about this... this... SELLOUT ANIME BASED FROM THE VIDEO GAME CRAP...I hate this adaptations, and this is main example why the adaptation is so cruel, is so vile and worst.Story:Okay, let\'s start with the Storyline shall we? (SPOILER ALERT) So it goes like this, there was man named Dante and a girl named Patty who stays in the Devil May Cry shop to search for her missing mother. Then, it also explains how Lady and Trish met (and that\'s why Trish and Lady became friends in the game; Devil May Cry 4), and wanted to kill all those who were in Dante\'s way, especially Sid, the main antagonist of the story who looks like a beggar at first but now he\'s a demon jackass. Oh, and by the way, this anime is CANON, meaning this anime is also set on the same universe on the game itself. So... As I checked on the storyline, it\'s just plain and simple, and also, there are no memorable things here in this anime, besides how Lady and Trish met, how Dante spoke profanity (which is kinda weird though), and Baul and Modeous\' Appearances as Sparda\'s Protegees.But you know what is worst in this anime? A Lot actually, like those Demon Fights with Dante which you think you\'d expected longer and hardcore, well, I\'d say, NOPE, it\'s not fun and I\'d rather watch ""Shingeki No Kyojin"", ""Naruto"", or even the longest fight between Goku and Cell in ""Dragon Ball Z"" than wasting my time on this climatic... or should I say ""Boring"" Climatic Sequence. And also, really? On the episode where it sets on the Opera House, when Dante says to Patty ""Sorry kid, but this following sequence is FOR ADULTS ONLY."" You also showed her any kinds of fighting and gore against those demons you\'ve been facing with even the fight is sets behind the curtain... Really? Dante from the Anime World, a word of advice, Instead of telling her that, why don\'t you tell her to get out of the opera house because it\'s ""...FOR ADULTS ONLY""... Really, Dante? Is this is how you treat that kid like that? ""Dante\'s Has No Son or Daughter Maybe That Was Acceptable, right?"" F--- NO!! He already looks like older now and a little mature, maybe he knows what is Good Values and Right Conduct. What is he? A Half-Demon, Half-Human with No Brain?Art:Nope... I don\'t like it... Why? Because Dante, from my view, is kinda thin, what is he? Is he taking some dope or something? What\'s wrong with him? The Only Dante I Know is he has a Good Shape and With A Nice F-----G Abs #NoHomo... WHY DON\'T YOU DO THAT IN THE ANIME?! And also, Lady is so Hideous... Much worst to Dante\'s look in DmC: Devil May Cry game. So, when my boner was about to engage, instead, my boner retreats... Trish... I don\'t know, but for me, she looks fine though so I accept that...And as for the other minor characters... I have no problems at all... Besides, they\'re just another bunch of anime characters from the DMC universe. Except they\'re new and not on the game. Because if they are existed in the game, I would just flipped myself over because of those hideous looks starting from Lady to Dante...Sound:Error 404: Best Sound or Soundtrack Not Found...Character:Dante, speaks profanity, which is UNACCEPTABLE, but maintains its cool just like in the game. Lady, has the worst shape but her character maintains it, and Trish, which is also acceptable. Appearantly, those characters are just good enough... Except Sid, I don\'t like his face. PERIOD. Maybe next time, try Ver--... No... No... Not here in this anime... Oh how about this... NEXT TIME... TRY MAKING A ANTAGONIST THAT LOOKS LIKE VERGIL AND FIGHTS LIKE VERGIL EXCEPT IT\'S A DIFFERENT NAME, how about that?Enjoyment:Fun Part of the story? I\'d say... Hmm... Wait... Give me more minutes to think...(More Minutes Later)......Nope, I don\'t enjoy it... Oh wait... There\'s One... That was closing my Windows Media Player which contain the Episodes from Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, shutting down my PC, and go to sleep like it was just a dream... or a nightmare perhaps...Overall:In my opinion... It\'s enough to play Devil May Cry games except watching this anime. I\'m sorry, I don\'t like this and I wanted to have more time to watch any other animes besides this anime toilet... So, if you want to watch this anime, I RECOMMENDED YOU TO WATCH ""DEATH NOTE"" or ""PARASYTE -THE MAXIM-"". Two of the most well recommended anime shows from MadHouse Entertainment.Parasyte -The Maxim- is maybe the best choice to devour Devil May Cry: The Animated Series onto it\'s roots. Why? Parasyte has the best battle out there and it has a great storyline with a well character development. So I recommend to watch that instead of this hideous anime adaptation based on the game.So my final verdict is 3/10... It almost gone out to 2 or pathetic score. But because Dante\'s jokes that are kinda funny, and the explaination on how Lady and Trish turns out into good friends from DMC4, i guess that\'s enough to cover it... shocked when my beloved video game franchise, Devil May Cry, became an anime.

Well, there are some connections, but the way the story goes is not directly connected, it is like each episode has is own story. By the story of all anime i give a 3. But i think each episode story is well made, so i give a 8 as an average of each episode story.(3+8)/2=5,5=6. If you like anime with good story, from the first episode to the last one, this is...not your kind of anime. I personally dont mind, and im opening for different kind of stories.Art (7) - Art is good, but nothing special in my opinion. Sometime it could be better, but is fine anyways, this is neither the strongest point neather the weakest.Sound (10) - When i watched Dmc the first thing that got my attention was the opening..i liked it. Besides, character voices are good, the ending is also something great, background music is also nice. I have nothing negative to say about this aspect, so 10.Character (8) - Dante is great, and his personality  is well made. Some other suportt characters are also nice, but there are some that are not good at all. I think besides dante and 1 or 2 more, the rest is not anything special.Enjoyment (9) - I will only say this. i watched the first episode, and became interested in watching, and this is always a good aspect. I saw all the episodes really fast, and believe me, that is rare for me, because if it is nothing special i take more time to see all the episodes.Overall (8) - I agree when people says that devil may cry is nothing special, i already saw much better, but i cant say it is horrible, because it isnt. Its a fine and entretaining show, not the best, but good enough to be worth of watching. not your kind of anime.

It is borderline slice-of-life action, A wired combination and it doesn't work all that well in my opinion. There seems to be no plot going on throughout the first few episodes however the plot slowly develops a very tiny bit per episode until it reaches its climax in episode 11/12. the overall story had me a little bored however the last few episodes were some of the best anime I have ever seen. They were tense on the edge action and it is a great reward for sticking through the slow storyline.Art -...The art is amazing. Defiantly something that should be admired. the art really adds to the level of depth and helps indulge the watcher in Dante's world.Sound - Although a little repetitive at times the sound fits the anime quite well. The OP is amazing, It also has a very small role in the anime which really made me smile - I don't want to reveal too much but its usage in the last episode is amazing. The ED is almost engrish, the words change frequently which was a bit strange but the overall feel of the ED was a nice way to wind down after an action packed anime.Enjoyment - I didn't enjoy quite a few of the episodes however the last two episodes really redeemed the show. There are ups and downs and, as I have said before, everything comes together in the last few episodes.Overall - Overall I liked this anime, the last episodes are amazing whilst the middle episodes (3-9) are quite boring however worth watching to see the very high tension ending.

The enemies are weak but looking at the amount of enemies that appear at once or how many they appear in the whole anime, it's obvious they're not going to do anything to him, it's not even the amount that appears on any first chapter of the games but the characters were very good.EnjoymentGreat enjoyment, I liked this anime because i wanted to see something different from the games, i wanted to see how Dante handles his business, how he approached the jobs, this was a refreshing turn from the games, that's why it's a 9 well, mostly for the enjoyment but the surprising animation and great sound were decisive to give it a high score despite the weak but good story. his powers and the only one that can fight and even kill Dante is Vergil but he doesn't appear here for obvious reasons and it could seem Dante is immortal, well, he's immortal even in his human form in DMC4, but the thing is, only Vergil can kill him, that's why he kills demons so easily; oh and for me this is a great anime more for the enjoyment that i had than what the story offered.StoryIt follows an episodic formula in which Dante does all kind of jobs, specially killing demons and everything related with demons, he will accept the jobs so he can pay his debts, and the causing of the big amount of debts are Trish and Lady because they're always taking a share of the payment he earns without their help; Almost at the last eps. the story will continue what was left in the first two and conclude with a good story but not surprising and predictable also at the very end everyone heading to the same place, the events of DMC4.Art & AnimationThe animation was great, there's not much to say, it was well done, the character design was surprising, i was expecting something bad just because it was different from the character design of the games but Dante looks good, i really liked it and i was wrong to think it was going to be bad just because it wasn't like the games but yeah, the art style/animation was great considering it was from 2007.SoundThe sound was great, the OP, the backrgound music, the weird thing was the ED, i don't think it was fitting; The VA made a great job specially for Dante, i thought Dante's voice was going to be bad, but it was on point of who he was at that point.CharacterBecause one writer helped to make the anime, the characters are just exactly like in the games and that's what i loved it, they didn't change it, they had the same personalities just a little changes on Lady tho and for the new characters, they were interesting, i liked that Dante had a contractor looking for jobs to offer him and i kind of liked the character of Patty, always cleaning the local and bothering him like if she was her little sister and he being cool about it.

It's 12 episodes long. The animation and sound are good and it has action and humor. Many of the episodes look like one shots but everything is linked in the end. It won't confuse people who have not played the game and it won't bore those who have.My criticism is that some of the action scenes are little cut. Dante starts fighting and a few seconds later fast forward, he's at home after winning the battle.Another thing isn't really a critic as much as an observation, but I noticed after watching some game videos that...anime Dante is more serious then game Dante. Sure he still loves pizza and strawberry sundaes, and he's still cocky and confident, and a little cheesy; but game Dante is cheesier, louder and more cheerful. I'm not saying anime Dante is an emo, far from it, he's just quiet, practically never smiles and he takes a lot of naps. While game Dante would say &quot;This party's getting crazy! :D&quot; and proceed to beat up the bad guys while eating pizza, I honestly can't imagine anime Dante saying such a line. Fighting while eating pizza and being cocky yes, but he would instead say with a serious face &quot;it gets R rated from here.&quot;As for what's new in the anime. You'll get some more information about Dante's past and certain characters who have appeared in different games will finally meet. You'll also see Dante in his day to day life. My favorites are episodes 5, 9 and 12. anime Dante is more serious then game Dante.

After I completerd the first episode I decided to leave it for a while, hoping that one day I would be in the mood for a stylish but brainless anime. Months later... I have realised this will not happen.The story - or lack thereof - is disgusting. Fair enough, the DMC series never was known for its plot lines, but there is a huge difference between playing and watching (which is highlighted particularly by this anime).  I actually had...to force myself to finish the first episode. There was a basic 'transport this girl to this place' thing going on... punctuated by a bunch of demons popping up and almost killing someone,  before Dante appeared out of nowhere and killed them EVERY SINGLE TIME. There was no character development either... just a stereotypically cool Dante doing all the stylish stuff we could make him do in the games. The sound was predictable and boring - Dante listens to hard rock because he's awesome; we get it.The one thing this anime does have going for it is the art. It is relatively well-presented and ultra-stylish. That really doesn't make up for how remarkably poor every other aspect of it is.In all honesty, I wish that I had discovered this anime somewhere in the middle of puberty, when I might actually have been content to kill brain cells by watching a guy shoot monsters over and over and over again.

DMC was simply awesome!I was looking for an anime that is shonen or seinen with a genre of action and with top priority on cool graphics - so I picked Devil May Cry with a lot of hesitations.I also thought I would never watched this kind of anime because I was tired with so detailed-like graphics and animation TV series I used to watch back then. But then again I thought, I'll give it a try. Man, I was wrong! I was hooked up right after I watched the first episode.I'll break down my...thoughts on the anime without giving spoilers (hopefully). :)Art:When I watched the first episode, I said, &quot;WOW!&quot;.  The graphics left me in awe with nicely drawn characters and backgrounds. Colors used were also great - with Dante in red dress and white-grey hair of which I thought before was boring if this is his &quot;uniform&quot; but then again, I was wrong if you&rsquo;re caught up with the story.I give the art as 10/10.Sound:The OP soundtrack was superb and in sync with (flashes of) characters in their little scene. I did not read that entire lyrics of the ED soundtrack but the melody was nice.Sound effects were also superb.Overall, sound is top-notch and I give it 10/10.Story:I like how the anime story was somewhat divided per episode but each ep was connected in reaching to the climax. I really like the last episode. It left me smiling after watching it. I like to watch more of this anime!I also like the fact that they employ humor in the story for the main character; though humors here are little as this anime focus on serious action.Why it's not 10? Maybe because it's a short series and I would like watch more about the main character's development as he is in the anime.It's 9/10 for me.Character:I say the main characters were cool with cool moves and were nicely drawn. I even found Dante sexy. Now, don&rsquo;t get me wrong. :D His moves were cool and sexy especially with his guns and sword. The lead female characters were also pretty cool and sexy.I give them 10/10.Enjoyment:The entire series is a total enjoyment for me. Pretty cool characters and their moves with top notch graphics to go with. Story is not so intricate for me but it also gives mysteries which were unfolded in the climax.I totally enjoyed this anime, so it&rsquo;s 10/10. 2 thumbs up!I highly recommend this to those who look for action anime with very nice graphics, cool characters, superb sound, and story in one package. thoughts on the anime without giving spoilers (hopefully). :)Art:When I watched the first episode, I said, &quot;WOW!&quot;.

No, really I\'m not. It\'s a video game to anime/movie translation. Normally, these types of projects are horrible anyway. I\'m sure many people know that this is based on the game of the same name, as it followed Dante completing missions by exterminating demons in some very stylish ways. Unfortunately, although the demon killing is present in the series. The greatness that was found in the games is completely lost. Those out there who sat through the Street Fighter Alpha series, Fatal Fury movies, or heaven forbid Art of Fighting. More than likely shouldn\'t be surprised and already have an...idea on just how often the mark is missed. The only thing surprising to me is that the fans didn\'t outright obliterate this bullshit on release date like they did Street Fighter: Generations.Video game to anime are mainly meant for one particular fan base, and that is fans of the games. However, as a fan of the game myself. I can tell you that this series doesn\'t do the game any justice at all, and as an anime, Devil May Cry is pretty much unwatchable. Devil May Cry has almost nothing to offer.There\'s a dumpster load of reasons to hate this series. Right from the very beginning, I knew this series was going to be bad because Dante was given a chibi character named Patty to baby sit. This character along with many others serves absolutely no purpose, except to provide small repeated comedy relief which was never funny to begin with, and this is among the cliches that are present in this series.The characters are incredibly bland, and the secondary characters make appearances for no reason other than to squeeze in popular faces from the video game. Outside of the way they fight, the viewer can forget about learning anything about them. The secondary characters who make their appearances are Trish and Lady: two female fighters that aren\'t even slightly developed, with only very small hints about them thrown out there.Dante is a decent character sort of yet he\'s very lame as well. He deals out death packing his usual two pistols with a large sword, but his full abilities are never fully displayed. Even fans of the game should come away disappointed here. Try to imagine Ryu from Street Fighter never using his ultimate attack, which would be the ""Hadoken"", and you will get the picture. In addition, I find nothing cool about a character whom fights demons, but loses to children and everybody in grown up games. Plus, has a love for cherry sundaes? It just comes off weird to me. Instead, he should be drinking beer, some fuckin\' robust, full bodied, imperial stouts or some shit.The direction is atrocious. The series utilizes an episodic format which happens to become quite repetitive and very predictable. Clients would appear to Dante requesting his services, and each episode ends with some type of battle with a demon. Hints at a greater plot are mentioned very early. Only to be completely dropped and never mentioned again.Giving a tad bit of credit where it\'s due. Some of the villains are somewhat interesting with decent abilities, but every last one of them are poorly used in delivering good battles. The action sequences are very boring and lack a lot of imagination. Many of the fight scenes either consist of off screen and unseen action, or are decided in one move victories. This also includes demons that are heavily hyped in to being real threats. The battles are colossal disappointments, and they are cut too short for an action oriented fan whom has binged on a lot of action anime to really be pleased. There are too many action titles out there that very far surpasses this, and I\'m talking titles that pre-date this at least a decade.  The ending is every bit as unsatisfying, bland, and nonsensical, as every thing that came before it. This series is almost a bigger waste of time than Hell Girl, and that\'s saying a lot.Devil May Cry at least stands out with its production values. It definitely looks pretty, and it smoothly blends in 3-D with CG. The artwork brings the Madhouse flavor with scantily clad chicks almost baring it all, and the character designs are very faithful to their video game counterparts. I didn\'t find any of the designs for the demons to be impressive. Only passable at the very best.The soundtrack contains a real good opening theme, which is titled ""d.m.c."", and quite honestly displays the best animation in the series. Plus, the ending theme is a nice song performed by Rin Oikawa called ""I\'ll Be Your Home"", but it\'s not worth sitting through 20+ minutes of bad anime to hear it. The voice work from the English cast was fine to me. Dante at times delivered some profanity filled lines, which were kind of funny. I can\'t comment on the Japanese cast, because I would never sit through this more than once.Devil May Cry is a nightmare for the anime vet and non fans of the game; but as a fan of the game, all this series does is make me want to play through the games for two reasons. Number one: to remind me that Devil May Cry really is a cool and entertaining franchise. Number two: to cleanse my mind of the vacuous tripe I\'ve wasted my time on. I would say avoid this shit, but since it has a high rating I\'m probably wasting my time. idea on just how often the mark is missed.

If you love shiny guns, motorcycles, blood and shiny swords, this may be the anime for you.Story: (6/10)The story isn't really bad. It has the right materials which are pretty substantial. In other words, the background of the story was great! It's very interesting; European setting, demons, Demon Hunter and so on. But then, the materials weren't used properly. So the story flow became really dull. The story development wasn't really visible. It was only until the 11th episode that the climax was drawn....And as soon as you're finally enjoying the climax, you suddenly get lost because the series has already ended. Personally, I think that the series was simply too rushed. I believe this would have been a better series if the story was more developed.Art: (9/10)The drawings are good. The proportions are great. But what I love most about this anime are the shiny guns, Dante's sword, some motorcycle scenes and the bloody scenes. Graphics' really good. The art complemented with the story and the atmosphere it was trying to give off.Sound: (5/10)Sorry to say, I did not notice the sound at all. I only heard the gunshots and the dubs. Maybe it was part of the main idea of the story. But I think that more sounds would help define the atmosphere. That aside, I did NOT enjoy the OP and ED at all.Character: (6/10)The characters are interesting, but they were not developed well. The same comment as the story. They good materials but were not used well. For one thing, Dante's father and mother could have been given some light, but they weren't.The other two female characters, Lady and the girl that could use thunder could have also been given some emphasis. Simply put, there were not enough interesting flashbacks for the viewers to sympathize are empathize with.Enjoyment: (8/10)Well, it was funny and action packed. Again, you'll really enjoy this if you love guns and blood.Overall: (7/10)Though the story and characters were underdeveloped, the anime's decently enjoyable.

Most things based off a video game- whether it be a movie, a book, or even an anime- are damned to fail. So for Devil May Cry, based on the video games of the same title, my hopes were that this work might succeed in its attempt to become a great anime. They might have been foolish, selfish wishes, but I wished that it at least would at least try.Was this anime as good as it could have been? The general consensus is no, as it seems. Why? To illustrate how an anime...becomes boring, a list, featuring Devil May Cry:1. Dante doesn’t have flaws.If he does, they barely exist. He’s a freaking blank slate. He always defeats every demon in his way, EVERY TIME. Conflict? What conflict. If there isn’t anyone he can’t kill, then why even bother watching. Even Dante is aware of his extreme powers, and is constantly bored by his opponents. If he’s bored, we’re bored. You won’t be at the edge of your seat, because you know he can defeat whoever comes his way. It’s healthy to have the character lose once in a while, because it keeps the audience on edge. It’s permissible to never have the characters lose, but at least let them break a sweat. If Dante ever breaks a sweat, which he won’t, it’ll be the cool kind, like a strawberry sundae oozing down his face or a pizza slice breaking out of his pores and sliding with a greasy trail down to his- scratch that, that’s disturbing. I actually wanted Dante to lose or die in the end, because it would be a major twist from the usual formula of ‘I can’t defeat this guy… just kidding’ that Dante relies on all too often. It’s a level of boring that can only be matched by watching plastic grass grow.2. Being something all the time = boring.Dante should not be cool 24/7. It gets boring and grating to watch. He’s cool when he sleeps. He’s cool when he eats his cool food. He’s cool when he walks all alone in the dark, in his cool outfit with his cool sword and cool shiny guns strapped to him and his cool poker face. He walks out of a fight without even a single speck of soil landing on his clothes and his hair immaculate. The coolness is great at first, but after the same thing all the goddamn time, you might even find yourself switching to “Mars of Destruction” instead of this crap. At least you can laugh at MoD.3. The plot comes at the last minute.Look at the picture for Devil May Cry. Go ahead, look at it. The white haired guy in front, as you probably know, is Dante. The other two guys are central to the plot, but show up at the next to last episode. That means the rest of the time was spent on NOTHING. The rest of the time is spent on Patty, who is basically Ciel’s fiancé Elizabeth from Kuroshitsuji mixed with Renge from Ouran High School Host Club. If you don’t know who those people are, the mishmash would be a grotesque mass of blonde hair, clingy personality, no point, and a really annoying tendency to appear at the worst times. That’s Patty for you, a girl who should’ve left after the first episode, but stuck around just to add another element of suck to the DMC headquarters.Now that we’ve got that out of the way, more about the plot. The plot is so rushed into the ending that they shouldn’t have even bothered. Most of the anime is just one episode dramas which have zero conflict because as I said before, Dante doesn’t lose. Ever. Devil May Cry is about Dante and friends having wonderful romps through their zany adventures of killing bloodthirsty demons. And Patty’s there too, I guess. It wasn’t very good, it’s very obvious it was based off a video game. There’s really no explanation of anything- I would have loved to hear the limitations of the demons, the limitations of Dante, or how Devil May Cry got started. Nobody gets that much of a backstory, no rules of the universe are explained, and no real emotional ties between characters are developed. It’s cripplingly average. The majority of the anime is Dante strutting around eating his strawberry sundaes and pizza and beer while shooting demons. It’s not very fun once you get passed the first episode.On the technical side, it’s obvious that they did do a bit of demonology research, evidenced by names such as Baal, Modeus, and Dante. That, however, is to be expected and it‘s not very impressive.Moving right along to the art, there are a few things that need to be said about the dreaded art. It’s blasphemous to see an otherwise gorgeous characters massacred by unsavory art. Dante’s really hot, but you wouldn’t be able to tell because the damn animation could turn caviar into feces with a garnish of roadkill. Trish the sexbomb was reduced to Trish the kill-it-with-fire bomb. Lady went from looking like Meagan Fox to looking like something a fox just killed. The animation’s boxy and has a freaking ugly style. However, it gets a four because it’s not bad enough to deter you from watching the series. Most of the other things might.Right about here’s where characters are discussed, and it’s a real shame that they’re basically cardboard cut outs with traits slapped on to them. In fact, each character can be described in one sentence without fear of missing a personality aspect. They are all so flat that pieces of soggy paper say to their children, “Honey, some day you’ll be like Dante.”Dante isn’t the only character at fault here. Lady is a chick who basically fills the screen when the animators take a break from Dante’s face, Patty is a chick who is there for comic relief, but it’s more like comic agony, and Trish is the girl who’s supposed to be really hot, but as I said before, the fault lies in the sub par animation. It’s notable that Patty is one of the few original (to this anime) characters here. The actual demons are transparent and you can see their explanations for their actions coming from a mile away (I wanted to battle the infamous Dante, I need to prove myself to master, I knew your father, etc).The sound of the whole thing was okay. It was just alright. The choices were very obvious, like “DANT’S BAD@ZZ SO OBVSLY HE LURVES ROCKNROLL OMG LOL!!!1” It’s sickeningly mediocre rock, by the way. Nothing particularly hardcore.As for the enjoyment, if you watch DMC, watch it for the ride. If you get tired of the same cool shtick over and over then watch a few episodes and don’t finish it, the ending does not carry a great payoff. Otherwise, I recommend this anime to those who are intrigued by badassery and badassery alone. becomes boring, a list, featuring Devil May Cry:1. Dante doesn’t have flaws.If he does, they barely exist. He’s a freaking blank slate. He always defeats every demon in his way, EVERY TIME. Conflict? What conflict. If there isn’t anyone he can’t kill, then why even bother watching. Even Dante is aware of his extreme powers, and is constantly bored by his opponents. If he’s bored, we’re bored. You won’t be at the edge of your seat, because you know he can defeat whoever comes his way. It’s healthy to have the character lose once in a while, because it keeps the audience on edge.

Well, i remember some crappy video game base on movie game like Transformers, or ET. But maybe some game like Lord of the Ring or maybe the recent Wolverine game for the PC is good. Speaking of game, now i going comment a anime that was base from one of the best game from Capcom call 'Devil May Cry' (wahhhhh.....), and how that i think about it; well, let's find out!DMC, when it say it going to become an anime; i like any other DMC player are jump for...joy for it adaption. But after going through all the 12 episode of DMC, i like any other DMC player are down with sorrow and anger that what the hell the director has done on DMC.The story in this anime are all episodic, each episode are stand alone story until episode 9 or 10 where the real plot has finally started. And each episode are all the same:1,there is a demon case2,Dante sitting around and do nothing (or maybe try to annoy Patty stupid problem) until Morrison say 'get your ass up! We got work to do, blah blah blah....'3,He goes to work, have some help from Lady and Trish4,He blew the work, mission accomplish and his debt is increase. The End!That it! Nothing new, no plot that connected to other plot, zero! Until episode 9 or 10.Sure you have character like Dante, Lady, and Trish to be animated here, and you do have character only for this anime, like Patty, she has been on the series since episode only has 'finally' been serve as a important character on episode 9 or 10, for the rest of the episode she just serve as a annoying brat! And Morrison, Dante agent always try to bring him a good job but end getting mess up by Dante.For Dante, Lady, and Trish (i still want make a comment on them!), Dante still Dante, like pizza and strawberry, and weild Ebony & Ivory and Rebellion to fight off demon. And the funny thing is, he use his gun more than his sword! Even the director finally let him use it, the sword battle are just temporary! But Trish and Lady still play their role where they supposed to be, to support Dante and take Dante credit!Animation is good, no less. The shading and everything was good. Even the bike scene in episode 2 are well done. Plus the OP of the series was nice, able to blend in the series as well. But the ED (though i didn't listen that often) was smooth and relax.What is the credit for us finishing DMC anime? Zero!What is the credit for them finishing DMC anime?Promoting DMC4!What is the credit for us buying DMC anime DVD?More DMC4 bonus!And in my opinion, this bonus are come to nothing and pointless after the real thing is out. The anime just bring down Dante good point and completely destroy the DMC atmosphere. And DMC is not the only one being anime, other like 'Tales of...', '.Hack' did make the series well and on going. And heck, even the live action Resident Evil movie was better than this!That why product movie, animation, comic or anything that is base on something are mostly not a good thing! joy for it adaption.

On the one hand, looking at it critically is pretty difficult. It\'s based on a game series that I really like, and they really do the games justice, and trying to look at it critically makes me feel like I\'m nitpicking issues that didn\'t really impact my enjoyment at the end of it all. However, I do want to be somewhat fair with it, so I\'ll give them two ratings: one as a fan of the games, and one just looking at it as is.As a fan of the games, the show...does just about everything that I could\'ve hoped for. If all you\'re looking for is a show that represents what the games are all about while also getting a new story, this does the job pretty well. I am honestly surprised that this show isn\'t brought up more when it comes to good video game adaptations, at least when talking about representing the source material in a good way. There\'s a few things that I feel like they could\'ve improved on when making the show, like sometimes I feel like Dante\'s a bit too much of an asshole at times, but they\'re pretty nit-picky, and it\'s not really a distracting issue, just something I feel like fans would pick up on. I really can\'t say much more about it from the perspective of a fan, so I suppose it\'s time to talk about specific things about the show.Before I get to the thing that some people might have an issue with, I actually want to praise a couple of things before I get to that. First: the animation. It\'s pretty damn good looking, which is pretty common for shows made by Studio Madhouse. The show was made just around the time when digital animation started to look really good in TV shows, and it looks really good, especially for the time. It\'s all mainly hand drawn, but mixes some CGI in there, but only for very specific moments when you\'d probably not even notice the CGI. It also just looks good stylistically. The day time/bright scenes look decent, albeit kinda standard, but the show looks especially good in the night/dark. I could go into way more detail, but there\'s a lot of layers to making stuff look good in different lightings, so... I dunno, watch a YouTube video explaining it.The other thing I want to talk about is the music. The music in this show is pretty damn awesome. Some of the tracks feel like your typical anime tracks, nothing good, nothing bad, but the tracks they play in fight scenes are pretty friggin\' rad, especially near the end. The track ""Evil Spirit"" in particular really sticks out as a really good track. The opening theme and ending are pretty damn good too. I don\'t really have much else to say about the music, it\'s just really good, and I wish it was available regularly.Now, for the one issue I feel like a lot of people might have. If you aren\'t a fan of the games, then I can\'t really see this doing that much for you. I mean, on its own, it\'s decent, but nothing too special. The characters feel like standard anime characters, the story is pretty standard, it would most likely just feel standard if you aren\'t really familiar with the source material. It\'s fine, but having knowledge of the games makes it way more enjoyable.So, as a fan of the games, it\'s like an 8/10. Very much a must watch if you like the Devil May Cry series. Looking at it without knowing the games, it\'s like a 5 or 6/10. does just about everything that I could\'ve hoped for.

There he is hired To kill demons. Theres many fights and heaps of blood. And its just so cool the way he uses his sword. everyone with a thrust for blood will love this. ', ""This anime was recommended to me by a friend who absolutely adores it! I realized when I was finished watching it, she meant the video game and not this. Oh well...too late.Story:No plot. Seriously. There is no plot in this anime. Now I don't know what the video game is like so I won't dwell into it, but I was very disappointed in the fact this this anime, as good as it looks, lacked a simple plot. It was only 'filler' and 'subplot' episodes until at least the last two episodes. I just wished it came close to what my friend told me about...instead of this bull.Art:Saved by the art. It's wasn't bad really. The style was especially interesting, and there wasn't bright colours to make my head spin. Overall, the anime and art style was relatively calm.Sound:Same as the art. Wasn't too, too bad.Character:Now I know something is missing. I did look up the DMC wiki after I watched and realized they were missing a huge chunk of characters. Too bad since I was so interested in meeting Dante's brother and learning more about his past. But aside from a lazy, demon demon slayer, and a little girl who can't keep her mouth shut, they both seem like the typical demon and human tag team you would see in any other anime. In short, it's nothing new.Enjoyment/Overall:It was fine. I enjoyed the random parts and I am a fan of white haired anime guys, but it was too short for my tasting. I just wished they animated more.I give this anime 55% on the giant sword scale. instead of this bull.Art:Saved by the art. It's wasn't bad really.

The main being that you never see Dante in his devil form, which to me was a real let down. Another being that there was never any cameo appearances of enermys from the games except for the lava spider in the intro (thats the only one i spotted, if others were im sorry for not noticing). ', 'I played the games, and I figured that I would watch the anime. The characters were well portrayed, and the fight scenes were cool (when we actually got to see them), but it was overall a pretty average anime. Storyline definitely lacked lustre, and became pretty monotonous. For those looking to kill time? Go for it. Looking for something with a good storyline and content? Not exactly my first pick for you. One of the major strong points, however, was the art, which I truly enjoyed. ', ""A lot of gamers are, at least, familiar with Capcom's Devil May Cry. The franchise is pretty beloved, except for that reboot one where Dante had dark hair and was, objectively, a piece of shit. In 2007, after the third instalment but before the fourth, our old friends at Madhouse started releasing an anime based off of the games. That's right, the studio that brought us such adaptations as X-men, Metropolis, and FF Legend of the Crystals was behind this. Well, maybe this one isn't a pile of garbage like those were. Well, except Metropolis. It was just sub-par.Story:We open with Morrison bringing Dante...a job. Now, you might find yourself asking “who the hell is  Morrison?” He's an original character who basically exists to bring Dante work and, occasionally, drive him around. The job is simple, Dante just has to safely escort a young orphan girl to the estate of the deceased father she never met to claim her inheritance. Naturally, she's being hunted by demons.This is one of those anime where the underlying plot is pretty light and most episodes are just doing their own thing. Dante gets a job that somehow involves demons and then he goes out to slay them. In fact, the weakest part of the series is the big underlying plot. You get little snippets of it in quite a few episodes, but it ultimately involves a lot of contrivance and it's just not very good in general. Even the ongoing stuff that's meant to draw your attention to the fact that something is afoot is largely just dull and really obvious. To the point where it's just “this again” after a few times. The episodes also have a general problem of trying way too hard to give happy endings. To the point where they can just go completely off the rails and not make much sense. There are quite a few episodes that set things up for sad or, at the very least, bitter-sweet endings and then pull happy ones out of their anuses. I guess I missed the memo about DMC being for small children who can't process tragedy on account of the PEGI 16 ratings.With that being said, a lot of the episodic scenarios are pretty interesting. Varied too. Yeah, you know that Dante is going to fight some demon,  but there's a lot of variation in what kinds of demons he'll fight and how they'll approach. Some of them use stealthy approaches or try to use guile, others prefer the direct approach. Some are after him specifically, others just happen to stumble upon him while going about their terrible business. And some of the scenarios are really intricate. The death poker game being a prime example.Characters:The characters from the games, Dante, Trish & Lady are all portrayed pretty true to character. Which is more than a certain reboot managed. In terms of original characters, some of the ones Dante encounters on his missions are kind of interesting. Others are pretty mediocre. Then we have our reoccurring Ocs, Morrison & Patty. Morrison is a boring character. We don't know why he's bringing Dante jobs, how they met or anything beyond “he brings Dante jobs.” He's pretty much on par with the plot coupon guy from your average PreCure series. And those can get by with it because they are actually for children. Then we have Patty. Have you ever wondered what Devil May Cry would be like if Dante had a slightly annoying child sidekick? No? Well, it's not the best decision that Madhouse could have made. She spends a lot of time pestering Dante, having to be rescued and contributing virtually nothing.Art:The artwork is pretty decent. The characters look like themselves and Madhouse clearly made an effort to make the aesthetic look like DMC. The demon designs are generally pretty good as well. The trouble is that the action sequences themselves aren't all that good. In a series that relies heavily on action sequences. A lot of the “big” Dante fights end very quickly without having much content. And a lot of the sequences focus heavily on scenes of Dante attacking while not showing, or barely showing, his opponent. It would've benefited from showing them striking at one another in the same frames a bit more, is what I'm saying. Oh, and expect a lot of deaths to go the blood fountain route. I guess demon blood streams are highly pressurised.Sound:The series did get some good voice actors. We've got Morikawa Toshiyuki as Dante. Yes, Dante and Sephiroth are the same guy. We all suspected it given the resemblance. We've got Orikasa Fumiko and Tanaka Atsuko, both of whom are damn good actresses, as Lady and Trish respectively. Even the less interesting characters got some decent voices. The musical score by Hama Takeshi & Tsutsumi Hiroaki is pretty close to fantastic.Ho-yay:There isn't any, really. The closest you're going to get is Lady and Trish forming a friendship.Final Thoughts:Devil May Cry is an anime that had some potential. After all, there's a lot to work with from the games. Unfortunately, it's held back by a dull underlying plot, trying too hard to provide happy endings, the slightly annoying child sidekick and mundane action sequences. Ultimately, I'd still say it's all right  but it certainly could have been better. My final rating is a 6/10. Next week we'll continue video game month with a look at Street Fighter Alpha. a job.

The death poker game being a prime example.Characters:The characters from the games, Dante, Trish & Lady are all portrayed pretty true to character. Which is more than a certain reboot managed. In terms of original characters, some of the ones Dante encounters on his missions are kind of interesting. Others are pretty mediocre. Then we have our reoccurring Ocs, Morrison & Patty. Morrison is a boring character. We don't know why he's bringing Dante jobs, how they met or anything beyond “he brings Dante jobs.” He's pretty much on par with the plot coupon guy from your average PreCure series. And those can get by with it because they are actually for children. Then we have Patty. Have you ever wondered what Devil May Cry would be like if Dante had a slightly annoying child sidekick? No? Well, it's not the best decision that Madhouse could have made. She spends a lot of time pestering Dante, having to be rescued and contributing virtually nothing.Art:The artwork is pretty decent. The characters look like themselves and Madhouse clearly made an effort to make the aesthetic look like DMC. The demon designs are generally pretty good as well. The trouble is that the action sequences themselves aren't all that good. In a series that relies heavily on action sequences. A lot of the “big” Dante fights end very quickly without having much content. And a lot of the sequences focus heavily on scenes of Dante attacking while not showing, or barely showing, his opponent. It would've benefited from showing them striking at one another in the same frames a bit more, is what I'm saying. Oh, and expect a lot of deaths to go the blood fountain route. I guess demon blood streams are highly pressurised.Sound:The series did get some good voice actors. We've got Morikawa Toshiyuki as Dante. Yes, Dante and Sephiroth are the same guy. We all suspected it given the resemblance. We've got Orikasa Fumiko and Tanaka Atsuko, both of whom are damn good actresses, as Lady and Trish respectively. Even the less interesting characters got some decent voices. The musical score by Hama Takeshi & Tsutsumi Hiroaki is pretty close to fantastic.Ho-yay:There isn't any, really. The closest you're going to get is Lady and Trish forming a friendship.Final Thoughts:Devil May Cry is an anime that had some potential. After all, there's a lot to work with from the games. Unfortunately, it's held back by a dull underlying plot, trying too hard to provide happy endings, the slightly annoying child sidekick and mundane action sequences. Ultimately, I'd still say it's all right  but it certainly could have been better. My final rating is a 6/10. Next week we'll continue video game month with a look at Street Fighter Alpha."", ""Badass half-human half-devil? That's Dante your talking about. Devil May Cry made its name first on games. Its really popular on game consoles, because a hack and slash game that's so detailed like DMC doesn't come quite often. And in 2007 they made an anime adaptation of it.Story : 8First of all, if you have no idea what Devil May Cry is. Its the name of a shop that Dante owns, a half-human half-devil who specializes on doing missions concerning devils. The story does not much differ from the game, Dante is still running his shop. But this time, he started helping a little girl...named Patty. Who ends up staying at his shop. It doesn't really focus on Patty though. Every episode he completes different missions. The last two episodes are the longest mission he'll be doing.Art : 8Art was great, the series was aired in 2007. And I'd say that it has better art than most of the 2007's animes. Well they did use a lot of CG's on it, since it has quite a lot action scenes.Character : 8Dante is your badass devil hunter, he has two handy dandy guns named Ebony and Ivory. And the sword Rebellion, which Sparda his father gave him. I kinda hoped that more characters from the game were used. Too bad some of the more badass characters in the game weren't shown on the series. But! Two of the supporting characters at the game were shown, Lady and Trish. Lady is a human devil hunter like Dante, and Trish is Dante's old partner at the shop. And the new characters shown on the series were pretty quite good too. Patty is your resident loli maid that lives in the shop. She's too damn cute.Music : 7Not much to mention on music. The ending theme is quite good though. The opening theme is just instrumentals, I didn't bother listening to it though.Enjoyment : 8The series is short; so I quite enjoyed it myself, since I've been a fan of DMC ever since I've played it. If you loved the game, this definitely won't waste your time.Overall : 8Overall, the animation didn't quite hit like the game. But for me? It was worth my time, many games that were adapted to anime suck real bad. But DMC is quite OK for me though. I might be biased since I loved the game. But anyway, all in all you wouldn't enjoy this series if you haven't played any of the games. Since the series didn't bother telling who or what is Dante, and you surely want to know how DMC started. And its a must to know who Dante is, there's more to him than being a badass devil hunter. You'd love to know his history more.

There are other characters, too, but none of them are particularly interesting, nor do any of them stand out as unique or dynamic. Dante is the owner of ""Devil May Cry,"" a business that investigates demons... or something...Oh yes, the fight scenes. So very many mindless fight scenes, complete with copious levels of gore.Now, don\'t get me wrong, I like fight scenes, and I can see why an anime based on an action game would want to have a lot of fight scenes. But...when the fight scenes preclude any form of storytelling, as they do in Devil May Cry, then I can\'t see the justification in making an anime series at all.I do have to give credit where credit is due, though. Despite all of its many faults, Devil May Cry is very well animated. The fight scenes and action sequences, countless as they are, are all fluidly animated.

And, wandering hopelessly on the web, I found out it has an anime adaptation. Too bad for me though, only finding out about it just lately.With me, who has played the Devil May Cry games, I had high expectations with this.Story: (6/10)It's your typical cartoon series: it has no sequence, no continuity. You can watch the first few episodes in random order and find no differences in each. I recommend you watch episodes 3, 6, 7, 8, and 9 before watching episodes 10-12. It'd be less depressing...that way.Art: (8/10)Animation's good. It has has that Devil May Cry feel, but a little milder. Gun animations are pretty cool too. Motorcycles, slashes, etc. are all good. one thing you'd hate about it though is that you will witness less the action unlike that in the games. Also, Dante's anime features is pretty accurate.Sound: (10/10)Okay. Maybe I'm exaggerating on this one, or maybe I'm not. Sounds were amazing and believable. They have convinced me that this 'thing' is slashed, or the gun has fired, or a person's walking. Also, the opening theme was one of the best musical scores I've heard from an anime.Character: (6/10)Dante's overall cool-and-mysterious-that-somehow-still-finds-a-way-to-be-hilarious characteristics made an episode worth watching. Also, at first, I didn't like Patty and Morrison. But Patty's story was moving, and Morrison's pretty cool. But, it's not that I don't want to see them, it's just that I wanted to see somebody else. Like Lady and Trish for example, who, if I might add, were just worthless the whole story. I mean, sure, Lady makes more money with her heterochromic eyes, and Trish is this bad ass chic who controls electricity. But, no. They weren't as interesting as they were in the games. It's like they were never there at all. I also wanted too see Virgil, and the Devil Trigger in its full capacity. Too bad, I didn't.Enjoyment: (7/10)If you're going to ask me if it really is enjoyable, yes. It is enjoyable. Patty's fun to watch especially when she nags around Dante. Cool, although minimal, fight scenes will reel you in. Comedy was not too forced. I have said this earlier, but some episodes would just blow you off. That made it less interesting.It was Stylish!

I'm a pretty big fan of the games, 3 being one of my all time favorite games. So there is a lot of fun to be had as a fan seeing Dante going through these villain of the week stories. They do a good job subtly fleshing out his character, and there are some really cool concepts in play here. But the execution is just really flat. The animation is very bogstandard and rigid, which is a shame being in the hands madhouse. The main cast is as fun as ever but a lot of...the side characters are really one note and even annoying. There are a few too many episodes that are boring. I can't help but feel disappointed, as I really enjoy this universe, but they do little to spice it up.

I wouldn\'t say it was a huge disappointment, since I really expected very little of a storyline - which on par with my expectations, turned out to be none at all.

That being said I was never really fond of the females in the games either, Lady was probably the better though (until DMC4).Moving on.I did however, enjoy the every-so-often cursing which would seem to fit with Dante\'s personality very well.

Most of the episodes (8 of them actually) are structured in an episodic format, basically showing Dante doing some type of contract for a costumer, be it a desperate wife or the brother of a biker that died during a race, which generally involve him killing some random demon that murdered someone important to this person. The episodes that are not individual stories focus around this weird demon guy named Sid and his plan to receive the powers of the demon lord Abigail, while also giving away some other details about the demon world and Sparda.I didn\'t really mind that the episodes were mostly separate stories, but most of them are really boring and uninteresting, and I think the main reason for this is that the anime doesn\'t really have that much fighting in it. Don\'t get me wrong, I\'m not saying that an anime can only be good if there\'s lots of fights in it, but, dude, this is DMC, if you\'re not going to put lots of fights and demon slashing in it (and why the hell wouldn\'t you?), than at least make the side characters and stories interesting.Don\'t get me wrong, Dante is still as funny and badass as he used to be, the same goes for Trish and Lady, who also make an appearance in this show, I even like the new characters they introduced. Sure, Patty can be annoying sometimes, but it\'s aways great so see her bitching at Dante telling him to get his lazy ass off the chair and do some work, and Morrisson is just cool in general, I think it\'s because of the mustache. The problem with these characters is that, while they\'re pretty cool and likable when they\'re alone or interacting with each other, the same doesn\'t go for when they\'re interacting with the side characters or the enemies. None of these characters could make me feel interested in the story or what was going on, with a few exceptions here and there, and these were mainly because the plot lines were sort of interesting, and there is no tension to be had if the enemies you fight feel like soldiers from a Dynasty Warriors game.Almost every single fight in this anime is resolved within 2-3 minutes or less, it depends if Dante decides to use his pistols or if Trish and Lady are there to help him. It just makes enemies look like they\'re no big deal, even when they\'re 4 times Dante\'s size.It\'s just makes me feel so disappointed everytime the anime decides to show some fighting, because they\'re actually pretty cool. The animation is fluid and it looks great, and besides one or two fights that just involve Dante shooting demons \'till they explode, the choreography of the fights is really good, It\'s just a shame that there is so little of them in the anime.The sound department is also good. The opening does a pretty good job of setting the mood for the rest of the episode, and the fact that it is also used in almost every fight in this anime is not a bad thing. Besides the opening the rest of the songs are ok, with the exception of ""Future in my Hands"", the main theme for the sixth episode, ""Rock Queen"", that really stands out from the rest of the tracks, possibly being the best song present in this anime\'s soundtrack.Overall, I don\'t consider DMC to be a bad anime, it\'s just sort of misguided. They could have done so much more with what they had here and instead they lamed it out. There are some few moments of pure enjoyment here and there, but most of the time you\'ll only be mildly interested in what\'s going on in the screen at best.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION: If you\'re a fan of the games, then give this a try, it\'s still fun to see Dante kicking some ass, but if you\'re not, well, you might wanna watch something else. awesome rock tracks, and you might just have a great action anime, but that\'s not the case with Devil May Cry, it can\'t even get the hack \'n slash part right.About the plot, it is set between the events of DMC1 and DMC4, but it\'s not like that really matters.

Actually, thanks to this exact anime my whole interest in this fandom began. I got some dvds from my friend who didn’t have time to watch them. And there was Devil May Cry anime, unfortunately only the first episode. But it was enough to get me in. I downloaded the rest as soon as I could and started watching.I wasn’t much of a anime watcher then. I knew only several anime, but none of them like Devil May Cry. And to be honest, I still haven’t found...anything similar enough.Devil May Cry is a series of 10 short stories, which have nothing in common except the main characters of Dante, Patty and Morrison, and some others. But then suddenly, we come onto episode 11 and everything stars to make sense! The stories in fact have been essential for the main plot which appears in two last episodes. Well, episode 12 is basically the final fight only, so not of a plot there. The stories themselves are different, some are better some weaker but for me each of them was interesting enough to watch.I know that most of DMC fans don’t like the anime, for the creation of Dante. And I don’t blame them; it’s true that Dante’s personality’s been deformed more than ‘a bit’. But, still, maybe because it was the beginning for me, I like it. The first time I watched it a year ago, and since then I played DMC, DMC3 and DMC4, read mange and huge amount of fanfiction. A few days ago I watched it again, to make sure that I love it as I loved it then.As I see it’s getting mostly weak scores, but from me it’s 10. I’m absolutely enchanted by the DMC world, anime art, Dante’s personality (the active part of it, not the one that could be sleeping all day long), guns and generally fights. In any other anime I didn’t find such a good looking main character with a gun and an oversized sword. And therefore I dare to say there isn’t a single anime resembling DMC, its world, characters and weapons. anything similar enough.Devil May Cry is a series of 10 short stories, which have nothing in common except the main characters of Dante, Patty and Morrison, and some others. But then suddenly, we come onto episode 11 and everything stars to make sense! The stories in fact have been essential for the main plot which appears in two last episodes.

As a half demon – half human, he uses his trusty sword – Rebellion – and his two guns – Ebony and Ivory – to take on missions. Dante owns and runs an odd job called “Devil May Cry”, a business that...specialises in hunting and killing demon-related or supernatural problems. The series is based on the game series which goes by the identical name.Plot Rating – 5.0/10.0•\tArt and Animation –The art style and animation in DmC is good, compared to any other animation or artwork seen in any anime aired during the 2006-07s. Since it is based on a gaming series originally, the artists and the animators have kept this in mind to give the characters a bit different appearance from the normal or traditional anime style. The artwork resembles that seen in the anime movies – Bayonetta: Bloody Fate and to an extent Dante’s Inferno: An Animated Epic and the animation is praiseworthy. However, the series advocates much of gory content, which makes it unsuitable for watchers of every age.Rating for Art and Animation –6.0/10.0•\tDialogues and Voice Casting –The dialogues are pretty well-framed, so as to give the characters their personalities, which are individually reflected in the most efficient manner, judging by the manner of presentation of thoughts, which the characters adopt throughout the series while carrying out conversations among themselves. However, in a few instances, it is seen that the usage of explicit language has been supported throughout the episode, which makes it unsuitable for kids to be viewed, again.Script – 5.0/10.0•\tOverall Review –The TV series of DmC is based on the originally released gaming series by Capcom, which goes by the same name. However, 12 episodes, each highlighting a separate mission is supposedly not enough for the entire story line of the actual series to get covered up. In my opinion, a second season at the least was expected, since the season 01 has failed to portray a few other important characters such as Nero and Virgil. Moreover, Dante’s relations / history with his father Lady, Sparda and Trish weren’t highlighted much in the series except for a bit of references given in a few particular episodes. These drawbacks have brought about a bit of disappointment, although the series as a whole makes a fair watch, undoubtedly.For the aforementioned drawbacks, my personal rating out of 10.0 – 5.0/10.0Average Rating – 6.0/10.0 specialises in hunting and killing demon-related or supernatural problems.

As a fan myself I recommend to watch it.If you're unfamilliar with the series and don't want any spoilers here's the short version - Very episodic, but slowly, part after part the main plot appears. Badass main male character. Short, but cool fights. Awesome music (rock-metal intro and a slow, peaceful ending). Every battle scene includes a badass music theme, mostly the intro. The graphics and animation are fine, especially demon blood getting splashed all over the place :). There's also a...plenty of comedy moments.And now the part for game fans.It's about Dante after the first part of the game, when he has already slain Mundus and is (most probably) the strongest, most powerfull and definitely badass living being. If you've played the game, then you should already know that it's hard to actually challenge Dante. Most of his opponents are nothing but flies to him. With that said, I don't really understand why other reviewers are so rough on it. Lady and Trish also appear, but (in my opinnion) Trish is a bit ignored by the show and it doesn't show enough of her.It's about Dante's everyday life, you get to know a few more things about him, mostly his financial status and favourite food.I think this show should be treated as one describing the life of hero, who has already saved the world and defeated his most powerful opponents and now is simply taking care of things if they get out of control. In short - Life after the final goal have been accomplished. That's why the main hero is mostly bored and lazy.Summary: Good story, Great characters (it's Dante, you know), Good animation and Awesome music.PS. If we put Vergil in the place of Dante as the main hero, the whole show would be a one episode, about six minutes long. Opening and ending included :D plenty of comedy moments.And now the part for game fans.It's about Dante after the first part of the game, when he has already slain Mundus and is (most probably) the strongest, most powerfull and definitely badass living being.

Anybody who watches this series though must know that the characters aren\'t exactly identical from the ones you got to know in the DMC games, don\'t judge it by that, if anything the animated series is supposed to inspire you to go play the game if you haven\'t.Story- In terms of story line, mediocre is a good word it tries to actually follow a decent storyline except a few episodes just kind of fall out of...place. To be honest some episodes don\'t even seem related to the series and just seem to be filler (funny considering that most of my friends considered more than half of the series filler) but the truth is their not really filler but just plots that won\'t actually get tied together until the last two episodes (which is fine and all but seriously was not the best idea the creators have). There was nothing persay to build up on unless of course you think that ""Dante kills demon"" is something that is really well built (not that that\'s bad idea i thought it was a really good one but typically I want more behind a fight than I\'m going to kill you because your an abomination)Art- I actually thought the art was pretty good I mean they obviously need to take a class to find out how much blood is inside of a given body then again most animes have that problem anyway. The animation was good very rarely did I end up saying that was shoddy (although occasionally the number of bullets shot didn\'t match the number that hit the ground I know it\'s stupid but I\'m picky about that sort of thing).Sound- The sound was pretty good it actually pulled me in I especially liked the opening theme which matched really well to the whole battle context. Voice acting was okay not the best thing in the world but it got me through I don\'t want to hear english dub though I liked dante\'s jab voice actor and they will most likely ruin it with english dub.Character- I hated character development they spent no time developing the aspects of Dante or for that matter any other character in the series in the end all I thought was that Dante likes strawberry sundaes and pizza and that near everybody seems to like killing demons (it actually does sound like fun when you think about it but honestly as you can tell by Dante\'s financial status it doesn\'t pay much).Enjoyment- Despite all my whining I did enjoy the series after all in this case especially the end justified the means and gave me the gratification I needed not to bomb this whole series. I\'m a man who likes action and if gun totting sword swinging demon bashing fights don\'t fill that need I don\'t know what could.Overall- My suggestion only watch this series if you don\'t feel like being a little insulted because you\'ve played the games and know something is not right about a situation. If you like violence and killing I doubt you\'ll have a problem getting through this series place.

He fights...Random demons he then eats pizza and sundaes and we are reminded that he is drowning in debt and doing all these things while being a badass.So from what you have just read so far you can pretty much guess that there really isn't really a plot to this and for the most part you would be right.Devil may cry story is for the most part very episodic it mostly includes stand alone missions.that dante dose for a living and some of what dante dose when he doesn't have work going on. Which is mostly him fucking around while eating high amounts of sundaes and pizzas.Which I am not an expert of demon or half demon biology but surely eating all that pizza and sundaes would probably slightly bad for him .unless in this world just demons  really love  pizza and sundaes.But other than that there really isn't much I can comment onthis show doesn't  really use all the ingredients that it could used and even if this show for all intents and purposes is a kick ass rule of cool show about some badass dude fighting demons. It doesn't use or play on many  of the elements it's brings up.Like one example there was an episode where we find a demon falling in love with this human women and though this episode we find out that not all demons are evil monsters that destroy and kill everything in there path and demons themselves have the ability to grow not just in power and also there personality and beliefs.And what really bothers  me is that they gloss over this idea in one episode,Which leaves me with few questions like why is this demon so different from the rest of his kind or what lead him to becoming like this.They never explain or  expand on that idea and concept.Which I think is a wasted opportunity.Now I will mention   that this show tried to have an overarching plot with the loli side kick that Dante has with him.That dose lead to this plot In the end but it really doesn't matter in the long run of things. What happens is that the this demon that's trying to become some sort of super demon and needs the loli side kicks blood or something she has to complete it.But it was boring and predictable and I don't care about in the lest.Like here is how they  could have made this show ten times more interesting and not feel like a soulless video game ad in anime form.Still keep the episodic missions expect the episode count is 24 episodes and during these episodes we lean more about the lore and world of devil may cry.Because the demon and super natural elements are quite interesting and it would cool to explore Dante childhood as being a half demon/orphan or talk about what other super natural shit that going down that doesn't involve demons.It would be pretty cool to see Dante fight angels or some organization trying to capture or kill him because of his demonic nature.Surely that would be batter Than what we actually got and if it had those what ifs the story and anime could stand up on its own and  not just be a video game adaptation.Character,6/10The main character is pretty badass. I mean if you look up badass in the dictionary you would probably find this dude picture on it.He is pretty cocky and very relaxed , says bad ass lines and dose the most badass things you can think of.The side characters were also pretty cool as well.Except one character because for some reason this show has a loli side kick for danteWho pissed me off some times.The bad guys who are demons of the week.Are pretty much your throw away characters that I don't give a fuck about.Art, 6/10The animation is pretty decent, it's very polished and shiny it is something you should watch in he if you can.It also has this kind of dim color scheme that goes well with the kind setting that this show has.It also has some pretty good fight animation as well.The demon designs were pretty cool as well.Dante also looks pretty cool as well.Sound, 5/10Not a big fan of the opening or ending song.Because it just a background noise music which doesn't sound good to me.The ost is pretty decent and it fits the tone of the show pretty well.And I couldn't find out who did the ost.But ost is ok.The sub and dub  is alight.Plus Dante English voice actor sounds like he does in the games.Enjoyment,6/10I liked the fight scenes.I also like the characters as well.I also like some of the designs for the demons they were pretty cool.Overall,6/10So if you are Looking for a decent rule of cool show then you will probably like this anime but it seems like to be that you would have to be fan of devil may cry in order to like it more.If you not a fan of the game you will mostly right this off as another sub par video game adaption. Random demons he then eats pizza and sundaes and we are reminded that he is drowning in debt and doing all these things while being a badass.So from what you have just read so far you can pretty much guess that there really isn't really a plot to this and for the most part you would be right.Devil may cry story is for the most part very episodic it mostly includes stand alone missions.that dante dose for a living and some of what dante dose when he doesn't have work going on.

Its just 12 episodes, it has not just Dante but also some really good character development from the protagonist and antagonist sides, and each episode was actually unique - twists and turns and such.With that said, the ending episode was what made it surprising for me - I wasn\'t expecting such a twist to occur.With that said, I feel that Virgil should have been a part of this story in some form or way. Even though Sid is a good villain, he\'s not the best...villain you\'d want. Personally, I found King in ""Death Poker"" a more interesting villain than Sid. At the same time, I think that this series (although good in terms of its art style and its episodic construction) was good, and worth the rewatch, but its for fans only.Either way, its ten times better than DMC5 and what they did to Virgil and Dante - this Dante kicked ass, and its worth every minute watching his fight scenes.

Strangely, taking this show out of context made the show much better and I actually liked it.We have the normal characters that we seem to love like Lady and Trish but sadly, they don’t get enough time in the show, giving the little girl Patty Lowell as the main...character next to Dante. This was the only thing I really didn’t like although the interaction between Dante and having him baby-sit this little girl gave the show a fair bit of comedy mixed into its very serious story. Sometimes it felt as though it was a bit forced as there are things I could never see Dante being ok with like when she turns the whole shop into a cute pink fairytale looking place. Patty somewhat made my inner demon want to get out myself as I have had times where I could imagine Dante throwing her out the car or off a bridge, she was that annoying. It’s sad that we had to go threw having her in there for every episode because she wasn’t really a big role until later on near the end.Dante on the other hand was awesome. I only watched the English dub but Reuben Langdon did a pretty good job matching his sort of swagger style of talking. Sometimes he had a little too much swagger in it but that didn’t happen very much. The ‘I don’t care’ attitude was cool though it needed more of a push to the badass side, it felt a little lost. He did as well as he could to match the first game but it feels like it wasn’t enough.The style of the anime and the graininess gives it a novo feel, almost like an old detective movie where the music gives it a New York 80’s jazz style. The colors are dark and sometimes it’s hard to see what’s going on but it gives the show that Horror that all the games have. (At least at when this show came out.) The character designs match the games pretty well and I have no problem with that at all. Dante looks really cute in fact for an animated character. The blood and gore that is so scattered in this show sometimes just looks like it was heavy congealed red something. It does not normally look like actual blood sometimes. The openings sadly feel lack luster as they have images of the show just plastered in for the most part. I think they should have given it a real opening rather then just a set of images. Again, I really wanted to see Lady and Trish more then Patty.In the end, this is really a show that has to be seen with a clear head. You can’t base it on the video game or any other thing. You can only base it on itself and maybe the shows around it because of the work they did on it. character next to Dante.

Seems kind of impractical to me, and would most definately lead to failure. You need character interactions, you need dramatic relationships, you need romance. Well, apparently Dante could give a s@#t less about that, because he\'s just gonna kick some monster ass and let you watch.Story-wise it suffers. Why? There isn\'t one! It is an episodic series, which isn\'t bad by any means. The series basically follows the jobs that Dante is employed with at his office, Devil May Cry. Him and Patty, a young...orphan who hangs around the office as the female of the company, take any jobs they can get to get some money to pay of Dante\'s enormous debt and get on living through the next day. This formula was mildly successful, since Dante is utterly awesome and who doesn\'t like seeing him kick ass. However, I can only watch so many Bruce Lee movies before I go ""I think this is getting old"". And unfortunately that is what happened. The other characters had little importance in the series and thus did not add to the story much.Art-wise, it was exactly the kind of animation you would expect from a horror action series. Dark, sharp, and very detailed gore. The design of the series as a whole was well done. The character design is what it was for the video game, but seeing t in animation was a real treat as a fan.The OP was quite intense seeing as though there was absolutely no vocals. It was one of the best instrumental OPs out there. The ED was nice, but not as good in my opinion. The BGMs did a good job keeping the atmosphere dark and suspenseful, and was actually quite impressed.If you\'ve played the video game, watch it. Trust me. As a fan it was a great treat. However, I can\'t say that you can only watch this if your a fan because that means that the anime failed to please the rest of its audience. Even though it pleased me, I\'m not sure I can say the same for someone new to the series, as it does nothing special or out of the ordinary to stand out from others in the same genre. Overall, its a good series, but I cannot promise it will please everyone. orphan who hangs around the office as the female of the company, take any jobs they can get to get some money to pay of Dante\'s enormous debt and get on living through the next day.

All jokes aside, great for mindless action without a coherent story with pretty decent animation. The sound track is also pretty sick. The art style is actually good, Dante looks like how I expected him to look in anime form and the other characters have okay character design too. This anime mostly consists of Dante(the main character) just flexing on everyone and being as flashy as possible, which was pretty fun.If you are looking for a story with deep characters and a meaningful plot, this is not for you but if you wanna...turn off your brain for a couple hours, then I recommend this. turn off your brain for a couple hours, then I recommend this.', ""I've played all the games, except for the reboot, and i was rather disappointed. The story of the anime didn't really have much ties with the games, but that's actually favorable so that the average anime viewer can understand what's going on.So, the story: Dante, a badass demon that slays demons, tries to kill a guy that is trying to destroy the world. The story is rather weak, but isn't boring, but it is mostly fillers.The fight scenes were really disappointing, because Dante mostly beats all the enemies in one hit without using his devil trigger.Dante ,like always ,is awesome and always...has the best cheesy but witty one-liners.By now, you'll probably be thinking to yourself why you wasted so much time reading this poorly-written review. You will by now have also guessed that i am not a professional critic. To that I reply you are right.

People say its not like the games and that there's no story and all it is, is just Dante fighting demons with cheesy punchlines...Well sorry to break it to you but that's exactly what all the games are too. I personally enjoyed this anime quite a bit. It was cool seeing Dante just perform his job instead of saving the world from Vergil or something. Seeing Lady and Trish was cool as well, and how could you NOT like that poker episode? "", 'What to say about Devil May Cry... Well, to start off, it\'s based on the Capcom action games, which are pretty outstanding and frequently get thrown into ""Top 10 Games of the Year"" lists. Insert groan here: you can already tell someone tried too hard to get this converted into an anime. And it shows.Devil May Cry (the anime) has no solid plot until the bitter end. The episodes all feel like either one-shots that were never meant to take off, or filler that was never meant to stand out. Either way, there is no ""story"" to speak of. It\'s all about Dante being this...ridiculously cool, gun-wielding, sword-swinging badass, and if I wanted that, I would just pick up the game and play it.But that\'s sort of what sets Devil May Cry to the side. The artwork and sound are both excellently executed, and the voice acting is superb. I think Capcom knew from the beginning that this was a bad idea, so they threw as much into the project as they could to prevent it from absolutely shattering when it dropped. And this is where this anime shines. If you\'re a fan of the video games, you\'ll absolutely love the style and flair of this series. Despite the lack of continuity, you never feel empty about any particular episode. It never leaves you feeling unsatisfied. But that\'s sort of a problem, too: Devil May Cry is best taken in small doses. I can absolutely fall in love with one of the episodes, and just call it a day right then and there, but if you start to watch them back to back, it starts feeling forced and drawn out, dare I say filler arc-ish. In order to really set this one apart from the rest, I think they should have either based it on the plot of one of the games (which could have made for a ridiculously good anime), or made a new plot with a continuity and a backbone to hold it all together. Style, flair, and even Dante himself, can\'t save this anime from its unfortunate shortcomings, and you\'ll notice them as time goes on.It really pains me to rate this so low. It had so much potential, and they blew it. But I honestly can\'t recommend it. Few anime series do justice to the games, and this is one of the ones that finds itself treading the same waters as a live-action movie of a video game: once you take out the element of the human player, you start losing your love for the character, to the point that the flair starts getting show-offish and almost annoying. A bit of substance might have remedied this problem, but as it stands, Devil May Cry doesn\'t hold its own when compared to Hellsing, Trinity Blood, or any of the other really good demon/vampire hunter-style anime out there. ridiculously cool, gun-wielding, sword-swinging badass, and if I wanted that, I would just pick up the game and play it.But that\'s sort of what sets Devil May Cry to the side.

True, this Anime doesn’t live up to the name of the game but don’t let that deter you from watching it! Especially if you are sick and tired of Anime clichés. The reason I like this Anime is because it doesn’t not fall into the trap of Anime clichés. (Well, it does manage to dodge them really well.)As an action Anime, this Anime fails horribly in its action. It’s action is mediocre, often ending as quickly as it began. Dante doesn’t...spend too much time on killing a single demon in the game but that doesn’t mean the producers can skimp on the fighting > spend too much time on killing a single demon in the game but that doesn’t mean the producers can skimp on the fighting >', 'Its very frustrating reading the other reviews for DMC:Anime on this website. Nearly everyone is giving it low scores because it isn\'t naruto or chobbits. If you go into this anime expecting some generic mainstream crap than of course you won\'t enjoy it. DMC is in a genre nearly of its own.This isn\'t a anime you watch for a ""deep romantic storyline"". This is an anime you watch if you want to see a badass kick alot of ass; than get his ass kicked - and yet come back alive for round three.I\'d compare this anime\'s storyline to Cowboy Bebop. Its similar, in that...its not a deep flowing storyline but instead of set of small but awesome adventures occurring within the same set of characters.DMC has great animation, awesome fight scenes, badass enemies and allies. Its a hack & slash gory horror thriller. If you love crazy over the top action, you will love DMC.

While playing through the Devil May Cry games I always wanted to see what Dante's daily life was when the world isn't in danger.This anime's plot is basically Dante getting a job and doing it. Nothing is dragged on and everything fits smoothly.There isn't much character development, but that's alright if you've played the video games.*SPOILER*Dante never loses a fight; however, they do show him struggling from time to time. It's great that they made him 'weak' in the anime and he was just lazy. He is CLEARLY stronger than all of his opponents, but Dante never ends it immediately (he...easily could). easily could)."", ""Started this anime cause i thought it would be cool to see Dante(main character)in action..guess i was wrong.To put it simply,this anime is just ugly,one of the worst i've ever seen,you can tell just by one look that's all for commercial purposes.There's no story,characters have no personality,the action sucks and it's damn boring from the beggining to the end,i would save just two or three moment os the all 12 episodes,anyways,don't lose your time with this and get some serious anime on watch. "", ""So if you're here after having played the DMC series games (DMC 3 and 4) and are expecting to see more of the continuity of the story, like Dante's past or how do he take care of his arsenals, let me tell you this: there's nothing like that in this anime. It's episodic, meaning that it's stories about clients coming Dante's demon hunting shop and in each episode, the CLIENTS are the focus. Not Dante or his partners. Picture Cowboy Bebop (Except Cowboy Bebop does it better in my opinion).Story:I think this show is made in order to promote the video games but the problem...is, i think the writers are afraid to take risks to tamper with the already existing characters such as Dante and Trish because they don't want to upset the fans by make these characters go through troubles, conflicts and emotional breakdowns (because that'll make them appear weak). Therefore they write the characters as emotionless gun-wielding bounty hunter who breezes through every demons in every episodes with barely no effort.And also, they had made a loli to live with Dante to nag about his lifestyle every episode. This came out of nowhere and looks out of place.Art:It's pretty great in quality (as it's the same studio that made Death Note). The only gripe i have is that Dante's face is always covered by his hair most of the show.Sound:The dubbing is pretty decent but more importantly if you have been a fan of the game, they had Rueben Langdon, the man who voices Dante in both DMC games to voice Dante in this show, which is really great. You can clearly recognizes Dante's speech mannerisms and tone from the game, which for gives a slight feeling of nostalgia.Extra: The demon's voices in the dubbing are really loud and rather incoherent.Overall:It's not like i'm saying that i hate show adaptations of video games in general. I'm willing to love adaptations with open arms. It's just that for them to be enjoyable, we need to make shows that expand the characters' backgrounds and make these characters go through conflicts in order to make character development. is, i think the writers are afraid to take risks to tamper with the already existing characters such as Dante and Trish because they don't want to upset the fans by make these characters go through troubles, conflicts and emotional breakdowns (because that'll make them appear weak).

The Opening is maybe the only thing I would save about it,but then the episode starts.Almost every episode is self-contained,the plot is trivial and all the characters who aren't in the main cast,last just an episode. The only piece of story is about a character who is not in the game series,not that i remember,and the animation sometimes is poor. Save your time,play the games,because when I started an episode,I could easily tell where that episode...was going and I literally lost interest after 5 minutes.Dante,Lady and Trish live up the expectations,but maybe the most annoying thing about this anime is the amount of times when it seems that there is finally a bit of action , but in the next scene is already all over and Dante has saved the day. Dante still loves pizza and gambling,but you can't make a 12 episode series without some plot,but you do preferring to put those aspects that make it a lot better in the game. was going and I literally lost interest after 5 minutes.Dante,Lady and Trish live up the expectations,but maybe the most annoying thing about this anime is the amount of times when it seems that there is finally a bit of action , but in the next scene is already all over and Dante has saved the day.

But yeah this bender eventually led me back to the Devil May Cry anime, yes like most popular Japanese games DMC got an anime but how does it fair, is it one of those rare good adaptations of a video game or does it fall flat on its face.Story: 6/10. For those unfamiliar, Devil May Cry follows the adventures of Dante, a half human half demon devil hunter who runs the titular Devil May Cry store, in...which he receives his demon hunting jobs. However unlike most anime based of a game which attempt to adapt one of the games of the series, DMC actually follows an original story (well sort of). The show follows an episodic format in which Dante takes up odd jobs that usually lead to him slaying one or multiple demons who are wreaking a small amount of havoc on his employers. These episodic stories range from being kind of crap, for example an episode based around a guy who is stalking Dante cause a girl he likes has a crush on Dante, to actually being quite good, like an episode in which Dante has to deal with two demonic brothers who have some connection to him. There is an overarching story which is set up in the first episode that involves a little girl character Paddy as well as a demon named Sid (more on them later). This slowly progressed in the background in some episodes and eventually paid off in the last two episodes. This storyline is... alright i guess, it has its moments but ultimately it just isn't focused on enough for you to care very much about it by the end. So overall the episodic stories have some highs and lows and the overarching story has moments but i fell is ultimately quite weak.Art: 8/10. The art in this series is actually quite good. Madhouse worked on this show and while not one of their strongest works i wouldn't exactly call it weak either. The characters all look good, especially Dante who is rocking his DMC1 attire (my personal favourite attire), the show also has some really good demon designs with some looking quite badass and some looking quite horrific (in a good way). The animation is also quite good generally looking quite clean and making the action scenes look damn awesome. The environments are fine if a little uninspired, just your average city scapes and forests etc, especially since the DMC games (the first two in particular) have a very Gothic inspired look to them so i found that kind of disappointing but at least the environments look good.Sound: 8/10. The sound in this show is probably its strongest point, with a badass rock soundtrack which fits quite well with the DMC vibes, the sound effects themselves are good, Dantes guns sound great, cars explosions etc all sound great, and the voice acting is all good as well (I've watched in both English and Japanese and both are equally as good as one another).Characters: 6/10. For this i'm gonna cover characters from the games and original characters separately. Dante himself is relatively close to how he is in the games, a smart mouthed badass who likes to joke around with his enemies and loves Pizza, however sometimes i feel Dante comes of as a bit of a cynic which was something that was never present in the games and i feel it doesn't fit well with his character. other returning characters from the games include Lady and Trish. They are both pretty much exactly how they are in the games which is great, Lady is a much more serious character who tries to get Dante to take his work more seriously (mainly because he owes her a lot of money, which is actually one of my favourite running gags in the show) and Trish is a badass demon femme fattale although she doesn't appear much in the series so she doesn't get much time to shine. The original characters range from being alright to being really bad. Morrison, Dantes agent of sorts is easily the best of them acting as a great straight-man to Dantes more laid back nature. There is also Paddy, a little girl who Dante has to protect in the first episode and then begins to hang around the Devil May Cry. She... isn't very good, She begins to develop an almost Father-Daughter relationship with Dante which is kinda nice but i just find her kinda annoying. The main villain Sid is actually alright, he's a weaker demon so he sort of plays around with Dante in the background as opposed to facing him straight on which i actually like a lot. The characters who appear in the episodic stories range from alright to awful and none are really memorable, save for the two demon brothers in episode 10 who actually have a good storyline.Enjoyment: 7/10. The show has a lot of problems but i can't deny that watching some kick ass demon killing action for 12 episodes didn't entertain the hell out of me.Overall: 7/10. i love the Devil May Cry series and while the anime isn't one of the strongest parts of the series it is still a relatively fun show. If your a DMC fan or just want to watch a badass dude kill demons for 12 episodes and not have to worry about story then you just hit the JACKPOT. If neither of those apply to you, then i'd give this one a skip. which he receives his demon hunting jobs.

She... isn't very good, She begins to develop an almost Father-Daughter relationship with Dante which is kinda nice but i just find her kinda annoying. The main villain Sid is actually alright, he's a weaker demon so he sort of plays around with Dante in the background as opposed to facing him straight on which i actually like a lot. The characters who appear in the episodic stories range from alright to awful and none are really memorable, save for the two demon brothers in episode 10 who actually have a good storyline.Enjoyment: 7/10. The show has a lot of problems but i can't deny that watching some kick ass demon killing action for 12 episodes didn't entertain the hell out of me.Overall: 7/10. i love the Devil May Cry series and while the anime isn't one of the strongest parts of the series it is still a relatively fun show. If your a DMC fan or just want to watch a badass dude kill demons for 12 episodes and not have to worry about story then you just hit the JACKPOT. If neither of those apply to you, then i'd give this one a skip."", ""Hm...the time has come to review another anime.This time I'll be generous and I'll try to be nice.Story 3/10Is there a story?I'm asking cause I didn't watch it after episode 4,made me drop it.But even if there is one I doubt it'll satisfy me since I've played the game first.Art 7/10It was...good.Only that,nothing more.I didn't get the feeling that it was anything need to be noticed.Didn't impress me.Actually at first I didn't like it,but then got used to it.Sound 8/10Pretty pleased,nothing wrong to point out but could have used something more similar to that of the game.Although I can see that they tried but weren't...so successful at accomplising it to get a 10.Character 1/10Hated them,all of them.Including Dante who is one of my favorite ones.I didn't feel he was the same,the portrayal lacked the uniqueness of Dante.He was just sitting there,sometimes walking,sometimes killing monsters,silent,no comments coming from him and no show off moves.I'm starting to doubt whether that's Dante and not Vergil?O.oDisappointed.Enjoyment 6/10Didn't get a lot,but I certainly enjoyed the killings though the battles need improvement.That's not how Dante fights at all.We've seen battles like those thousands of times,and mostly in fillers.Overall 6/10Like I said I'll be generous,because I love the game and they share the same title.I'll just ignore this and expect something better next time if they decide to adapt DMC into something else(like a 2nd anime season,which I highly doubt,or a movie if they already haven't)Hope my review was enjoyable,let me know what you think about it. so successful at accomplising it to get a 10.Character 1/10Hated them,all of them.Including Dante who is one of my favorite ones.I didn't feel he was the same,the portrayal lacked the uniqueness of Dante.He was just sitting there,sometimes walking,sometimes killing monsters,silent,no comments coming from him and no show off moves.I'm starting to doubt whether that's Dante and not Vergil?O.oDisappointed.Enjoyment 6/10Didn't get a lot,but I certainly enjoyed the killings though the battles need improvement.That's not how Dante fights at all.We've seen battles like those thousands of times,and mostly in fillers.Overall 6/10Like I said I'll be generous,because I love the game and they share the same title.I'll just ignore this and expect something better next time if they decide to adapt DMC into something else(like a 2nd anime season,which I highly doubt,or a movie if they already haven't)Hope my review was enjoyable,let me know what you think about it."", 'Story 2/10: The anime has no plot whatsoever, it\'s only Dante being cool and killing a different demon each episode till he gets to a ""final boss"" in the last 2 episodes, and we don\'t even get to see his DT in a pure form without being that brief shadow.

So let\'s get on it shall we before the hoards of fate zero fanatics lynch me for my commentEssentially DMC has a lot in common with hellsing ultimate in terms of visuals. But...that is all there is to it. In fact the only good thing one can say about the show Is that its got great visuals.

The characters are a huge disappointment. Dante is cool just because he\'s Dante and that\'s really all there is to him. He\'s stupidity overpowered, so much so that you\'d think an asteroid could hit the earth and it wouldn\'t even ruffle his ultra stylish attire. He\'s got more superpowers than Superman including but not limited to coming back from the dead, crossing through separate worlds without help, being the coolest guy to ever inhabit the earth and of course  being so above anyone and everyone  that you question  the fact why Dante isn\'t  president prime minster admiral general Dante of earth.

But therein my friends lays the greatest disappointment. There\'s absolutely no bloody action. In fact Dante is so stupidly overpowered that even the climactic season finale battle has only about a minute\'s worth of fighting most of which is surprise surprise Dante being cool.

But it was still fun.', ""This has gotten alot of tough reviews, but I actually liked it, it's not perfect by any stretch of the imagination in particular it's more slice of life then action orientated, though there is that in each episode.   It shows more what Dante is doing the rest of the time when not fighting super powered bosses in games.The story I would say is it's weakest point, it's not bad, it's just probably not what your hoping or expecting in a Devil May Cry Anime, it's very episodic until the end where it picks up.The art I like, a decent amount of...blood and gore for the action, the various demons I found fascinating.Sound is okay, about what is fitting.To me the main thin that works is the characters, Dante is his usual suave self cracking jokes and kicking ass, a few chars from the games show up, and he ends up taking someone in early on that plays a decent part throughout the show, and was a nice addition even if felt a bit tacked on till later on.I did enjoy this, if you go into expecting high octane non stop action you will be disappointed, but if you go into this with a open mind and learning about Dante and the world a little more, you might enjoy it. blood and gore for the action, the various demons I found fascinating.Sound is okay, about what is fitting.To me the main thin that works is the characters, Dante is his usual suave self cracking jokes and kicking ass, a few chars from the games show up, and he ends up taking someone in early on that plays a decent part throughout the show, and was a nice addition even if felt a bit tacked on till later on.I did enjoy this, if you go into expecting high octane non stop action you will be disappointed, but if you go into this with a open mind and learning about Dante and the world a little more, you might enjoy it."", 'English Version:A Different Perspective On Dante.The Anime of Devil May Cry gains value by showing a different point of view of the life of our favorite demon hunter, since the first game we have in view a completely badass character, who does not care about much besides a good fight and make jokes of his opponents. Of course, in specific parts of his journey we have exciting and even sad moments, such as when he thinks he let Trish die, as if he had failed his mother again, moments where he talks to his brother or his childhood, leading the character even to cry (hence...the name of the franchise is obvious), but overall what we have is a buck , stylish and a joke.Already here we have a tired Dante, sad with his life, the anime in chronological terms takes place right after ""Devil May Cry (2001)"" ie, his brother was supposedly dead, his revenge against the one who took the life of his mother had already been realized and his partners were no longer present, so there was nothing that gave meaning in his life , he was moved only by the jobs morrison delivered him and the goal of protecting the weak, but that was just a hobby. Interestingly the few moments when we see Dante smiling and having fun is when he fights, since in these hours the character went out all his internal problems, the anime also makes it clear that the protagonist spent every day feeding on pizza and ice cream, just as another escape from his anguish, and in his ending it is implied that alcohol was also part of his routine.Just for these examples is already valid to say that this anime is a pearl in the midst of the whole franchise, but things get better because we have a counterpoint to all this that was mentioned before, ""Patty Lowell"" is the typical child that even young is mature and seems to understand a lot of life and how people feel, and even if dante\'s main mission is to defend her and escort her , for the most part it is she who takes care of his feelings and supports him, creating a relationship almost between brothers. Of course there are times where one teaches the other about different aspects of life, but it is Patty who gives Dante a reason to live, either through his scolding or his sympathy that seemed to be missing in the protagonist\'s life for a long time.Another point at which the series hits is not only on the main mission but finally showing Dante and the others acting as genuine demon hunters, things that are mentioned in all games in the franchise but never shown, of course they still act as protectors of humanity, but finally is shown the mercenary side, which accepts the works for money , the research side is of paramount importance in these moments, showing that Dante is not only a fighting machine without any strategy or intelligence, the relationships that the existence of demons causes in humanity is also portrayed, another positive point since in most games this is left aside.The action scenes are also decent, as much as Dante solves most of his cases with extreme ease makes perfect sense, since at this point in the story the character is completely invincible.The anime also brings cool curiosities such as dante\'s way of doing his work through his partner Morrison, as Trish and Lady recognized each other and began their rivalry, never-before-explored ties of Sparda and other demons that followed his ideology, among other interesting moments. Anyway, this anime is a treat for any fan of the franchise and a pastime for a casual audience.Português/Brasil:Uma Diferente Perspectiva Sobre DanteO Anime de Devil May Cry ganha valor ao mostrar um ponto de vista diferente da vida do nosso caçador de demônios favorito, desde o primeiro game temos em vista um personagem completamente badass, que não se importa com muita coisa além de uma boa luta e fazer piadas de seus oponentes. Claro, em partes específicas de sua jornada temos momentos emocionantes e até mesmo tristes, como por exemplo quando ele acha que deixou Trish morrer, como se houvesse falhado com sua mãe de novo, momentos onde ele fala com o irmão ou de sua infância, levando o personagem até mesmo a chorar (daí o nome da franquia é óbvio), mas no geral o que temos é um fanfarrão, estiloso e piadista.Já aqui temos um Dante cansado, triste com sua vida, o anime em termos cronológicos se passa logo após “Devil May Cry (2001)” ou seja, seu irmão estava supostamente morto, sua vingança contra aquele que tirou a vida de sua mãe já havia sido concretizada e suas parceiras já não estavam mais presentes, então não havia nada que desse sentido em sua vida, ele era movido apenas pelos trabalhos que Morrison o entregava e o objetivo de proteger os fracos, mas aquilo era apenas um passatempo. Curiosamente os poucos momentos em que vemos Dante sorrindo e se divertindo é quando ele luta, já que nessas horas o personagem extravasava todos os seus problemas internos, o anime também deixa claro que o protagonista passava todos os dias se alimentando de pizza e sorvete, apenas como mais um escape de sua angústia, e em sua ending fica subentendido que o álcool também fazia parte de sua rotina.Só por esses exemplos já é válido dizer que esse anime é uma pérola em meio a franquia toda, mas as coisas ficam melhores por termos um contraponto a tudo isso que foi citado antes, “Patty Lowell” é a típica criança que mesmo jovem é madura e parece entender muito da vida e como as pessoas se sentem, e mesmo que a missão principal de Dante seja defendê-la e escoltá-la, em maior parte é ela que cuida dos sentimentos dele e o apoia, criando uma relação quase que entre irmãos. Claro que existem momentos onde um ensina o outro sobre diferentes aspectos da vida, mas é Patty quem dá um motivo para Dante viver, seja através de suas broncas ou de sua simpatia que pareciam estar faltando na vida do protagonista há um bom tempo.Outro ponto em que a série acerta é em não depender apenas da missão principal mas finalmente mostrar Dante e os demais agindo como genuínos caçadores de demônios, coisas que são citadas em todos os jogos da franquia mas nunca mostrados, claro que eles ainda agem como protetores da humanidade, mas finalmente é mostrado o lado mercenário, que aceita os trabalhos por dinheiro, o lado investigador é de suma importância nesses momentos, mostrando que Dante não é só uma máquina de lutar sem nenhuma estratégia ou inteligência, as relações que a existência de demônios causa na humanidade também é retratada, mais um ponto positivo já que na maioria dos jogos isso é deixado de lado.As cenas de ação também são decentes, por mais que Dante resolva a maioria de seus casos com extrema facilidade faz todo o sentido, já que nesse ponto da história o personagem é completamente invencível.O anime também traz curiosidades bacanas como a maneira que Dante consegue seus trabalhos através de seu parceiro Morrison, como Trish e Lady se reconheceram e começaram sua rivalidade, laços nunca antes explorados de Sparda e outros demônios que seguiam sua ideologia, entre outros momentos interessantes.

The fact that there came an anime of it is testament to how good they are. Unfortunately the anime can't measure up to the games, but that still doesn't mean it's not good, just not AS good.Spoler Alert!Story: The weak point of the anime is definitely the story. In fact other than episodic pacing with a few hints of something bigger on the horizon, it's pretty much non-existent. You get to know some info about the main character and see him be a total badass. As...this show goes, I would call it a major power fantasy, filled with blood and gore. This, for the most part, works for the show with some exceptions, like the ending where, no matter how strong the enemy is, Dante almost just finishes the fight in one blow of his sword.Characters: After the story, the characters is the weakest part of this show, because most of the characters never get an established backstory. There are in fact only 3 characters who get their backstory explained, Dante, Patty and Patty's mother Nina. Still, you get to see an interesting enough cast of character and an interesting variation of enemies throughout the show.Sound and artwork: The soundtrack in this show is quite good and suits it well, with heavy metal or rock playing during the fight scenes. The art style is dark for most part, with lots of dark shades and some things (like blood) highlighted with vibrant colors that stand in contrast to the else-wise darker tones.Enjoyment and summary : In total I can say that I thoroughly enjoyed the show, though my experience with the games left me somewhat disappointed. I would recommend this show to those who do not mind blood and gore in their anime, and those who like shows with tons of action. this show goes, I would call it a major power fantasy, filled with blood and gore.

Dynamism amazes. It is pleasant that the anime not gloomy and is filled by humour and blood - all simly enough. The happy ending pleases. Was pleasant with what revolution of a scene which should will be tightened or when it becomes already visible that tiresomely, the shot, blood and loud music crosses. A masterpiece! It is a pity that there is no continuation.Sorry for my misery English, I'm from Russia :P "", 'Story- 5In a word the story and overall plot is poor, at best. The individual “case” or “mission” episodes were a great way to hold the attention of the viewer and add variation, but would have been better suited to a series of more length. As it were, 12 episodes is far too short to hold a structure like that, much less to keep that form until the final few episodes. Yes, there were several underlying characteristics which could be argued to point to the end, but only to the untrained eye. Even if the form was flawed, it is refreshing to see an anime...take an episode-by-episode approach.Art- 5The art isn’t bad, but it isn’t good either. It is smooth at times, and awkward at others.

The story takes place between the first and second tittle of the series which may explain Dante\'s somber attitude and personality but retains his wacky and carefree characteristics he\'s known for to a degree. Games with gameplay focus and lack luster plot and characters tend to do poor integrating into other forms of media such as anime and film but Devil May Cry did depict Dante well in a way...at least.The art is a mixed bag for me since it was made by studio Madhouse and they made famous animes like One punch man and Highschool of the dead but they do leave it cliffhanging and to be fair, this was made in the 2000\'s so I\'ll cut it some slack. The director however, is another mixed bag despite having to be known for his other work. I think it was more of a miscast than just something else really.The sound at best is mediocre with only a few rememberable tracks such as the theme song and another one in a fight with a singing demon. A lot of the tracks are forgettable and the theme song has been used frequently to a monotonous degree with it\'s original and acoustic version.The characters were alright with Dante as the focus and Lady and Trish\'s relationship was explained and further detailed. Patty\'s and Morrison\'s relation with Dante served as a great parallel to Dante\'s other relations with Dante being pestered by Patty like brother and sister and Morrison as his agent when Dante is lacking business in his shop ""Devil May Cry"".Initially it was stale to watch through but after investing and gaining a understanding the series and chronological order, I started to enjoy and appreciate it for what it is after re-watching it. I loved that they used the original cast form the games to reprise their roles and I was very surprised to learn that Japanese big names like Toshiyuki Morikawa and Akio Otsuka to dub the Japanese version of the title.What I would like from the though was that they would\'ve added characters that either has or never appeared in the games like Dante\'s former agent and his twin brother and further detail other aspects Dante and his everyday life up till the second tittle of the series. Overall I enjoyed it but I would not recommend this to any newcomers or non-fans of the series as it is stale as aforementioned and there are unexplained details that are relevant to the series. at least.The art is a mixed bag for me since it was made by studio Madhouse and they made famous animes like One punch man and Highschool of the dead but they do leave it cliffhanging and to be fair, this was made in the 2000\'s so I\'ll cut it some slack.

If you loved the characters from the games and just wanted to see them more, you\'re in the right place!Some people complain about this series being too ""slice-of-life"", while I don\'t agree, I also don\'t mind slice-of-life at all, so it might bother people who hate the genre more. ', 'So I\'m going to wonder as to how many people who have watched this show knew there was a game series tied to it. It has to at least be a 30-70 split in favor of the group who knew.Either way, I\'m on the side who not only knew there is a game series attached to the name but also played the whole series as well lol. So needless to say, I\'m going to be a little bias but at the same time, I\'m also putting it along side the games that are part of the same time line. So higher standards in the end....So with out further introductions, Let\'s rock.Story: 7Ok, gonna be honest here but if you come to any of the games to tell you a good story, then you are gonna be disappointed. The games are mission based with only a few cut-scenes along the way to give story detail. Any fan would say you come to the games for the action and game-play. The same applies to the anime as well. There was something nice and charming to it in the beginning but as the story progressed you kinda feel like you are going through different missions. Which would be fine if it was for esthetic purposes, but I honestly didn\'t feel that way. 1 job per episode. The ending also wasn\'t too great either since the main villain was too easy to spot and his motives not being any more unique then a simple B-movie villain. The games didn\'t suffer too much with this but there was a fair amount of prediction going on through out the game. The only other problem I have here, and this is more of a nit pick, is that the name of the shop was different after the first game which comes before the anime in a timeline sense. Can\'t tell me Dante just changes the name back because fucking why not.Art and Sound: 8 and 9I thought the visuals were really nice and fit the style of the piece entirely. DMC being a famous hack and slash game is all about gritty combat and flashy moves, so a hard edge, high detail style works well here. Dante\'s design is really nice to look at as well as a lot of the other characters. But the detail doesn\'t stop there because the demons are freaking awesome to look at. Horrific and grotesques, just the way the Underworld brewed them.Too bad the sound department edges out bringing the rock and metal tracks to play in the background of every fight as well as a great use of Spanish guitar for somber moments. The opening theme especially is a badass enough track to get you pumped up for a fight or two. To bad the quality of the story doesn\'t deliver an equal amount of badass.Speaking in terms of the games, the art was always great to look at as we moved further along in titles. The sound too was always appropriated to fit their situations. So we have a good integration here as well. I did only find it appropriate to listen to the soundtrack as I typed this out lol.Character: 9This is an easy one, anybody who knows this series knows exactly who we came to see. I have heard Dante being described as ""50 shades of awesome"" and I honestly can\'t come up with a better description then that. He loves his job and has fun doing it, and when he isn\'t hard at work he couldn\'t care less so long as he had a pizza at hand. I can see people disliking the show taking time to poke fun at Dante and make a fool of him and their reactions being something along the lines of, ""Dudes, this is a badass demon hunter with enough power to slay his own kind. Why are you trying to get on his last nerve?"". Which I don\'t understand. I actually enjoy the breathe of fresh air they give his character. In the games he is always on the job so he has to find fun along the way, but he is never put in a position where he can relax for long enough to produce any content to prove that he wouldn\'t do something like this. Getting a chance to see him and his comrades in a more relaxed state gives us another angle of their personality which is always appreciated.Which speaking of other characters, We have a few other familiar faces here. Trish from DMC1 and Lady from DMC3. Both of which are before this show chronologically speaking, so yeah more fun. Again, I love what they did here with these characters. They show well enough that these characters have history with each other, enough so they have no problem quipping at each other mid fight or before they go on a job. It\'s just more depth to their relationship. Wins all around.Enjoyment: 8What can I say, I get just as much thrill from this as I did the games (except DMC2 because DMC2 sucked massive ass). The characters were spot on, the art fit the style and the music excited every occasion. And while the story can be feel very bland, its not beyond the series as a whole to be weak in the story department. But, like I said before, that\'s not what we came here for. We came here to hack and slash our way through demons. To be put in situations that no sane man would honestly take on. And to look as badass as possible while doing it. What can I say, putting it all together it comes up with a solid Jackpot.Overall: 8 So with out further introductions, Let\'s rock.Story: 7Ok, gonna be honest here but if you come to any of the games to tell you a good story, then you are gonna be disappointed.

Weather your wanting to watch this show as a fan of the games or a fan of anime this suits both parties. Don’t have to high expectations the show doesn’t do anything revolutionary, but it is good. Very Hellsing mixed with Claymore and if you haven’t seen those shows go watch Hellsing ultimate…you don’t have to watch Claymore though that one needs help. To be honest in DMC I wish that the story almost solely revolved around him, but there is a boring support character that keeps...showing up and if you want character development your out of luck, but just because those things are bad, it doesn’t mean it ruins the show. So go watch Dante be a badass and just enjoy yourself. showing up and if you want character development your out of luck, but just because those things are bad, it doesn’t mean it ruins the show.

I felt the need to comment on this show, because my feelings towards it are quite strange, it's not good, but weirdly I enjoyed it.StoryThis was completely all over the place, it tells more like a slice of life show, about demon-hunter Dante, than an actual plot. It has a kind of 'monster of the week' format for the most part, and this can make the episodes seem really rushed.ArtI have no complaint with the art, it all looks pretty decent and the character designs were good, the only jarring thing is that some of the...3d animation doesn't quite fit in with the rest of it.SoundThis is one of the weakest aspects of the series, as it sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom, sometimes you have no idea what the characters are saying (this is based on the English dub), the same music is used repeatedly, and some parts seem to lack sound effects.CharacterThere is basically no character development, and many of the characters are very similar to each other.EnjoymentI actually did enjoy this show! It was silly, a lot of it was stupid, but it is a self aware show, which makes it not as painful. Don't take it too seriously, allow yourself to laugh at Dante's corny lines and some of the anime physics, and it is actually quite fun to watch. 3d animation doesn't quite fit in with the rest of it.SoundThis is one of the weakest aspects of the series, as it sounds like it was recorded in a bathroom, sometimes you have no idea what the characters are saying (this is based on the English dub), the same music is used repeatedly, and some parts seem to lack sound effects.CharacterThere is basically no character development, and many of the characters are very similar to each other.EnjoymentI actually did enjoy this show!

Although if the anime really wanted to be classed on the same level of the game it probably should have been longer, included a more daring and exciting story line and brought foreward a villain that outlines Dante and shapes the anime.Despite that, it had brilliant humor and fantastic little details....For example, they included Dantes pizza and Ice cream addiction, and created a wonderful charcter by the name of patty. A fun and demanding little girl who makes a strange bond with the main character.I think it would help with playing the games first and then watching the anime, otherwise i don't think you'll truly grasp the art and exquisive ways of this series.

A tight 12 episodes, mostly episodic but with an overarcing plot that manages to tie in with the one-offs nicely.The animation is your typical mid-2000s Madhouse production - good - and I even spotted a little studio called ORANGE in the credits for CGI assistance - a few clunky moments of odd/bad blending or obvious repeated models aside, that is.The writing staff, headed by veteran tokusatsu screenwriter Toshiki Inoue, has a couple other veterans of stuff like Cowboy Bebop and Ghost...in the Shell Stand Alone Complex, but also Bingo Morihashi who wrote DMC 3-5, Bayonetta 2, Dragon\'s Dogma, and portions of the first Blazblue game. There\'s some fun one-offs like the first meeting of series regulars Lady and Trish or the death game poker episode (written by Inoue and vaguely reminiscent of a future script he\'d write for Garo Makaisenki). The overarcing story is cleverly structured around a recurring loser demon and his encounters with Dante.The voice cast is mostly ADV regulars aside from Reuben Langdon reprising his role as Dante under a pseudonym. Like most ADV productions there\'s a more than a few funky line reads or awkward performances, made worse by some English rewrites that are either clunky-sounding or unusually profane for the franchise.The biggest criticism I could give is that it never really goes hard on the action. Nothing ever approaches the wildness of DMC3\'s cutscenes (tho without Yuji Shimomura of Versus fame, its hard to match) and even the final fight is over in a flash. (well the one critique I\'d give aside from the Funimation audio mastering being shit)One plus is that they actually took the effort to give characters more than one outfit. Small child/sidekick Patty gets a bunch of dresses, Lady gets a casino dealer outfit and a jumpsuit that I\'m pretty sure is a reference to Elza Walker from the Resident Evil 1.5 concept.All the demons in the show have pretty cool designs too. Some are clearly meant to evoke designs like the Seven Hells from the games while others are completely original.It isn\'t much of a real game-changer anime but it also isn\'t the boring insult to the games people treat it as.

You join him as he kills these demons each episode. Now, at the end, the plot starts forming. The last episode is pretty intense.I think they did Dante\'s character extremely well. It\'s the side people I didn\'t care much for. Here\'s an example: When Dante was on screen, I smiled and...felt happier.

My impression from playing the games was that except for boss battles which in many cases were insane all other batles were easy in any mode except DMD once you learn how to use Dante. So the complain does not hold ground. About the story it does not even aim to be anything more than separate missions. As in other movies and anime even if there is a storyline that links the episodes it is only hinted with the exception of the episodes which...resolve the story. I found the end a bit stupid though. The way Dante defeats the Boss is anticlimatic and seems to have been rushed without a second thought. resolve the story. I found the end a bit stupid though.

Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not necessarily limited to Western games. In Japan, prominent games are regularly made into anime series, and more often than not, they end up just as convoluted as their western equivalents. Devil May Cry, as most of you readers probably already know, is a fairly successful video game franchise developed by Japanese publisher Capcom. It was only a matter of time until someone decided to make an anime out of it. Well, nothing can possibly...go wrong here, can it?The anime series in question is Devil May Cry: The Animated Series. It follows the misadventures of Dante, a tall, half-demon man that fights other demons with automatic pistols and a nine-foot-long sword. There are other characters, too, but none of them are particularly interesting, nor do any of them stand out as unique or dynamic. Dante is the owner of ""Devil May Cry,"" a business that investigates demons... or something. That\'s about as far as the plot gets before it decides to throw storytelling out the window. Who are these demons? Why are they attacking? What do they want? Why is Dante hunting them? Well, the writers didn\'t seem to think any of these questions were very important, because they didn\'t bother to answer them. I guess they couldn\'t cut a few minutes out of the fight scenes to make room.Oh yes, the fight scenes. So very many mindless fight scenes, complete with copious levels of gore. Let me put it this way: The title for this show would probably be more accurate if it were ""Dante Stabs Demons in the Face."" Now, don\'t get me wrong, I like fight scenes, and I can see why an anime based on an action game would want to have a lot of fight scenes. But when the fight scenes preclude any form of storytelling, as they do in Devil May Cry, then I can\'t see the justification in making an anime series at all. The only story elements that are given any time are those that set up the given episode\'s action sequences. Anything else is apparently not worth the time - including things like, say, concluding the episode.For example, in the first episode, Dante is tasked with guarding a young girl named Patty, who is apparently the illegitimate heir of a local rich man who just passed away. Okay, that\'s simple enough. Then, as the climax of the episode draws near, another woman shows up at the man\'s mansion to claim the inheritance, claiming that she is actually the heir and the girl was a decoy. Except she\'s in her twenties and the man (presumably) wasn\'t that old. So who\'s the real heir? The ""epic"" fight scene of the episode ensues, but in the aftermath, the issue is promptly dropped without any explanation. To boot, the woman who claimed she was the real heir asks to help take care of Patty, completely out of the blue. What\'s the history behind these two characters? No matter, the credits abruptly roll, and then we never see her again. Thanks, Devil May Cry, I guess concluding your own stories isn\'t important after all.I do have to give credit where credit is due, though. Despite all of its many faults, Devil May Cry is very well animated. The fight scenes and action sequences, countless as they are, are all fluidly animated. The backgrounds are crisp and clear, and provide a good contrast to the characters that inhabit them. Devil May Cry just looks good, and if there\'s one thing I can say about the series as a whole, it\'s that it definitely had a big budget.But at the same time, when you realize the work that went into this show, it\'s distressing that the writing managed to come out so badly. Did they just hire a hundred animators and one writer? Didn\'t anyone see a problem with leaving entire episodes\' worth of story hanging without any sort of conclusion? Perhaps it\'s better not to analyze it so closely; no matter how much you pick apart and examine a train wreck, it\'s still a train wreck. go wrong here, can it?The anime series in question is Devil May Cry: The Animated Series.

Dante just gos around in each episode and kills 1 demon after aouther . the anime has good fight scenes  and this anime has great humor to the story and its worht a couple of laghues. its 100% good and wouth your time  that is if you are a fan of deivl may cry i liked the anime its was very funny.

If you enjoy a character being epic then this is the anime for you.This is for people who have heard or play devil may cry or if you just want to see some blood and things getting killed.This anime has no story which is sad but it really dosen\'t need one. To me it just seems the people of Devil May Cry had some extra cash and while thinking up the new game they went. ""Lets make Devil May Cry an anime"" And here is what you get.I gave it a 7...becasue i don\'t know a think about Devil May Cry but I know it is good for what it is. becasue i don\'t know a think about Devil May Cry but I know it is good for what it is.', ""They stripped Dante down to his completely basic fundamental elements and complimented that with horrible animation and no narrative drive whatsoever.  A big component in making a successful adaptation to a movie or anime or whatever medium you choose is making it stand on its own. If you don't do that, it just comes off as mindless promotional material (which it is.) I like to imagine this is exactly what happened and what they were thinking because on first thought, who wouldn't want to watch the upcoming Devil May Cry anime series???Devil May Cry?Yeah!!!!Anime?Yeah!!!Girugamesh?Oh yeah brother!!!mmmm Yeah it sucked 3/10 "", 'I try to keep my anime reviews brief an straight to the point. With that said lets get this show on the road.Story line- There was no solid plot for the first 10 episodes of the anime. Each episode was basically Dante going on jobs hunting demons. Which got kind of boring after a while. Its not until the tenth episode that they tried to create a plot. (THIS ANIME IS ONLY 12 EPISODES) There was no form to the plot, it just kind of appeared out of no where. It also made little to know sense at all.Art & Sound- The art was classically...done with dull colors however, it does have a dark appeal to it. The sound is also good.Character- This anime was created based of the game Devil May Cry. However, if you have never played the game series you would certainly be lost on the characters. There were only a handful of characters that you would see in every episode. No character actually made a show stopping performance. Nor did I feel attached to any particular character. They basically came and left.Enjoyment- I overall enjoyed the theme of the anime (dark, supernatural, action, gore ) theme. I felt that the actual deliverance of the anime needed a bit of work. Nonetheless it was good. done with dull colors however, it does have a dark appeal to it. The sound is also good.Character- This anime was created based of the game Devil May Cry.

Accordingly, I can only rate this anime without any insider knowledge.This title starts out pretty incoherently. The protagonist named Dante accepts an assignment and has to fight his way through demons for several episodes. And then he takes the next one and so on. On the way to the goal, there are more and more demons, there is shooting, there is blood, and then comes the finale and ... big demons and even more blood and action.Maybe there is some comedy in the middle...and one or the other noteworthy conversation. For the most part, however, this remains very sluggish and meaningless work. As a game, this would certainly be more than enough, provided the gameplay is good. But as a 12 episode anime, this was way weaker than expected.Story:There are practically none. Most of the characters in the series should apparently already be known practically, not really introduced. The missions are quite linear and practically nothing happens up to XP 10.Animations / Pictures:Mostly average. Usually, there are only still images, but the representation of the surroundings, as well as the battles, is quite solid.Characters:The protagonist is pretty empty and has hardly any personality, at least in the anime adaptation. Apart from the fact that he's a badass, out of luck, and always in debt, nothing is known about him.The remaining characters are the same or even emptier.Music:The intro is solid and recognizable. The Osts are also quite pleasant and go very well with the work. Some really get stuck in your ears.ConclusionI can hardly say if I would enjoy this work more if I knew the game series.

Let's see how stylish this anime is.Story:It's...meh...the story in DMC games was never really something I think of when it comes to the games (at least not in the first two games), it was more for the gameplay. As it is though, each episodes (with the exception of the last two) have different stories, with some events carrying over with the characters (basically them calling back to moments...in the show.) It doesn't really feel like DMC until we really see Dante just doing his things are fighting Demons. It's alright...nothing really good though, the later games' (3-5) stories are better.Art:The art for its time is rather nice, the characters are usually consistent in their looks and the original characters aren't bad either, a little generic, but not badly designed by any means. The animation (during fight scenes especially) is quite nice, though it can look a little cheap at the briefest of times. I enjoy the Black Lagoon mixed with Death Note (and DMC of course) that I got from the visuals, doesn't look bad, though the colors are little washed out at timesSound:Well...there's quite a bit to say here, more than most animes I've seen to be honest. The dubbing is alright, Dante's got Reuben freakin' Langdon doing Dnate's voice (same guy from DMC3-5) which is AWESOME! The others characters are all well-voiced (though I miss the fact that everyone else is...okay. It's kinda dumb they could get the OG Dante, but not the OG Lady and Trish voices to dub.Character:Overall, the behavior of these characters are a bit of mixed bag. Some of these characters like Dante, Lady, Trish, are alright, but the other original characters are either alright or just flat-out bad. For the most part though, the bad characters are only there for a short time in their one-off episodes and the good ones (except Patty...again, annoying more than anything else even if she's a main character).Overall:As a fan of DMC...it's okay, nothing spectacular, but not complete and utter garbage. It doesn't hurt the rest of the series in any way and actually shows up as a cute little reference later on in DMC5 if you're paying attention. If you aren't a DMC fan...don't bother, you won't probably understand that much of it. It's alright for what it is, a little side-story thing with nothing to it. in the show.)

And the voice acting for the other characters like Trish and Lady do sound a lot like the original voice actors in the video games....The voice acting for demons as well sounds threatening and scary.I’ll start off with the story. It uses an overarching story that forms up to one big event in the later episodes of the series. Much of the earlier episodes of show it takes place in a self-contained procedural format showing Dante not taking on world ending contracts like the ones he usually does in the game and glimpses of his daily life outside of demeon hunting. Some of the story episodes did had interesting ideas like Dante being in a street race with a leader of the biker gang in order to hunt down this mysterious biker demon.Some of the other story ideas for episodes were pretty cliched as well. My least favorite one was this Romeo And Juliet storyline where a demon and a woman fall in love much to the disappointment to her father. Other times there was loose threads that were not resolved in the show.But the final episodes of the series is when the show starts to pick up the pace as it focuses on a world ending threat and one episode where Dante is going up against two demon brothers who were the apprentices of Sparda Dante’s demonic father. And that is when the threat level starts to rise up as well.  Which sets off the events for the final episodes of the story where things get to be more interesting.The story is a mixed bag to say the least. As it focuses more on Dante being in multiple action scenes. While the action scenes are good and very fast paced. But Dante is pretty overpowered and it doesn’t take much hits for the demon to die unlike in the video games.The characters other than Dante,Trish and Lady are also one sided and shallow. For example, Patty in this show is a spoiled brat who hardly has any relevance to the plot and is background character most of the time.And the main bad guy of the show Sid. He is pretty much just another ambitious power-hungry manipulative villain you could see in any other form of entertainment. And he is not as threatening as a villain like Vergil,Arkham or Mundus in the video games. Trish and Lady even though they are major characters in the series they are hardly utilized in the show and Patty would often take up most of the time instead of them. The character chemistry between Dante and Patty is apathetic you wouldn't really care if her or another character besides Lady,Trish or Dante were to be killed. In addition they both treat each other like crap and bicker much of the time and its pretty distracting as well from the main plot.The show like in the original video games does have pretty funny moments in it as well. And Dante always comes up with funny remarks to mock any demon he is fighting no matter how powerful he is. And Dante is still a really likable character and he is highly talented in any of the aspects he could do in the show such as riding a motorbike or slaying demons.The action scenes in the show whenever Dante is fighting a Demon is pretty good. Each demon does have their own strategy and their own powers to further their own selfish goals. Dante whenever he fights is pretty cool. But as I mentioned he can be overpowered at times and the demons even though they do look really threatening. They can be taken down within a few hits without any trouble for the most part.The art style of the show is faithful to the games. It looks dark and the Gothic ambiance and design is still there. And it does give off a horror styled feel to the show as well.  The background designs look nicely made.Dante,Trish and Lady do look pretty good in an anime format. Some of the other characters as well look typical anime characters and they didn’t really stood out to the show as well.The animation is pretty smooth and fluid and it also reminds me of Hellsing Ultimate as well considering that both Hellsing ultimate and Devil May Cry were both animated by Madhouse studios.There was pretty good camera angles and close ups during the show especially in the action scenes.The music is similar to the original video games. Such as a fast-paced energetic rock track. It does sound good but much of the soundtrack often sounds like different variants of the opening theme of the show. I did found the audio as well to be really high quality and the sound effects were alot like the video game.It still is overall a decent anime despite its many shortcomings.

There are also two new regular characters - Dante's agent Morrison who visits frequently, and Patty Lowell, a young orphan girl he saved in the first episode, who also visits frequently and shares a father-daughter relationship.My thoughts:Dante is a half demon, one of the sons of Sparta and a very good character. He has a laid back attitude but when it comes to demons, he’s all business. Although he complains about Patty, he doesn’t seem to mind having her around (if only to clean up the messes he...makes).

But on the other side it would be very bad, if they copied the games story a 100%. i give it a 4/10.The Art: is amazing. They keep the drawing close the the dark theme that the story also is. I...give it 7/10The sound: that is a hard one. It did not have all the over-dramatic sound effects, that some other animes have. And the music that goes with each part of the mood in the anime is also wonderfull, (partly because its the kind of music i like personaly). It gets 8/10.Character: It is great how it matches up the game, and that it has the cool yet funny people in it. Some might say they should have more people with defferent personality in it, but that would ruin it since its made after a game. It gets 9/10.Enjoyment: the injoy ment in it was not that great. Because the game is pretty much a pure hack n' slash game. But on the other side it would be bad if the anime is a hack n' slash. So the battle (if you can call it that) are very good for an anime to be. Yet the story pulls the whole anime down. So it gets 3/10Overall: The anime is good, but the story pulls the whole thing down. But still i would love to see a season two comming up, (but don't think it's gonna happen).

Because the game is pretty much a pure hack n' slash game. But on the other side it would be bad if the anime is a hack n' slash. So the battle (if you can call it that) are very good for an anime to be. Yet the story pulls the whole anime down. So it gets 3/10Overall: The anime is good, but the story pulls the whole thing down. But still i would love to see a season two comming up, (but don't think it's gonna happen). They did a good job keeping up with the game but in the end they couldn't do it.4+7+8+9+3=31 / 4= 6,2=6. so the final grade is 6.Thanks for reading. Signed Vampmaster!!"", ""I just finished Devil May Cry the anime and it was better than I expected it to be and I really enjoyed it, until the last few episodes. I didn't play the game series very often but I'm aware of what the game is about so I thought I would check it out. Although I'll say it here and now, Patty and her mother should have died. There I said it and I'm not taking it back.Story - 6/10 - the story isn't anything special, it's about Dante the Half Devil and he is part private investigator and part bounty hunter I suppose. He pretty...much takes odd jobs that end up having to deal with demons in one way or another. Each episode is a different case or problem that Dante get involved in that end up with him killing a lot of Demons. The episodes aren't really connected until the last few episodes, other than a few characters that pop up in different episodes either asking for the money Dante owes or on the same job as him.Art - 7/10 - even though the anime is 15 years old when I watched it for the 1st time, the art and animation really hold up in my opinion. I really like this style of animation where the characters have I little more of a realistic look. I think when anime is done in this style, especially older anime it really stands the test of time. It wasn't as dark and gritty as say Hellsing Ultimate but it was done really well in my opinion and was my favorite part about this animSound - 7/10 - the sound was pretty good especially for the year it came out. Most anime from around then had more generic music but in DMC the music was decent. The intro was good and it helped get my interested in the episode and the outro just made my want to keep watching. The outro was a little somber but still good. The SFX were well done also, especially the gunshots which sounded good and reminded me of playing the games.Characters - 7/10 - the characters were great for the most part and I honestly would have given this an 8 if it weren't for how Patty and her mother acted at the end. I won't spoil it for anyone but if you seen the anime then I'm ure you know what I'm talking about and if you haven't seen it, let's just say that I bet you will be yelling at your T.V. like I did when it happens. Dante on the other hand was great, his attitude and demeanor were perfect and I really enjoyed his character. Lady and Trish are Hot AF but are total con artists when it comes to Dante and what they charge him for doing a job. Last time I checked, the point the helping was to get paid not the helper pay helpee in most the situations but I suppose they get away with it because Dante just can't be bothered and I love that lol. And you can hate me now because I'm a Dub watcher and the English voice acting was really good. The only time I watch Sub is if I don't like the MC Dub voice acting, then I prefer the original. Although I have been watching both versions, Dub & Sub because sometimes it does change the context of things.Sound - 8/10 - I never played the game series but I'm assuming that the opening soundtrack is related to the game in some way. Even if it wasn't I'm sure it was an original and is was pretty good as far as opening credit soundtracks can go. The outro soundtrack is also an original and is also pretty good. The SFX are a big part of this anime and I thought they were somewhat realistic and I thought they helped the action scenes seem like they had some weight. The sound Dante's guns made were very explosive and made it seem like his gun was firing bullets the size of cannon balls.Enjoyment - 8/10 - I enjoyed this anime quite abit and I think I will start to watch anime that is a little older than I normally watch because there is still so much good anime out there. I wish I had started watching anime a long time ago but ohwell I'm trying to catch up now. A couple things I enjoyed about this anime was the art style for sure, it has a touch of grit but it's not overdone. Another thing I liked was how easy it was to follow, you don't necessarily need to pay super close attention and still know what's happening. For me that was good because sometimes I like to read or do other things while watching anime and if the story is too complicated then you have to give it all your attention.Overall  - 7/10 - it was a good anime and I really enjoyed it. You don't have to have played all the games to understand the plot or to enjoy the action but if you have played the games it makes the experience that much better getting to see characters you are familiar with in a new medium. The animation is good for the year it came out and still looks decent today. I'm not saying it's perfect because it definitely wasn't but it was definitely enjoyable and worth watching. I'll most likely watch it again in a few months but this time I'll watch the original subtitled version and compare the two. Whether you are into the DMC games or even if you come into it completely blind I'm sure you will find some enjoyment watching this anime.Thanks for reading my review I hope you enjoyed it and I hope it helps you. much takes odd jobs that end up having to deal with demons in one way or another.

So that makes me like this show more than it probably deserves.For the story, I feel it\'s just alright. Like I wouldn\'t say the story is necessarily good which tbh disappoints me but I guess what else can you expect from a video game anime, but...yeah the story is just kinda meh not bad necessarily but not really good either.The art is fine, but it really could be better. I do feel like the games have a really cool look to them and I wish the anime had that look as well, but the art is just kinda meh.The sound is decent at least I don\'t really have any problems with that.The characters... I mean Dante is just such a cool guy so 10/10, but no, in reality, the show doesn\'t really do much for the characters like they are still cool and all but not enough for me to be like woah in the confines of the show id say its just like 5.In terms of quality, id say this show is like a 5. It\'s not bad, and it\'s not good it\'s just kinda average, however, my personal score of liking the show is more like a 6 because Devil may cry is a great games series and biases my opinion. yeah the story is just kinda meh not bad necessarily but not really good either.The art is fine, but it really could be better.

Batman: Gotham Knight,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4094/Batman__Gotham_Knight,"[""As a big fan of Batman and an obvious fan of anime, Gotham Knight was definitely something I had been looking forward to. While fun to watch though, this series of shorts kind of left more to be desired... then again, considering it's to lead into The Dark Knight, that may be a good thing.STORY - It's kind of hard to review six standalone works all at once while simultaneously trying to be succinct, but I don't think I have the attention span right now to detail each one individually (and I'm long-winded enough as it is). The shorts collected within Gotham Knight are supposed...to take place in between the events of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight; to that end then, they work okay, avoiding major villains and touching on various lesser themes within the Batman franchise. Each short sort of reminded me of a summarized version of an episode of Batman: The Animated Series, especially the first one, Have I Got a Story For You, which I swear was the exact premise for a TAS episode. Each story is self-contained, but vague, and even though it was possible to draw connecting threads between some of them (always nice), such as In Darkness Dwells and Working Through Pain, I wasn't really wowed by any of them. At best, they were just decent episodes, not good enough for real praise, but not bad enough to trash.The final short, Deadshot was probably my favorite, if only because it had all the elements of a classic Batman -- action, mild suspense, and a demonstration of Batman's awesome skill (though he is never without weakness). Working Through Pain and Field Test are runners up because they contribute at least a little bit to Batman's very complex personality and psyche, and as morality and the mind in general are very prevalent themes in Batman, those two shorts felt rather necessary in helping to further develop and prepare the character for The Dark Knight. Bruce's line at the end of Field Test is especially memorable: &quot;I'm willing to put my life on the line, but it has to be my life.&quot;CHARACTER - There seem to be two central goals in Gotham Knight: one, describing Bruce/Batman's progression as a character in between the two live action movies, and two, detailing the public's perception of the Batman as he rises in both fame and infamy. Each of the six shorts meet at least one of these two goals, though I'd venture to say that none of them do it particularly well. The complexity of Batman's character is one of the main reasons I've always been a fan. Sure, his backstory is one tragedy in a world of many, but the determination he has to both make up for his weakness as a child and to grow up past the sadness is admirable. It's incredibly interesting to see him in conflict with everything that stands in his way -- criminals, the police, Gotham's society, and of course, himself and his own mind. Batman has always been a great character, but the real question is whether Gotham Knight do him justice. The nature of the shorts -- basically, the fact that they are indeed short -- limits the depth of exploration; they do okay with what they're given, but they had so much more potential that it just ends up being a little disappointing in the end.The other characters that make appearances, Gordon, Fox, Ramirez, and Cassandra, get even less time for development than Batman, so it makes sense that they don't really get any depth. Still, the shorts establish or re-emphasize their relationships to Batman, and for Gordon and Fox, this is valuable as material leading into The Dark Knight since they only just made allies out of the Batman in Batman Begins. It's passable.ARTSTYLE &amp; ANIMATION - Each of the six shorts employed their own animation style, but I wasn't really impressed with any of them. Have I Got a Story to Tell had some gorgeous urban backgrounds, but the characters were depicted in that rounded, lazy-looking style that really contrasted with the detail of everything else. It isn't bad, per se, but I'm personally not a fan. For Field Test, it was actually kind of disturbing to see Bruce Wayne as a generic bishounen. It's perfectly understandable, seeing as he's supposed to be a playboy and all, but that didn't stop it from being disturbing. Especially with Lucius Fox winking at him every other scene. D8 Other than that, the only real thing to note artwise is the variety in costume design. Batman's suit does from having actual heavy armor to looking pretty true to its movie design; once again, none of them really struck me as particularly impressive, but none were flat out hideous either.MUSIC - The usual Batman theme stuff for the most part. Awesome, but nothing really to note.VOICE ACTING - I'm sure I wasn't the only one who was psyched to see that Kevin Conroy was going to reprise his role as Bruce Wayne/Batman for Gotham Knight. His is easily the most definitive and recognizable voice for the character, and it just wouldn't have been the same without him. For those who don't know, Conroy started as the voice for the role in The Animated Series, and then went on to play almost every animated appearance of Batman, including roles in the Batman Beyond, the Justice League, subsequent movies, and guest appearances in Superman:TAS and Static Shock. In any case, Conroy does a great job once again; he sounds exactly as he had ten years ago, and that familiarity is really great.The rest of the cast, while not from TAS, seem to mimic their predecessors very well. For me, since TAS played such a big part in my Batman fandom history, I've come to view most of the voices done in the series as &quot;canon,&quot; and so when the cast in Gotham Knight seem able to pick up their parts so well, I was happy.OVERALL - Gotham Knight was good as filler material between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and it's always great seeing these grand collaborations between American and Japanese companies. But as a standalone work, I would consider it a little disappointing. The technical aspects were all on the high ends of things, but its very specific timeframe gave it little wiggle room as far as story goes, which is really too bad. So yeah, in the end, I guess it just depends on how you look at it. In either case, it's worth a watch. to take place in between the events of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight; to that end then, they work okay, avoiding major villains and touching on various lesser themes within the Batman franchise.

In either case, it's worth a watch."", ""Gotham Knight is the best North American and Japanese collaboration in the production of an animation. It is neither an anime nor a cartoon, but a perfect blend of the two. After watching this it created even more anticipation for The Dark Knight live action film that will soon continue the story. The DVD has Japanese directors, American writers, Japanese and American Artists (who are also writers and directors, but also do animation and character design), and American Producers. One cool note that I found was that Emma Thomas one of the producers is Christopher Nolan's wife, and she produces most of the films that...he directs. It is surprising that he did not direct at least one of the short stories. I guess he was too busy with The Dark Knight. My skin feels alive just thinking about the upcoming film, since Nolan happens to be my favorite director. Maybe animation is not his style, since he is so good at directing live action.The story is not really a bunch of short stories, but instead they are actually just different chapters for the entire story that covers the span of chronological events between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. But each story has it own style of direction, since each story was done by a different Japanese director and worked on by different American writers. Here is a break down of the short stories or &quot;chapters&quot; or episodes:Have I Got a Story for YouFour youths describe their perspective of what they see as Batman. Each set of eyes see a different side to the being behind the mask. They each tell of their encounters with Batman, and argue over their observations, and each encounter happens to be contiguous with the next story told so it provided an interesting dynamic for the direction of the short story.CrossfireThe perspective of two detectives under the command of James Gordon which is directed in third person. Local gang wars put some of Gotham's finest in danger, which is something the Bat does not like. One of the detectives was recruited from another city by Gordon, and he has his doubts about whether he can trust Batman, while the other detective grew up in Gotham, so she has a polar perspective to that of her partner. It situates excellent conflict between  the opinion of the partners, and even with the superior officer.Field TestAn excellent depiction of the good or &quot;light&quot; side of Batman. Normally his dark side is the one portrayed, but this story shows the truth of the man behind the masks and his kind heart. It also has some insane progressive technology!In Darkness DwellsThe story features Croc and Scarcrow. Not as much depth as the other stories, but it has excellent action sequences.Working Through PainThe best of all six short stories. It is a flash back of Batman's past where he travels the world and seeks out some Hindu philosophy or Psychology to learn how to bend his pain to his own will. It is an excellent illustration and articulation of the inner conflict within Batman.DeadshotAnother super villain, Deadshot, is assassinating the commissioners in Gotham. In the episode, Batman protects his social and judicial defender, and link to society, Commissioner Gordon. There is an amazing transition from the previous short story into this one, where Batman comes to a realization about his life as a superhero and the deeper meaning behind his surface motives for defending Gotham city.A really cool comment on the show is that Kevin Conroy came on to do the voice of Batman. For those who do not know him, he was the voice actor for the original Batman in Batman: The Animated Series. He is a legend among North American voice actors, and his voice is the perfect match to the archetype that is Batman.Overall the DVD or OVA or &quot;whatever&quot; is one of the finest animations I have watched. The very first scene blew me away with its phenomenal animation and artwork. It starts with a pan across a fog sodden bridge somewhere in Gotham to the top of a building where Batman awaits. Some of the best creators in the world came together for an avant garde production. Avant garde literally means the group of soldiers who would lead an army into battle. It is normally lead by the army's finest battalion. The figurative connotation of my use of the word, means to push boundaries. The perfection that is Gotham Knight is the result of some of the best production in the world. The task to bring all these brilliant minds together is arduous and costly, but with the perfect hierarchy that is their entire production team, they have been able to produce a taste of perfection in this Anime, Cartoon, Animation, whatever. The whole time as I watched I had inner conflict turmoil inside of me as to whether or not I consider this show to be an anime. But after watching the show, I came to the conclusion that is is neither an anime nor a cartoon and instead is a neoanimation. Whether or not that is actually a word, I could care less. I simply used a modifier on a noun and the semantics work to describe my meaning. All I really know is that this show deserves a place here on MyAnimeList along side of some of the greatest animation of our time. he directs.

Some of the them are closely connected chronologically, while others are temporally isolated from the events of the other shorts. While our hero still has to stop...street gangs, old foes, and new enemies alike, the main conflict throughout Gotham Knight is the struggle within Bruce Wayne\'s mind between the anguish he suffers both physically and mentally, as well as his faltering belief in what he does under guise of the black mask.

It's either gonna make it or break it for you. This is especially true you watch it with friends who don't see much anime.Anyways, if you DO hate it, just keep watching -- you won't be dissapointed. It gets much better the more you watch. Each episode runs for about 12 minutes, done by a different art studio. My fave episode was probably the 5th one - &quot;Working Through the Pain&quot;. Most of you will probably think the same....But really, all of the stories are well done.7/10 -- anticipating The Dark Knight even more now! But really, all of the stories are well done.7/10 -- anticipating The Dark Knight even more now!"", 'If you have ever wanted to see anime-esque Batman, you\'ll get your wish with Batman: Gotham Knight.  Produced as a combination-collaborative project between Japanese and American animation studios, Batman: Gotham Knight is collection of six short animated segments/stories each with their own unique art style and interpretation on the caped crusader.  The film is extremely similar in comparison and format to The Animatrix (2003).Might I also add that this film once again features Kevin Conroy as Batman.  He is known as the man who has been coined the character\'s most iconic and long-lasting voice.  He has been playing the caped crusader...since 1992 and continues to this day in multiple media forms. (Check out Batman: The Animated Series if you haven\'t ever seen it.  It is, in my personal opinion, the greatest American cartoon series out there.)Have I Got A Story for You (Studio 4°C):A group of street kids meet up in a ghetto skatepark and discuss the Batman and their encounters with him from earlier in the day.  Each has their own variation on who Batman is and how he operates, creating a mythos of fear and mystery surrounding him.  The art in this segment is very ""messy"" and that can ultimately be a strength or weakness due to viewer subjectivity. (6/10)Crossfire (Production I.G):Two partners under Lt. Gordon\'s Major Crimes Unit are assigned to transport ""The Man in Black"" (the high-tech criminal from the previous OVA) to prison after Batman turns him over to the authorities.  One of the partners is skeptical of Batman and believes he is a dangerous vigilante.  After an argument with his partner, the duo finds themselves in the middle of an all-out turf war between large rival gangs.  This short has some solid art and some great action shots.  It also introduces and establishes us to the characters of Crispus Allen and Anna Ramirez (two characters that are throughout the remaining segments). (8/10)Field Test (Bee Train):Lucius Fox, head of Wayne Enterprises\' prototype weapons technology, gives Bruce Wayne the technology to deflect almost all gunfire he will encounter as Batman.  He takes the tech on a night trial.  Ultimately, this has to have the strongest anime Batman out of all the segments.  The way Bruce Wayne appears (looking Light Yagami of Death Note to me) and the batsuit looking like an armored falcon-bat from some angles.  It is definitely the most bold interpretation of all the productions in the art department when it comes to defining Batman. (6/10)In Darkness Dwells (Studio Madhouse):After learning that a priest has been taken into the catacomb sewers beneath his church by a lizard-like monster, Batman takes pursuit and finds that Jonathan Crane (aka. The Scarecrow) is somehow involved.  The plot of this segment is very basic and just gives an excuse for some great action sequences.  The art is reminiscent of Afro Samurai, another anime that thrives on energetic fight-animation above all else. (7/10)Working Through Pain (Studio 4°C):After being shot in the stomach by a thug hallucinating from Scarecrow\'s fear toxin, Batman stumbles to find a way out of the sewers and back to safety.  While he fights the pain of his wound, his memories echo to his travels before Batman where he sought the secrets to deal with strife and pain of the body.  Definitely the most story-depth in this portion compared to the rest. (8/10)Deadshot (Studio Madhouse):After a Gotham gang hires the marksman-assassin Deadshot to kill Lt. Gordon, Batman must find the shooter before he finds his target.  Definitely one of the most memorable action pieces from the entirety of the shorts.  The art is solid in this one. (8/10)In the end, this series of mini-films was ultimately intended to be set in Christopher Nolan\'s Batman universe between the first (2005\'s Batman Begins) and second film (2008\'s The Dark Knight).  Though loosely weaving some elements in (such as Scarecrow still being at large since Batman Begins) and connecting some segments together through minor plot points (1-2, 4-6), Batman: Gotham Knight doesn\'t really have to connect to anything and can fit into any basic Batman continuity or anthology if one decides to view it as such.  If looked at as an artistic piece with foreign studios trying their hand at one of the most famed superheroes of all-time, then by gosh, it\'s a very simple great time in my opinion.  Mindless fun with an artistic flare (and a few thoughtful moments).  Definitely worth checking it out if you are a fan of Batman. since 1992 and continues to this day in multiple media forms.

If you want you can read my review in Spanish.After Animatrix (2003) and Genius Party (2007), the next famous anthology is the one dedicated to the bat man. Surely more than one of them will find his existence curious, but it makes sense when you realize the popularity of the hero in the second half of 2000 with the Cristopher Nolan films like Batman Begins (2005) and The Dark Knight (2008) ). We are facing an American and Japanese co-production. On the one hand, these shorts were produced by various Japanese studios such as Bee Train, Madhouse,...Production I.G and Studio 4ºC. Additionally, each of these short films were directed by Japanese professionals such as Shojiro Nishimi, Hiroshi Morioka, and Yoshiaki Kawajiri. On the other hand, the script was the task of American writers such as Greg Rucka, David S. Goyer or Brian Azzarello.The link that unites these six shorts would be the presence of Batman, but each one focuses on different aspects of the hero: the myth, his work as a vigilante, his ideal of not taking other lives (no matter how criminal they are), etc. Most simply put the issue on the table up front and then, through a confrontation or dangerous situation, come to a conclusion about it. To be honest, they don\'t tell us anything special. They do a little zoom, which gives us a clear idea, but they don\'t go very far. The only short film that really points far is ""Have I got a story for you.""This first work was created by Studio 4ºC, a studio more than known for its experimental and creative side. Anyone who has seen a few of his anime will be able to notice his style in the character designs, the use of color, etc. Leaving that aside, the subject of this story would be the myth and reality of the Batman character. As many of you know, several ancient heroes such as Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar were greatly mythologized by later historiography for their great military feats and deeds. The same could happen with the most famous heroes of fiction. For example, Superman, Batman or Spiderman. Not a single one of them has a single image, but various authors have represented them in multiple ways.Hence, everyone has their own image of the hero, as shown by the three skaters in history. When the three of them meet at the skating rink, with a friend of his who has not seen Batman, they tell him the version of him. Although they have the fundamental actors in common, that is, Batman and the Man in Black, each one places his story in a different place and time. But the most important thing would be that this Batman has very different abilities and powers depending on the version. In one they describe him as a living shadow capable of appearing and disappearing. In another he takes the form of a giant bat endowed with claws and the ability to fly. In the last one, the boy opts for the strange idea - you can tell it came to a Japanese man - of turning Batman into a combat robot capable of launching lasers and jumping great distances.As you can see, the stories can be a bit crazy. They point it out themselves, correcting themselves on more than one occasion because they tried to make it too spectacular. The truth does not surprise me because people like to exaggerate and create incredible stories to praise someone\'s figure, attributing unusual qualities or enormous feats to them. This is how great legends are born. However, behind all those myths that portray a heroic character, there is a real person. That man would be the Batman of the last story, when we are really sure that he is authentic because he starts fighting with the Man in Black in front of them. There we can see a weaker Batman, without special powers or amazing gadgets. Someone who goes through a lot of difficulties to win and capture the criminal. Even this one manages to win thanks to the intervention of the boy, who, unlike the others, was not a mere spectator.You can read my review here: https://elarmarioanimados.blogspot.com/2018/09/batman-gotham-knight.html Production I.G and Studio 4ºC.

While the animation style is visually striking, the stories in the anthology film are hit-or-miss. Some segments are engaging and well-written, while others feel underdeveloped and lacklustre. The voice acting is solid, but the overall experience is underwhelming. It's worth a watch for die-hard Batman fans, but it's not a must-see for general audiences.The film's anthology format allows for a variety of different styles and perspectives, which is both a strength and a weakness. On one hand, it keeps the film fresh and allows for different takes on the iconic character of Batman. On the other...hand, it makes the film feel disjointed and uneven.Some of the segments stand out, such as the one directed by Shojiro Nishimi, which features a unique animation style and a tense and thrilling story. However, other segments fall flat, such as the one directed by Futoshi Higashide, which feels poorly written and rushed.The voice acting is good overall, with Kevin Conroy reprising his role as Batman. However, the film's soundtrack is forgettable and doesn't add much to the overall experience.In conclusion, Batman: Gotham Knight is a decent watch for fans of the character, but it's not the best representation of the Dark Knight. It has its moments, but it also has its shortcomings.Additionally, the film's anthology format is not without its drawbacks. It can be jarring to jump from one story to another and not all stories are equally strong, making it difficult to fully invest in any one of them. Furthermore, some of the segments feel disconnected from the overall Batman universe and lack the depth and complexity that the character is known for.The film's animation is impressive and the character designs are faithful to the comics. However, the animation quality varies between segments and is not consistent throughout the film.In summary, Batman: Gotham Knight has its good points, but it also has its fair share of flaws.

The stories were all independent in my opinion. While the overall character development in this anime was interesting to watch, it didn't really hold that much value for me because I just felt in a transition.The artwork was passable, if not average. On the whole, I think it was just able to keep my attention, but not such that I would watch it a second time. "", ""This anime gives a better portrayal  of batman,not just as a crime fighting knight but also the very essence of bruce wayne. The  awesome thing about this anime is that,the looks of batman changes and so his mentality.some of it's episodes reveals the beginning of batman and how he managed to become the greatest hero of all time .the story is great and so is it's animation.for an avid otaku Gotham knight is a must watch because it changes the perspective of what we call anime.it has potryed batman as the most badassed hero of all time.no other anime character could ever reach...the level of how awesome he is.story is greatart is very goodsound-though there is no opening or ending theme song,yet the original motion picture soundtrack and original Batman animated series music find it's place in somewere middle of the episodes.character-it's BATMAN(do i need to say something more)overall-gooda must watch anime the level of how awesome he is.story is greatart is very goodsound-though there is no opening or ending theme song,yet the original motion picture soundtrack and original Batman animated series music find it's place in somewere middle of the episodes.character-it's BATMAN(do i need to say something more)overall-gooda must watch anime"", 'What can I say? I\'m a Batman fan. Though the ""real"" fans might run me over the coals for saying so. I like the movies, the animations, and have read my fair share of the more popular graphic novel compilations, but I don\'t have the gall to dedicate myself to the entire mythos. Regardless, Batman is runner-up to Spider-Man for my favorite western superhero, and the important thing is he maintains that status through the sheer great concept that\'s kept him going. More so a modern take - the gritty neo-noir detective stories set in a city as black and grimy as tar. I\'m sure...I don\'t need to explain Batman to anyone, but I\'m left with a bit of a high after watching Gotham Knight, since it was better than I was expecting and reminded me of why I find the hero\'s stories so engaging.This anthology movie contains contributions by several different Japanese directors, with each injecting their own style into their short. They\'re chronological and loosely connected, but satisfyingly enough to make the movie format feel worthwhile but also not beholding any of the directors to adhere to a specific narrative. Gotham Knight was commissioned as a sort of promotion for the upcoming movie, The Dark Knight. Gotham Knight released a mere week before the first public airing of The Dark Knight, so it got fairly overshadowed by the main event other than that niche of Batman and animation fans. They do exist, however, since the 1990s animated series is still fondly remembered. Since I still have a predictably difficult time getting Batman fans to watch The Big O, this other anime that bears its influence will be an easier recommendation.I\'m not wholly in the mood to go over each of these shorts individually, but on the whole I can say those expecting something grand beyond the anthology concept can scrap that thought. Gotham Knight is fairly close to the ground, perhaps a bit surprising given the Japanese direction, but that\'s how I like my Batman. The hero\'s rogues gallery sees little use, and instead the stories are focused on an eventful, but not particularly life-altering night for Batman. As normal as you might imagine things get. The shorts take a variety of perspectives from the people and police who watch him on the streets, as well as the fear Batman inspires and even his vulnerabilities. It covers the basic beats for Batman, but the modesty keeps it engrossing and almost calm as the unpredictability of the style changes bring their own excitements. The quality consistency is commendable, and there was no segment I felt to be a drag. Nonetheless, no anime are created equal and I have my preference: Working Through Pain > Deadshot > Field Test > In Darkness Dwells > Have I Got a Story for You > Crossfire.I particularly enjoyed Working Through Pain for it breaking the mold somewhat on conveying an established character and his setting for specific character development. It\'s the only segment here that looks at a Batman theme deeper than the common interpretations, and as such it feels appropriately personal and the most emotional. Deadshot\'s second place is clear when you consider it\'s directed by my man Yoshiaki Kawajiri. Granted, his usual darkness can be hard to pick out in a series that thrives on such, but the most telling mark of his absurdity is when it turned out Kawajiri gets credit for Gotham Knight\'s infamous bullet punching scene. God bless. His section was visually a treat as well, with the heavy sharp angled outlining and realistic character detail felt the most similar to a standard comic book design. It reminded me the most of the 1990s animated series, though nothing here truly captures that spirit. It doesn\'t need to, though, because it captures the broader spirit of Batman that\'s been so ingrained in public perception that even this smorgasbord of different visions all capture what makes the world of Batman engaging while adding subtle, delightful differences. There\'s nothing extremely impressive, but it\'s a suitable and familiar ride through the dark streets of Gotham through stylish animation, and that\'s worth some weight in gold.

But I must say this anime was quite interesting and I think it did a very good and interesting job of portraying batman even though there lack depths. You cannot deny that even with the different animation styles it really captured Gotham city and the mystery surrounding batman, I must praise the first episode for being quite a jolly ride and a very different and original way of presenting batman.the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things- I love the fact that they used different animation styles, it really gave a experimental fell to it :) (also making it somewhat more tolerated that it lacked frametime, and needed a better plot and character development.)- it is batman? That makes it also less needing for that character development because we already somewhat know the main characters.- The dub was great (can´t speak for the sub, haven´t heard it)The flip coin - either cons or pros depending on your taste.- I liked it for being somewhat short and not that character/plot developing because that is already taken cared of with all the movies, western cartoons and the comics. So I liked it for being this more experimental kind of series showcasing batman in different ways. I was indeed entertained ^^- Either you hate or love the changing animation style for each episode.- The animation of the first episode of the characters.... I both loved it and hated it. I definitely loved the design of the scenery, that was fucking eyecandy, but it was a very weird animation for the characters XDAll the hurtful.... cringe! - The cons- Yes it is short, lacking plot and character development, I want to watch more, without any doubt :3- The music/music effects... For me I didn´t really notice it at all o.o or maybe it was just me. I only noticed it in the second episodes where it did a great job :PIt was more presenting batman as a concept instead of being original stand alone complex itself. But they could have been more experimental with the animation style, I loved the first for its AMAZING urban scenery and the second for its whole execution but the last 4 was very similar (I would have loved batman in a really classic anime animation style, maybe corpse party ish for a more darker feel, haha XD)) returns, released few weeks prior.- Every episode has a different animation style (mainly the first is vastly different from the fifth others, the others are more similar but still different)I am myself not a very big batman fan, I am much more of a Joker girl. But I must say this anime was quite interesting and I think it did a very good and interesting job of portraying batman even though there lack depths. You cannot deny that even with the different animation styles it really captured Gotham city and the mystery surrounding batman, I must praise the first episode for being quite a jolly ride and a very different and original way of presenting batman.the rainbow faeces of the Unicorn - the good things- I love the fact that they used different animation styles, it really gave a experimental fell to it :) (also making it somewhat more tolerated that it lacked frametime, and needed a better plot and character development.)- it is batman? That makes it also less needing for that character development because we already somewhat know the main characters.- The dub was great (can´t speak for the sub, haven´t heard it)The flip coin - either cons or pros depending on your taste.- I liked it for being somewhat short and not that character/plot developing because that is already taken cared of with all the movies, western cartoons and the comics.

I mean I love batman but i have to say this really let me down. I mean these are some of the best writers of our time (or at least thats what they kept telling us) and this was the best tehy could come up with ', ""Ayy, Go watch: Batman Gotham KnightBatman Gotham Knight is a 6 part OVA produced with the collaboration of 3 household names: Production IG, Madhouse, and Studio 4C.I'm not going to spend time summarizing the show, you can find that on Myanimelist or on someone else's blog, but I am going to tell you why I believe Gotham Knight is indeed worth the watch.Due to the show being made by 3 different studios, there's an insane amount of budget and artistic style put into each story. The animation specifically of episodes 1 and 4 are absolutely phenomenal, and are almost on movie levels of fidelity. The...artstyles also give great personality to each story and make it fun to try to figure out which studios did what episodes. That makes for a pretty fun guessing game believe it or not.The tone of Gotham Knight also very consistent. Never did I feel that there was an abrupt tone switch that took me out of the mood, or a moment ruined by comedy. It was dark the entire time, and when it wasn't dark...aka only the first episode, it was consistently mysterious but fairly lighthearted in tone. The atmosphere of Gotham Knight is also another thing that deserves praise, especially in episode 5, which is easily the best episode in the series. At many times, specifically towards the beginning, I felt as if I was watching a horror movie. I felt the terror that this hobo on screen felt. This is not the only case of a great atmosphere, however this is the best example I personally felt in the series.The characters aside from Batman and the woman he meets in episode 5 don't have much depth, however it's just a short Batman flick so I don't really see this as an issue. Characters however are well defined even if it means they're just villain or just cop. The duo in episode 2 felt like real people because aside from being cops, that's all they were. They're realism made them relatable, which added to the feeling to suspense later in the episode.One of the best things about Gotham Knight is believe it or not, its theme expoloration  which is once again, most prominently seen in episode 5. I know just said that Gotham Knight is mainly an action flick; however, dont go into it thinking that's all you'll be getting. Gotham Knight covers themes of dealing with pain, heroism, and the idea of masking your pain with heroism.Overall, Gotham Knight is definitely worth the watch just for the action sequences and the budget alone. The theme exploration is nice but the show isn't extremely thought provoking. What it is however is a very fun ride, to the point that even I, someone who has fallen asleep in every other attempt in trying to watch a Batman film, can enjoy the experience. HEY DONT JUDGE ME!So AYY YOU, GO WATCH BATMAN GOTHAM KNIGHT! WHY?

You had Batman, Alfred, Lucius Fox, the works. You also had some underappreciated Batman villains like Deadshot and Scarecrow mixed in there. The characterizations were pretty accurate and a fair chunk of the episodes had nice little character bits.The art was pretty well done overall although I wish more of the bits were as visually interesting as the 1st...episode, that was the best looking one of the bunch. Everything else was generic anime style, but still perfectly fine. On the last note for this section of the review, some of the fights were pretty kickass as expected from any animated DC movie.The soundtrack was pretty generic in all honesty. While it wasn't really terrible it felt like royalty free action movie music was slapped on and felt like one of the weaker parts of the movie.Overall, if you're a big fan of Batman or are just looking to be entertained for an hour you should check it out. However, not every episode is gonna be your cup of tea, just bear that in mind. episode, that was the best looking one of the bunch. Everything else was generic anime style, but still perfectly fine.

I had my doubts and never bothered to look it up until this day. And I have to say that I'm very surprised.This film manages to encapsulate the very essence of Batman. Every story is independent from each other and each of them focuses on a certain aspect of our Caped Crusader.When you look at every story altogehter, you can see that Batman is more than a hero. He represents something different for every part of...the community in Gotham.For the civilians, he is a mythical entity, like an urban legend. They find him very mysterious but also fascinating. People are having a hard time to describe him but they trust him dearly because of his work. Behind his enigmatic and dark facade, he is a beacon of hope for the people of Gotham. You get to see this in the first story.For the criminals, he's like a creature of the night. He's relentless and inevitable. He's watching all of them day & night. If you're doing something wrong, he will get you eventually. He won't kill you but he will hurt you really, really bad.When it comes to the authorities, Batman is a contoversial and divisive figure. He's a righteous man who's devoid of any personal gains and ambitions. His moral code is beyond any authorities and he cannot be stopped. He cannot be tempted by any powerful and influental people in Gotham. He is totally incorruptible. Even though trustworthy and virtuous men like James Gordon believes in him, his reckless and independent nature scares the authorities.Aside from these qualities of Batman, the film also explores Bruce Wayne, especially in the fifth story which is also my favorite one. Bruce Wayne is a man who can't overcome his tragedy in his life. He is scarred forever and the pain he suffers from is unbearable. He goes on a long journey to find out how to bury this pain but he finds out that the only this he can do is to become one with the pain. He cannot escape this eternal suffering and the place he belongs to, Gotham. Hence, the sad story of our Dark Knight begins.I see that the art style is a bit mixed bag for the viewers. I personally liked every single one of them. They're pretty unique and fit their respective stories like a glove. Especially in the first story, Batman's vague urban legend like status is portrayed perfectly with hip-hop like fluid and abstract animation and colors. Also, since the first story is told by bunch of skater dudes, I think this art style fits the narrative and characters.Overall, this film will be a great experience for open-minded die-hard Batman fans. It's like a Batman 101. Highly recommended. the community in Gotham.For the civilians, he is a mythical entity, like an urban legend. They find him very mysterious but also fascinating.

To me this is essential viewing for DC fans and anime fans should enjoy it as well. It consists of six stories produced from Studio 4 °C (Memories), Production I.G. (Ghost in the Shell), Bee Train (.hack//) and Madhouse (Death Note). Although they range in quality, there's no bad one per se. I don't love the animation in the first story, Have I Got a Story for You, and the ending to the fifth one, Working Through Pain, admittedly...has me puzzled. The rest are spot-on though. As usual it's great to hear Kevin Conroy's voice in this movie, which was his first outside of the DC Animated Universe started by Batman: The Animated Series. I might be biased towards this movie because it was one of my favorites to watch growing up but even in my college years I find myself revisiting this time to time and always getting a thrill out of it. has me puzzled.

A-Channel,https://myanimelist.net/anime/9776/A-Channel,"[""Does a good anime need to have a good plot? The answer is: NO! Take a certain over-the-top mecha-robo anime with plenty of drills (and thus male Freudian artifacts) for example; it's plot wasn't the most original storytelling, but that didn't stop the anime from being explosively entertaining.But does good anime need to have ANY plot? The answer is undoubtedly: NO. If otherwise, the slice-of-life genre of anime wouldn't exist; and hits like K-On, Lucky Star, and Hidamari Sketch would never have gained the popularity that they did.So is A-channel like Lucky Star, K-On, or Hidamari Sketch? The answer is still: NO. The latter...three anime, although plotless, have some extra premise or setting in which the contents of the anime revolve around; K-On has the pretense of forming a band, Hidamari Sketch has the setting of an art school, and Lucky Star has an otaku as the lead. A-Channel, on the other hand, has nothing.But is that a bad thing? NO! That just means that A-Channel is a slice-of-life in its PUREST form.A-Channel portrays the easy  life of four ordinary high school girls. The main focus if this anime is undoubtedly the characters and their interactions with each other. The biggest concerns or conflicts that the characters have are simple things like their weight, jealousy over different body proportions, or being over-protective of each other. The characters do ordinary things together like going to festivals, walking home in the rain, eating at fast food restaurants, singing karaoke, or playing in the snow together. There is no storyline at all, major, minor, or subplot; all A-Channel portrays are the sweetest moments amongst the smallest actions found in daily life. It's like someone cut out the most boring 23 hours and 40 minutes of the characters' days and turned the most lively 20 minutes of each day into a show.The characters are what drive this show; they are indeed a good group to be friends with, being  diverse and varied and yet not straying too far from the norm. We have Tooru, the clever troublemaker, Nagi, the ordinary one, Yuuko, the nice-bodied scaredy-cat, and Run, the airhead of airheads. Taken individually, these character may not seem like the most interesting ensemble. But when put together, it their interactions that make this anime shine. Character development doesn't come from the growth of the characters themselves, but rather that the viewer learns more about the characters as he or she continues to watch them, just like in real friendships. The diversity and depth of the interactions are astounding, and often it's the littlest of interactions that can send the viewer the biggest signals. (i.e. Yuuko showing slight interest in the idea of Run not wearing any panties.)Being a slice-of-life, the production value of the show need not be very high. Most slice-of-lifes can get away with mediocre animation with a lot of still shots and  mediocre sound with just an opening, ending, and a handful of background tracks. A-channel does exactly that. The animation is fine; the four girls look satisfactorily cute from most angles and distances, and the sound is alright, with an upbeat opening, a winding-down ending, and BGM that doesn't find itself to be to obtrusive to the ears. There is one praiseworthy aspect of the production, and it's the number of insert songs sung by the seiyuu. Often times, when wanting to show a collections of events, the producers would display a montage of clips accompanied by an insert song often times sung by the seiyuus themselves. This technique was most apparent during the karaoke episode, and I thought it was a nice way of letting the episodes flow rather than trying to directly tell the story. Voice-action, however, is a totally different story; this is the area where slice-of-lifes absolutely cannot skimp, and A-channel here delivers what it must. Each of the seiyuus for each of the character does a splendid job of delivering the right performance at each given situation.So is A-channel something you should watch? Well it really depends. If you want something action, drama, romance, story, plot-twists, thrills, chills, or the like, then look elsewhere. But if you're into cute girls doing cute things from day in to day out, a light hearted slice-of-life comedy for a few laughs, I suggest you give A-channel a try.Questions, comments, criticisms and compliments are welcomed whether you found this review helpful or not. three anime, although plotless, have some extra premise or setting in which the contents of the anime revolve around; K-On has the pretense of forming a band, Hidamari Sketch has the setting of an art school, and Lucky Star has an otaku as the lead.

The setting itself is a bit overused but that doesn't mean that it's not good. The slow pace combined with the setting gives it a light and relaxing atmosphere. Despite the slow pace, rarely does A-Channel feel boring. The comedic moments are up and...down, some are pretty funny while others don't seem to work.

There is the Run, who is an airhead, Tooru, who is overprotective of Run and reckless, Nagi, who is level-headed and Yuuko who is very timid. The contrasting personalities of each character really makes A-Channel fun to watch and it injects life into the series.  Individually the characters aren't very diverse which has it's own pros and cons.  On the upside it prevents the series from being confusing and makes the it a relaxing watch, not making us think.

They've even got Madoka. This is a nice cast lineup. Four girls in a high school slice of life with a cast like this, can it seriously go wrong?The major falling of A-Channel is that it isn't funny.

You have Nagi, who's literally an inferior Yomi from AzuDai. You have Yuuko, who gets scared easily and has big boobs. You have Tooru, who's shy but aggressive.For each of those characters save Tooru that's all there is to them. Tooru gets a little bit more to her in that she really likes Run, she has this conflict where Run and the others are a year older than her, and she's moe.

Most of the time it's just the music played to stills.The best that can be said of this show is that some of the music is ok, the OP is good, and the characters at least look nice.A-Channel is awful."", 'I liked A-Channel.Was it amazing?Well no.I\'m going to be honest, it was a run-of-the-mill moe slice-of-life anime series that is supposed to entertain through hilarious incidents of normal day-today activities. Everyone is right when they criticize A-Channel. It lacks substance and is a subpar, repetitive slice-of-life anime with beach trips, summer festivals, school life and hang outs. It didn\'t make me laugh as hard as Yuru Yuri or Lucky Star. It didn\'t make me go ""Awww!"" for the cute touching scenes like in K-On! You possibly can\'t compare it to slice-of-life beasts like Lucky Star when it comes to uniqueness. Hey, at least...the A-Channel girls did not have a club like the K-On! cast!So why did I like A-Channel?One of the main things people forget nowadays is the appreciation for the little things and learning certain lessons form a variety of experiences. Of course A-Channel is not a Clannad in terms of an emotional roller-coaster, but what I\'m trying to get across here is that different anime can teach a variety of different lessons that we can apply in our lives. I\'ve learned many deeper life lessons from Clannad about family and from Ano Hana about moving on, but I\'ve also learned some general lessons about daily life. This is especially true after seeing Tooru progress through the series. Although development for Tooru is rather flat and lacks dynamic, she did remind me of myself at many times. Her cold attitude and distrust toward everyone in the beginning is pretty much how I am toward new people or just people in general. I share her same work ethic, get things done efficiently, respect older people, and help people where ever you can. Seeing Tooru all over Run definitely hit a soft spot for me. Why? Like Tooru, I only trust people who\'ve I\'ve known for a long time and learned to trust. It\'s hard for me to make new friends because of distrust of people that bullies instilled in me during my middle school life. Learning to make new friends and making new experiences is a vital part of living. It is something I always forget to do, yet Tooru\'s journey in this short series reminded me about that throughout life, you need friends, you need to have a lot of friends to live a happy life. Every time she learns some sort of lesson, I have this feeling of warmth inside. Even Run taught me a lesson. Despite the fact someone may be a bit torpid or even mean, there sometimes may be some goodness inside of that person. At many times I want smack people like Run upside the head at times, but in the end those people can be the most warmhearted people you can ever meet. Lessons like these, I know, remind me to do something trifle, yet so important to the actual living of my life. I liked the series not because it was entertaining, but I was able to take something from it and make that lesson mine.I can\'t say I would recommend this to people who are familiar with the slice of life genre because it isn\'t amazingly funny or entertaining when compared to K-On! or Lucky Star. It will be repetitive to those who have seen many slice of life high school series. I can say though, if you try A-Channel out, you might learn a thing or two like I did. On the same token, you can say it\'s boring and move on to the next series: one that actually will entertain you.Onward with the review:Story (6): Most slice-of-life anime series have no plot. Just a simple get together and do something episodes that give a few laughs and may make you say feel fuzzy inside at the end. Again this is my standard for these types of moe slice-of-life anime series. This is not the judgement of entertainment I had from the series!Art (10): What really blew me away here was the amount of detail put into this slice-of-life series. Most of these types of series are cheaply made and quickly released as a means to keep the audience\'s attention on the moe moe kawaii characters in the series. The amount of detail in A-Channel really added to the depth of connection I had with the protagonist. I know I\'m exaggerating here, but I felt as though I was really in and feeling the setting. The details, especially depth perception and movement, were sharp and smooth. This was probably one of the most important factors in my actual learning from and enjoyment of the series.Sound (9): This was the second aspect that really took me home. I really loved the background music, OP, ED, and Character Songs that were played during A-Channel. It really did add on to the mood of the series. I can\'t say the soundtrack was compelling here like in the soundtrack of Clannad, but the music was a major contributor to the emotional connections I was able to make throughout the series. In terms of character voicing and SFX, they were the same to me as every other slice-of-life anime series. Nothing special, just following the mold of slice-of-life high school comedy.Character (7): ""Wait! I thought you were able to learn lessons from these characters!?""Yes I did say that. I also said I thought one of the above said characters was flat (no pun intended) and was not dynamic or interesting in any way. These characters fill in certain slice-of-life archetypes like Yuuko being the Mary Sue of the series and Run, the nice girl who is unfortunately the oblivious airhead. This is much like Mio and Yui respectively from K-On! Not that I have with said archetypes, sometimes it can get a bit repetitive. Yes, it\'s true. Girls do bicker and talk about the most trifle of things such as body weight, homework, or cute things, but I see and hear that already in real life. Yes, when exaggerated in anime form it can be very humorous, but this still doesn\'t dismiss the fact that I have heard these petty conversations that can get old and boring in a heartbeat. A-Channel pulls the character interactions and archetypes well, just like every other moe slice-of-life blob I have seen. There is no complex character development. Even Tooru, who goes through the most change, doesn\'t really go through THAT much change. Simply put, the characters were good, but not amazing or spectacular.Enjoyment (7): While the comedy was humorous and managed to steal a laugh from me here and there I wasn\'t laughing hysterically like I did with Yuru Yuri or Lucky Star. The main selling point for me was the warm and fuzzy scenes in each episode. I was able to make a lot of connections and learned a few things from A-Channel. The entertainment level as a comedy was pretty low since I\'ve seen many slice-of-life moe series already, but the everyday lessons learned from this series is something unique that I seldom get from most anime series.Overall (8): No point in beating the dead horse. In short, if you like slice-of-life moe series despite the lack of depth the series presents, then by all means watch it. Maybe you\'ll take something from it like I have. If you\'re here find nonstop fits of laughter, this is not the anime for you. the A-Channel girls did not have a club like the K-On! cast!So why did I like A-Channel?One of the main things people forget nowadays is the appreciation for the little things and learning certain lessons form a variety of experiences.

If you\'re here find nonstop fits of laughter, this is not the anime for you.', 'Many people may not like A-Channel that much due to the fact that it bears a lot of similarities to other slice-of-life/school life anime in that it has 3-5 girls attending school and the end of the anime is either during Christmas or graduation. I can see why people may give a low score for A-Channel due to those reasons but I believe the anime deserve more credit than it was given. Many slice-of-life anime can get boring to some and I can see why. There\'s no real story and it\'s just the story of the lives of people who aren\'t real and you don\'t...know. However, I felt that A-Channel kept this in consideration as I was not bored one bit. It may be due to the fact that I love slice-of-life anime but I don\'t think that was it. Sure, the anime had no real story but what kept me glued to the screen were the characters. The personality each character had was quite generic but the combination of these 4 different personalities and how it interacts in daily life was what made it unique. You had the girl who looked smart but has her dumb moments, the girl who seems perfect in every way, the air head, and the last girl who I will talk about later because I felt that her personality was the most unique.The smart-looking girl may seemed typical. However, what really made me smile was that she was actually very pretty without her glasses and she has odd habits like the way she calls her brother aniki instead of onii-chan (aniki is normally used by a younger brother, not sister).The girl who seemed perfect in every way is one of my favorite personality because this sets them up for so many comedic moments. I really don\'t want to spoil the fun so you\'ll have to really watch A-Channel to understand what I mean.The air head is just pure laughter because they made her into an air head but not a stupid air head. She isn\'t dumb nor is she uneducated. However, the things she does for her friends really makes you want to laugh but can\'t help see it as something so sweet. My favorite scene would have to be the doll, again, watch A-Channel to really understand.The last of our heroine! Her personality was simply unique. I felt that it was a combination of Nagato Yuki and tsundere with a bit of innocence and maturity within the body of a child topped off with a bit of moe. Yes, you may think that she\'ll be a super cute girl that you\'ll want as a friend one day but get this, alongside all those features, she also bears the wrath of an angry mother protecting her child. You\'ll understand when you watch the anime. You can\'t help but laugh at the things she does in some scenes, question what the heck or why the heck in another, or just have one of those ""Awwww"" moments. She has got to be one of my favorite characters in A-Channel.There are two others but they\'re just comedic relief, but you see quite a lot of them!About the artwork, normally, i dislike artwork where the arms, body, and legs of the characters are ridiculously thin but in A-Channel, I felt that the proportions of he body parts to their thin structure was just right and it did not bother me at all.There is not much to talk about the sounds, it was like any other anime. The music really sets the mood but what music doesn\'t do that in anime?There is also not much to say about the story line either because slice-of-life anime normally doesn\'t have one set story line, if any at all.. So why did I give it an 8? Because since it has no story it doesn\'t mean it deserves a bad score, but that also mean it can\'t really receive a 10 either. The smaller stories within each episode was great though, some I felt like it was a tad bit slow but some I felt was right on the dot and made me laugh.Overall, I would recommend this anime to anybody that loves Lucky Star or K-On. Word of warning though, if you did not enjoy lucky star whatsoever then I would not recommend A-Channel. These types of anime are unique in their own way and it really takes a person that loves these types of anime to really appreciate them. know.

Although it may have a plot like most school based anime, I think it deserves it\'s own special category.Story : 6The reason why I gave this a ""6"" out of ""10"", is that the plot line sometimes gets old. You see so many slice-of-life anime, sometimes its hard to choose!Art : 8I gave this an ""8"" out of ""10"" because the artwork was very good, and gave all the characters a ""innocent"" air about them.

It follows a girl, named Tooru, and her everyday life with her friends. There isn't much of anything else (in terms of story). Despite this, I really loved this series.PROSOnce you start watching A-Channel, the very first thing you'll notice right away is the great sense of humor it has. Perhaps, this is the shows greatest strength. All the jokes are spot on and can be so funny that they will make you cry (at times). I'm confused why others have said that they don't find the comedy that...funny (if at all). Obviously, comedy is subjective, and perhaps many people are turned off by the type of comedy in A-Channel. Nonetheless, I was more than entertained by the hilarious events that happened throughout the series.Another aspect of A-Channel that is fantastic are the characters. Just like Konata in Lucky Star, I assume that most people who love this show, including myself, love Tooru the most. She has this presence of a person that is really protective -especially of her best friend, Run. She'll do almost anything for Run to please her. The other characters in the anime are interesting as well, although one is questionable, but I'll get to that later.Friendship is the main theme of this anime, and rightfully so. Never before have I seen an anime so open about the up and downs of friendships. There are many times in certain episodes where this shines more than anything else.CONSAs I said before, one character in this anime is a bit questionable, in terms of humor. That person is Sachiyo, a health teacher at the school that the main characters go to. He seems to have a weird fascination for foreheads (Run's in particular). It kind of made me feel uncomfortable. I know it was supposed to be seen as a joke and all, but really..... Some things aren't funny if not done properly.As with most slice-of-life anime, A-Channel has no story. If you are expecting plot twists, new characters, and other things that regular anime shows give you, you won't find it here.OVERALLA-Channel is a great anime for those who enjoy the slice-of-life genre. It's nothing mind blowing or new, but it has a certain feel to it that is pretty unique compared to other anime series. If you are interested in friendships and how they work, I would probably suggest A-Channel to you. If not, then there isn't much to recommend here. funny (if at all).

The characters are drawn well with a different look for each one, even the side characters. Run\'s trademark blank stare is what upped the score to an 8 because it was simple yet interesting to see at the same time as she is the only character (besides her mom) that had it. Scenery was illustrated quite well with a good use of color.Characters (7/10)Character archetypes were a bit typical but, nonetheless, enjoyable to watch. You have airhead-chan, overprotective chibi-tan, megane-san and ""nice...body""-sama. With good variety like this, it\'s hard to go wrong in the audience satisfaction department. Personally, I found each of the characters moe in their own way (maybe not so much for Nagi), adding to my enjoyment of the series. The comedy included with a airhead like Run and the teasing of Yuuko surprisingly never got old, even after 12 episodes. Overall, decent characters but don\'t expect anything out of the ordinary.Sound (8/10)Catchy OP and ED coupled with an insert song every episode makes for a great music-based anime. Sadly, A Channel doesn\'t focus on music but the sounds for this anime is actually better than what I expected. Memorable BGM pieces also added to my enjoyment while watching A Channel and I will definitely have to obtain the OST along with the insert songs in the near future when they are released. Notable VAs: Yuuki Aoi (Tooru & Victorique de Blois from GOSICK), Fukuhara Kaori (Run & Hiiragi Tsukasa from Lucky Star) and Kotobuki Minako (Yuuko & Kotobuki Tsumugi from K-ON!). Now I\'m kind of disappointed at K-ON!\'s lack of music compared to A Channel.Story (6/10)Seeing as this is a slice of life anime, I decided to be a bit lenient with the scoring. Through the twelve episodes, it was nothing but ""cute girls doing cute things"". Besides their daily activities in and out of school, along with the passage of time, there wasn\'t anything else that moved the ""story"" (if that is what you can call it) along. On the other hand, at least each episode didn\'t bore me to death so I won\'t say that the ""story"" is horrible.Overall (7/10)It was fun while it lasted but nothing really memorable was left in my head after the completion of A Channel. It\'s something that is good to watch to help you relax and kill some time. If you\'re looking for a good story, I think you should stay away from A Channel to avoid disappointment. However, if you are just looking for some anime to watch leisurely, then, by all means, choose A Channel.

I normally enjoy them quite a bit, but I was coming across quite the heavy amount of repetition in content over the past few months. All of that changed when I finally gave A Channel a shot after glancing at it from a distance for quite the plentiful amount of months.My first thought was that the comedy, straight off the bat, proved to be HIGHLY enjoyable. The character designs, well, it's anime. Unless it's from Akira Toriyama or a few others, most of it will look generally the same. That being said, two of...the four female protagonists have surprisingly original designs and visual comedy that is highly enjoyable. I usually love to let the reader know of the anime without going too much into detail, but I will say this much: as soon as you see the characters, you will know their personality traits straightaway.The soundtrack is amazing. Well it's very simplistic piano, and very calm, it fits the mood really well and I was interested enough to learn two of the tracks on my own piano. The last time I learned the actual piano OST from an anime was a year ago before this one, so it had a unique sound that was enough to enjoy playing on my own. I just liked its mellow vibe and it has such a nice feel to it where you will probably always have a smile on your face when you listen to it.The backgrounds are among the most beautiful I have ever seen in an anime in a VERY long time. Most modern ones I have seen looked fine, but this one made me tear up at one of the scenes. They animated a certain scene so well that, just for a few seconds, you would probably have a hard time telling if you were watching a cartoon or not. That I remember, I only felt this way for two of the scenes, but chances are you might be the type of person to only see it as it is, so this might be more of a personal preference in my own book.And, to finish off, I can not recommend this one enough. If you like Slice of Life and felt like you were watching a lot of repetition, you have to give this one a go right now. In a vein similar to Yuyushiki, K-ON and Lucky Star, it does its own thing and it does so very well. At the very least, you would have a bit above neutral opinion about this anime. You would have to hate Slice of Life, or find it repetitive at least if you have seen a lot, to give it anything lower than that.It was certainly enough for me to buy the Blu-Ray, even though I might not watch it for a while on account of how much I still remember of it. It may be quite a while before I find one as satisfying as this one was, given it met all of my expectations and tastes that I enjoy in a Slice of Life, but I said that about the one I watched not too long ago and then I found this, so maybe I might. the four female protagonists have surprisingly original designs and visual comedy that is highly enjoyable. I usually love to let the reader know of the anime without going too much into detail, but I will say this much: as soon as you see the characters, you will know their personality traits straightaway.The soundtrack is amazing. Well it's very simplistic piano, and very calm, it fits the mood really well and I was interested enough to learn two of the tracks on my own piano.

From what I see, it just follows the lives of four high school girls as they deal with everyday life and find humor in everyday situations. The plot is far from original and tends to be used a lot in these kinds of series but the key is the execution and use of this kind of story and I think that A Channel did a good job...at making this story a little more unique.Art-8: The art style was really good, even though I didn't expect the color scheme to be used in the anime after reading the manga, like I thought that Run would have a lighter shade of blonde for her hair and that Yuuko's eyes would be a darker color then they were, but the scenery was all beautiful and the animation was beautifully done.Sound-10: I have to give the soundtrack a ten here, in pretty much every episode, there is another insert song sung by the cast, and each one of those songs are adorable and fits well with what is currently going on during that episode, like when Tooru and Run were arguing and Tooru's song came on as they were about to make up, that kind of sound track shows that the right music can really make or break an anime and I highly enjoyed the music for this series.Character-9: The characters for this series are a little unexpected for series like this, there's Tooru, the short, tsundere character, Run, the blonde ditzy airhead with a kind heart, Nagi, the tsundere megane who seems to be obsessed with her weight and constantly dieting (Which I can relate to), and Yuuko, the school beauty who is completely perfect in everything she does and is a perfect example of the 'Hime' character sub-type. Now all of these characters have their own moments when you just can't help but love them. My personal favorite character of the series is Tooru, especially considering that she is pretty much the only character in the series who has any character development. The anime shows that Tooru is anxious about her friends graduating from high school without her since she is a year younger then the other three and is afraid of loosing them as friends, which anyone can understand. And aside from the main cast are the teachers, who I really found enjoyable, especially the school nurse who seems to have a forehead fetish!Enjoyment-9: With A Channel, I didn't expect it to be a little more dramatic then Lucky star is, but that just goes to show that despite the genre being essentially the same, that each anime can have their own style. I loved watching every episode, and I'm planning on watching them over again when I have the chance!Overall-9: I would highly recommend A Channel to anyone who enjoys anime like Lucky Star or Azumanga Daioh, or just enjoys the slice of life genre or seinin manga in general. And this anime actually does have character development when it comes to the first main character, Tooru, it isn't a lot but it's enough to separate this series from being just another one of those 4-koma series that there are a lot of nowadays. I highly enjoyed this series and would really consider giving this series a try if you're a fan of lucky star or slice of life! at making this story a little more unique.Art-8: The art style was really good, even though I didn't expect the color scheme to be used in the anime after reading the manga, like I thought that Run would have a lighter shade of blonde for her hair and that Yuuko's eyes would be a darker color then they were, but the scenery was all beautiful and the animation was beautifully done.Sound-10: I have to give the soundtrack a ten here, in pretty much every episode, there is another insert song sung by the cast, and each one of those songs are adorable and fits well with what is currently going on during that episode, like when Tooru and Run were arguing and Tooru's song came on as they were about to make up, that kind of sound track shows that the right music can really make or break an anime and I highly enjoyed the music for this series.Character-9: The characters for this series are a little unexpected for series like this, there's Tooru, the short, tsundere character, Run, the blonde ditzy airhead with a kind heart, Nagi, the tsundere megane who seems to be obsessed with her weight and constantly dieting (Which I can relate to), and Yuuko, the school beauty who is completely perfect in everything she does and is a perfect example of the 'Hime' character sub-type.

I highly enjoyed this series and would really consider giving this series a try if you're a fan of lucky star or slice of life!"", ""The slice of life genre became quite popular recently, studios have been adapting more and more titles. It all began with the release of Azumanga Daioh and the genre is blooming ever since. A-channel also belongs to the ever increasing list of slice-of-life anime and the title is originally a 4-koma comic like K-on! or Lucky Star, which also have an adapted anime form. The anime was made by the relatively new Studio Gokumi, which is known for its other title Koe de Oshigoto.The question about the show is: how is A-channel different from the slice-of-life shows listed above? The short answer is: there is...no difference. A-channel follows the daily lives of 4 high school girls: Tooru, Run, Nagi and Yuuko. It's your standard high school setting with an almost all-female cast. Still A-channel turned out to be really enjoyable despite its flawsStory:Like in all similar anime, episodes can viewed independently from each other. There is no distinctive story that will develop throughout the episodes, there are rather stand-alone episodes which center on a certain event or setting. Since it was adapted from a 4-koma manga, it is a big question whether you can produce a continuous 20-25 minute long episode, or not. I think it did a great job with that. The episodes are nicely written; if some tension is built up during an episode it is usually resolved by the end of the show. A-channel moves with a really slow pace, so you might think it’s boring, if you're not used to the genre. I think the anime managed to put up a nice balance between the comedic and serious moments too.Art:The backgrounds are surprisingly well drawn in the anime. In fact there are very few occasions when someone seriously takes care of the backgrounds in a slice-of-life anime. The colors were vivid, they represented the mood of the scenes really good; overall it was a real eye-candy for me. The character designs are simple as they were in the manga, sometimes a little bit too simple for an anime adaptation. Most of the reactions and expressions were displayed through chibi faces, which they did a little too many times during the show. But the designs were appropriate.Sound:The background music wasn't anything remarkable, it was rather forgettable. The opening song 'Morning arch' on the other hand was very catchy and goes very well with the mood of the whole show. The songs at the end sung by the actresses were a nice addition and the lyrics also passed to the episode's story and mood, but they didn't make a great impression despite this. The ending song wasn't anything special either. The studio did a good job at selecting the voice actors for the show particularly with Yuuki Aoi, who almost single-handedly carried the whole show on her back. Kotubuki Minako and Fukuhara Minako already had some experience with the genre before and they did a good job with their characters too. The deep-voiced Uchiyama Yumi is a relatively new to the anime world, but her characteristic voice made Nagi unique.Characters:While the voice actors did a good job, their characters were just re-hashes from earlier anime. We can easily spot Azumanga Daioh's Yomi in Nagi, Lucky Star's Tsukasa in Run (I think it was intentional that they even share the voice actor), K-on!'s Mio in Yuuko's character (the producers managed to enroll Kotobuki Minako who had a role in K-on! as Mugi-chan, so I think she knew Mio's character pretty well enough, to play her counterpart in A-channel) and Mitsudomoe's Hitoha in Tooru (she can be also considered as a copy of Noel from Sora no Woto, since both characters have the same actress). While the characters are only copies from previous shows, their interactions and the story makes up for them, they really get along well together. Most of the stories somehow center on Tooru and events can be seen mostly from her point of view. We can also have some insights on other characters as well, but the only character, whose personality gets thoroughly analyzed is Tooru.Summary:A-channel is typical case, where a show offers the exact same thing we expect from it, nothing more, nothing less. Anime industry seriously needs more anime like this, where you get what you expect and the show manages to live up to the expectations of the viewers. A-channel is not the best slice-of life anime ever made, but is nicely done, and the studio managed to put up a heart-warming show from mediocre source material. It is the anime that you watch after a stressful day, when you finally get to sit down to relax. I can only recommend this show to those who like slower pace slice of life anime. no difference.

It was sweet, and like a breath of fresh air for me.Story: While there wasn't really much of a plot or conflict anywhere in the story (the biggest thing that comes to mind is when Tooru is feeling stressed about her friends graduating without her near the end), I really enjoyed just smiling at the sweet parts every now and then and the subtle humor that came with each of the characters' individual, unique personalities.Art:...The art wasn't really anything magnificent or out of the ordinary, but I was impressed with the character art, specifically. When I first started watching this anime, I immediately noticed how cute Tooru looked. Another thing I noticed about the art was the outstanding detail in the pet shop after Tooru found and decided to keep Tansan. And then I think somewhere in there there was also a line of posters or pictures with portraits of people in them and I was really impressed with how realistic they looked.Sound: Unfortunately, even if I actively try throughout an anime to pay attention to sound, I just can't focus on it. So sadly, I don't have much to say about it. However, I can say that I loved the voices for each of the characters. They were chosen perfectly, especially Tooru's voice.Characters: I LOVED the characters in this anime. They were so perfectly developed and their personalities didn't shift over the course of the anime, which I'm always keeping an eye out for. Their personalities were so distinct and unwavering. I just really loved them all and how they interacted with each other.Enjoyment: I really did enjoy this anime. The only thing I didn't enjoy was how short it was. There were some things I'd change, but that's true of every anime. The characters, story, and overall tone to the entire thing were on-point. I really liked it.

I really liked it."", '*Note*  If you hate anything that doesn\'t have action and plot in it, turn away now. This will be your only warning before brain cells are forcibly obliterated by hours of non-stop chibi characters.With that out of the way, those who remain may find some value in watching A-Channel. Like I said before, it has no action, no plot, and ultimately no fanservice (sorry ""lover of lolis""). However, what it does have is essence. That sounds cheesy and all but that\'s probably the only word I can think of to describe it. A-Channel is simply about life; not only life, but the essence of...life. How this may affect you mentally can certainly vary from person to person. I think the reason why this anime struck into me so deep is because, as a high school senior graduating in exactly 1 month, I will forever lose some opportunities of life. I will not experience Japanese highschools, highschool romance, and anything else related to anime school events ever again in my entire time here on Earth. These forever lost opportunities are certainly tragic, but there\'s really nothing we can do about it. Watching A-Channel gives me, perhaps, my last glimpse before I exit this period of my life of a lifestyle that I will never experience. Some people would like that, while others will hate being shown something they can never attain. Again it varies.Story (4/10)I\'ll be quite frank here, there is no story. The plot is something like a going-with-the-flow-of-events improvisation. Then again, no one would expect an anime about school life to really have a plot anyways. The story is about 4 high school girls: exasperating Nagi, quasi-yandere Tooru, airhead Run, and cute Yuuko. Tooru is especially attached to Run and enters the same high school as her. There, she meets Run\'s friends Nagi and Yuuko. The plot follows the 4 of them throughout their events in high school. Since Tooru is a grade below Run, Nagi, and Yuuko, there always appears to be some invisible barrier and tension between them. Along the way comes much humor, and even some really meaningful, reminiscent scenes. In addition, you can enjoy semi-yandere mode Tooru groping Yuuko\'s E-cups off screen if that brings you any pleasure. Of course the plot doesn\'t compare to some action shounen anime, but this will probably be the best you\'ll see in a shoujo school life anime.Art (8/10)Perhaps it\'s just that I don\'t like the constant chibi style, but I didn\'t find the art to be particularily attractive. One or two minutes of chibiness in an anime is ok, but to have 20 minutes of non stop circle eyes staring at me gives me the creeps. In addition, they even messed up beautiful Yuuko\'s eyes! RAGE. I don\'t want her to have the same eyes as Akihisa Yoshii-kun from Baka to Test, that\'s just freaking stupid! *Ahem. Anyways, past the somewhat mediocre drawings, there is certainly evidence of beautiful animation and scenery techniques. Movement and even some character positions are expressed fairly well and I am impressed-- enough to give an 8/10.Sound (9/10)Nothing to say really about the sound except that the sound quality was pretty nice. Some background music gets a bit repetitive and annoying, but that slight nuisance can be overlooked. What I really liked about the sound in A-Channel is that, in addition to the OP and ending, they bothered to have a section of each episode (usually 1-2 minutes) that is harmonized with a song about that particular episode. This shows exemplary dedication on the part of the sound directors and really accentuates the feelings conveyed through this anime-- the feeling of happiness, memories, and even nostalgia.Character (8/10)Oh boy characters. Tooru, a short and taciturn girl who has level 5 Yandere mode limit break on cooldown (when Yuuko is present, there is no cooldown), can be considered as the protagonist. Tooru has an...abnormal affection for Run, almost to the Yuri level. Run, on the other hand, is mostly clueless about how much she matters to Tooru. Then again, Run is mostly clueless about everything in this anime. She is that typical open, clumsy and airheadish female character seen in comedy animes. Nagi is the ""freaking out"" type of person. She freaks out, exaggerates and talk to herself a whole craplot. Then there\'s the awesome and amazing Yuuko. Something about straight, black, long-haired anime girls with nicely distributed bangs always gets to me, and Yuuko filled that place in this anime. Yuuko also happens to be the most timid and nice out of the four of them. The only fault I could find with her was her eyes.. grrrr.*facedesk...oh no no no no don\'t think about those eyes... *facedesk. These characters, although probably not the most unique and distinguished characters, fit this anime perfectly. The contrast between their personalities and habits really gives the story in A-Channel humor, relaxation and ultimately that (horrible) cozy feeling.Overall (7/10)I\'ll admit it. I was bored with this anime. But the fact that I realized there was a message much more meaningful than Tooru swing a bat around like a crazy yandere hidden in this anime compelled me to sit and watch. As a result, I believe that watching this anime now this is a memory that I will cherish later in life when watching this type of anime at that time wouldn\'t bring the same enjoyment or feelings.I might get flamed for being a hypocrite when I always say I hate cozy, cute and lovey-dovey things/feelings but become overly sentimental about a boring anime about life. But really, I\'m only sentimental about a few things in life. Shoot a puppy in front of me and I wouldn\'t even blink ( I might even smirk a bit. Heh, dead puppies), but take away a once-in-a-lifetime experience from me, and I wouldn\'t be too happy about that. Likewise,  some people might say that the thought of this anime meaning any more than boring school life is utterly retarded. To those people I say: The message is there. Whether you decide to read it or not is your choice.So, to people who are much more about the thinking, experiencing and dreaming aspects of anime, (or perhaps if you are like me, ending highschool with regrets), A-Channel will bring you to world of experience. To diehard action, romance fans who would kill for a decent plot, your time is better spent elsewhere. life. How this may affect you mentally can certainly vary from person to person.

I had comparatively little hope, and I had heard almost nothing about this anime. This resulted in a dismal prediction: I thought this would suck. Bad. Though it did live up to my expectations, it had just enough story to sort of come out as merely pleasant.I\'ve watched very few slice-of-life sort of shows, and I may not be one to judge, but I did love the story. 12 episodes, however, isn\'t quite enough to fully finish a story. I found myself left hanging; this could have so much more potential. The whole ""high...school girls"" theme seems prevalent enough and this anime is no exception.

I know next to nothing about it except that it's supposed to have a good level of les-yay. Let's take a look at the anime adaptation and see how accurate that is.There's not an over-arching story in A-channel. The basic setup is that a girl named Tooru is starting High School and she's excited because she got into the same school as Run, the girl she loves. You follow Tooru, Run and two other girls, Yuuko and Nagi as they enjoy their school lives. Frankly, I don't care about...the lack of a story. This is a comedy so the important aspect is the humour. How does that hold up? Well, it's pretty similar to Azumanga Daioh. The humour is derived mainly from quirky characters interacting and going through everyday situations. The major issue with the humour is that, in the first few episodes, they reuse the same jokes several times close to each other. Fortunately the series does get better about varying the humour pretty quickly so it's not much of an issue. They even have some reoccurring setups that result in different punchlines, all of them funny. Is it as funny as Azumanga Daioh? Not quite, but it comes pretty close.The characters are pretty familiar. Most of them come close to following common character tropes for slice of life comedies. They do vary somewhat and, to be fair, the variation they do get is arguably enough to set them apart, but it does feel like they started with the trope templates and modified them only slightly. I thought that it was enough for what they were doing, but I can understand why some people might argue that point.Now we move onto my biggest issue with the series, the art. I don't like the art style. It may even be more accurate to say that I heartily dislike the art style. Like Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight, the characters look like children with overly large heads, no noses (or noses that are so small someone couldn't possibly breathe with them), which begs the question of how Nagi keeps her glasses on. It has very basic sets and backgrounds. I'll be fair to the series, the art doesn't look bad. It's bright, colourful and cheerful, which arguably suits the series. My dislike of it doesn't have anything to do with the quality and is based entirely on preference.A-Channel has a strong vocal cast. Uchiyama Yumi, Fukuhara Kaori, Yuuki Aoi and Kotobuki Minako (especially) all give wonderful performances. Then there's the music. For some reason there are a lot of insert songs in this, one in almost every episode. They aren't bad songs, even if a lot of them do sound really similar, but they do seem like a lazy way to extend the running time without having to come up with jokes.The yuri factor is a 6/10. This is mainly a result of Tooru and Run but all of the characters contribute somewhat, especially the supporting characters Yutaka and Miho.My final rating for A-channel is a solid 7/10. It has a few issues, and I didn't care for the art, but it's still a fun series with endearing characters and plenty of humour. If you like Azumanga Daioh or Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight you'll almost certainly have fun with this one. the lack of a story. This is a comedy so the important aspect is the humour.

I don’t expect it to be that highly rated but I would of thought a gem like this would be at like a 7.5 at leastIt’s not hilarious but it’s funny but also touching and had me smiling more than I was laughing, it’s got a great cast of characters and they play off each other brilliantly, they aren’t...all super unique but they’re well done. It also has a nice cast of side characters who really fit the show and make its better experience. Its mostly comedy but slightly and just enough minor drama to make it more interesting and to keep you more invested.Also every episode feels different, different scenarios different things happening, it keeps the show feeling really fresh throughout, never a boring episode.It’s a great adaptation too, really nice art style/animation, great voice acting and good music. It also has one of my favourite OPs, it’s so good. Nice direction and really sets it’s own tone well. For me it really does all the things I love in a SOL well.Honestly it’s up there with my favourite SOL shows, K-on, strawberry marshmallow, saiki K. Like I said it’s not hilarious every episode like say Asobi asobase but it’s funny enough throughout and really sets it’s own tone and knows what it is. it’s not as good as those shows but I really enjoyed it. I’d recommend to anyone who likes slice of life and more specifically CGDCT.I gave it a 10 more because of my experience rather than than being objective, usually I try and be more fair with my ratings but this is one of the exceptions because I enjoyed it so much, also because it’s one of the only anime to really hook me recently, I can’t watch anime quite like I used too but that didn’t affect me when watching this. all super unique but they’re well done.

I watched this due to the rolling success of K-on! (Sorry!). But I probably would not have looked at this series otherwise. This anime was better than I had anticipated. You could say this was more of a guilty pleasure anime considering the other shows that came out this spring. What I enjoyed about it though was the fact that it felt very relaxing to watch. No cliffhangers no heavy drama, just light antics that had me smiling and laughing with the occasional ""aww"".Story - 7The beginning two-thirds of the series seemed to be more random and fun with interactions with different...characters mainly to show the personalities of the main 4 themselves. The last third seemed to focus a bit more on the friendship particularly with Tooru. Overall it was funny and interesting but not all that compelling. I could have just stopped anywhere in this anime and picked it up later and not miss anything. But I think the main focus of this anime was clear from the start that it was simply to entertain their audience and I felt the series accomplished that.Art - 8I was actually surprised at how detailed most of the backgrounds and objects of attention were drawn. Even simple things like a piece of candy, a can of soda, or a sign above a door were nicely animated. Unfortunately I didn\'t really take note of it until I skimmed through the series again. Initially, everything looked and felt the same. Only the first episode had bits of animation that were different from the remainder of the series. Aside from that, the animation wasn’t extraordinary but I suppose it did well to emphasize the everyday atmosphere of the series and bring focus to the characters.The art of the characters themselves were cute. I found Run\'s expressions to be uniquely different from the others but otherwise everyone else had fairly common faces and reactions. What bothered me in the beginning was how young the female teachers looked but it’s to be expected for a moe anime. Eventually I got used to the character design.Sound - 7The OP was very catchy.  It captures the mood of the series very well. The ED is appropriate but not something I found myself listening on repeat. There were also random insert songs in almost all the episodes which did add to emphasize an emotion or experience a character may have been having but I felt they were a little irrelevant and served as animation filler.  Granted I did enjoy listening to some of them particularly in the karaoke episode. Presumably all 4 seiyuus can sing, but an insert song in every episode felt a little unnecessary.Character - 8I had to give this an 8 because the secondary characters really made it worthwhile to watch. Yes the main characters were likable but honestly, the teachers and Tooru\'s classmates made this more enjoyable. Especially Sato-sensei whose character I questioned in the beginning but later came to appreciate. The only thing I had hoped for was more involvement from the male students. Their presence played a small part in revealing personalities but did little to add to the series.Of the 4 main characters Nagi was my favorite next to Run. Her character had a lot of potential with"" hidden talent/beauty"" but the focus was placed more on the other three. Plus her seiyuu Yumi Uchiyama seems new and does not have a following like the others. I thought she did a good job (Kudos to her in ep 7) despite being relatively unknown. The remaining three characters have fairly distinct personalities that are easily identifiable through watching.Enjoyment - 7This was fun to watch although I did stop watching at some later point of the series since other shows were more interesting at the time. I forced myself to finish the series but the last episode I felt was more or less satisfying. By the end of each episode, I found myself in a good mood. It was like an appetizer before watching other anime, or a nice dessert. (If the image fits).Overall - 7It\'s a fairly good series. I felt the side characters were great and occasionally the main cast was fun to watch. Some tunes were catchy although a little excessive. The show presents mostly light-hearted comedy that focuses on friendship and the characters\' everyday happenings in a high school setting.

It reminded me of one of my favorite series, Acchi Kocchi, for various reasons.As you would expect, it's a regular slice of life comedy high school series whose main cast is mainly made out of girls. So the plot is more or less what you'd expect. However, unlike series like Lucky Star and others, A-Channel's ending is a bit more... rewarding, so to say. Not to say that Lucky Star's wasn't rewarding, it's just that it's ending wasn't as 'heavy' than A-Channel's on an emotional standpoint.The characters have nice personalities, and none of them were annoying...in the least, which some animes sometimes end up making by mistake, though not in the comedy ones as far as I know. But I bring this up because of one of the characters. She has a personality that some people could find rather odd and possibly annoying at first, but it isn't at all on the long run. My favorite character was, without a doubt, the main character. Despite being serious, she has many hilarious moments, which I guess makes it the more funny. Though I did not really understand whether she has a crush on her best friend or just cares for her a lot. I guess it's up for interpretation.The music was... okay. It didn't particularly captivate me, but I recognize the songs they showcase as good songs nonetheless. I wouldn't really put them on my phone and listen to them, but maybe they're just not to my taste.The animation and art style were also pretty good overall. Based off a manga series, the art style distinguishes itself from others, though only by a bit, and the animation was pretty good overall. It didn't have super amazing shots, but it was good nonetheless.Personally, I really enjoyed the characters, the comedy, and the moments of friendship between the group. It's kinda like the other series of its genre, but still unique because the characters, some of its best moments, and the ending. I definetly recommend a watch to those who like hilarity surrounding cute girls and are fans of comedy. in the least, which some animes sometimes end up making by mistake, though not in the comedy ones as far as I know.

I thought the series had its ups and downs, which is fine, but why did it wait to the very last episode to be at its absolute finest? I’ll have some thoughts about the finale, mixing in my overall thoughts and observations about the series.That being said, the show didn’t always try to emphasize the slice of life part of the show. Specifically earlier in the season, when the fan service took just as much priority as any character or plot development. It was almost as if they didn’t want to alienate the slice of life fan,...while they also tried to appeal to the fan who wanted to see loli-style girls in school swimsuits and bloomers.Overall, I’ll be sticking with my initial impressions of the show and call it mostly ok. It was sometimes good, but never great, but most important for me, it was always easy to watch.The show looked good, but the color palette and backgrounds always seemed to overwhelm the simple and at times limiting character designs. I mean, how many ways could they animate Run being confused? Not too many, and throughout the entire series she spends about half the time with that same blank eyed (stupefied) look on her face.I would say the same about the voice acting. The main foursome were always ok. I don’t think I ever noticed anything horrid, but at the same time, I can’t remember ever marveling at their performances. In contrast the supporting cast, Kamade and Kitou sensei along with Yutaka were a lot more colorful.The music. If you’ve read any of the previous A-Channel reviews, you know how I felt about the creepy inserted songs throughout the series. The lyrics have always creeped me out. It was as if they were written by a fat 52-year-old otaku describing how high school girls should feel. Creepy! In particular the song while they were cleaning the pool in episode 4. I really imagined the otaku-writer, writing that song while peeping through some middle school fence somewhere in Japan. I still haven’t gotten over it. The authorities should put that guy on the must-watch list.I have always enjoyed the opening song along with the whole opening sequence, but the marketing push of the singer and song title in the OP left me keeping my hand on my wallet. The jokes on them though because there’s no money in there.Ultimately, I’ve enjoyed watching A-Channel, but in an out-of-sight, out-of-mind way, the show will probably fade from my memories. Especially with the new season starting as it always does. This includes the characters themselves, who were done pretty well in the show’s environment, especially my Yuuko-angel, but honestly, they aren’t very memorable.I’ll repeat what I said in the opening line of this post. This finale made me a little mad as it, by itself, lived up to the show’s potential. It’s just too bad it wasn’t completely representative of series as a whole.[Thoughts about final episode removed due to spoilerish tendencies: go to http://moemonster.com/2011/06/24/a-channel-episode-12-finale/ for full unedited review] while they also tried to appeal to the fan who wanted to see loli-style girls in school swimsuits and bloomers.Overall, I’ll be sticking with my initial impressions of the show and call it mostly ok.

In the last week i saw a few other shows. Shows like Hyakko, Ichigo Mashimaro and Kanamemo. Those were some decent shows with cute girls doing cute things but nothing really all that special. Those three shows all had something about them that i didn\'t like or at one point i just got really bored and i had kind of drag myself to finish it. It isn\'t as bad as i make it seem i am just exaggerating. Later i was looking through more shows...and i stumbled upon A-Channel, with a 7.16 average score i was a little bit skeptical. I always try my best to watch things that are 8 or higher. But the art looked really nice so i thought i would give a shot.Man am i pretty glad i decided to pick this up.Story: 8The story of this anime is just 4 cute girls doing cute things. The main thing i was looking for. Other than that there is no story and i am completely okay with that.Art: 9.5One of the things that i absolutely LOVEEEE LOVVEEE LOVEEEEEEEE about this anime is the art style. Many would say it\'s just some simple arts and colors and moe blob Sh*t. My response? JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT. The art makes me feel so calm, it doesnt look all messed up sometimes like with J.C Staff, like their eyes get all screwy or in one scene the character is wearing shoes and the next scene the character is wearing a pair of different shoes. Everything is so simple and clean and it\'s really really nice. Love the art. It\'s not KyoAni but it\'s still amazing. It\'s the simple things in life.Sound: 8I really like the opening of this anime. It\'s so different from other animes. There is this one youtube video named ""Every anime opening ever"" or something along the lines of that that shows what pretty much every single anime opening has in common. Sky shots of birds flying, main characters running, zooming in into a characters eyes, weird shots of the characters naked and looks like their floating, stuff like that. There is none of that. O wait i am supposed to be talking about the sound.There isnt really too much music that stands out in this anime but every thing just fits really well.Oh i should also mention that every single episode has it\'s own Insert song. I think that is pretty damn cool.Character: 8.5 ishI like the characters. They are somewhat cliche\'d but i still like em.Momoki Run: This chick reminds me of the Hirasawa Yui characters. The dumb but funny and cute as F**K. She always has this thing where her eyes turn white with a shady-ish black pencil like outlining. I find that to be incredibly kawaii as F**K. Yui does it sometimes in K-On also. And the way she thinks is just funny.Ichii Tooru: The quiet yet moe loli chick of the bunch. There\'s usually always a loli in every Cute girls doing cute things show. She doesn\'t speak much and her voice is rather low but she gets her message across and she is Loli-Tastic.Tennoujou Nagisa: The supposedly normal one of the group. All her Diet crusades are hilarious as hell. She\'s someone that wants to lose some weight but is the weakest in terms of athletics among the group and is always so easy to eat a lot of sweets. eating two boxes of chocolates while reading a book. WoW!Nishi Yuuko: This is the cliche\'d Scardy cat of the group. She also speaks in Kansai-ben. All of her adventures of being scared are really funny to watch. And always seeing Tooru attack her with crushing hugs near the beginning of the show was real great.Other peeps:Kamate Taki: this teacher is one of the coolest teachers ever. She just doesn\'t give a flying F**K about anything. So chill.Satou Sachiyou: This guy is creepy, he has a forehead fetish and he\'s voiced by Ono Daisuke , who does ALOT of really awkward roles.Run\'s mom: She had a funny scene of bribing her daughter to try harder in school lol.Imai Yukata: She is a creepy Tooru obsessed character but it\'s funny to watch all of her weird antics.Enjoyment and Overall: 8.357238RANDOM23087235This show was really good. It reminded me of K-On in many ways. I am just gonna assume all these bad reviews were because people are comparing this to big successors like K-On or Azumanga. People really should review things based on the anime themselves not comparing it to all these big names. I think A-Channel in itself is a really fun and great anime to watch. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is into Cute girls doing cute things.~Til next timeTomislol and i stumbled upon A-Channel, with a 7.16 average score i was a little bit skeptical. I always try my best to watch things that are 8 or higher. But the art looked really nice so i thought i would give a shot.Man am i pretty glad i decided to pick this up.Story: 8The story of this anime is just 4 cute girls doing cute things. The main thing i was looking for. Other than that there is no story and i am completely okay with that.Art: 9.5One of the things that i absolutely LOVEEEE LOVVEEE LOVEEEEEEEE about this anime is the art style. Many would say it\'s just some simple arts and colors and moe blob Sh*t. My response? JUST THE WAY I LIKE IT. The art makes me feel so calm, it doesnt look all messed up sometimes like with J.C Staff, like their eyes get all screwy or in one scene the character is wearing shoes and the next scene the character is wearing a pair of different shoes. Everything is so simple and clean and it\'s really really nice. Love the art. It\'s not KyoAni but it\'s still amazing. It\'s the simple things in life.Sound: 8I really like the opening of this anime. It\'s so different from other animes. There is this one youtube video named ""Every anime opening ever"" or something along the lines of that that shows what pretty much every single anime opening has in common. Sky shots of birds flying, main characters running, zooming in into a characters eyes, weird shots of the characters naked and looks like their floating, stuff like that. There is none of that. O wait i am supposed to be talking about the sound.There isnt really too much music that stands out in this anime but every thing just fits really well.Oh i should also mention that every single episode has it\'s own Insert song. I think that is pretty damn cool.Character: 8.5 ishI like the characters. They are somewhat cliche\'d but i still like em.Momoki Run: This chick reminds me of the Hirasawa Yui characters. The dumb but funny and cute as F**K. She always has this thing where her eyes turn white with a shady-ish black pencil like outlining. I find that to be incredibly kawaii as F**K. Yui does it sometimes in K-On also. And the way she thinks is just funny.Ichii Tooru: The quiet yet moe loli chick of the bunch.

I definitely recommend this to anyone who is into Cute girls doing cute things.~Til next timeTomislol', ""Welcome to another Robert's Too Late Reviews! Today we're working from the subbed version. Let me say right off, if explosions or fights or violence is your cup of tea, then move on, you will find nothing to like here. If you do like slice-of-life shows, cute girls doing cute things, and don't mind the stereotypical episode format, you might just have a good time! Let's see if we should change the channel.Story: 6It's hard to really rank a slice-of-life show for story since most of it is usually episodic events happening about everyday life, and there's not usually an overarching theme. A-Channel fits...this to a tee. We have the beach episode, the Christmas episode, some antics at school episodes, the same old thing as we've all seen a million times. That is not to say that the series doesn't pull it off, it's just not a cohesive and compelling narrative existing from episode to the next.Because we do have such cliched events such as pool cleaning day or the festival show, it does seem like a slightly annoying retread on a trope so many anime have used. I give it a lower score because we've seen most of it before, and I think it would really be nice if they expanded a little on the premise. A-Channel comes a little closer, having the girls sneak into school after hours only to be frightened by the school nurse who they believe at first to be a ghost.Partly because that kind of story telling is the primary nature of the slice-of-life genre, and because they do pull it off without being eye-rollingly bothersome, I didn't give it a negative rating, just slightly above average. Just know that pretty much every 'checklist' show is presented, even though this series is really short at 12 episodes.Art: 8I really liked the way everyone was drawn, Tooru really stands out, with her blank-to-possibly-pissed stare, and her soul piercing gaze. The rest of the cast is appropriately cute, though there are moment when proportions and body parts are drawn at odd angles, but they are not overly noticeable. The backgrounds all look fine, and the colors are pleasing to the eye.Sound: 8They really nailed it in the voice acting. Tooru sounds like the weird, kinda creepy girl she is. The oblivious one is completely clueless sounding. The easily scared girl has plenty of trembling in her voice, and the girl that torments her pulls off an impressive evil laugh. The background music is never intrusive, and the themes, while not overly catchy, are perfect in conveying the type of show you're about to watch.Character: 8The girls are obviously what makes up the entire show, and without them having proper synergy, it would all fall apart in a hurry. We are saved from this, however, by a cast that seems built to be each other's friends. The oblivious one is a complete dunderhead, never noticing when those around her might not have a healthy interest in her. However she is saved by the year younger Tooru, who is quick to threaten violence to any that would bother her beloved Run-chan. In fact, her devotion seems so complete that I would say it borders on mid-level yuri.Tooru is in fact often jealous of the other two girls in the group with Run-Chan because they are all in the same grade, and she's a year younger. She comes to begrudgingly accept the other girls, though the impending question of college and them leaving school before her is often present.There is the statuesque model-level cute girl who Tooru despises at first, but comes to develop and wonderful, if not strange, bond with. This girl is easily frightened, and the final girl of the quartet, a smart girl in glasses, uses this to her advantage as much as possible. Otherwise this girl is stately, cute and as fun as they come.The glasses girl is obsessed over her weight, when she's not scaring the model or dealing with the fallout of another of Run-chan's clueless actions. She isn't the main character, but seem to be the leader of the little group, and is quick to offer her opinion, or obscure information no one else knows.With these four primary girls, the absentminded Run-chan stumbling into trouble, the young but clearly crushing on Run-chan Tooru always moves to protect Run-chan's best interests. Couple them with a honest pretty girl, and a devious nerd like girl, and you have the perfect mix of hijinx. The cast doesn't carry quite as much chemistry as shows such as Kiniro Mosaic, but it's pretty dang close.Enjoyment: 8I loved this show because it's light, fun, airy, and doesn't require me to think or trigger intense emotions in me like a heavy drama or battle shounen does. It was something to watch and relax, and have a good laugh at. Even with the cliches it's funny, but doesn't take itself too seriously. Just some nice, simple fun.Best Girl: Tooru for sure! Not only is she so tiny her clothes don't fit her, she's got the big girl crush on Run-chan and even busted out a baseball bat a few different times guys tried to talk to Run-chan. She also has this creepy stare, and while it's hard for her to open up, she's a good girl at heart.There you have it. If you like some comedy, without thinking too hard, and would like to watch something relaxing, A-Channel might just be for you. I found it a wonderful break from some of the more emotionally weighty shows I often watch. It's not the greatest out there, but it's still pretty good, and I don't regret for a second watching it. Jump in there, you might the channel you've been looking for! this to a tee.

Jump in there, you might the channel you've been looking for!"", ""A Channel is simply a channel featuring the daily lives of four fairly-ordinary girls. This is a fairly ordinary slice-of-life story (strongly contrasting with Nichijou, which is still ongoing as of this review). In terms of animation, this can be likened to a mix of K-on and Lucky Star. In terms of plot and characters, probably more likened to Minami Ke. All in all, it's a fairly average show, though I don't know why it is tagged as seinen, if anything, there are yuri undertones.This is a straight slice of life series. There is no significant focus on romance, action, mystery, etc. In fact, if...you're looking for something with just a continuous plot you should look elsewhere. If you're looking to kill time watching moe/yuri girls interact then this is your series. Take this review with a grain of salt as I wasn't a huge fan of either Lucky Star, Hyakko, or K-on.Animation:Animation is a bit of a mixed bag here. The primary characters' styling is cute if a bit thin. Backgrounds are a mix between really nice drawings and cartoony scenery either consisting of simple solid colors or even occasionally crayon-styled sketches. While these scenes serve a purpose (when you're in a character's thoughts), I still don't like the extensive use. As this is a pure slice of life, there isn't too much action, there is no blood/gore, and there is no ecchi (come on the cast is practically all-girl). There is a lot of girls talking; yes, a lot of mouths move, occasionally the bodies will as well.Sound:The OP is light, which fits with the series well; though I personally like more energetic or peaceful pieces. The ED is even more fluffy than the OP, the track almost remind me of Raison d'etre from Chobits; though being a Rie Tanaka fan I have to say the latter is much better. The BGM is likewise very light and very mixed with guitars, harmonicas, and pianos. A unique feature of this series is the use of group insert songs, which remind me of television programming for toddlers. I really loathed these.The entire purpose of this show is having the girls talk to each other and the VAs do a great job fitting a voice to the character personalities. Run sounds as ditzy as she acts and Minako Kotobuki does a great job giving Yuuko an accent (see if you can notice it).Story:The story consists of girls doing stuff such as interacting at school, interacting at a local diner, interacting while shopping, and interacting in general. The series are purely episodic, the only thing to give a continuity to the ordering is the passing of the seasons. There really isn't much of an underlying plot as the focus is purely on the characters. There might have been one or two comedic moments but I'm senses are still probably recovering from the overload that is Nichijou.Character:Each of the four girls has a unique, and very distinguishing personality. The majority of the enjoyment in this series will derive from how these personalities interact. What is a bit confusing is the somewhat yuri behavior Touru displays towards the clueless Run. While it is true that you get a lot of character interaction, you don't really get any development. The characters start as friends, occasionally get into minor quarrels, and then end up as, well, friends.Value:While I could try to embellish a description by saying this series shows the greatness of friendship, it doesn't even do quite that.Minami-ke, Hyakko, Lucky Star, and K-On all distinguish themselves in very clear ways (see those reviews for details). However, I can't find what distinguishes this series other than its impeccable ability to not have any tension. It's simply a show about hanging out and having a good time. you're looking for something with just a continuous plot you should look elsewhere.

The easily digestible stories and simple character archetypes are easy works for companies to do, since less has to be invested monetarily for SoL shows. I often attribute the explosion in popularity with ""Azumanga Daioh"", which is considered by many to be the gold standard for SoL, myself included. It paved the way for other popular shows of its ilk like ""Lucky Star"", ""Hidamari Sketch"", and of course the ever beloved ""K-On!"".Because of just how common the genre is these days, very few shows get to stick out from the crowd, and are...often forgotten, no matter what their quality. And ""A Channel"" is unfortunately one of those shows, often being overlooked and overshadowed by other SoL anime. And that\'s a shame really, because I think that ""A Channel"" is a real gem that should be given the attention I feel it deserves.--Story: 6""A Channel"" story is your bog standard high school SoL. You follow the adventures of four (as always) girls as they spend their days in high school, having silly escapades as they interact with each other on a day to day basis.The story is nothing different from any others like it that you\'ve seen. There no real overarching plot to speak of, just smaller stories that happen each episode. One point though that I\'ll mention is that it\'s similar in a way to ""Azumanga Daioh"" in that the story is not frozen in time as it were. What I mean is that the characters aren\'t permanently in high school over the shows run, like many other SoL. Instead, the show goes over the course of one year. It\'s a nice little change of pace that I appreciate.Overall, I\'d say that the story, while nice and simple, is nothing all to special in the end.--Art: 9The art style of this show reminds me quite a bit of ""K-On!"". Not because the styles are the same, in fact the art style itself is much different from ""K-On!""\'s. More-so, it reminds me of it because of how the animation moves. It\'s very smooth and detailed, but no distractedly so. It\'s very clear to me that ""A Channel"" had a little more to its budget than other shows like it, allowing to get this good animation.As for the character designs, I actually like them quite a bit. They feel distinct from other character designs in other shows, with unique hair styles for all our mains, and even different eye designs, that give you an idea of the type of character they are. For instance, Yuuko has long straight black hair and tall sharp eyes, giving the air of being prim and proper; Run on the other hand has shorter blond hair with an ahoge, and large round eyes, showing that she\'s the more innocent and naive one. These designs are very nice and easy on the eyes, and help the make the show stick out more.--Sound: 8Overall, music for this is enjoyable. There aren\'t any standout songs with the exception of the theme, Morning Arch, which is a beautiful little peaceful melody. Otherwise, the background music is fairly standard stuff.The voice acting for the show is very good, enjoyably easy on the ears and sounding very natural. The show is only in Japanese, no English dub.--Character: 8Where I think ""A Channel"" really shines is in its characters. Each of the mains has a unique personality that makes them stick out from each other; Run is the clumsy and naive but sweet one, Yuuko is proper and classy but can be hopelessly scared silly, Nagi is the studious and smartest one, and Tooru is the best friend of Run and is incredibly overprotective of her. Each of their interactions with each other are fun to watch and feel like how real teenage girls would interact with each other.When it comes to the side characters, they also have unique personalities, at least for the different teachers. They provide humorous comic relief moments in-between the stories that our mains find themselves in.--Enjoyment: 9I very much enjoyed my time with ""A Channel"". Following these four girls through their year in high school was fun to watch, as each of them play off of each other so well. It was a joy to watch as well.--Overall: 8""A Channel"" is a show that just wants you to sit back and have a good time with the characters.  It\'s a shame that it\'s been so overlooked, because I feel that it\'s one of those shows that you can enjoy no matter who you are.Is it unique compared to any other SoL? Of course not, but its not attempting to be. Instead, it takes those standard stories and plays with them through fun characters and a beautiful art style.

Would not recommend for anyone who hasn't watched over 100+ animes (as there are many better).For the bad points of this anime, it would mostly be the humour wasn't good enough I quote enjoyed its type if dumb humour but it's not for everyone.For good points, it's an anime you don't need to be invested in no desire to binge-watch due to this you can watch...whilst working or just doing something else these types of anime aren't that common but this ticks that box.Overall it's a 5 I cannit say its a 'Bad' anime but I can't say it is a 'good' one either. whilst working or just doing something else these types of anime aren't that common but this ticks that box.Overall it's a 5 I cannit say its a 'Bad' anime but I can't say it is a 'good' one either."", ""Okay, so I don't really watch slice of life series that much because the ones I have watched always felt like the same kind of story and were pretty boring. This one is different. It's a very wholesome series with some great comedy elements, good characters and the music is upbeat and cute. It doesn't necessarily have a story line but is entertaining enough watching the main group of go about their experiences during and outside of high school. The supporting cast is great too and has some good moments too. I absolutely love the art style of this series and definitely defines the words...moé and kawaii. It also has a very catchy upbeat opening which has forever made a spot on my karaoke playlist. XD moé and kawaii. It also has a very catchy upbeat opening which has forever made a spot on my karaoke playlist. XD"", ""It was abit fun, watching the behavior of those four cute girls. Every episode feels unique by me for every scenes they want, to visualize the activity of those fours. The uniqueness of each character is so thick felt in each episode, and i think they did this in nice pace and good flow of story. Not too rushed tho, and it show more or less as a fun watch. Unfortunately, I still feel a little lacking in peeling the other side of some characters.Like Yuuko and Nagi-chan, they had fewer portions of the story then from Tooru and of course from the innocent...girls, Run-cwhan. I somehow feels sad looking at 11 and 12 episodes, like Toorus feel, the time has really tick so fast like burry every good thing appear in this show. But, Run and the others never changed, so i expect more funny thing happen in the next future, yet for the other OVAs i surely watch it the next attempt. 8 shall be enough to complete my feeling for these show. Not much for me, but its always nice score referring how low overall score this show had, which is sometime irritate me.This show sure was at the average level, i mean in the 6 or 7 level of score shall be enough for the whole series. However, my mind still positive to give this show more vibes. So thats why, i respectively giving away my 8 for hoping these SoL comedy get more attention in the future. Let see how your idiotically movement got you by the end of OVA, my girl Run-cwhan. And ofc, my sweet Yuuko and Nagi awkward moments always be my best in this show. Then, for Tooru, dont be sad, girl. You had best friend like Miporin and Yutuka! They will give you smile till your end, right? Funny i remembering some character and name here to another show, i somehow wanna give the recommendations toward that show. Haha.Ok, its over. The joke and comedy nice enough for my level of enjoyment. The story steer in the nice attempt too, to make the feel at the normal pace to get every detailing story as smooth as possible. Till the 10, the pace feels ok, 11 to 12 episodes get too rushed, so 8 points shall be enough level for showing my gratitude.Sounds and art feels okay to me. 7 points for that. For the characterization goes to 9, since i like so much for Run personality being too clumsy. As for the overall enjoyment, 8 must be too good for me as respect for the SoL comedy genres union.

The anime has a little bit of slice of life and a lot of comedy, and in addition, some musical scenes.1 - Story [5/10] - History is certainly not a point to focus on A-channel, the reason is that there is nothing very developed from beginning to end, but believe me, there are other strengths.2 - Art [7/10] - A-channel had almost no problems related to animation, these types of anime do not require much, however, this anime has a pleasant quality, or better, above average.3 - Sound [7/10] - As I said...before, this anime has some music scenes, but I can't say that it is a strong point of the anime, I found it very basic, as if it were some complement. Now the opening no longer says the same, these animes never present a very striking opening in my opinion, however, the opening of a-channel is very good, it is that type of opening that you will always want to watch when the anime starts.4 - Characters [9/10] - These animes always feature striking characters and even some that become favorites, a-channel is not much different, their characters have cute designs and are very charismatic (Teachers are the best!).5 - Enjoyment [8/10] - This category should always be considered for these types of anime. Comedy is the central point of entertainment for A-channel, they managed to do something very good, but not in all episodes ... Some episodes were a little boring, the theme of some were not very interesting and some jokes even went unnoticed, however, this does not mean that A-channel is boring. Most of the time you will have some good laughs with the protagonists, one of the strengths of the anime.Overral [7/10] - The anime had great scenes that made me laugh, a comfortable soundtrack and a nice opening to watch, however, A-channel had some problems that hindered my experience, such as the scenes of musicals that were not so fun to watch, besides, some parts were not very funny ... So, this anime is still a good reference in the school comedy theme, I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes the style. before, this anime has some music scenes, but I can't say that it is a strong point of the anime, I found it very basic, as if it were some complement.

On many counts, it delivers, but on so many others, it falls short. As a result, this is one of the weakest slice-of-lifes to come in a long time. The main problem I found was that the show wasn\'t particularly funny, although billing itself as a ""comedy"". It was indeed cute girls doing cute things, but not with as much substance as, say, Hidamari Sketch or GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class. However, the show definitely has its moments, mainly in the form of...Run-chan. The moment where she bites her tongue and can\'t talk is priceless, and her interactions with the people around her are the primary reason to watch. Recommended for fans of Lucky Star, Hidamari Sketch, GA, Minami-ke, YuruYuri, or any other cute girl show. Run-chan.

However, after marathoning the series, I can safely say that my high expectations were hit with a swift kick of reality. A-Channel is basically Lucky Star…except without the cute characters and the comedy.To start, the art style is only mediocre. The art style is often the driving point of any slice of life anime. Even with horrible writing and a cliche plot, at least the characters are cute and moe, right? WRONG. Every character in A-Channel looks the same, which...makes it impossible for you to appreciate the characters when they’re all the same with one differentiating trait. The only character who stood out for me was Tooru. At least her protectiveness of Run gave some flavor to the plot. Otherwise, all filler. There were so many cliche scenarios in this anime that it could be presented as an example of episode plots to avoid when creating a slice of life anime.Additionally, it was impossible to avoid being bored while watching this anime. It made me cringe seeing how hard they were trying to come off as funny and relatable. There were a very select few scenes that I actually found funny. The opening scene where Tooru was warding off a bunch of boys with a bat was one of the few redeemable parts of this anime! It gave us all high expectations, hoping for something different. However, all we found was meaningless schlock with tons of unnecessary fanservice and cliches.A-Channel wanted to be Lucky Star.

Also, if I don't make sense in some instances while writing this, my bad, I'll get you some cola to compensate.Referring to MAL's ratings, 7 is good, and 7 is what I'm satisfied with. A-Channel was pretty good. Some ups and downs but its quite a fine anime. The loli girls are flourishing with personalities and looks, especially Yuuko. Again, let us make this review short and non-eye straining.A-Channel's basis is literally in the view of four girls (Run, Tooru, Yuuko, and Nagisa) and their daily lives together, with Tooru being quite...a protective one. All I managed to grab from this was a slice of life, comedy vibe. The story didn't resonate with me that much, but it wasn't bad at all.The art in A-Channel is quite different from others. The way they are drawn/animated is definitely something. The loli appearances and the big ol' bug eyes is what makes the art shine for me.Once again sound is sound, but I guess it was unique for them to include little music segments in each episode as it provided a comfortable atmosphere. The opening and endings were normal.The characters in A-Channel weren't the most special and one of a kind, but they did seem to bring some different things into the equation. We have all types of life ranging from the cool klutz, yandere/kuudere, the cute/shy/fearful girl, and the happy/cheerful girl. A-Channel is definitely something.A-Channel wasn't the most enjoyable due to it being a slice of life primarily. However, there were some parts that touched my heart in many ways. I'm more in the neutral position, but slowly shifting into in the positive range with my enjoyment opinion.In the end, A-Channel is good. There is a little bit of everything in here, from the comedy moments to the scary moments.

The art style isn't particularly pleasing. Some of the animation can look choppy.Every episode has an insert song which is usually just played over stills and they usually feel out of place. While I'm on sound, I'd like to know who decided playing hokey pokey for background music was a good idea.There isn't a great story, so you rely on characters and comedy to drive your...show. The comedy is seriously lacking and I couldn't crack a grin at the antics.And for characters unfortunately we have one kind of half fleshed out dandere-ish character surrounded by the rest of the bits and pieces main cast and two supporting characters that are more interesting than the main cast themselves.Two of the main cast are worse versions of characters in K-On! and the other one is so forgettable and has little to no bearing on anything that happens, as if they just needed her to be there so they can have the 4 girl standard.

"", ""There were some fun moments, to be sure, but on the whole I felt like someone took a stock-standard slice-of-life template, but forgot to actually fill it with anything. If you wrote a few-sentence synopsis of this whole series without any names, it could be confused with any other slice-of-life, since there's nothing in this one that makes it different. It felt so much like just a blank template that I actually started thinking about how you could kind of view 25% of all anime as being the same characters stuck in some horrible purgatory shaped like a Tokyo high school, where every 3 years...they get a slightly different body and have to start over again. And I usually *like* slice-of-life...I liked the character designs, and there were some good ideas with the characters' backgrounds/personalities, though not much is done with it.

It\'s funny how a show like this can have absolutely no defining story, but still be entertaining. As with many shows like this (K-On!, Lucky Star) there seems to be a big trend around the ""four girls going about their high school lives."" And While this could get old, I honestly think that if you implement good characters, even when there\'s no defining story, you can really make something worth the while. A-Channel doesn\'t really have a ""story"" but I can definitely say that it has some pretty good moments that made me laugh.You know after watching so...many anime you start to see how art-styles in anime can fluctuate, and how it can be more or less the same.

The sound isn\'t anything special either, but the OP is kinda catchy.Now the characters.

This review is for my future self but you guys could also use this if u wantHello once again future me! I see you are interested in A-Channel.Story : 6The story is quite good but not at all original and sometimes over-used. I mean come on! It\'s another daily life of a bunch of high-school girls. But I do have to say that sometimes it could get quite funny with some of its quirks. Sadly, I dropped it because it was kind of repetitive since there wasn\'t anything new happening or no progression.Art : 8There\'s not much to say about the art....It\'s isnt bad, but it isn\'t the too awesome as well. Although, the character designs are quite nice and simple, which fits the anime pretty good. The animation is also pretty okay. Nothing too special though.Sound : 8It has a pretty neat soundtrack that goes well with the anime. It isn\'t something that you\'d like to listen to when you\'re in your car doing nothing else (unless you\'re driving). The sound effects are also pretty good and the voice acting is superb. I can safely say that the voice acting makes the characters more alive. It\'s probably one of the reasons why I continued to watch it.Character : 9The characters are all unique (sort of) and all very fun in their own way. I can\'t really describe much except for their traits and all that other stuff. I would have to say that the characters are really what makes this anime alive.Enjoyment : 7Sadly, because of the poor story, and because of no progression and basically no conflict or anything at all (I mean at-least K-On has one) it has damaged this ""could of been"" great anime. It is pretty enlightening at first, but when you reach episode 6, it kinds of gets boring and repetitive.Overall : 7.6 / 8It had lots of potential, since it had very interesting characters but sadly, we were given with a pretty cliche story.

After watching a variety of shows with a wide range of themes and differing levels of seriousness it was a wonder to experience such a well handled show that was capable of remaining consistent in tone and atmosphere without demanding anything of me as a viewer.While there is a lack of plot in this series, this is no issue. In fact, I believe it will be the thing that pulls many in to the show. By lacking an overarching plot, the concept of living in the moment, which is fundamental to the slice of life genre, is captured...in an easily consumable and highly enjoyable manner. With each episode being relatively self contained, every episode tries to immerse you in the lives of the characters, and I think the rest of the details within the series help with this.The art is solid and the show has a clear identity within the collection of anime I have watched. It is simple and bright and refreshing. The characters are not as flat in terms of development as I was expecting, and I came to learn more about them and their personalities than originally thought. Even so, both of these details were kept to a level of simplicity that allowed me to relax at all times. The consistency here is what helped me appreciate the actions of the characters the most, as they were inevitably highlighted by the subtle and lovely nature of the writing and art.The soundtrack is wonderful, and at all points fits the mood of the show. I consider it perhaps the strongest point of the show, especially with the opener being so exciting and upbeat. To tag alongside that, each episode has its own song built into it, and they all allow you to soak in whatever concept that episode is trying to present. It quickly becomes the high point of each episode, something to truly look forward to, and after they always find a smooth and steady approach to the end after that continues to captivate.Overall I consider the experience a worthwhile one. My preferred genre of story is certainly not the slice of life style, but I will never regret a second of watching this show. Every moment was worth my time, even if it never really blew me away. This is a series for anyone who simply wants to enjoy a short and sweet show. I can safely recommend it to almost anyone for a great time all around. in an easily consumable and highly enjoyable manner.

For someone who enjoys Slice of Life and School Life, I would suggest you find something else other than this. The Comedy is mediocre and the pacing is quite slow.

It probably would have taken me well over a year to get through it all if...I didn't get 5 smackeroos out of it.the thing that makes these shows actually good are the characters, if the high school girls in your high school girls show aren't silly and funny and quirked up and retarded then I don't think it's very good. see the thing about the characters in this show is that two of them are just lines moving on the screen. Yuuko Nishi is the boob girl and they make like two or three jokes about her boobs and those are her defining character moments and that's all I can remember, I had to copy paste her name from the character profile on this website.

Yuuko Nishi is the boob girl and they make like two or three jokes about her boobs and those are her defining character moments and that's all I can remember, I had to copy paste her name from the character profile on this website.

However, enjoyment often comes from the charming character interactions, lighthearted humor, and the overall feel-good atmosphere rather than unexpected twists.The art style is bright, colorful, and generally fitting for its genre. It complements the lighthearted nature of the series :3While the characters are not exceptionally complex, they are well-rounded in the context of a comedy. Each character has distinct personality traits, quirks, and dynamics that contribute to the overall comedic and ""heartwarming"" tone of the series.Enjoyable,...but not new. but not new.']"
Bouken Ou Beet,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8/Bouken_Ou_Beet,"['What can I say about Beet the Vandel Buster? Its set in a world where humans and demons exist, its kinda like watching a RPG, I think that would be the best way to describe it. Mainly due to the reward systems they have inplace and the leveling system as well, so yeha its kinda like watching a rpg. which is kinda fun and saves you the time of having to question every character and searching high and low of items and spending hours leveling up.Beet is the brother of Zenon, who was a famed vandal buster who was the leader of another 4 busters,...each having their own unique weapons known as Saiga which is a part of the wielders soul.Beet due to to his immatureness causes the Zenon squad to perish in order to save Beet, and in the end inherits all 5 Saigas from the squad.Beet is on a mission to rid the world of the vancals and to get revenge for the death of zenon by killing the tragic king.Overall this anime is good it was average at first, but when you get into the story abit more then you kinda get hooked and you just enjoy it more and more. each having their own unique weapons known as Saiga which is a part of the wielders soul.Beet due to to his immatureness causes the Zenon squad to perish in order to save Beet, and in the end inherits all 5 Saigas from the squad.Beet is on a mission to rid the world of the vancals and to get revenge for the death of zenon by killing the tragic king.Overall this anime is good it was average at first, but when you get into the story abit more then you kinda get hooked and you just enjoy it more and more.', ""There was just something about Beet that didn’t work. While there were plenty of cool bits and interesting characters (as well as a world setup I thought to be quite novel) it just didn’t seem to gel for me. Perhaps it was the sheer scope of the story and the (correct) feeling one gets that it’s just not going to be fully addressed. By the end of the first series (52 episodes) we've only really seen the coming together of four out of what looks to be a five man team and the series cuts off right in the middle. But apart from that there's...something that just doesn’t work for me, something that I find rather hard to put my finger on. This is still worth a watch, because if it works for you there’s plenty there and even if it isn’t it may be worth watching the first five or so episodes just for the novelty value of the world setup and the Vandel designs. I'm hoping that the sequel to this (Beet the Vandel Buster: Excellion) will manage to draw out and sustain the high points of the series. something that just doesn’t work for me, something that I find rather hard to put my finger on.

The anime series covers what id like to call the Grunide saga in the manga. The story itself is not new at all its a generic shonen type story, that does not mean its bad it just means that its not something that will blow your mind away.Story- fair (6),The art during the main story is okay, its good enough to convey the plot, however sometimes character faces and bodies seem off. The filler episodes at the end show this blemish.Art- fair (6)One thing i can gladly say that is great about...this anime is the sound more importantly the back ground music, the music is fully composed and beautifully orchestrated. The only thing not making it outstanding is that the music is somewhat overused and the opening and ending themes are horrible.Sound- great (9)The characters are run of the mill shonen, you got the hero,the love interest, the one for the fan-girls and the obvious fan service character. What i like though is that Beet is not entirely an idiot like other shonen characters, though he has his moments he acts like any 15 year old would and actually becomes serious when he needs to, really the only time he is an idiot is during the filler. The Jiiku warriors are characters not in the manga, and they are decent as well, i totally believed them to be full characters before i found out they were not in the manga. The vandels or ''bad guys'' are not just crazy evil people, they have emotions and let the viewer actually care, for the most part.Character- good (7)Now if you're in to shonen anime you will like this, if you want something deep you may not, but don't count it out, some parts of the anime are really intense and the anime is directed intelligently.Enjoyment- good (7)Overall this anime does not bring much new to the table of shonen but it it is still a good anime to check out, it wont change your view of life but you will enjoy this anime.

It\'s about adventurers killing demons, gaining strength and levels. Enemies have star levels, hunters a.k.a busters gain levels from doing various thing. in a sense it gave a feeling of mmorpg. Party up, level skills, get exp, get levels, get money. It was a nice touch.The main characters main goal is to pretty much, cleanse the world. Main characters consist of 3...people. Beet the ""dumb"" yet straightforward boy with ability fo maintain multiple weapons. (which was nice concept, haven\'t seen many Anime where character manages multiple different type of weapons), then we got Poala the girl who gets angry easily and has to maintain Beet all the time. The violent tsuntsun. 3rd guy shows up later but to avoid spoiling all I can say regarding him that he is the intelligence type\'ish.I did really enjoy music and soundtrack in this one. Well was fun and pleasant to listen to.Overall the anime was straightforward battle shounen. It seems one of those anime that you normally won\'t find. I personally popped onto this one because saw in the ""Recent Friend Updates"", where someone added it into plantowatch.

I know I was.In this movie, Shinchan and his family have to go back in time to help Fubukimaru save his (her?) sister from a deviant time traveler. Because of this, the movie deviates early on  from the usual scatological humor of the tv show into an epic samurai action flick, with Shinchan mostly along for the ride.Don't be turned off by the art style. The lack of details in the characters allows for a fluidity of animation that is...rarely seen in anime movies.The movie starts off slow, but the middle of the movie in particular is one extended castle-raid, which is one of the best action scene I've ever seen in anime.And just as you think everything is over, a twist reveals that time travel is much more complicated than you think. The future scenes have zany architecture reminiscent of Tekkon Kinkreet. The sight of a fuedal castle turning into a battle robot is wacky and awesome at the same time.The movie drags on rather long, and ShinChan's juvenile humour never did make me laugh that much (then again, I am not the target audience) , but if you liked Castle of Cagliostro, or Samurai swordfights, check out this movie.

Anne Happy♪,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31080/Anne_Happy♪,"[""-FULL FINAL REVIEW-It’s been quite a while since Gochiusa, Kiniro Mosaic and Yuru Yuri had aired. We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class??

You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song.

Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year!', 'Are you the type that feels a sharp pain in the chest when someone madly adorable and incredibly innocent gets hurt? If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer. heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10.', ""This anime is a 10 because of that op movie, just the cutest thing i've seen in years.Even if you don't really think the op movie is that good the anime is hilarous/cute nonetheless, a good enjoyable anime.Now, I've gotta write a longer review but i don't know how to, so i'm just gonna say that Hibarigaoka Ruri is my new Waifu (even more than Kuroneko from oreimo).Just how long is a review gotta be!? Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.

It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch."", ""I have to say that before watching this anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life.

Botan is you could say the rich girl of the anime she doesnt act like that thought shes pretty friendly but she tends too get injured alot. Hibiki is another person who is a bit of a tsundere but her problem is that she has NO sense of directions whatsoever making her get lost super easy. Ren problem (if you can even call it a problem) its basically where females (of any kind) adore her or will help her no matter what happens also that she tends too sleep alotEnjoyment: now if there is anything bad about this I would say that the jokes with the girls did kinda get old after awhile but for me i still found this anime hella funny and enjoyable too watch for sureOverall: giving this a 8 even though the jokes with them got old the comedy was just TOO good for me not too give this a 8 id recommend this anime An is a happy girl but she and also her mom have bad luck (luck very bad luck) and animals hate them alot.

Filled with humour, and funny moments, it's one of those anime's that will draw you in. In my opinion the series, could have had a bit more going on to explain the full extent of the story, but I would...say that is mainly the only minus to this series.

If you want an elaborated plot or even a basic story, go look somewhere else. The premise is quite interesting: a famous school that has a class for unlucky students. In Danganronpa logic, this is a class full of ultimate unlucky students. Although it has caught my interest, the plot never goes any further. They hint some developments that never do happen.

Both art and sound side. Opening was nice, everything else was good enough.✦CharacterAs mentioned at story. Plenty of stereotypes focused on clumsy, unlucky and so on characters.

I seriously couldn\'t figure out at the start whenever it was literal or symbolism...✦Enjoyment & OverallUnlucky oddballs in a odd school doing cute things. Sums it up.

But if you are looking for an anime just to hang out, if it is for you.Anne Happy is an anime that goes through the life of those who see it without glory or pain, it is only to laugh the odd bit.Anne Happy has several negative aspects, but I will only limit myself to saying that the weakest are her characters. OMG, but 3 of its 5 main characters are very bad:- Hibari: A girl who is in love with a factory sign, ridiculous.- Botan: The mangaka should have left this...character on his stretcher to recover his health ... Definitely Botan is a boring character, that to be a main character in a comedy anime has nothing funny, well, he tries but it goes wrong.- Hibiki: An annoying girl period.I don\'t have much to say about the positive aspects of this anime, because there are few. Hanako is cute and funny occurrences happen to her; Ren doesn\'t stand out much but with her apathy, laziness, and subtle sarcasm she\'s fun to watch ...But DEFINITELY the best thing about this anime is Timothy the bunny, but what a funny rabbit !! Not to mention when Timothy and Hibari were being chased by cats and Timothy decided to confront them to end up flying through the air, how funny !!! And when he made his appearance at Karaoke and sang Timothy\'s Rap hahahaha really funny!To leave some phrases that I took from this anime:""Don\'t complain after running straight into danger."" Ren""With a happy ending there is no sad beginning."" Anne Happy character on his stretcher to recover his health ...

Simply put, it wasn\'t very good.The main reason I picked this up and sat through 12 episodes is that I was very intrigued by the premise. The characters are all uniquely unlucky (luck is a major theme in the show). They are all enrolled in what is known as ""happiness class,"" where you learn to be happy (despite one\'s misfortune). I really liked this premise and thought it had potential.I quickly realized the poor quality of the show, and mainly watched it as a low priority ""filler"" anime for when I was too tired and just...wanted to stare at a screen but not watch anything I actually cared about. I also would put it on when in a depressed mood to try to immerse myself in the happiness class setting.Anyway, the reality of the show is that it is extremely unfunny. Unfortunately the screentime is dominated by low-quality comedy. The characters themselves and their interactions are all lame. The art style is lame. The OST is lame. The production quality isn\'t terrible or anything, it\'s just that the content fundamentally isn\'t good.The positive:Some might find the absurdist aspects of the show funny or entertaining. The character designs are kind of cute (though lacking in variety).5/10. Wouldn\'t recommend unless you\'re obsessed with SOL comedies. wanted to stare at a screen but not watch anything I actually cared about.

I\'ve seen quite a few CGDCT anime and this one was a unique one. First off, we have a character who unfortunately has ""bad luck"" and this bad luck would get them constantly bombarded with unfortunate events such as falling on the street and miraculously ending up in a river which made no sense at all, getting trampled by animals and constantly losing their belongings. This character kinda reminded me of Momoki Run from A-Channel, due to her airheadedness and that funny voice she has. I found it surprising that her VA has such a vocal range...because of her roles in other series where it is a complete 180 to what I heard in this anime. To continue, we have another character who is ROMANTICALLY in love with a construction man cut out and would be like horny or something whenever they pass by a construction site and there would be the cut out of the man holding a sign saying something like do not enter. It was weird. Another character (funniest in my opinion), has a misfortune called poor health, and you guessed it, they would have poor health, but it would range from so many different types of health-related problems such as fatigue from doing simple physical activities like walking, lightheadedness from low oxygen intake and getting fevers at night while sleeping. I found this character funny because there would be random moments where they are walking and all of a sudden they break a bone in their foot or legs and they would collapse randomly while walking to school. My favourite was when they were brushing their teeth in the morning and it is up to your imagination what happened considering how they broke bones while walking. Other characters had misfortunes such as attracting all female creatures, having a bad sense of direction and getting lost when they are literally told to go this path and they just randomly go on the other path as if they completely ignored what the hell they were just told.Overall, I reviewed this anime, which I rarely do, out of pure enjoyment and found that this was a different one out of the CGDCT animes I\'ve seen. Art, soundtracks and characters were okay, nothing special and there is little story considering this is a slice of life and comedy. because of her roles in other series where it is a complete 180 to what I heard in this anime.

I liked that the show dipped its toes in different genres in parody, such as VR isekai, magical girls, mecha and a very ""Corpse Party""-esque episode, though it\'s not quite a parody. Which leaves some untapped potential.With the anime lacking a continuation, it leaves a lot of questions unnanswered and I...wouldn\'t recommend it to someone looking for a complete slice of life. Anne Happy traipses back and forth with being an episodic slice of life to trying to have some overarching plot threads (regarding late characters and the school\'s intentions) that leave you disappointed without a conclusion within the material.If I were to recommend Anne Happy, the manga would be your best bet if you want the full story (I assume these plot threads are resolved there), or watch the anime if you honestly don\'t mind.I can see and understand the appeal, and if you really want a cute show with silly girls doing silly things then this is a show for you. wouldn\'t recommend it to someone looking for a complete slice of life.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.

Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy.', 'If somebody managed to get the Timothy rap out of their head, please tell me how.Story:Slice of Life comedy of the cute girls doing cute things variety, so basically something we\'ve all seen a million times before. While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool. You either find something to laugh or to feel fuzzy, so it does its job. The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.7/10Art:Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,...just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn\'t really necessary in my eyes. There is also the Timothy rap, which is...well, it\'s the Timothy rap.8/10Characters:As I mentioned, the focus on the characters one unlucky characteristic does get old fast. Whenever the show decides to do something else with them however, they are all rather likeable. Especially main girl Hanakoizumi. she is just so much fun.

The show managed to come up with a couple of entertaining ideas and it had its fair share of feel good episodes.

But if you are looking for the same genre where you want to focus alot on story and development, you might want to avoid this as the anime is a little bit random and quite generic. Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad. Period. and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years.

There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad. Period."", 'First I want to restate that this is not my got to genre for anime (that being mecha) but I have enjoyed a few school girl comedies (YuruYuri & Love Lab). So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year! out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer. heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10.', ""This anime is a 10 because of that op movie, just the cutest thing i've seen in years.Even if you don't really think the op movie is that good the anime is hilarous/cute nonetheless, a good enjoyable anime.Now, I've gotta write a longer review but i don't know how to, so i'm just gonna say that Hibarigaoka Ruri is my new Waifu (even more than Kuroneko from oreimo).Just how long is a review gotta be!? Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.

It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy!"", 'My score of this is exceptionally high and you may be asking ""Why does a generic schoolgirl anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"".

The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.7/10Art:Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,...just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too.

Then this is for youIf you want to watch some moe, funny, and heart warming anime then you should go for Anne Happy since it has numbers of skits and really adorable scenes.

Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad. Period. and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year! out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer. heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.

Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch."", ""I have to say that before watching this anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"".

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10.', ""-FULL FINAL REVIEW-It’s been quite a while since Gochiusa, Kiniro Mosaic and Yuru Yuri had aired. We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.

Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool.

Then this is for youIf you want to watch some moe, funny, and heart warming anime then you should go for Anne Happy since it has numbers of skits and really adorable scenes. But if you are looking for the same genre where you want to focus alot on story and development, you might want to avoid this as the anime is a little bit random and quite generic. Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception.

In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT."", ""As I am new to making reviews, please be gentle (might be some spoilers XP)Of course, their is another Moe anime in this season, but what caught my eye. The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.

Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this.

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune).

The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"".

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool. You either find something to laugh or to feel fuzzy, so it does its job. The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.7/10Art:Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,...just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn\'t really necessary in my eyes. There is also the Timothy rap, which is...well, it\'s the Timothy rap.8/10Characters:As I mentioned, the focus on the characters one unlucky characteristic does get old fast. Whenever the show decides to do something else with them however, they are all rather likeable. Especially main girl Hanakoizumi. she is just so much fun.

The show managed to come up with a couple of entertaining ideas and it had its fair share of feel good episodes.

Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute.

I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad. Period. and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year! out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10.', ""This anime is a 10 because of that op movie, just the cutest thing i've seen in years.Even if you don't really think the op movie is that good the anime is hilarous/cute nonetheless, a good enjoyable anime.Now, I've gotta write a longer review but i don't know how to, so i'm just gonna say that Hibarigaoka Ruri is my new Waifu (even more than Kuroneko from oreimo).Just how long is a review gotta be!? Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.

Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"".

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool. You either find something to laugh or to feel fuzzy, so it does its job. The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.7/10Art:Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,...just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn\'t really necessary in my eyes. There is also the Timothy rap, which is...well, it\'s the Timothy rap.8/10Characters:As I mentioned, the focus on the characters one unlucky characteristic does get old fast. Whenever the show decides to do something else with them however, they are all rather likeable. Especially main girl Hanakoizumi. she is just so much fun. I like how, unlike other characters, she is not completely oblivious to her bad luck, but rather decides to have fun anyway. However, I can see the possibility of the characters growing stale in a second season, so...6/10Enjoyment:I had a lot of fun with Anne Happy. The show managed to come up with a couple of entertaining ideas and it had its fair share of feel good episodes. I\'m not sure if want another season though, because of the reasons I mentioned above, but for a 12 episode anime, I did enjoy it quite a bit.8/10Overall:7.6/10 just look at all these colors!

But if you are looking for the same genre where you want to focus alot on story and development, you might want to avoid this as the anime is a little bit random and quite generic. Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer.', 'Hello yall! Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10.', ""This anime is a 10 because of that op movie, just the cutest thing i've seen in years.Even if you don't really think the op movie is that good the anime is hilarous/cute nonetheless, a good enjoyable anime.Now, I've gotta write a longer review but i don't know how to, so i'm just gonna say that Hibarigaoka Ruri is my new Waifu (even more than Kuroneko from oreimo).Just how long is a review gotta be!? Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.

Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch."", ""I have to say that before watching this anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class.""

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.

It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy!"", 'My score of this is exceptionally high and you may be asking ""Why does a generic schoolgirl anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool.

Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.

The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this.

You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell.', 'If Bakuon!! was LA\'s favourite guilty pleasure of Spring 2016, then Anne Happy is a close second. Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool. You either find something to laugh or to feel fuzzy, so it does its job. The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.7/10Art:Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,...just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn\'t really necessary in my eyes.

Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it.', ""Story: 1/10The story only fits anime with a schoolgirl theme/setting. Any other anime, it wouldn't work. So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year! out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer. heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.

Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"".

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool. You either find something to laugh or to feel fuzzy, so it does its job. The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.7/10Art:Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,...just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn\'t really necessary in my eyes. There is also the Timothy rap, which is...well, it\'s the Timothy rap.8/10Characters:As I mentioned, the focus on the characters one unlucky characteristic does get old fast. Whenever the show decides to do something else with them however, they are all rather likeable. Especially main girl Hanakoizumi. she is just so much fun. I like how, unlike other characters, she is not completely oblivious to her bad luck, but rather decides to have fun anyway.

Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn\'t really necessary in my eyes. There is also the Timothy rap, which is...well, it\'s the Timothy rap.8/10Characters:As I mentioned, the focus on the characters one unlucky characteristic does get old fast. Whenever the show decides to do something else with them however, they are all rather likeable. Especially main girl Hanakoizumi. she is just so much fun. I like how, unlike other characters, she is not completely oblivious to her bad luck, but rather decides to have fun anyway.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old.

The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer. heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10.', ""This anime is a 10 because of that op movie, just the cutest thing i've seen in years.Even if you don't really think the op movie is that good the anime is hilarous/cute nonetheless, a good enjoyable anime.Now, I've gotta write a longer review but i don't know how to, so i'm just gonna say that Hibarigaoka Ruri is my new Waifu (even more than Kuroneko from oreimo).Just how long is a review gotta be!? Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.

It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch."", ""I have to say that before watching this anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad. Period. and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year! out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer. heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.

Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of

Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"".

Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.

Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell.', 'If Bakuon!! was LA\'s favourite guilty pleasure of Spring 2016, then Anne Happy is a close second. Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool.

Then this is for youIf you want to watch some moe, funny, and heart warming anime then you should go for Anne Happy since it has numbers of skits and really adorable scenes. But if you are looking for the same genre where you want to focus alot on story and development, you might want to avoid this as the anime is a little bit random and quite generic. Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D"", 'As the title implies, Anne Happy♪ is a bundle of happiness that can bring a smile to anyone.The story was something that caught me by surprise since the summaries I read prior to the show\'s airing was pretty vague. In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year! out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.

Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this.

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"".

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool. You either find something to laugh or to feel fuzzy, so it does its job. The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.7/10Art:Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,...just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn\'t really necessary in my eyes. There is also the Timothy rap, which is...well, it\'s the Timothy rap.8/10Characters:As I mentioned, the focus on the characters one unlucky characteristic does get old fast. Whenever the show decides to do something else with them however, they are all rather likeable. Especially main girl Hanakoizumi. she is just so much fun. I like how, unlike other characters, she is not completely oblivious to her bad luck, but rather decides to have fun anyway. However, I can see the possibility of the characters growing stale in a second season, so...6/10Enjoyment:I had a lot of fun with Anne Happy. The show managed to come up with a couple of entertaining ideas and it had its fair share of feel good episodes. I\'m not sure if want another season though, because of the reasons I mentioned above, but for a 12 episode anime, I did enjoy it quite a bit.8/10Overall:7.6/10 just look at all these colors!

Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year! out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts.

I hereby nominate it for anime of the year!', 'Are you the type that feels a sharp pain in the chest when someone madly adorable and incredibly innocent gets hurt? If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer. heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10.', ""This anime is a 10 because of that op movie, just the cutest thing i've seen in years.Even if you don't really think the op movie is that good the anime is hilarous/cute nonetheless, a good enjoyable anime.Now, I've gotta write a longer review but i don't know how to, so i'm just gonna say that Hibarigaoka Ruri is my new Waifu (even more than Kuroneko from oreimo).Just how long is a review gotta be!? Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.

The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy!"", 'My score of this is exceptionally high and you may be asking ""Why does a generic schoolgirl anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

Then this is for youIf you want to watch some moe, funny, and heart warming anime then you should go for Anne Happy since it has numbers of skits and really adorable scenes.

Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad. Period. and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song. There was nothing about this anime I didn\'t like, I can not praise it enough. I hereby nominate it for anime of the year! out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay. I still cried all 4 season binges every time something managed to really make my adorable little Anne sad though, I\'m too sensitive to watch someone so blindingly innocent and pure suffer. heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.

Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch."", ""I have to say that before watching this anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"".

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10.', ""-FULL FINAL REVIEW-It’s been quite a while since Gochiusa, Kiniro Mosaic and Yuru Yuri had aired. We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT.

The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old. All the characters are great, let me just sum it up there. I do want to mention how Punch Mind Happiness is an addictive op song.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.

Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there. Overall, Anne Happy isn't going to blow anyone away but it is very fun and entertaining and if you are into this kind of series, it is worth the watch. in the character's everyday lives.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless.', 'What makes Anne Happy different from all the other slice of life moe shows? the characters and setting. The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this. You either find it cute and entertaining or still too cliche and boring as hell. of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"".

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune). That being Hibiki Hagyuu voiced by Haruka Yamamura, the ""no sense of direction"" misfortune along with her best friend *cough* love interest Ren Ekoda voiced by Mayu Yoshioka the""even the girls loves her"" misfortune and constantly  sleep deprived. The most interesting character is the main character who\'s anime title is based on, An ""Hanako"" Hanakoizumi voiced by Yumiri Hanamori, who has the WORST luck in the entire anime that her bad luck gets ironic good luck and Hanako is the glue that gets these five unfortunate characters together.The animation by Silver Link, has a contrasting animation concerning the unfortunate main cast as everything from the character designs to the backgrounds are extremely bright and noticeable, the anime has that ""full bloom"" to it\'s animation palette which might be slightly too bright at times however. Nonetheless, animation by Silver Link is rather ironic considering the premise.The voice acting has some squeakers but most can be given some grace to some level, Hanako, Hibiki and Timothy (the mascot icon for this series) voiced by Chitose Morinaga, nonetheless, LA definitely thought that all the voice cast had lots of fun doing their roles especially with Yumi Hara as Kodaira (the teacher of the main cast), with her tranquil fury to deadpan snarker vocals making Yumi hara, LA\'s favourite VA in Anne Happy, because of that voice cast is decent at best, squeaky and ""annoying"" at worst, in which LA didn\'t think it was bad at all.Ohh and LA forgot the egregious amount of yuri undertones ohh the yuri undertones, considering LA is huge sucker for yuri moe...it was something of a guilty pleasure.The ending was rather eccentrically hectic and really it gives us the same ""status quo is god"" with the girls just doing cute things by the end of it, with the Kodaira being the hero of the ending. The only plot thread however that never gets addressed is Timothy\'s creator, it\'s hinted at MULTIPLE TIMES, but never gets addressed, why is Timothy\'s creator monitoring the cast?, does she have bad luck to and trying to cure her own misfortune?.Anne Happy is really your typical cute girls doing cute things just with a rather weird yet unique twist to it and because of the entire spectrum of luck got Anne Happy away from the generic ""cute girls doing cute things"". ""Cute girls doing unfortunate things"" and trying to cure them from their misfortune sounds sadistic but really it\'s typical moe fair and as LA said at the beginning, it was a guilty pleasure for LA watching Anne Happy. misfortune.

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool.

Then this is for youIf you want to watch some moe, funny, and heart warming anime then you should go for Anne Happy since it has numbers of skits and really adorable scenes. But if you are looking for the same genre where you want to focus alot on story and development, you might want to avoid this as the anime is a little bit random and quite generic. Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.

We’re quite grateful for Anne Happy, an unhappy anime but very silly, comedic and CGDCT to be adapted. This is one of the 8 SOL to be aired on Spring 2016. There is quite a lot of SOL airing this season.Anne Happy to me is quite interesting to watch though there’s not much of people watching it. The core is much formulated, it can play off anime cliché as they use many frills moments to as the comedy theme, not by throwing it unnecessarily. Of course, it has a...pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception. Anne Happy’s comedic contents are quick and snappy to understand, such as the use of manga panels to deliver the comedy at a quicker pace however the excessive use of it can be a bit hassle.By far, the story plotline is not complicated or complex to watch.Animation wise, is handled and produced by Silver Link, a great studio which made Non Non Biyori. The animation was pretty decent and manga iconography is used to express the characters feelings. The character design was what made me impressed the most, this is by far from my perspective the best character design I ever seen, not to argue I just seem to like the character design as well as their eye design. The use of color is not too saturated as colors are used lighter to suit the theme, heck even 1080p I can see the difference. I still wonder how they can handle two anime production at the same time, I've been noticing that since fall season. In short, though a lot of loading screens are used, the character designs and animation is done pretty well by Silver link.I enjoyed the OP and the ED songs, as well as the OST. The voice actors for all the characters were pretty decent, I start to notice the VA who voiced Hibari, as she was voiced Kirie in Umaru chan, I was pretty stunned how amusing her voice be, even her singing skills are pretty damn good. An’s VA wasn't bad, some of her lines were pretty cute especially the “right” line. Botan’s VA on other hand, I get confused who voiced her, she kinda sound like Hayori. Hibiki’s VA is almost too similar to Sharo’s VA from Gochiusa. In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT. pretty standard set up of Slice Of Life genre such as the school setting and bunch of girls doing CGDCT. In addition, most of the plot points are prevailed every each next episode otherwise, continue where it left off.In addition, Anne Happy adds comedic and gag scenes to keep the show entertaining and interesting as it helps to spies up the viewer’s perception.

In short, silver link VA selection is pretty decent though, there aren't any big VA names.Ohh btw, TIMOTHY RAP SONG IS THE BEST!Talking about the characters, Hibari-chan stand out to me the most, I love the fact that she is very oblivious to not having any misfortune, despite she has one which is love misfortune nonetheless, she is one of the ordinary type of student without having any mishaps or bad luck occurring on her. Hibari has the mature type of attitude, whom she can concern anyone if they were in trouble especially An. An on the other hand, is a cute character who unfortunately suffer a lot of bad luck, feel pity on her. Botan on other hand, she is most likely used as character gag which make everyone laugh, she is quite prone to getting injuries even the smallest hit. Really not much to talk about the characters from Anne Happy.TL;DR In conclusion, Anne Happy is a great anime to watch, even though the excessive moe content is used to much, the content of the story is still there unlike some other which only focuses on fan service and deviating out of the plot which why some people wonder what the story is all about, Anne happy is different. Animations is pretty decent and sounds aren't pretty bad. There is little structural view as Anne Happy only offer comedies to the viewers.To sum it up, Anne Happy can be watched by anyone, but it would be recommended if you have a taste on SOLs, comedy and CGDCT."", ""As I am new to making reviews, please be gentle (might be some spoilers XP)Of course, their is another Moe anime in this season, but what caught my eye. The story and plot is which that caught my eye.The story is about the five girls who go to school in a class called the Happy Class. This class for the people for the unlucky and the purpose of this class is to become, well happy.  The story is different from what  I have seen from the other SOL anime. The ending was also very satisfying :).I felt the art was a good asset...to this. Although, if you are bothered by chibi characters, well there is a lot of them here. I'm not that bothered by them but why did I grade the animation so high in this. Well the animation consists of bright colors in the most important scenes. I felt this animation was really pretty and I was glad to see  sometimes that the characters looked different with different colors.The openings to moe animes are usually upbeat or very cute. Now, this anime is different with a funky opening which gives me the feels of happiness. The ending is really good as well, the opening and ending fit this anime really well.Now now, the characters did fit in the anime but I guess I wasn't really  satisfied you could say... there is your average tsundere, kuudere, glasses, derdere and a weird person you could say. I did not hate them though, just a little disappointed  you could say.I really did enjoy this anime, seeing a different kind of style to anime is very cool and I think there should be more animes like this. Overall I give this a 7  but the anime is very good anyways.This is a good anime if you're expecting a good kind of moe anime, so just give it a try :D to this.

In this case, the surprise was a good thing because I came to loving it. The show just gets wackier with each episode and that\'s what makes it great.I believe the show wouldn\'t be what it is if it wasn\'t for the characters. This series would be considered what the anime community calls ""moe blob"", which basically means a show with the most adorable characters. Anne...Happy is definitely one of those. Normally with this type of show, the characters don\'t get any major developments and usually stay within their specific personality. However, that\'s not much of an issue when it comes to these as you end up liking the character for who they are.As I started watching, the first thing right away that caught my attention was the animation. Everything was consistent, from the movement to the character models, but what intrigued me was the look/style to it. There are lots of vibrant colors mixing together making it look like a cover of a coloring book. At one point, I began realizing that it looked similar to the series Baka and Test, which turns out to be the same director.There obviously isn\'t anything to grand about Anne Happy, but what made me enjoy it was all the lovable characters, the beautiful aesthetic to it, and the over-the-top comedy that ensues. It was so lighthearted that I could not hate it. Happy is definitely one of those.

So basically, it's unoriginal.Art: 6/10The art was good for the most part. It's just the right amount of brightness, which is key to a schoolgirl/moe anime and the girls are cute. But the fact that the main characters are the only people with FACES is lazy. I mean, really?? They couldn't take the time to at least put faces on the other students in the class?? Unbelievable!Sound: 1/10Awful and forgettable. I hated the opening and ending songs and the music they use in the episodes just sounds so simple...and retarded.Character: 1/10This is 1 of the few anime I've seen in which I've hated ALL of the main characters and I've been watching anime for 5 years. You know an anime is bad when you hate the characters. Hibari is considered the main character, but we get little to no backstory on her! There are hints, but of course, they're too lazy to go into detail just like with the art. Also, her liking the construction sign is the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life. They basically shove it in our face that Hanako is unlucky. Every episode, something bad happens to her. We get it: she's unlucky! You don't have to remind us every single damn episode! Botan was so annoying with her constant injuries, Hibiki is a HORRIBLE tsundere, and Ren is kind of like the female version of a bland shoujo male main character. That's the #1 problem with this anime: they gave each character 1 or 2 personality traits and made it a running gag in which they showed it in each episode. I get that they're unlucky, so that's the main reason why, but they should've figured that at some point, it's going to get repetitive, which will eventually make the anime boring and unejoyable to watch.Enjoyment: 1/10I got absolutely no enjoyment out of watching this anime.Final score: 2/10They did everything that you're NOT supposed to do in a schoolgirl/moe anime. Lazy art, annoying characters, and unenjoyable to watch. The story itself is pointless. The teacher gives them assignments to do so they can find happiness and if they fail, they get a punishment. The main characters always fail the assignments or end up in last place, but there's always a loophole, so the punishment doesn't end up being that bad. In that case, what's the point of teaching them happiness if she lets them off the hook all the time?? Don't watch this anime. It's bad.

So when I read the premise for this show I thought I give it shot. It was worth it. It\'s funny, cheerful and bright. The characters are adorable because they try so hard despite their individual ""conditions"" The show can come across as repetitive, but that\'s what makes it so fun. You the jokes are coming so it never gets old. The fact that they all know these things befall them yet they go...out and face the day with a smile and hope in their hearts. My favourite character was Botan because no matter what she was doing you just know she going to get hurt. It\'s her running gag. Hanako was just as amusing because she would just find herself in these random life or death scenarios adding constant drama and change. My second favourite was Ren because despite all her good luck she has the misfortune of being friends with Hibiki. Hibiki was kind of annoying at first, but once you realize (like Ren) she just that way it\'s okay. Hibiki inevitably gets lost and it never gets old.

If you are, Anne will constantly soothe and drop kick your heart.Many shows that focus on any variety of ""cute girls doing cute things"" forget to add something that stands in contrast to the cuteness, effectively rendering it far less intense. Anne Happy manages to merge a number of likeable characters, most notably Anne herself, with endless misfortune that causes variable suffering, again most notably to Anne. The result of this is a very intense rollercoaster of emotion, fortunately with far more laughs and...heartwarming than moments of sadness.While the story is outrageously crazy and the events are way over the top it still manages to be a fun ride, it just ""works"" in its own way unlike many other shows that try to include crazy impossibilities. The art and sound are at first glance certainly unremarkable but fit the feeling of the show like a glove, like the subtle nuances in voices and the images that are not really all that simple but just ""clean"" and wonderfully consistent.My favorite moments are when Anne\'s god level bad luck strikes in ways that don\'t really hurt her, the fact that the events are already sort of impossible from the start and get even more outrageous down the road actually makes it even better, this anime doesn\'t take itself too seriously and it feels totally okay.

Today, I have decided to make an honest, and special review for one of my absolute favourite anime of all time! It is called Anne-Happy! So, what makes me like it? Well, I am very glad you asked. You see, I love this anime, because it is an absolute masterpiece compared to that of Death Note, Gintama, One Piece, Fairytail ect. Now tell meh, do you like Naruto, Dragon Ball, Pokemon, and mexican pie?? Well this is the anime for you!I learned about this anime from a good friend of mine named Jimothy. He walked up to meh one day, and with this...smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?! Than watch this freaking anime!"" At first, I thought he was high on something, but a few into the conversation, he caught my attention. He said to meh: ""You\'ll like this anime, because it\'s not Naruto, BELIEVE IT!"" That made me intrigued, so I began binging this 12 episode work of art.So here are our cast of characters! Our main character is Anne, she has terrible luck, and acts like a complete moron, which makes her useless. She is just there, so the weebs have some kawaii fan service. Our next character is, Twilight spar-I mean.... RURI! She is very uninteresting, and worst of all, she is in love with a damn construction billboard! Like, how lonely can you seriously get?! Our next character, is squid girl, aka Botan. She has no calcium in any of her bones, and they brake all the time, only thing is, she apparently, also has the gift of regeneration... or something. Which makes her useless, just like our main hero.... THAN, FINALLY, I thought I had found the absolute best characters, Ren and Hibiki! Who although had the best relationship, and personalities, still had some trashy problems. Hibiki (My personal favourite ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)) had a terrible sense of direction! And her best friend Ren, had a serious problem when it came to keepin her damn eyes open. So they become useless like all the others! I tell ya, they are all still better than L, Monkey D. Luffy, Elric Edward ect.Now, time for our sponsorship moment! DO YOU LIKE CHEEEESE?! WELL, WE HAVE GOT A FINE SELECTION OF YOUR FAVOURITE QUALITY CHEESE PRODUCTS! WE\'VE GOT CHEDDAR! MOSSERELLA! SWISS! AND IF YOU\'RE REALLY IN THE MOOD..... PERMISEEEEAAAAN!Now that we got that outta the way, let\'s continue! The plot is very non exsistent! Like, seriously, the writers get really bored at one point, and decide.""Let\'s get some of that SAO in there, and some of dat Sailor Moon, and a bit of Attack on Titan, with a giant fluffy bunny!"" And don\'t even get me started on how they play tag! I mean, this whole anime revolves around the main characters becoming happy... So why the hell are they playing killer bunny tag, in the dark woods, with bears and such?! BTW, the teacher is a complete, and udder psychopath. Just saying.So, this anime is complete garbage, but compared to Attack on Titan, SAO, Naruto, Sailor Moon ect. It is a complete masterpiece! And that is why my rating for this series, is a solid 10 cheesey mustaches, out of 10. smug-ass look on his face, he said: ""Hey! Do you like Sailor Moon, and slice of life anime?!

Well, the anime is about unfotunate kawaii girls doing what an unfotunate kawaii girl should do, that is, helping each other when in trouble and being cute (can i submit...this now?) this now?)"", 'Luck.  We all have varying degrees of it.  I\'m sure there are some of you out there that have the best luck possible and conveniently get nice things come to you cause hey, random chance.  Others...like me, however, don\'t really have that luxury and varying degrees of misfortune befall us.  So to bring attention to such a problem, Silver Link has brought us their new work, Anne Happy, or Unhappy as I have grown accustomed to calling this show and...wow, there aren\'t many words to accurately describe this.Story: Our story begins with Hibarigaoka Ruri, a first year high schooler who begins...her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.  After rescuing this...rather unfortunate girl, Ruri learns that this girl\'s name is Hanakoizumi Anne, another girl who is also in this mysterious Class 7.  Upon arriving at school, they find out that this Class 7 is known as the \'Happiness Class\' where the curriculum and reason for existence is to try to help out the girls who have been dealt a bad hand in life and are classified as extremely unlucky in hopes of helping their situation.  Oh boy, this is gonna be good.The basic premise of Unhappy is following the story of 5 specific girls in the Happiness Class as they go through their crazy curriculum of various tasks to try and improve their innate luck through the usage of various activities.  The show plays off like your generic, standard moe show with the twist being that literally nothing goes right in this show and everything that these girls do is so out there and crazy that it just becomes the kind of slapstick entertainment that\'s just fun to watch.  Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre. her first day at a prestigious academy where she has been assigned to Class 7 of the incoming freshman.  On her way to school, she find...a girl hanging from the side of a bridge, dangling like a hook while holding onto a dog who is at that moment in time, biting her arm violently.

Added into the fact that the various characters have their own respective forms of unluckiness and you have a complete recipe for disaster.  A terrible, burnt, yet somehow wonderful great disaster.Though as far as positives go, that\'s about the show has to offer.  The basic premise is still more or less your generic moe girls in a high school setting so without all of the wackiness and downright insanity that the show gives us on a minute to minute basis, it\'s still basically just your average moe show.  But quite honestly, due to just the sheer ridiculous that this show gives us, it\'s more fair to compare this show to Nichijou than anything else.Overview:+ Unique premise+ Complete and utter wackiness for entertainment-  Still basically a bunch of cute girls running aroundCharacters: Oh, characters.  The lifeblood of any good moe show is really how good the characters are, or rather how good the girls are.  If they aren\'t up to snuff or have anything unique about them, than the show basically just falls flat without problem.  Unhappy...pretty much avoids this entire problem altogether similarly just with its base premise.Hibarigaoka Ruri is the first character in the series that we\'re introduced to.  Ruri plays a very...interesting role in the series.  Her \'unlucky\' factor isn\'t so much of unluckiness as it is so much as a problem that she has, which is basically her having objectiphilia, which in layman terms, she has a damn crush on a construction sign.  Yeah.  Aside from that, Ruri acts more as the \'straight man\' amidst the complete and utter chaos that this show has to offer.  She always seems to have something to say about the situation and is by far the least problematic character in the series due to her complete and utter awareness as to what the hell is happening in any given situation.  My problem with Ruri as a character is the fact that she has this bit of backstory in the series that we\'re hinted and shown some aspects of, but we\'re never really explained on them.  It\'s a thing in the series that I was a bit bothered by because they consistently threw out hints as to what was up with her parents, which of course, we never really get answers to.Then there\'s Hanakoizumi Anne, or Hanako as the rest of the characters cal her.  Hanako is the mascot character of Unhappy and bears the unlucky factor of just basically having absolute terrible luck.  She tries to pet an animal, they bite her.  She\'s walking over a bridge, it\'ll break and she\'ll fall through.  She walks normally, she\'ll fall into a manhole.  Gets food, immediately drops.  You get the idea.  Despite all of this, Hanako holds the medal at being the happiest damn character in this entire show.  Being the Genki Girl of the series, Hanako is the series\'s bundle of joy in the series and is always there to keep the mood up despite whatever happens.  Hell, she\'s basically Bad Luck Incarnate.  The fact that she\'s even able to smile is worthy enough of a salute.Then there\'s Kumegawa Botan, the quiet, oujo-sama megane girl of the series.  Her unlucky factor is having a body of frail glass.  In short, doing ANYTHING that involves her body from sitting down, holding a pencil, even goddamn breathing can cause something to break, rupture, or shatter.  And while yes it is bad for me to chuckle a bit at this girl\'s pain, Botan is more or a problematic character than anything.  Botan very commonly in the series has bouts of self-victimization and consistently throughout the series radiates a depressing aura that is just far too common in the series and as such, really isn\'t that fun to watch.  Especially when they dedicate a few minutes each time to this, it just gets a bit annoying.And finally we have the duo of Ekoda Ren and Hagyuu Hibiki, the two characters who are childhood friends in the series.  Ren is the cool kuudere character whose unlucky factor is having the innate ability to attract ANYTHING female to her location (this includes humans, dogs, birds, bears, squirrels, her childhood friend, etc.), and Hibiki is the proud, stupid, and somewhat irritating high and mighty character who has the worst direction sense that you have ever seen on a person.  These two come as a pair simply because 1) this section is getting excessively long and 2) you really can\'t really talk about one without the other because the series basically glues these two together from start to end.As for side characters, we have the prominent ones such as Ms. Kodaira, a terrifying teacher who you don\'t want to open her eyes, and Timothy, the other mascot character that is a robot rabbit made with CGI.  These two are very common in the series and are basically the masterminds of all of the craziness, so I thank them for keeping the show much more interesting than it would\'ve been without them.  Other characters are more or less one-off characters that you see once or twice in the series, so they\'re pretty much mooks in the grand scheme of things.Overview:+ Unique and...interesting characters for the main cast+ Good side characters-  Main characters have some unfavorable aspects to them-  Some hinted backstory but no executionArt: Produced by Silver Link, the art quality is far better than that one season where they tried to take on 3 shows at once, having a very bright and colorful artstyle mixed with watercolor backgrounds to give this show this very nice and happy flair to it (despite what actually happens sometimes.)  The character designs are exceedingly cute in design.  As this show is a moe show, the characters all have a wide-eyed and child-like look to them (Hanako specifically), so if you\'re not a fan of cute, well, here\'s your forewarning.Due to the show having a lot of just absolute craziness, the show is just filled to the brim with effects to detail what actually happens and it only added to the experience.  Being a comedy show, Unhappy also utilizes a varying degree of comedic stylings such as chibi simplification, the classic blank dot eyes for Hanako during moments of just absolute \'What\', as well as the constant usage of purple aura for the evil moments of Kodaira and depressing moments with Botan.  Additionally, the show utilizes some CGI to make Timothy which, while was a bit jarring during his introduction, slowly smoothed out as the series went along.Overview:+ Colorful and consistent artstyle+ Watercolor backgrounds+ Comedic stylings mixing in with the series+/-  Moe artstyle (This is dependent on your outlook on Moe)Sound:  The soundtrack for Unhappy is basically your standard moe tracks with a bit of an...Unhappy flair to them.  Eh?  Eh?  (I know where the door is...)  The OP known as \'Punch Mind\' sounds like your standard moe OP with a bit of craziness and some off-putting tones to accentuate the fact that the show is about some very unlucky girls.  Sung by the seiyuus for the five main characters of the show, the OP isn\'t the best, but it\'s pretty damn enjoyable.  The ED on the other hand...well, it\'s good, but compared to the OP, it\'s not as good nor enjoyable in my opinion.Personal Enjoyment: When I first saw Unhappy, I thought to myself, ""I am watching this.""  Due to the show\'s just absolutely ridiculous premise, this show was one of the first shows to make it into my to-watch list for the Spring 2016 season.  Coming out of it, I have to say, my prediction was right, and damn did I enjoy this.Did I like this anime?While some moments were quite cliched due to the show very commonly expressing the power of friendship between the characters, the constant wackiness and the kinds of things that these girls ran into were just an absolute joy to watch.  Due to Hanako\'s complete and utter bad luck, you would most likely never know what was going to happen next, and it might just be me, but it\'s funny to laugh at the comedic misfortune, especially since these girls live the life of \'We can never win\'.  (I know, I\'m a bad person.)What didn\'t I like about this anime?Specifically, I was a bit irritated at the sheer amount of things that the show insinuated but never put into action.  Ruri\'s backstory, Kodaira\'s hinted backstory, and Timothy\'s creator were never things that were revealed or used in the series and it just bugged me a bit because those details might\'ve put a bit more flair into the series.  Though, seeing Hanako collapse a portion of the forest just due to sheer bad luck and climbing a damn tree and various other scenes like that make up a lot of the problems.  Kind of.Would I recommend this series?If you want a very unique kind of moe show, than Unhappy is for you.  The only comparison that I can make to Unhappy is Nichijou, as both have the same level of complete and utter ridiculousness to them and fulfill that gap of being both stupid yet absolutely glorious at the same time.  It might not be the same, but Unhappy is a good moe show and definitely has its own unique stamp in the moe genre.', ""There are a lot of slice of life shows which involve cute girls doing cute things and because of this, a lot of them end up being similar to one another in many ways. Despite many of those series throwing in a twist or two to differentiate themselves from one another, the similarities make most of them not feel like anything special. However, even if a series isn't anything special, it can still be entertaining and enjoyable and Anne Happy is one of those series.Like most shows in the slice of life genre, there isn't a plot instead we are just watching events that happen...in the character's everyday lives. Anne Happy focuses on a group of 5 girls who are each very unlucky in their own way and because of this they are placed into a special class at school. Through-out the series we get to witness the little adventures these girls go on (such as playing a life size version of a board game) and the misfortunes they encounter. The events that happen during each of these episodes are executed fairly well for the most part, they are very light-hearted and are filled with comedy, and even though some events may seem over the top but for this series it works.There are also a large number of comedic moments in each episode and they are funny more often than not (the transitions between scenes are especially funny). The series also makes some subtle references that only add to the comedy. However some of the jokes do get repetitive (especially the ones that include the girls' unlucky traits) which subtracts from the comedy. Even though most episodes have a lot of funny moments, the events as a whole, even though they are fun to watch, don't really feel like they are anything too special.The characters are the weakest area of this show. Because the series seems to focus on the events themselves, the characters don't really get explored. Out of the main cast of 5 girls, the only character that seems to be explored significantly is Hibari (Hibarigaoka Ruri for those who didn't watch). The other characters, even though they are not one dimensional, they do lack depth and not much is seen from them other than a couple of traits in their personality. Also the jokes made about the unlucky traits of the characters do get repetitive. However their personalities do work well with each other, none of them seem out of place and none of the interactions with each other seem awkward.The art isn't bad but it's not something that will blow you away either. Like any show that has cute girls doing cute things, the character designs are very cute and the color palette is very light which fits well for this show. The backgrounds are fairly simple, don't have too much detail in them and are static for the most part.The sound is good but not great and compared to other series it's not really anything special. The opening and the ending are both very cute with the main VAs singing it but compared to other series that do this, it's pretty par for the course. However, the VAs do a very good job matching the personality of the character they are playing and portraying their emotions. The background music is very simple and it's not something you would regularly notice unless you go out of your way to but the music does add to each scene.Like many slice of life shows, this isn't for everyone. If you typically don't like cute girls doing cute things then you are not going to like this but if you do then this isn't a bad series to watch. The little adventures these girls go on are interesting to watch and this series is one of the more funny slice of life shows out there.

anime, I didn't have much of a liking for cute slice of life anime, I tried some but I never got to really enjoy them, thankfully, this changed with Anne Happy, an adorable and really fun anime.I really like the idea of this Anne Happy, basically it's a group of girls that end up in a school classroom that focuses on fixing the bad luck everyone that is there was born with.For good or for bad, atleast for me, there were two types of episodes, the ones that were focused on the crazy ideas the school planned...in order to (somehow) make them luckier, that were a blast to watch and the main motive that made me love this anime, and the ones that focus more in the cute SoL situations for the whole episode, that honestly were average at best, they didn't do anything better than other moe anime would, and just felt empty compared to the other ones.Now let's talk about the characters, like in most of this comedies, they follow a certain personality assigned at the start and have little to no development during the story, sadly, I couldn't get to like some of them, specially Botan, a girl with poor health and even worse self esteem, her comedy parts got repetitive fast and all the time I felt that if we had a different character instead of her, Anne Happy would have been a lot better.Thankfully, on the other side we have Hanako, that is just the most adorable thing ever, she's also the one with the worst luck and always end up in silly situations, there is also the duo Ren (calm, sleepy girl) + Hibiki (tsundere, I found her quite annoying, but she's the perfect match for Ren), lastly, Ruri, the most normal (kinda) of the girls completes the group.The secondary characters are few but amazing, Kodaira, the teacher, is just so badass and damn, she's scary when she wants, but in the end she really cares for her students, Timothy is a weird bunny-like robot that helps her and, in my opinion, is the funniest character of this anime, the best moments are when he's around.The art style, like one would expect from a moe anime, is made to be cute, I personally like a lot the way the studio Silver Link handles the artistic part, and with this anime they delivered again.The voice actors are great and fit well with the characters, I specially love the work of Yumiri Hamamori in the voice of Hanako, it's as adorable as it can be.I'm honestly speechless with the opening+ending combination Anne Happy has, both songs, PUNCH☆MIND☆HAPPINESS and Ashita de Ii kara, are fantastic and grew up on me, the background themes during the episodes are kind of there, none of them stand out, nor are memorable, but it's nothing I expected neither.If you're a fan of cute slice of life anime, I really recommend to watch Anne Happy, if it focused a bit more on the original school elements it has it would have been ever better, but it's still an enjoyable anime from start to end and one I'm sure you will have a good time with. in order to (somehow) make them luckier,

""according to the assessment of the storyline, art, sound, character and enjoyment which I give all 10 and it's so perfect.Forget about Underrated and try this one anime, everything is here for exciting character development, great character desires, love for fellow friends' characters, even the joy of one character who changes everything, fills the void, acts as an intermediary, helps each other very very well and is an interesting friendship.The storyline is very supportive of everything, the progress and wishes of the characters, a teacher or homeroom teacher who really cares about them, all for the sake of happiness and want them to think that...everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched by the nature of their character (something is annoying though) but these are those who seek Happy! everything they do is happiness, that happiness does not come alone but moves each other's desires.I'm really touched

anime get this rating?""Well to be put simply, this anime makes me very happy! Whenever I want something that I can just watch to decompress, this is one of the first shows that I gravitate to.Story- 6My god is the story mediocre as hell. The gimmick in this show gives it a lot of flavor though. In the end, it\'s still a cute-girls-do-cute-things episodic plot. Nothing gets too deep since its a slice of life in the end. A lack of depth doesn\'t mean that a story is...bad though. The plot structure and gimmicks are interesting enough to make this a very enjoyable watch.Art- 8The art style itself is very cute and clean. The color choices are extremely appealing and the character designs are tastefully unique. The animation is nothing to write home about. It services the show well enough but you don\'t ever have a moment of ""my god this animation is sexy as hell!""Sound- 7I can see the soundtrack being irritating for some people because it is very happy-go-lucky. I personally would listen to the intro outside of the anime. Other than that, the soundtrack doesn\'t stand out to me very much.Character- 9Now the characters are hit or miss in this show.Hanako was SO IRRITATING. I just don\'t like a plain jane happy character. I love characters with spunk and I enjoy when they\'re over the top in a cool way. Hanako is just not that. She\'s overly cute with little flaws so I don\'t even want to hug her or anything.Hibari was very very very very cute~ She reminds me of a more outwardly chill Hifumi (from NEW GAME!) She definitely compliments the other characters, and would initially be our usual shy character if she didn\'t have her crush on the sign. Her romantic interest and embarrassment about it adds some cute depth to her character. I would hug 10/10Botan was pretty irritating. Her negative demeanor made me roll my eyes constantly. She would be so much better if she was a more ara ara~ MILF type smh.Hibiki is mildly irritating on her own. She a token tsundere but actually has a reason to be like that. Her love for Ren is very sweet and adds almost a protective side to her character. Her interactions with Ren make for some good gags. By the end of the show, Hibiki was one of my favorites.Ren was my first waifu (before I knew that waifus were a thing) She has a pretty relaxed and chill demeanor which makes her a good partner for Hibiki\'s disheveled personality. Her constant tiredness adds to the cuteness factor too. She\'s a character that I look back at with fondness.To address the yuri. I APPROVE! Sometimes yuri can be very bad (like in Inugami to Nekoyama ahem) but Ren and Hibiki have a very natural bond. It makes me really happy to see well written yuri and I\'m glad that they didn\'t have to make a big deal out of it.My enjoyment of this anime is obviously very high. It just gives me the fuzzies.I\'d recommend this show for a snow day when you don\'t feel like getting out of bed just yet. Not the best moe ever, but enjoyable nonetheless. bad though.

The show still maintains the generic slice of life themes with ""cute girls doing cute things"" but holds a different personality altogether that makes it unique.Story: 8: The show is about a class in Tennomifune Academy and all the students have terrible luck, or ""bad karma"" as the synopsis states. It\'s main focus are the three main heroines, each with different personalities and ""bad karma"" which follow them throughout the show. With the help of their teacher, they strive to have a happy school life instead...of being unhappy with the ""bad karma"". Even though the three girls struggle immensely, the show has lots of comedic gags to keep it entertaining and not drain out the viewer.Art: 9: Beautiful bright and colourful visuals with a few dark-ish dull colours and scenes to go with the situations for each character. Even if you don\'t like the plot, the visuals can keep you watching.Sound: 7: Joyful and catchy opening, I also really liked the small piece of music they used between episodes, it actually reminded me of the show Doraemon.Character: 8: Anne Happy presents characters with some-what relatable problems. My personal favourite character was Botan, I found her the most relatable as she borderline hates herself. Throughout the show she will make a small comment towards an aspect about herself that she doesn\'t like, commonly her appearance. Nonetheless she is an absolute joy to watch, very kind hearted and mature. Ruri has some unique points with her personality and An is very unlucky but still manages to smile.Overall, these characters very entertaining to watch, I almost guarantee you will find a character to love. Honestly, each of them are lovable in different ways.Enjoyment: 7: Yes, this show was entertaining but the ending was a slip up for me. It lost the ""slice of life"" premise and I felt like there are still some more things we can learn about the characters. You will also find an episode or two which drags like hell, but be sure to keep your hopes up for this show even if you do land on an episode like that. I found two of these types of episodes.Overall, if you like slice of life and moe characters but want a change from the generic personalities then I highly recommend this.

Starting Anne Happy at a happy note aren\'t we?.Anne Happy is a rather ironic anime to watch due to the rather happy go lucky cast member going under alot of misfortune and nonchalantly being happy about it even after the misfortune.Anne Happy follows the typical ""girls doing cute things in a school"" but with a weird twist that being that the main cast is trying to cure their own misfortune and show their misfortune at the same time.Character-wise they are diverse through their personalities and brand of...misfortune. LA\'s favourite character was at first Botan Kumegawa voiced by Kiyono Yasuno the unhealthy misfortune, but became Ruri Hibarigaoka voiced by Haruka Shirashi the ""tragic love"" misfortune as she had the most connecting tissue to the rest of the cast not to mention she interacted with the main cast the most, aside from them the characters do get fleshed out outside from their personalities and misfortune (in a more relational development than a character development, as the character development goes through many running gags through the character misfortune).

While this anime sure is cute most of the time, the comedy goes into absurd territory every now and then, which was kinda cool. You either find something to laugh or to feel fuzzy, so it does its job. The only downside in my eyes, is the running gags about the main casts characteristics, which get old pretty fast.7/10Art:Anne Happy is very beautiful to look at. I mean,...just look at all these colors! Some episodes highlight this especially, like the one where they\'re in the flower garden. They overdid it a little with the ""shiny effect"" (I know there is an actual term for that, I don\'t remember it unfortunately), but in general, this is a feast for the eyes (if you\'re into the cute kind of artstyle). I also liked the occasional comedic simplicity, like in the eyecatches.9/10Sound:The opening song is so ridiculous, I can\'t help but love it. The ending is pretty good too. The voice acting was allright, though they tried rather hard to sound as stereotypical as they could, which wasn\'t really necessary in my eyes. There is also the Timothy rap, which is...well, it\'s the Timothy rap.8/10Characters:As I mentioned, the focus on the characters one unlucky characteristic does get old fast. Whenever the show decides to do something else with them however, they are all rather likeable. Especially main girl Hanakoizumi. she is just so much fun. I like how, unlike other characters, she is not completely oblivious to her bad luck, but rather decides to have fun anyway. However, I can see the possibility of the characters growing stale in a second season, so...6/10Enjoyment:I had a lot of fun with Anne Happy. The show managed to come up with a couple of entertaining ideas and it had its fair share of feel good episodes. I\'m not sure if want another season though, because of the reasons I mentioned above, but for a 12 episode anime, I did enjoy it quite a bit.8/10Overall:7.6/10 just look at all these colors!

Then this is for youIf you want to watch some moe, funny, and heart warming anime then you should go for Anne Happy since it has numbers of skits and really adorable scenes. But if you are looking for the same genre where you want to focus alot on story and development, you might want to avoid this as the anime is a little bit random and quite generic. Either way, the anime provides some good lessons and realizations when you are feeling down in real life and you might relate of...some of the main characters. The story is fair, art is good, sound is good, characters are good, quite enjoyable if you don\'t have anything else to watch and yes, I give it an overall 7 being a ""good"" anime. some of the main characters.

Because of their terrible luck, the five characters are enrolled in a ""Happiness Class"" that is supposed to help them with their misfortune. However, instead of offering therapy, this class offers “interesting” (or rather, insane) activities for the girls to participate in, making their already odd lives even crazier.Positives-The characters are the strongest aspect of Anne Happy. There’s Hanako who experiences misfortune in every sense of the word; Botan who has incredibly poor health to the point where it is ridiculous and funny; Hibiki who has horrible navigational skills and easily...gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives. We get to witness all of the crazy things they go through on a daily basis and, frankly, it is fun and amusing. The facts they all have different kinds of luck helps to make things less redundant. You never know what sort of disaster is going to befall them next. When catastrophe does strike, it is usually in a comical manner and the characters struggle through their difficulties in chibi form, giving an extra cutesy vibe to the already adorable atmosphere. The constant chibi portrayals were one of my favorite things about the show\'s animation. Overall, the animation gives a unique feeling to the show. Each character has adorable character designs. One thing that particularly stood out was the use of watercolor. The background uses beautiful pastel colors and water color brush marks. The show is extremely colorful and pleasing to the eyes. Another aspect, although quite minute, was the characters\' hair, especially Hibari\'s. If you look closely, her hair is two shades of purple, but it is blended so well that it is hard to notice. This attention to detail shows much effort the animators put into this show.Negatives-Firstly, Timothy, a mechanical bunny robot and the mascot of the show, was extremely annoying, in my opinion. Appear-wise, he is adorable; however, his squeaky voice and personality are irritating. But most importantly, whenever Timothy was around, the show focused on him instead of the characters.That was my main issue with the show: the story. It is a slice of life anime, meaning that, instead of a clear-cut story, the show is shown through small snapshots of the characters\' lives as they go through their daily routines. Because of this, most SOL anime have little, if any, story or plot. Anne Happy is much the same. However, instead of really focusing on the girls\' everyday lives, it focuses their experiences in the insane ""Happiness Class."" This class, as I mentioned earlier, does all kind of ludicrous things to make the students happier. Some highlights include a life-size board game, a virtual casino, and a game of tag that was more like a man hunt.Seeing what sort of silly scenario the class had to go through was entertaining, but the show focused too much on the spontaneity of the ""Happiness Class."" The show should have focused on learning more about the characters as people. Was there a reason for their bad luck? How did their bad luck affect their families and friends? How do the girls react to the constant stream of misfortune that seems to follow them? Does Hibari ever find a love outside of a sign post? In my opinion, this would have been much more interesting to explore than robotic rabbits and a school with an obviously outrageous amount of spending money.Yuri-Based on your personal preferences, yuri can be a good or bad thing. While it is not entirely yuri-based, Anne Happy definitely did have some yuri. The most yuriish moments are between Hibiki and Ren. As I said earlier, Ren attracts female animals because of her charm. However, it isn\'t just nonhuman species that like her. Human females are attracted to her as well, including Hibiki. As the series goes on, a lot of hints about Hibiki\'s feelings for Ren are thrown in. If you want heavy yuri, you would need to look elsewhere, but if you are interested in adorable shojou ai, I definitely recommend Anne Happy for a cute yuri fix.Despite some of its flaws, I really enjoyed Anne Happy\'s concept, animation, yuri, and its adorable and unique take on slice of life. Overall, I would give it an 8 out of 10. gets lost; Ren who has female animals constantly fawning over her because they are attracted to her charm; and finally there is Hibari whose misfortune takes the form of love because she is in love with a construction site sign.With all of the insanity, the audience gets to follow the characters through their misfortune- ridden lives.
