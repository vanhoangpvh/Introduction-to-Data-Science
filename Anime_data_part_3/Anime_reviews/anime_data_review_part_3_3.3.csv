JoJo no Kimyou na Bouken: Adventure,https://myanimelist.net/anime/665/JoJo_no_Kimyou_na_Bouken__Adventure,"['JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure (2000) is one of two halves of an adaptation to the 3rd arc of the JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure manga, Stardust Crusaders. While this half came out second, with the first coming out in 1993, this one is the first canonically, going from the beginning of the arc. Even though it came second, it\'s definitely a better idea to start with this one.This half starts with a young delinquent, Jotaro Kujo (the titular JoJo), in prison... not by force, but of his own free will, and refusing to leave. He claims to be haunted by some kind of strange spirit... something that gets...the attention of his grandfather, Joseph Joestar (the protagonist of the previous arc, Battle Tendency), who knows something about the spirit in question.As it turns out, the spirit is something called a ""Stand"" (named as such because they typically stand beside the user), a manifestation of the user\'s will, brought about in a variety of ways. In the case of both JoJos, it\'s because of a psychic connection to the body of (Joseph\'s grandfather and the first arc\'s protagonist) Jonathan Joestar\'s body... which has been revived, and attached to the head of the vampire Dio Brando, Jonathan\'s mortal enemy and the initial trigger for all the events of JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure. To make matters worse, it\'s not just Joseph and Jotaro who are affected... it\'s also Jotaro\'s mother Holly, whose stand does not properly manifest and instead turns into an affliction, draining her energy. The only way to stop it is to kill Dio. With the use of Joseph\'s stand, Hermit Purple (which allows him to take photos of distant places), they ascertain that Dio is in Egypt... and along with Joseph\'s friend Abdul, and a pair of converted would-be assassins of Dio named Kakyoin and Polnareff, they journey to Egypt to bring an end to Dio.The best thing about JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure is definitely the stands. Because of them, unlike most battle shonens, rather than on having the supporting cast hold out against the Big Bad until the big hero gets there, or upping the ante through a series of increasingly irrational and convoluted powerups, the fights of JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure rely on one main feature: trickery. Every battle in JJBA is as much a battle of wits as it is a battle of physical strength. The fights are all set up, or manipulated to be, based on how one can use one\'s power rather than how much power there is. What I really love is, no matter what Stand someone gets stuck with, they will always find a way to get the best out of it, no matter how crappy it may seem on paper.Now, the original manga for the Stardust Crusaders arc ran for a whopping 16 volumes. As both halves of the anime combined add up to 13 episodes, it should be no surprise that A LOT of material was cut. This is a double-edged sword. On the upside, the original manga was very drawn-out and had a lot of enemies that weren\'t very interesting. None of those make it into the animated version, and the whole thing is much more concise, with the 2000 half focusing entirely on plot-relevant opponents. Considering the plot of this half was much more focused on Polnareff\'s character than any of the others, this also exemplifies his character very well (being probably the best character of this arc). On the downside, it also cut a load of the best material as well... and in the process, totally neglects to characterize Joseph or Kakyoin.Unfortunately the 2000 half is definitely the weaker of the two, even with all the dull fights like ZZ and Gray Fly removed. Barring the fights that introduce Abdul, Kakyoin, and Polnareff, we only really have two opponents introduced in this series... and they both lose a decent chunk of dramatic tension because we really don\'t care about most of the cast at this point. Also, a lot of the execution comes off as unintentionally funny, such as Jotaro\'s total nonchalance to a zombified baby chewing on his leg. The production is most of the cause... it\'s paper-thin, drawn out, and the fights are poorly directed. Certain scenes were obviously not though out at all when the transfer was made... many of them worked as single manga frames, but when time becomes a factor, we get issues like characters managing to get several lines of dialogue in the time it takes for a bullet to travel a few feet.The art style is one of those that transfers very badly to animated form. It probably could have worked if it had been handled by a studio with more budget to spend (JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure was made by Studio A.P.P.P, who have made approximately fuck all else of value or notability), but unfortunately the art looks... well, bizarre. The shading is extremely heavy regardless of lighting, the lines are overly thick, and generally ugly-looking, and all the muscle detail makes it even harder to believe that Jotaro and Kakyoin are 17 than it was in the original manga (which is saying something). The animation isn\'t particularly good either, though it isn\'t bad.Fortunately, the acting is fantastic. Joruta Kosugi sounds so natural as Jotaro that it\'s impossible to imagine him voiced by anyone else. Chikao Ootsuka, Katsuji Mori, and the late Hirotaka Suzuoki all deliver fantastically as Joseph, Polnareff and Kakyoin respectively, and Kiyoshi Kobayashi manages to give Abdul a layer of charisma not present in the manga. It also features Norio Wakamoto as recurring villain Hol Horse, a perfect fit if there ever was one. The less said about the dub, the better... there isn\'t a single passing-grade performance in there. The ADR job is noticeably half-assed, and none of the actors know how to emote. The soundtrack is not particularly noticeable, but is largely inoffensive.Overall, while JoJo\'s Bizarre Adventure is a somewhat dodgy series, it is still enjoyable, and I\'d still recommend it as something of an advert for the manga. It only has a small fraction of the actual content, which gives good incentive to read the manga. On top of that, seeing this beforehand makes the less-than-stellar first arc function as something of an origin story, rendering it more interesting than it otherwise would be.Final Words: Not that good on it\'s own, but still an entertaining watch and a good introduction to JJBA as a whole.Story/Plot: 5/10Characters: 7/10Animation/Art: 4/10Music: 5/10Japanese track: 9/10English track: 1/10Overall: 5/10For Fans Of: Fist of the North Star, Shaman King the attention of his grandfather, Joseph Joestar (the protagonist of the previous arc, Battle Tendency), who knows something about the spirit in question.As it turns out, the spirit is something called a ""Stand"" (named as such because they typically stand beside the user), a manifestation of the user\'s will, brought about in a variety of ways.

This is the first JoJo animation I have watched so I really didn't know what to expect from the series, but what I got after completion was a fighting anime that left me wanting more.. YES the ever so popular 2012 version.This anime was far from perfect though as there were times where I was bored and not all the characters were developed as strongly as I hoped. The intro to 4 out of 7 or so of this anime began getting on my nerves and I...began wishing they had decided to use a real opening or at least something different. JoJo 2000 is nowhere near the best action anime to grace the anime industry, but was still a fun joyride that proves even somewhat older anime can be as enjoyable as the newer anime.The ending was a bit of a letdown, but that is most likely because I am so unaware of the JoJo franchise and what to expect timeline wise.If you are a fan who enjoys mostly new anime.. find some time to try this hidden gem! It may motivate you to try out the 2012 version just like me.. and this as said coming from a JoJo noob. began wishing they had decided to use a real opening or at least something different.

Though the second half, especially the last three episodes, is noticeably superior.)Yes, it is certainly bizarre.JoJo is the thinking man\'s surrealist DBZ. Except instead of endless 3-frame loops of tedious ""fight animation"" it has sudden, subtle, blink-and-you\'ll-miss-it fight scenes. In it, weird fighters use weird powers in weird ways; typically by outwitting -- rather than merely overpowering -- their opponents.The series\' greatest strength is the unexpected, shocking oddity of it. Whenever you think the series is about to devolve into fighting game cliche, something utterly bugfuck happens. A villain will...gleefully and intentionally decapitates himself to show his badassery. A dog addicted to coffee flavored chewing gum kicks ass with a voodoo sandstorm. Somebody telekinetically stops his own heart. A man with two left hands...I-I-I can\'t explain it. Oh, did I mention that most characters are named after random popstars?The greatest weakness is the needlessly idiotic character models. Each character model includes numerous, distracting, embarrassing design choices like stupid clothes, inexplicable hair and mindbogglingly moronic jewelry. Jotaro\'s has a 50 lb chain hanging from his lapel and a hat that might be just a visor made of hairgel. Abdul (named after singer Paula Abdul) has hair like an untidy pile of soupcans and a necklace which might actually be the world\'s heaviest and least comfortable set of earrings. Even the final boss, Dio Brando, looks like a Hakuto no Ken villain re-imagined by Bronies. And then there\'s Polnareff. Fucking Polnareff. Good lord, Dorkula...cut back on the styling mouse, dude. You look like a cracker cosplay of the skinny guy from Kid\'n\'Play!Only two characters aren\'t dressed like retarded clowns: Joseph Joestar, who looks like Richard Branson cosplaying as Indiana Jones; and Iggy....who is a dog and therefore doesn\'t wear fucked-up clothes or psychotic earrings.Story.Although it descends into wonderfully addlepated madness in the details, the overall plot can be boiled down to: Team of super-powered badasses travel around the world to kick the Big Bad Evil Guy is his smug face. After fighting all his super-powered henchmen first. Rinse Repeat.ArtThe art is nothing special. Perfectly workmanlike if you can get past the insane character models I ranted about above.SoundThe sound effects used by the various Stands were oddly memorable, unlike the music which left no impressions at all. The voice acting (in the English dub) was slightly above average.CharacterAlthough each character is initially off-putting, they do grow on you. Yes, even Polnareff won me over.EnjoymentThis series is viscerally fun and memorably deranged. It doesn\'t merely zig when you expect it to zag. It zrbft\'s and then zlrfts.This is would DBZ would be like if it wasn\'t vapid, and what BoboBo BoBoBoBo would\'ve been if that show hadn\'t lived off a diet of paint chips and monoxide. gleefully and intentionally decapitates himself to show his badassery.

However that doesn't mean I feel this OVA is bad it's just we live in 2017 and a better adaptation exists. The first thing to note is that while this is the second part to be released it should be watched first as it is the first half of the story.ArtSince it is the second part the animation is made to match the first 6 episodes released...in 1993. Which for the reason previously stated is why I can give it a pass for a series that came out from 2000 to 2002, if it wasn't for that strange schedule of release I would expect way more.StoryThe story for the most part follows the manga although it omits and abridges certain parts such as the lesser stand battles. Odds are that your favorite character is still here though. Really there isnt alot to complain about as every major part of the story is still here.SoundNow I cannot remember a single composition in this series, It's largely forgettable when it comes to the music. The biggest reason I couldn't appreciate the Voice overs is that even the video game that pre-dates this has a much better Voice over. The voices here are a bit unremarkable but by no means awful unless you're watching the English dub in which the voices seem completely disconnected from the characters as if someone was just talking over the anime.Now in conclusion I still found this enjoyable as it was another piece of Jojo to watch but I can only recommend it to people who have seen and love all the other Jojo Anime. If you haven't I'd say go ahead and watch the newer version as it's the full story and a much better adaptation. in 1993.

Sadly the weird self depricating humor that the series is known for is almost completely gone. The whole thing takes itself really seriously and that works as a detriment to some of the most riddiculous moments (like Joseph...smashing the camera with his stand in order to produce a nude photo of the family's arch enemy whose head is posessing his grandfather). Sadly the voice acting and sound design fall flat, but I don't know if it is caused by the performances or the fact that I got used to the over the top voice acting kown from the modern adaptation of Stardust Crusaders. Overall I wouldn't recommend this OVA to anyone not fammiliar with the original but it's a cool thing that it was made. smashing the camera with his stand in order to produce a nude photo of the family's arch enemy whose head is posessing his grandfather).

The animation cuts out many of the parts where action is supposed to be happening to focus on the uninteresting reactions. I didnt mind how they restructured the story to condense it down but they didnt take advantage of condensing it in any way.

It differs from the source material in two main ways: minor plot details are changed to make it flow better within seven 30-minute episodes, and anything comedic is completely omitted. Your opinion will depend on what you think of these changes. I very much enjoyed this series for them. The changes give a main villain to the story arc, instead of the protagonists only fighting unrelated bad guys of the week. The serious tone well suits the stoic, observant character of protagonist Jotaro Kujo— he comes across as mature and pragmatic at first...impression rather than off-puttingly rude. The seriousness also reins in the over-the-top behavior of other characters that otherwise would threaten to overshadow his quiet presence. Even the opening gets right to the point: depicting the gruesome death of Jotaro's ancestor Jonathan Joestar lets the viewer know what the protagonists are up against.The art is striking and detailed, with subdued but beautiful colors, and seems to draw some influence from Western comics. There is a questionable-quality frame here and there but not enough to detract from my enjoyment. The music is old-school synth stuff that fits the visual style and tone of the series well.If you're a big fan of old-school anime and/or JoJo, I recommend this one. As with many older OVA, make sure you watch the subtitled version since the English dub is not good. impression rather than off-puttingly rude.

Sure thing, because everyone loves animals. Some of us have pets, some of us don't. Nevertheless, we humans like to spend time and play with them, be it at the zoo or even at home. Dogs and/or cats are certainly the pets that many have and without any doubts, they are adorable animals.Follow the everyday life of our manga artist Matsumoto-san who is based on the author of the series. She is the proud owner of a dog AND a cat. Every day she experiences new problems and adventures with them, but she still loves both animals very much. We...don’t only experience their happy everyday moments, but also sad ones when she thinks about her previous pets that she played with as a child. Although she only lives in an apartment and does not own a house, all three friends still find a cozy place.Her dog, Inu-kun is a small gray dog with fuzzy ears, a top and a tail. He's always in a good mood, no matter what happens. Even if the cat makes nonsense, he immediately forgives her and happily begins to sing and dance. He looks forward to every new day.The cat Neko-sama, on the other hand, has a very intimidating face that would scare anyone outright. Nevertheless, he is a good boy at heart and radiates his coolness everywhere. The animals are also based on the author's real-life pets.The art style is simple but cute, it is very similar to the manga version. You certainly can't expect wild and crazy animations, but it gives the viewers a very comfortable feeling. You feel at home.Both theme songs are quite similar. With happy music, they radiate a happy mood to us. It's not an orchestral masterpiece obviously, but the simplicity fits it perfectly. With Kana Hanazawa as the dog's voice actor, we also have one of the most popular seiyuu nowadays. Dogs cannot speak human language, but you can feel the joy from the happy barking. Also, the matching deep cat voice is spoken by a popular voice actor: Tomokazu Sugita.You had a busy day and just want to switch off for two minutes? Or just briefly on the toilet? Then this is the perfect anime. Take a little break and enjoy the happiness that pets bring to us people. The acts are simple but fun and cute. don’t only experience their happy everyday moments, but also sad ones when she thinks about her previous pets that she played with as a child.

As an owner of a Dog I can really relate to the main character of this anime.This anime basically is all about our protagonist Matsumoto Hidekichi and her daily life with her 2 pets being a Tsundere Cat and Energetic Cute Little Dog.I don\'t know much about Cats so I don\'t know if Cats being Tsundere is true or not. But it doesn\'t change the fact that Hidekichi\'s reaction to Cat\'s Tsundere moments is freaking funny...and cute. But as an owner of a Dog I absolutely loved how they presented the Dog as an energetic , always excited and one who always wants to play which is the right way to present. It\'s not like I am implying that Dogs in real life always wants to play but most of the time they do. And our main character is just a normal girl who loves her pets no matter what they do. Which I absolutely relate to. I love my Dog even if he shits on my bed and I have to do the cleaning. Everything the main character deals with is relatable , funny and cute.Dogs getting excited to see you back after you went out for few hours , they looking at you excitedly when you are about to clean their shit , they asking for you to pet them etc are something I deal with almost everyday which is presented pretty well in this anime. Hidekichi dealing with Tusndere behaviour of Cat is extremely fun to watch as well. Cat not forgiving her for accidentally sitting on his tail , Cat being jealous of the other pet she got , Cat feeling disgusted of his own shit etc were fun to watch as well even if I have no experience like that IRL.The Voice acting in this anime is great. As Cat and Dog are VA\'ed by 2 of the most well known and praised Voice Actors\xa0 ( Sugita Tomokazu and Hanazawa Kana ) they absolutely nailed the voices of Dog and Cat according to their character.Hanazawa Kana\'s cute high pitched voice completely fits with the energetic nature of a Dog while Sugita Tomokazu\'s deep antagonistic voice fits with how Cat is presented in the show. And same can be said for the main character as well.The artstyle in this anime is not remarkable by any means but as it is a 1 and a half minute gag show about 2 pets and an owner the artstyle fits well and its CUTE. The reaction of the MC and the funny faces she makes is only possible because of the artstyle it has. I can\'t imagine this being as funny as it is now if it actually had great artstyle.Untill now I have enjoyed every single episode of it. Its relatable, funny and cute and what more do you want from a SoL anime about pets and an owner ?Inu to Neko is an anime that I am always excited for.

Kiniro Mosaic,https://myanimelist.net/anime/16732/Kiniro_Mosaic,"['Don\'t you just hate it when an anime looks like it\'ll be good and then turns out to not be so?Seriously, I really want to like this show. I really do. The first episode was so sweet, so charming, and reminded me so much of Ikoku Meiro no Croisee, I didn\'t mind having a nice little slice of life anime to watch. I didn\'t have any expectations at first as I didn\'t know much about it, but when I saw the first episode, I thought it\'d be a nice exploration of cultural differences similar to how Ikoku Meiro no Croisee was. I thought it\'d be...a really cute and sweet and interesting serious, without getting into borderline saccharine and moeness. I thought it\'d be different from those other cute girls do cute things anime that have been swamping the industry lately. Boy was I wrong. After the first episode, it just basically said, ""you wanted an interesting slice of life anime?! Ha ha! Tricked you! Well, too bad! Here are some unfunny moe blob antics where everybody acts like idiots over the stupidest things!""...yeah. Thanks for stomping all over my expectations, Kiniro Mosaic. Now I feel like I went through the second season of K-On again, and THAT in itself wasn\'t a pleasant experience!The story is about a girl named Shinobu who, as a kid, went to stay with a family in England for a while. She knows no English but that doesn\'t seem to bother her. She meets a girl named Alice (Seriously, what\'s with Japan\'s obsession with the name Alice? If they really had that much trouble coming up with a name for her, they should have gone on some websites or something! I would have named her something more English, like Adriana or Amy or Jolie or Cassie!), who at first doesn\'t like her due to being ridiculously shy, but soon warms up to her. After spending time with her, Alice soon finds a very good friend in Shinobu. After Shinobu leaves, Alice vows to learn Japanese and go to Japan someday to meet her friend again. Years later, Alice gets her chance and manages to transfer to Shinobu\'s school. Her Japanese is fluent and she stays with Shinobu during her stay in Japan. Soon, her other friend Karen joins the picture, along with Shinobu\'s friends Yoko and Aya.As far as the animation goes, visually, its pretty and very beautiful. I like the soft colors it uses on everything, like flowers on trees and the insides of houses. It really looks like a watercolor painting come to life. But as far as character movements go, it\'s rather minimal, looking just like any other anime that just focuses on looking pretty and having characters do stuff nobody in real life would do. Personally, the animation is pretty much this show\'s saving grace mostly because it\'s easy on the eyes, though at times some things do look a bit blurry. I do like how skillfully it uses a lot of pinks and yellows, and not just for hair colors either. Unfortunately though, the character designs are really bland and uninteresting. Normally this would be a good thing, but everyone here just looks like a bunch of moe stereotypes, made to act like moe stereotypes too, which certainly doesn\'t help.The music is nice too, and surprisingly varied for a moe show. It doesn\'t limit itself to just one tune, and for the most part, it does its job well. There\'s soft piano tunes, nice classical tunes, comedic pieces, etc. They all do their job well...but not even this could save the show from derailing into stupid moe antics. I\'ll discuss the first one one seriously glaring flaw that\'s really starting to bug me: what\'s with Japan and their belief that any and all English/American people are blonde with blue eyes? Not all Americans and English people have blue eyes and blonde hair! I\'m American and I have dark brown hair and green eyes. I actually read somewhere that back in the forties or fifties, the Japanese asked Osamu Tezuka to make Japanese people in his stories have blonde hair and blue eyes, and this was after World War 2 ended! Seriously, talk about doing a complete 180! I don\'t know if this is a cultural thing or not, but the Japanese really need to see that not all Americans and English people have blonde hair and blue eyes, or even foreign people in general. Gunslinger Girl took place in Italy, and not everyone in that anime had blonde hair and blue eyes, save for only a few characters.The characters...oh God, how the anime flanderized them over the course of the anime! In the beginning, Shinobu just started off as an innocent girl in another country, but later on she became a full on, squeaky voiced ditz! All the other characters are bland and don\'t change over the course of the anime, and they all fit their molded stereotype. Shinobu is a straight up ditz, Yoko is perky, Aya is a tsundere, Karen is loud and hyper. Heck, even the teacher is a moe stereotype! No teacher I know acts the way she does! Alice is the only one with some depth to her, but even then it\'s forced and superficial. Oh God, I HATE Aya. She started off as the level headed one of the group, someone I\'d actually like, but later on all she does is blush and jump to conclusions about everything! I wanted to bash her head in every time she reacted to something or even opened her mouth! And as much as I like her seiyuu, her voice wasn\'t helping matters. Heck, for that matter, EVERYONE I know has a squeaky voice! No teenagers I knew sounded like they did! God, by the time the third episode came around I wanted them to just shut up, their voices were that grating! Seriously, I hope Sentai dubs this anime and gives them all realistic sounding girl voices! One thing I love about anime dubbing is that English dubbers often give girls in moe shows realistic voices, Air and Kanon being the best examples, and it works. But yeah, they rely too much on their assigned gimmicks to be funny (which they aren\'t) and they\'re completely shallow and uninteresting. Plus, trying to act like five year olds clearly doesn\'t help here, and the forced, artificial voice acting just makes it worse.So yeah. Kiniro Mosaic is just yet another unfunny cute girls do cute things like idiots show meant to rake in some cash. The characters are boring, the voice acting is horrid, the jokes got old fast, and the show in itself is...well, if you like moe girls, give it a go.

Otherwise, give it a miss.', 'First review!Overall, not a bad show, but not a fantastic one either. Let\'s get into it!~Art & Sound~VERY cute/moe/sparkle-y art. Nothing breathtaking, but no real problems. Has some cute moments in alternate art styles.OP and ED were pretty good, but nothing really special. Not much to comment on. However, it is worth noting that sometimes, the ED would randomly play, like, 8 minutes into the episode. Then there\'d be ~13 more minutes of content after it, and THEN the episode would end. It was weird. Why did they do this? WHO KNOWS.Both Art and Sound...-  8/10.~Characters & Plot~The characters are supposed to be the shining, glorious star of slice of life. This show didn\'t really have that. The characters weren\'t BAD, but for a slice of life show, the characters have to be SUPERB. Why were they not superb in this show? Well, that ties in with the plot.The plot was by far the biggest problem for me. This is because, well, there was ALMOST ENTIRELY ZERO PLOT. Of course, this is slice of life, so that\'s sort of the point, but this show seemed to deliberately avoid/defuse any situation that could have lead to development.This show (like many other slice of life shows with cute girls), hinted at yuri pretty often. But this show did it A LOT. Almost every episode there\'s a romantic moment that could easily end in some sort of loving embrace, but instead ends with someone (normally Alice) smiling with twinkling eyes, and saying ""okay!"". And then 2 minutes later they pretend like it never happened.Most slice of life shows use tiny touches of yuri implications for comedic purposes. However, in this show, the feelings felt a lot more real and grounded. Yet, nothing ever goes anywhere. Obviously, Alice likes Shino. DOUBLE OBVIOUSLY, Aya likes Yoko.""You\'ve shown up in my dreams a lot lately.""  .~*sparkle-y image of yoko, and blush*~.-Aya, to YokoREALLY? That\'s full romance. Don\'t bullshit me. Don\'t worry though, this isn\'t really a spoiler, because all the feelings are pretty evident early on- even from the first episode. I mean, I\'m not asking for another freaking Sakura Trick here, but come on, give me SOMETHING. You could literally watch the first episode, and then watch the last episode, and you wouldn\'t even know that all those little romantic moments happened.It\'s pretty clear why things were done like this. This way, the creators of the show can say ""well, teecchnniicallllyy, there\'s no yuri in the show"", and that makes the show less weird, and therefore more easily accepted by the general public. Yaaaayy. By staying in the gray area, sure, that problem is solved, but the show feels a little bland as a result. Now, I see there\'s going to be a second season, but I\'m fairly certain nothing will actually come to fruition in that, either.There\'s always the comedy though, right? Sort of. The comedy isn\'t all that great either. The humor is pretty repetitive, and it was very rare for a funny moment to actually be genuinely laugh-able.Character - 7/10Plot         - 5/10~Enjoyment~The romantic set-ups got my hopes up and then went nowhere. I was always waiting for that MOMENT of feeling realization that never came. I knew it wouldn\'t come, since this is slice of life, but I COULDN\'T HELP IT OKAY I LIKE ROMANCE AND IT WAS TEASING ME. The relatively lackluster comedy that often defused the romantic moments probably added to the frustration a bit. Of course there were quite a few entertaining portions, but certainly not enough.Enjoyment - 6/10~Overall~Cute art, good-ish comedy, half-baked romance, and a partridge in a pear tree. If you want something cute and easy to watch, without too many crazy laughs, check this one out. Just don\'t get too hooked into the implied yuri moments (like me), or you\'ll be disappointed. It\'s certainly a passable slice of life show, but in my opinion, it\'s not much more than that.Overal - 6.5/10 -  8/10.~Characters & Plot~The characters are supposed to be the shining, glorious star of slice of life.

Now, I see there\'s going to be a second season, but I\'m fairly certain nothing will actually come to fruition in that, either.There\'s always the comedy though, right? Sort of. The comedy isn\'t all that great either. The humor is pretty repetitive, and it was very rare for a funny moment to actually be genuinely laugh-able.Character - 7/10Plot         - 5/10~Enjoyment~The romantic set-ups got my hopes up and then went nowhere. I was always waiting for that MOMENT of feeling realization that never came. I knew it wouldn\'t come, since this is slice of life, but I COULDN\'T HELP IT OKAY I LIKE ROMANCE AND IT WAS TEASING ME. The relatively lackluster comedy that often defused the romantic moments probably added to the frustration a bit. Of course there were quite a few entertaining portions, but certainly not enough.Enjoyment - 6/10~Overall~Cute art, good-ish comedy, half-baked romance, and a partridge in a pear tree. If you want something cute and easy to watch, without too many crazy laughs, check this one out. Just don\'t get too hooked into the implied yuri moments (like me), or you\'ll be disappointed. It\'s certainly a passable slice of life show, but in my opinion, it\'s not much more than that.Overal - 6.5/10', 'Welcome to Golden Mosaic, or Kiniro Mosaic. The anime that was overshadowed by the popular 2013 anime that was hyped during it\'s airing. While being a big slice of life fan, this anime is definitely one that that brought out the comedy of every day simple things while also bringing a little hint of soft yuri.The story is following the groups daily lives in school and outside just hanging out. The anime opens with an english scene that lasts about the first half of the first episode making it a great opening that made me laugh with the accents that they spoke with. The art...is really cute and looks like a typical ""moe"" so to speak, but has great detail in the background and the little scenes where they made them look a lot more chibi than usual. The characters are all interesting with their personalities and definitely one of the strong points of the anime.

Overall this anime is one that is under the radar, and definitely worth anyone\'s time to watch.', 'Raise your hands if you thought this was going to be a moe yet fulfilling tale of two girls from different cultures discovering each others\' worlds, like Ikoku Meiro no Croisee...and not just another K-On/Lucky Star clone.I was drawn in by the first episode, in which ditzy Anglophile Shinobu participates in a student exchange program and stays with shy, skittish English girl Alice Carteret (OF COURSE she has blonde hair). Despite both girls knowing only the words ""hello"" and ""konnichiwa"" in each others\' respective languages, they make some sweet memories together and become fast friends. So when Alice comes to Japan to meet up with...her pen pal, we think we\'ll see some steadily paced introduction to Japanese culture through gaijin eyes and musings about how we\'re not really so different in the end et cetera et cetera. Of course, perhaps we should\'ve been tipped off about the reality by the fact that first (and best) episode was largely anime-original; the manga just had the scene of Shinobu and Alice yelling ""Hello!"" and ""Konnichiwa!"" at each other.So naturally, what we get, as I said, is yet another K-On clone, with most scenes built around misunderstanding jokes and very light teasing with plenty of cute shaking, blueface, or blank white (or in Alice\'s case, blue) eye reactions. There\'s even an ersatz Azunyan in the form of Aya, being egged on by a Ritsu wannabe. Even their Christmas cake teacher (OF COURSE she is; you know all this by now, right?) acts like her quivering, flighty students. Meanwhile, the whole ""innocents abroad"" theme is only barely returned to again, even after Alice\'s energetic ""hafu"" friend Karen arrives to fill the ""genki girl"" quota; what we thought would be the focus of the story is pushed to wayside by embarrassed squiggle lines and ""EEEEEEEHHHHH"" moments.Perhaps I\'m not the proper person to write a review for this anime since, like I said, I was expecting something like Ikoku Meiro in modern times, and with the Japanese/Westerner roles reversed. And while I certainly enjoy some moe moments...c\'mon guys, why give up such a compelling start for yet another schoolgirl show?

Do we really need yet another A-Channel?', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)When it comes to anime, something that it does right, or at the minimum what it does well, is cute. From characters, to story, and everything in-between, cuteness is prevalent in most modern shows, to the point that it sparks huge debates about it being supersaturated. Despite the controversy, Kiniro Mosaic steps up to the plate, bringing along a delightful little anime that is sure to make anyone smile.STORYKiniro Mosaic begins with the sweet little Shinobu, visiting England to study abroad. There, she becomes best friends with Alice, who, a few years later, goes to Japan to live...and attend school with Shinobu in return.Above all else, this show does two things very nicely: humor and cuteness. The comedy for the show stems mostly from the way in which the characters react to the current situation and also heavily on the personality or character quirks of the specific characters. Often times, as an audience member, you will know exactly what is going to happen next, but this doesn\'t necessarily detract from the laughs. Instead, part of the fun is actually anticipating how Shinobu and Alice will act during specific situations. At the same time, the amount of adorable moments is off the charts. All of the blushing, name-calls, whimpering, happiness, and mannerisms compound to the point that its almost unfair. There isn\'t a time on-screen where a character isn\'t being as cute as humanly possible.This being said, the comedy and cuteness isn\'t for everyone. To be honest, a lot of what goes on during the show can get somewhat repetitive. The same gags usually make their way into the show, such as Alice\'s and Karen\'s English, Aya\'s closet-yuri feelings, and Shinobu\'s love for all things foreign. This is an issue that is born from the character\'s themselves. Since there really isn\'t a story to be had, what we get is the characters being who they are for twelve episodes.Speaking of story, the show is essentially a slice-of-life. It does an interesting mix of small and episodic segments that don\'t really flow well together. Each part within an episode may be endearing and fun to watch, but the smaller, twenty-second sections somewhat break up the ""focus"" that the episode was attempting to establish.ANIMATIONMosaic tends to stick with a mostly plain looking art-style. In regards to the environments, the locations are generally rather typical, such as Shinobu\'s house or the school grounds. The world doesn\'t feel very ""alive"" because that isn\'t where the show focused a lot of its attention.Rather, this attention was placed heavily on the characters. While the character designs for Alice and Karen are the only notable ones, the ""minimalist"" or ""chibi"" drawings of everyone during the show once again elevate the cuteness level to new heights. The smaller, oval eyes, their dazed expressions, and Yoko\'s single fang help make the entire experience that much more fun.In regards to the shows actual animation, for the most part it is somewhat above average. The characters are generally pretty lively, always moving about one another to either participate in teasing or to react to someone\'s phrasing. The show also employs many different tricks to express the character\'s current feelings, from brooding and melancholy auras to sparkling and dazzling lights. Much of it isn\'t technically needed, but reiterating the point once more, it allows for the show to take one more step in the comedic and adorable direction.CHARACTERSWhile none of the characters from Kiniro Mosaic are memorable, they all perform their jobs quite admirably.My least favorite from the bunch (which isn\'t saying much) is Yoko. Mature, tomboyish, and understanding, she\'s the first one in the group who will point out the obvious. More often than not, she won\'t play along with the group mentality, and instead bring everyone back down to reality. Her constant grounding and usually fourth-wall breaking humor makes her the ""audience\'s voice"" during the whole show.Aya, or Karen\'s incredibly cute nickname for her, Ayaya, is smart, kind, and a romantic at heart (I can relate here). Her suppressed feelings towards Yoko are adorable and hilarious at the same time, and her inability to cope with external pressures make her a great addition to the cast. She doesn\'t usually say much, instead letting her actions speak for themselves.Shinobu is technically the MC. Always optimistic, her love for anything related to English knows no bounds. Her smile is infectious, her friendship with Alice is too cute for words, and her general behavior and likability allow her to not only bring happiness to the rest of the cast but also to the audience who watch her.Alice is ""moe"" incarnate. Small, blonde, and so adorable it hurts, she\'s the kind of character people either love to love or love to hate. Her motivations for doing anything almost always revolve around Shinobu, and her friendship towards Shinobu, likewise, is as tight as could possibly be. Alice cries at the thought of not being beside her best friend, having Shinobu taken away, or when anything even remotely trivial happens to Shinobu. Acting pretty much as a little sister, there just wouldn\'t be a Kiniro Mosaic without her.Arguably the best character from the anime, Karen is also a foreign exchange student. Pretty, energetic, and jubilant, she makes it her mission to always have fun. Her broken Japanese, coupled with her springy attitude, make it nigh impossible to keep a straight face whenever she appears. She loves to joke around, hang out with her friends, and really just be herself. While she may be seen as the ""fifth-wheel"" for the group early on, it becomes apparent later on that she is anything but.SOUNDThe OP for the show is pretty generic. While upbeat and lively as the show itself, besides the ""one-two-three"" beat that it incorporates at certain points during the piece, it\'s nothing that really strikes a chord or stands out on its own.The ED is slightly better. They chose to go with a jazzy song, probably to be a bit more ""western"" due to the overall higher amount of English present in this show when compared to others. The actual song is fine, using a mix of both English and Japanese. Again, it\'s nothing amazing, but it does edge out the OP.The soundtrack overall is average. If anything, my favorite ""piece"" was the piano transition usually heard at the half-way point that accompanied the ""Kiniro Mosaic"" frame.Above all else, this one earns a rather interesting title: best English voice acting. The characters that do speak English, the most important being Alice, Karen, and Alice\'s Mom, all speak English very well in comparison to any other English I have heard from anime. When I first started hearing it, I was actually taken aback by how nicely it was being done.Lastly, Karen\'s VA, Nao Touyama, nails it, allowing Karen\'s character to flourish in terms of personality and cuteness.ENJOYMENTThis show has probably one of the best first episodes for a series I have ever seen. It is almost movie-quality, with its wide-screen, great voice acting, good use of emotion, and easy-to-follow premise. And yet, it\'s only twenty-five or so minutes long. I was actually slightly disappointed when the rest of the show didn\'t follow the same trend, but I think it would have been unrealistic to have the same level of dedication throughout.Yet, the show slightly proves me wrong with its final episode, and more specifically its final ten minutes. It tries something vastly different from the rest of the show, and oddly enough it works.It\'s important to understand just how cutesy this show is. Nearly every character is a ""moe-blob,"" some more than others. As such, the show\'s characters rely greatly on the audience taking a liking to them. If one is not a fan of incredibly adorable girls acting beyond cute during all predicaments, then that person will have a hard time liking the show. Thankfully, I\'m quite the fan of such charming archetypes.This anime is super sweet, funny despite its repetitiveness, and in very specific areas tries something outside of its comfort zone. If someone is looking for a show in which to sit back, relax, and smile profusely, then he/she needs to look no further than Kiniro Mosaic.SUMMARYStory: Fine, funny, cute, yet repetitiveAnimation: Good, mostly plain but actual animation accentuates the comedy and cutenessCharacters: Good, their personalities and quirks fit the genre quite nicelySound: Good, okay OP, ED, soundtrack, ""Best English VA Award""Enjoyment: Great, ""moe"" to the maxFinal Score: 7/10 and attend school with Shinobu in return.Above all else, this show does two things very nicely: humor and cuteness.

Then i saw this: God! I was  so happy that I started watching this when it was finished.Story = 7 - The plot of the 1st episode was Language Barriers, but when it progressed, it just turned into 2 British girls living and adapting in Japan, hearing Engrish and broken Japanese made my day even more! The story isn\'t complex and deep.Art = 7 - I don\'t really care about the art,...but the artist did what they can to make this show light and fluffy. So kudos to them.Sound = 8 - As for sound, the seiyuus who provided the voice here are part of a group, they sung the OP and ED, both were catchy and cute, it can give you a heart-attack if your not careful. They even managed to squeeze a musical, w/c made the OSTs much better.Character = 8 - before i start writing this, after watching lots of all-girls/SoL animes, I can classify the main cast into categories:Boke = idiot,Tsukkomi = straight-man,Airhead = always spaces out or in their own world,Ms.Perfect = has good grades and good at sports or has good grades but bad at sports, vice-versa, normally Ms.Perfect characters has a weakness or secret,Ojou-sama character = the insanely rich characters and;Moe characters = Cute characters that can give you heart-attacks with a simple glance.Shino = Airhead/Boke - she looks like a Japanese doll, she\'s extremely fascinated with foreigners especially blonde girls, it is unknown if she likes blonde boys anyway, Shino is basically an Airhead, she need someone to look after her, if not, she can pretty much be in trouble. There are even hints that Shino is a ninja/assassin. She wants to be an interpreter.Alice = Moe -  a blonde loli, that clearly likes Shino. Alice is a very interesting character, there are times she acts a Tsukkomi, but during those time Shino\'s the Boke, she can speak good English, in the 2nd episode (according to Youtube), she even had a""Cockney Accent"", when she said: ""Ms. Karasuma, your English is a little awkward!"". I had to pause at that part to laugh for 3 mins.Yoko = Boke/Tsukkomi - the show classified her a the main Tsukkomi, but IMO, Ayaya was the one playing Tsukkomi always. Energetic and loud, the big-sis of the main cast, because she really is a big-sis in real life. She\'s dependable, and according to Karen: ""Yoko is like a convenience store."", that\'s how dependable she is.Ayaya = Ms.Perfect/Tsukkomi/Moe - at first i could believe Risa Taneda voiced her, because Ayaya doesn\'t say ""Sempai"", but whenever Ayaya gets flustered she sounds like Mirai Kuriyama, so yeah, Risa Taneda voiced her alright. Anyway, Ayaya is like Mio of K-on, strict, serious, and unexpectadly moe, she plays Tsukkomi when Yoko, Shino and Karen play Boke. I loathe tsunderes with a passion, but Ayaya is okay.Karen = Ojou-sama character/Boke - when i first saw Karen, i thought: she was gonna be spoiled bitch, but, thank god i was wrong! When Karen arrived, this show even got more louder! Her Boke-ness is beyond Shino and Yoko combined, w/c is a surprise for me. Karen gives this show a lasting memory, because of her broken Japanese.Enjoyment = 9 - Hearing Engrish and broken Japanese in the same show is a new experience for me! This show was really fun to the point that I re-watch it a lot of times.Overall = 8 - With the basic formula of all-girls/SoL, add in some good random Engrish sentences, broken Japanese, blonde girl fetish, one-sided yuri love, closet Siscon and fluffyness  with a side of a light and relaxed atmosphere,  you get Kiniro Mosaic. but the artist did what they can to make this show light and fluffy.

Starting at three original friends quickly becomes 5 as the foreign friends become local classmates and with five very different personalities, the most unlikely...of friends make for some... cultured humorIt comes across as very bright and cutesy which is understandable for its aimed at younger age groups but at some points can become too much as the constant highlight of ""blonde hair"" either blends into the scene too much or it stand out so much so its the only thing that you end up focusing on. It really doesn\'t have a middle ground as the animes\' color plate seems very finite and can be displeasing to the eye.Music is matched to the art style to keep it a very cutesy child like portrayal but a lot of the time blends with the scene to the point where you don\'t notice it. It\'s used in many ways to amplify the scenes atmosphere or just a backing to make scenes flow smoother or make it seem a lot more calming. A for the voice acting, the ""English"" spoken by the European foreigners is utterly horrid and can almost cause bleeding ears. Even if it is spoken by Japanese VA\'s imitating a British accent.Characters are questionable as none seem really relate-able and each have a personality so far set from each other its sometimes hard to believe that they\'re friends. As for the development of the characters, these kinds of anime rarely have much in term on character development and this hold true for the most part. However that is not to say there isn\'t any but it\'s all within the first few episodes with little pieces over the next few episodes as well.Enjoyment was a bumpy ride as It comes with light yuri undertones and sometimes barely legal humor for an anime of its age demographic while also keeping its very bright and happy moments that make you just want it to hurry up and move on. It also has a lot of spontaneous humor that is quite spotty in its actual comedic value as some are laughable and others just make wonder if they were even trying to be funny when they put that in. But it still was overall a great comedy.Overall Score: 7/10 of friends make for some... cultured humorIt comes across as very bright and cutesy which is understandable for its aimed at younger age groups but at some points can become too much as the constant highlight of ""blonde hair"" either blends into the scene too much or it stand out so much so its the only thing that you end up focusing on.

No spoilers beyond season 1 though.Kiniro Mosaic is probably the most odd anime I have seen to date, A moe show with a cast of only female characters. It is a typical slice of life anime that takes place at the beginning of high school and progresses as the years go by. You dont go into Kiniro Mosaic expecting some deep, complex story line, quite the opposite actually.  Its simplistic and adorable nature makes each episode so enjoyable if hardly anything is really happening.Theres really only 5...characters you have to care about. Alice is pretty annoying and the best parts of the show are when she is not the focal point. Karen and Aya are the stars tbh, even though they are polar opposites. Karen is everything that makes this goofy & fun show wrapped into an immature high school girl. And Aya...well...I believe she is one of the best Slice of life characters I have ever seen in an anime. So much internally and emotionally is going on within her, it just feels so realistic compared to the typical annoying tsundere. The story development she gets throughout the two seasons, and ESPECIALLY in the movie is just amazing. Theres not a moment I didn\'t enjoy when it involved her.This may seem like an anime that you\'d never expect to watch, as its not ""your taste"". But I assure you that even if you are a huge shounen fan, you will love this just as much. In my opinion, a decent show that does everything it tries to do [perfectly] is a lot better than a show like HxH or Death Note, which has an extremely high ceiling at times but struggles with some major flaws. Kiniro Mosaic is there to be something you laugh at and brighten your mood. Its execution is near perfect. To feel nothing but positive emotions towards an anime is a very rare site, and thankfully Kiniro Mosaic delivered. AYAYA characters you have to care about.

Unfortunately, most of them either focus on fanservice, which can be offending to some, or on an oblivious male protagonist, which gets boring rather quickly, or on abstract moral values, which feels forced most of the time.Kin-iro Mosaic, on the other hand, has the right combination of ""cute"", light-hearted humor, moe exploitation, with just a dash of yuri undertone. The characters are easily recognizable and lovable. The interactions feel natural (at least in a comedic context). The background music fits each scene perfectly, without distracting from the overall enjoyment. The art is simplebut effective. It...doesn\'t try to solve social problems nor explore complex love stories, nor does it need to.The show does, however, lack that ""magical touch"" sometimes felt in KyoAni\'s or SHAFT\'s works. I could not find anything about this show to exclaim about besides the fact that it\'s very well-executed, but Kin-iro Mosaic still manages to put a stupid smile on my face for the full 24 minutes of each episode. Perhaps that\'s all it takes to make a great show. doesn\'t try to solve social problems nor explore complex love stories, nor does it need to.The show does, however, lack that ""magical touch"" sometimes felt in KyoAni\'s or SHAFT\'s works.

The ED is pretty good though and takes a leaf out of many slice of life anime and has the ED as the main characters singing and dancing together which works pretty well but other than that there are no real scenes where sound becomes important of all that great. In terms of voice acting that a whole different thing, it’s fine until the girls (who are apparently native to England) start sounding like bloody Google Translate and then my ears bleed but other than that its fine, and actually pretty cute.Character: the characters are similar to the characters of A channel but there are not many other defining features in the characters, there is not much time spent on back story so not much of the characters life gets revealed.Enjoyment/Overall: This anime was pretty enjoyable, I usually score anime high so if you are into anime as much as me I would take like 2 points off to get it to a reasonable score, as you can tell my biggest problem with the anime was the continuous use of bad English throughout it but other than that it was just another slice of life which means in lay-man’s terms ""It doesn\'t really matter what happened in the anime, the fact is it happened and it\'s not the end of the world if it didn\'t work out."" 5 school girls with two of the main characters being English (England), this creates a language based plot around the anime, however the idea of a girl from ENGLAND sounding like Google Translate kind of pisses me of and many times through the anime I found myself wanting to rip my ears of, otherwise the anime story wise is fine.Art: The art in Kiniro Mosaic is almost identical to the type used in A Channel, it may also to some people resemble the art in love lab, this art is cutesy and fairly normal for a slice of life like this one, the art itself has no effect on the anime other than extenuating cute features.Sound: Not really much I can say about this really, the OP isn\'t bad but isn\'t nearly as good as some of the more recent and memorable anime.

(The first one reaching MAL! so please bear with me!)Kiniro Mosaic is a Subtext heavy show about Moe girls in school,  a slice of life about 3 Japanese girls and 2 British Exchange students, each having funny characteristics and providing lots and lots of Yuri subtext that is both funny, and still hope giving for season 2, will it the next season actually hold an F/F relationship? or end with one? probably not but it wouldn\'t be jarring if it happened at allThe Character Design is probably the strong part of the Art in the...series, as they do stray form the classic ""All girls in same uniform"" by adding some personal flair to their school uniforms. and the style does a good job of being cute and somewhat colourful, though its Definitely not an eyegasm.As someone who really likes moe this reviews is probably(definitely) heavily biased in its score. if you do not enjoy moe take this review with a huge grain of salt. I even broke one of my dresses from going ""Kyaa!"" to hard at one point...a true 10/10 for any Moe fanThe Kaiters SealTit gets the Kaiters Seal of : Go watch it already! series, as they do stray form the classic ""All girls in same uniform"" by adding some personal flair to their school uniforms. and the style does a good job of being cute and somewhat colourful, though its Definitely not an eyegasm.As someone who really likes moe this reviews is probably(definitely) heavily biased in its score. if you do not enjoy moe take this review with a huge grain of salt.

When starting off, I only watched the first 3 or 4 episodes of the show and then quit hard. After forcing myself to give it another chance, all of that stuff happened. I also read some of the other reviews on here before posting mine. Here goes nothing...**STORY**I have to say that this show starts with a more ""story arc"" and narrative feel to it, but uses this as a backdrop for context moving forward. We\'re introduced to WHY there is a little blonde English girl...in freakin Japan, which to their credit (looking at the naysayers) is a LOT more than we get from other anime. So kudos to the Kinmoza team for actually putting in the effort instead of plopping characters into high school and going from there (something even Azumanga Daioh is guilty of to a certain degree). It\'s a Slice of Life Comedy and is quintessentially the ""Cute Girls Doing Cute Things"" anime genre in a nutshell. I am going to go into WAY more detail on this in the ""Character"" and ""Enjoyment"" sections, so I\'ll wrap this section up now. If you don\'t like CGDCT, just don\'t watch it...simple as that.**ART**The art is fantastic! The girls are super cute and the environments look great. I couldn\'t point out anything ""stylistically"" different, so this gets a 9 which is perfect in terms of quality. The low-quality expression-heavy animations are also cute, but this is common in other anime as well. The show is very GIF-able though!**SOUND**Voice acting seems good (I watched the sub) and I LOVE the music for Season 1 OP and ED! I\'m lumping Seasons 1 and 2 together on this, which is why it\'s a 9. The OP and ED were weaker for Season 2, not bad just not as good as Season 1\'s. Voice acting still seemed good in season 2 though.**CHARACTER**I\'ll let this be the first hop into the ""You don\'t \'get it\', apparently"" tangent which will be fully-explored in the ""Enjoyment"" section. Just let that statement simmer as it may apply to the naysayers of this series...I could write for hours about the girls, so I\'ll try and keep it brief and do it in paragraph instead of broken-down form. Alice is an adorable character, you love her to death and just wanna hug her. The relationship with her and Shino is really touching in episode 1, you get why they become friends and it\'s super endearing. You\'re introduced to Karen later on who grows on you a lot (quickly as well) though she has a rocky start. Yoko and Aya start off bland, but just need time to develop and you end up loving them too. Sakura, their teacher, is also quite lovable in the end.""Yeesh, not very detailed and sounds too positive"" is probably what some folks are thinking. Remember that comment about ""Getting it""? Here we go...**ENJOYMENT**If you don\'t like SoL comedy or CGDCT, I don\'t know why you are watching this to begin with, but this isn\'t aimed at you...though reading this might change your opinion on the show regardless.When I watched this the first time (remember my first paragraph? I QUIT this show hard after 3-4 episodes) my problem was that I didn\'t ""get it"" and I think some of the reviewers didn\'t either. I thought the show, and in particular AlicexShino, was nauseatingly sweety sweet to the point of making me want to vomit. The ironic thing is the show is absolutely aware and that\'s the joke. Maybe it\'s getting lost in translation, but the schtick is that you\'re laughing at how over-the-top Alice and Shino are, it\'s meant to be COMICAL. Once you realize THIS, it\'s like you\'re watching a completely different series (and I mean that, I rewatched the WHOLE thing).With that in mind, it\'s in essence making fun of sugary anime, the show is intensely more enjoyable. To think it\'s not would be like defining Kimura and Kaorin from Azumanga Daioh as a serious romance, or Konata\'s obsession with anime/manga as a serious psychological problem to be explored. You\'re completely missing the humor. This is also a feel-good anime, so while it\'s self-aware and comical it\'s also meant to be healing at the same time. I can never understand dissing a show for being exactly what it advertises (and even poking fun at it, as well).So with that in mind....**OVERALL**I love the show quite a bit, but for some folks the aesthetic might turn them off even though the show is fully aware of itself. I ran into the same thing with MLP Friendship is Magic (season 1, that is). If you can\'t get past the aesthetic, that\'s fine, but it\'s not a factor outside of personal preference. As another example from Western animation, the Powerpuff Girls also fits this. If the subtlety is lost on the viewer, they aren\'t going to see the humor in it. With that in mind, the show is great. Season 2 (Hello! Kiniro Mosaic) was also very enjoyable. It felt as though it picked right up where the other left off, unlike other anime. If you like season 1, check out season 2!! in freakin Japan, which to their credit (looking at the naysayers) is a LOT more than we get from other anime.

Since, I\'m a sucker for watching these type of anime series.~Story~The story is about a Japanese girl named Shino who visited and stayed at Great Britain. She met an English girl named Alice and the two became fast friends. Years later, Alice came to Japan and attended the same high school with Shino. They are now closer than before along w/ their other friends.8/10~Characters~The characters are mainly focused on these five girls: Ayaya, Karen, Shino, Alice, and Yoko. Mostly the main characters in this...series would be Shino and Alice. The girls are really enjoyable and have a very good relationship with each other especially between Shino and Alice.9/10~Art~The animation to this series is bright and colorful. It does give you the light-hearted feel of the animation. The character designs have the typical cutesy design to it. The animation can be related to A-Channel.8/10~Sound~I really love the music in this series. The background music has a really nice cute melody which sound very light-hearted that gives a good tone to this series. The OP and ED are the best. I really like the OP (Jumping!! by Rhodanthe) better since its really cheery and happy. I do also like the ED (Your Voice by Rhodanthe) song, too.9/10~Overall~This series is really enjoyable and nice to watch. The characters are entertaining, the relationship between these girls are good, and its one of those relaxing anime to watch. If you enjoy watching slice of life, or seeing ""cute girls doing cute things together"", or want to find a relaxing anime to watch, then I highly recommend this one. This goes for the people who enjoy watching K-On!, Lucky Star, A-Channel, etc.Final Score: 8/10 series would be Shino and Alice.

Maybe it’s a shounen show that you think is too similar to whatever you watched before or a drama where all the dramatic elements are in other shows, but worse.Well, I think this is the most generic show I have ever watched.Lucky-star and K-on are another two high school slice of life shows, both of which came out before KINMOZA! And even though I’m not the biggest fan of any of those, I can appreciate what they did for the genre.Lucky-star being one of the early high school anime from what I...know, and K-on developing the genre a lot. But I can’t say that for KINMOZA!So what was it about KINMOZA! that is so generic? Well, everything about it is made better in other high school shows. The music felt like either a knock-off of a lucky-star soundtrack or K-on. The animation was fine, but the character designs looked like children. They were supposed to look 15 but managed to look 5. But they didn’t do it for all characters, So they look really out-of-place. So unlike lucky-star that has a similar style (where the characters look really young), it isn’t consistent.The character tropes also felt just like K-on. There’s the smart one that is a little shy, the tomboy and the naive child. All of these tropes were made in K-on, and better. And they were just generally very boring and one-dimensional. Well except Aya and Youko who I actually really liked. They showed different sides of their personality and I found their relationship to be interesting.I know this review wasn’t great, but I didn’t want to put too much effort for this shit.Hey, at least I saw the ”oh my gahd” scene that made me watch the show from the beginning know, and K-on developing the genre a lot.

However, all of the review is centered on the characters alone, because I thought they did things that were unique from most cute girl anime like this one. So, if you are expecting a lot on the story...alone, well, I cover that in the next season since the characters took up too much of my time.But yes, it follows the usual cute girl doing cute things bit, I\'m sure every other popular review on here covers that. But, what stands out to me is how this one starts. Right off the bat, you see Japanese subtitles on the screen and the character is speaking ENGLISH. And, VERY fluent English at that. I give it high respect for making the voice actor speak genuine English, rather than pulling a fast one and just leaving her Japanese.I know most anime do have those little funny bits where a character does speak real English and everyone is confused, but whenever a main character speaks English, they just mask it with everyone not being able to understand that character or they have a light accent.So, right off the bat,, that caught my attention right away. It also made me have to put away the crunchy food because I was on a streak of watching subbed anime for the longest time and knowing I had to listen with my ears, for the first time in a while, what a character was saying was pretty surprising; given I was expecting this to be a sub, first of all.Of course, later on, we are in fact greeted with the usual Japanese when the anime finally begins with showing a house in what we found out was England. So, yes, an English speaking family in a subbed anime; quite unusual for a lighthearted comedy since making the actors speak that way must have been quite hard to pull off; especially since it is fluent. But, I\'m going on too much about that, but only because I thought it was very unique.Anyway, onto the part of the review that you want to read: how the anime actually is. So, as I said earlier, ""the usual Japanese"" I mean that the protagonist of the anime is introduced here; by the name of Shinobu, she goes to England for a homestay where she meets the family and we find out that the mom is capable of speaking Japanese herself to greet this foreigner. There was a scene before where she sees off her friends, and they are all fairly young here so I would pay attention if you want to catch some cute designs since this will be the only time you see them this way in present time of the anime.Now, back to the other thing, here is the real star of the anime: the blond haired girl named Alice. She hides behind her mom\'s posterior as she is greeting Shinobu. She speaks English in the entirety of the first episode and humorously attempts to speak Japanese to Shinobu; whom in return, attempts to humorously speak English. But, I will not try to spoil the whole introduction too much because it is quite hilarious.Now, later into the anime, we see the characters age quite a bit; with Shinobu having the most notable appearance change in her bangs now appropriately covering her forehead. The other Japanese characters are the ones we saw earlier, and they are the friends that Shinobu sees off. There is Aya, the only obvious personality in the entire anime as she sports a tsundere look, is very diligent, gets the homework done and all that. She is nothing too special by herself.But, here is where the second most interesting part of the anime comes in, as we are greeted to Yoko. She sports the usual tomboy act that almost all red haired female protagonists have. I have honestly not seen a tomboy female that has a different hair color than red, though I have only seen two anime with female tomboy characters that I am aware of.Yoko is quite reckless and brings forth most of the better comedy as she develops. She also sports the biggest chest of the rest of the females, though it is appropriately sized for her age and not over-exaggerated by the other characters. In fact, this is the first female anime comedy I have ever seen where the female characters do not heavily envy the one with the biggest bust the entire time; rather, they compliment it and most of the scenes doing so only have it for less than ten seconds most of the time, with no envy in any of them.But, no, that was not the second most interesting part of this anime, given I literally stated that I have seen tomboy females like Yoko before, though only once when I actually think about it. But, the interesting part is how Aya feels about Yoko. I was going to list this as a spoiler, but it is quite obvious when you see them together right away.But, Aya treats Yoko as though she is a real boy, gets really nervous when she is within her personal space and has occasionally fantasized at the idea of dating her. This caught me off guard big time as I have never seen something like this done before in these cute girl anime, especially one with a story like this one; and it gives their relationship a bit of flavor immediately because of how completely opposite they are from each other, which brings forth that infamous saying about lovers.It also does not help that Aya is so nervous around Yoko that she can not even do simple things like call, text or anything with her as though she were the love of her life and she stutters on every line that isn\'t a retort to Yoko; almost always when it is a compliment, she usually fails to recite what she was thinking properly which confuses Yoko every time. And Yoko, not being aware of Aya\'s feelings, still treats her like one of her casual female buddies; much to the discomfort of Aya.I saved the best of the Japanese characters for last, but now let\'s talk about the present Shinobu. My favorite thing about her is how she sports the least flashiest hair out of any of the other protagonists, even though she is the center of them; which reminds us that every protagonist does not need some wacky hairstyle to be considered cool. In fact, every other protagonist might very well outshine Shinobu in this regard if people judge characters based on their hair, too.But, look outside the cosmetics and Shinobu sports probably the best personality in the entire anime. She is extremely nonchalant, never gets mad (though does get agitated and usually only at her big sister that teases her; never her friends) and actually possesses a very professional talent for her age that is referenced throughout the entire anime. She wears extremely outdated clothes, though she is never ashamed of them and nobody judges her beyond the first glance of the outfit. She makes for such an interesting character that I would rather not go on about her as long as I did with Yoko and Aya and want to just leave the experience for you to see yourself.Now, you are probably wondering why I have suddenly neglected Alice, even though I admitted that I was a big fan of how she spoke very fluent English. Well, because she kind of stops speaking it in the present time as she finally learned Japanese and, like Aya, is very diligent in her studies and is the only other one that is, well, like this.It is a shame because I was hoping we would have more humorous moments with this, though they do make up for it by one of her infamous traits: whenever she is extremely stressed, she completely forgets how to speak Japanese and goes on English tantrums which happen a few times and confuse the crap out of everyone. She also speaks English a few times in the beginning in full sentences, non-stressed, but she slowly lets go of it as the anime goes on.(LIGHT SPOILER START)Funnily enough, despite one of Shinobu\'s career options being that she wanted to be an English interpreter, she never speaks English throughout the entire anime; besides the one greeting in her debut episode.(LIGHT SPOILER END)Wow, this went on for a pretty long time. I do not even know if I can call this a review, since all I did was go on about how much I loved the cast. But, I guess this will give you a good idea that they are not reeking heavily of generic personality traits, besides Aya; and that you might give the anime a chance. It will standout pretty well due to the English speaking Alice, alongside many more things that I left out just so that you could experience it for yourself.My reviews almost always go on about something without ever spoiling much, so I apologize if my devoid information did not convince you to watch this, but I feel like too many of the better reviews on here spoil a lot to the point where you barely do enjoy the anime if it is a comedy.One thing I would like to point out before I end this is something that is probably on your mind by this point:""This person is ending the review, claiming that they go on about all the protagonists; but what about the other blond girl in the poster?""Very good question. I did want to cover her as well, but I did not want to extend this for a very long time, so I only cover the first two episodes. Oops, light spoiler: you do not see her for a little while. Hah, oh well. But, this girl alone was probably the third most major reason why I stuck with this anime, because I spent many months tracking down where this girl debuted from after I saw memes that showed a few of her most memorable scenes and nobody EVER told me where she was from. So, I can say this much: you WILL like her, too.So, maybe this entire review was about only the characters, but I suppose this relates to the fact that they cover the entirety of the anime due to their unique traits and that the story is the usual generic ""high school socializing"" bit that you see in every cute girl anime ever made. They only standout from one another because of the characters, so I imagine almost every other review on here goes on about the characters more than the plot, anyway.Well, I hope you enjoyed the long read, though this review is probably my most scarce one yet on information about the anime itself. I hope I said enough to convince you to give Kiniro Mosaic a chance. alone, well, I cover that in the next season since the characters took up too much of my time.But yes, it follows the usual cute girl doing cute things bit, I\'m sure every other popular review on here covers that.

I hope I said enough to convince you to give Kiniro Mosaic a chance.', 'First impressions aren’t everything, and Kiniro Mosaic shows this well. Is that a bad thing? Not necessarily.The anime starts off with a rather strong premise given its nature as a Cute Girls Doing Cute Things (CGDCT) series. Main character Shinobu Oomiya takes part in a brief homestay in England, under the care of her mother’s friend. While there, she meets a girl her age, Alice, and after some initial awkwardness the two become friends. During their time together they break down language barriers to get to know each other while also learning more about their respective cultures. This is all done in a way that’s...fitting for this type of show, and all in all it was a great start.After such a strong opener, it wouldn’t be strange for one to expect more of these kinds of developments. However, the show instead begins to drift into a different direction, for better or worse. It is one that’s more standard for a CGDCT anime, but I still believe there are more positives than negatives to this approach.Story and Plot:Outside of the premise of connecting despite cultural differences and learning about others’ cultures, there isn’t much of a story to Kiniro Mosaic. In the first few episodes there is a more distinctive focus on the original premise, but after the main cast gets to know each other, things shift to a more typical formula. The show is mostly episodic with a series of loosely connected moments of the characters interacting with each other. These range from comedic bits to more wholesome and heartwarming moments between the cast. Most of the comedy stems from the cultural differences or characters acting absurdly in their affections for the others, while heartfelt moments also revolve around the difference in values along with the cast’s growing friendship. Overall, the anime offers a good mix of comedic and wholesome moments while continuing with the slice of life approach as the show progresses; this is all while it offers its own unique flair as it mostly builds on the foundation of the original premise.7/10Characters:This is probably Kiniro Mosaic’s strongest aspect. The main cast is rather small and the show revolves around five main characters: Shinobu, Alice, Aya, Youko, and Karen. Shinobu, along with Alice, is the token cutesy character. She is a fanatic of Western culture and has a strong obsession with blonde girls; these two traits are often played on for comedic effect. Alice comes from England and has learned Japanese in order to be with Shinobu in high school. She is typically shy but at the same time very affectionate of Shinobu. Aya is the smart and reliable one of the group who also gets flustered easily, especially around her best friend Youko. Youko is more of an outgoing “genki” girl and also a jokester, but at the same time also acts as the “straight man” in some cases. Karen also comes from England, but in contrast to Alice she is very easygoing and carefree, never hesitant to speak her mind. There are also recurring characters like the homeroom teacher and Shinobu’s sister to fill out the supporting cast.Coming into the show and having seen the legendary “Ayaya” scene, I figured that Karen would have stolen the show the moment she appeared. Surprisingly though, none of the main characters seemed to get special treatment, and no one was overshadowed by another. Each character gets their moments in the spotlight. Along with this, their antics and interactions with each other are a joy to watch. Definitely the highlight of the show.9/10Audio and Visuals:The anime’s opening is upbeat and energetic, certainly appropriate for the tone of the series. Meanwhile, the ending closely matches the energy of the opening, while being a little more lowkey as to befit an ending. As for the background music, it isn’t exceptional but it tends to fit the respective scenes quite well. For example, the exaggerated depiction of Western life is often accompanied by a classical music style. On the other hand, the slice of life scenes are typically complemented with what you would expect from a standard CGDCT/comedy show, with different tones depending on the mood.As for the art, the show is quite colorful and vibrant. But for the most part the art style and animation are fairly simplistic outside of the nice character designs. Particularly notable to me were the watercolor-esque backgrounds, most prominent in the early episodes when it came to showcasing the beauty of Western culture. I though the approach to background art was neat and went well with the show’s style. Overall, the production value isn’t too much to write home about but was still quite fitting.8/10Enjoyment:Looking back, I enjoyed this series a lot! When it had started to drift into the episodic format, I was a little worried that I would lose interest, but that wasn’t the case at all. There wasn’t a moment where I was outright bored of the show, and it gave me a lot of laughs and entertainment along the way. Equally so, the wholesome moments really resonated with me in addition to the overall message, despite the show’s seemingly simplistic nature at first glance. It also has some of the most endearing Engrish I’ve heard in an anime.9/10Overall: 8/10I think a good way to describe this show would be that it reels you in with its premise while still having more to offer outside of that. “Come for the premise, stay for the endearing characters and their interactions” might be a bit of a mouthful but explains it well enough. The first impression wasn’t everything to me, and I found a lot to love even as the series changed its pace. fitting for this type of show, and all in all it was a great start.After such a strong opener, it wouldn’t be strange for one to expect more of these kinds of developments.

Quick turn around for a silly, enjoyable show. I rank a lot of shows really high, often times too high, so I'm going for a bit more realism this time. Kiniro was a charming little show, but lacks in many areas that some might find important. We're going to take that all into consideration as we move through this review. Unfortunately with wall space becoming a huge premium on the RTLR wall, we won't be adding any blonde cuties to the wall today....Let's see if we can exchange this lack of posting into something more palatable. Of note, this is dealing only with season one, nothing else.Story: 5There's not much to really be had in the story department. First a Japanese girl does an foreign exchange in grade school, and ends up in a house with a cute as a button blonde British girl. They develop a friendship, and then Japanese girl goes home. Later on, during the first year of high school, the British girl makes it into the foreign exchange program, and wouldn't you know it, ends up drawing the home of the girl that had stayed with her years before. The two are reunited and get about living their lives in Japan. Later the British girl's good friend, a half English half Japanese follows her British friend to Japan and ends up in the same high school.So we end up with two native Japanese girls who are friends with the Japanese girl who did the exchange program, the exchange program Japanese girl herself, and two blonde British girls who round out the quintet of friends these girls form. The British girl, Karen, is not a exchange student, but is a half British, half Japanese girl who convinces her parents to return to Japan after her good friend Alice entered the exchange program. The rest of the show is the group getting into slice of life hijinks and just having a good time being teeny bopper girls and doing all the things girls that age do.Make no mistake, this is a 'cute girls doing cute things' anime, and has a great deal of 'moe' content. There is also light but noticeable shoujo ai/yuri content, as the former exchange student Shino has a very large crush on both British girls as they have blonde hair. She's obsessed with blonde hair and while there's no overtly sexual overtones presented, it's more than clear that she's kinda close to that line over their blonde appearance. There are also the two native Japanese girls who seem to have the budding of romantic links between them, especially the quieter, dark haired Aya in regards to outgoing Yoko. None of these really stray over the line of 'hinting' but they are most decidedly there. This gives the sugar sweet coating covering the show a bit of edge and interest.For the most part the story revolves around daily life and activities. Usually something comes up, a shopping trip, a beach trip, a school festival and we get Aya being totally nervous about it, and British Karen just totally becoming incredibly excited to participate in whatever it is. British Alice is only concerned as long as her exchange partner Shino is also interested, which works well as Shino bases her interest on what blondie Alice and Karen want to do.The show is broken up into several parts in most episodes, an overall theme might exist, but will be interspersed with quick little skits in between, some of them lasting only a few seconds at a time, and always played for a laugh. The show doesn't take itself too seriously at all, whether it be Shino tripping over the cuteness of blonde hair, or Aya and Yoko fighting in a mock way over some small silly thing. This is a show about basically nothing, just with a lot of humor injected into it. This is why the story scores a 5, there's nothing special to it, and while humorous most of the time, there's no real cohesion going on at all.Art: 7The art looks pretty good, only they over rely on the comedy tricks and tropes to the point it's a bit overdone. I think this is more a question of personal tastes, but I got a little worn out the 5th time they showed Shino sparkling in love with either Alice or Karen's blonde hair, among other tropes. Otherwise there's little to complain about, as there's not a lot of action to be had, just a lot of joke looks and funny faces.Sound: these are freshman teen girls, and they sound like it. Karen in particular can strike a nerve, she's so upbeat all the time and often prone to dropping broken Japanese, seemingly on purpose. Another complaint, one I think unique to English speakers is that when Alice and Karen are communicating in English, their native language is just as broken and rough sounding as their Japanese. I know its silly to expect perfect English out of an anime show without dubs, but they do sound quite awkward at times.The theme songs are fun and enjoyable and the background music worked well. The girls do sound their age, and if teen girls grate you, this isn't the show for you, for sure. Otherwise they all sound fine.Character: 6The characters are a bit one sided, in that Alice is crushing on Shino, who returns the feelings in an innocent way, but also is distracted by Karen's golden locks as well. Alice is polite and not prone to anger, but she really wants to be Shino's first and best friend. This makes sense as they spent time together in their childhood during Shino's exchange program.Karen is funny as she is Alice's friend from Britain and just seems to show up like it's nothing. Her family just jumped and decided to move half way around the world. Wish I could afford to do that! Karen is bubbly and always happy and excited. She's kind of the life of the party, even when not needed to be.Aya loves Yoko, but is loathe to admit it to herself. These are kinda young girls so we're not talking romance really, we're talking the seeds that might some day become romance. Aya is lost without Yoko, and Yoko knows it. The good think is Yoko doesn't mind and takes comfort in their relationship as well. The girls are all well written, and more than just a single trait.Enjoyment: 8I really did laugh my head off at this show. Maybe I have juvenile tastes, but that's fine, I don't mind. These girls were cute, and they were funny. Whether it be Karen's over enthusiasm or Aya's reserved view, they all mess together well and is a good time overall. It's a silly show, but silly sometimes is a great thing too.Best girl: Komichi Aya. She's the more 'grumpy' and down to earth one of the whole group and is fun to watch in her nervousness.If you can handle the rapid fire pace of the show, with the very short skits based around the general theme of the episodes, give it a shot. If you don't mind silly girls doing silly things, there's fun to be had here. If you're looking for seriousness, pass on by. This show looks to spark humor from a simple place in one's heart, and if that simplicity puts you off, then this isn't for you either. If you can hang with kids being kids, and find fun in that, check this one out! It's not a show stopper by any means, but it's fun enough to check out for sure. Thumbs up! Let's see if we can exchange this lack of posting into something more palatable. Of note, this is dealing only with season one, nothing else.Story: 5There's not much to really be had in the story department. First a Japanese girl does an foreign exchange in grade school, and ends up in a house with a cute as a button blonde British girl. They develop a friendship, and then Japanese girl goes home. Later on, during the first year of high school, the British girl makes it into the foreign exchange program, and wouldn't you know it, ends up drawing the home of the girl that had stayed with her years before. The two are reunited and get about living their lives in Japan. Later the British girl's good friend, a half English half Japanese follows her British friend to Japan and ends up in the same high school.So we end up with two native Japanese girls who are friends with the Japanese girl who did the exchange program, the exchange program Japanese girl herself, and two blonde British girls who round out the quintet of friends these girls form. The British girl, Karen, is not a exchange student, but is a half British, half Japanese girl who convinces her parents to return to Japan after her good friend Alice entered the exchange program. The rest of the show is the group getting into slice of life hijinks and just having a good time being teeny bopper girls and doing all the things girls that age do.Make no mistake, this is a 'cute girls doing cute things' anime, and has a great deal of 'moe' content. There is also light but noticeable shoujo ai/yuri content, as the former exchange student Shino has a very large crush on both British girls as they have blonde hair. She's obsessed with blonde hair and while there's no overtly sexual overtones presented, it's more than clear that she's kinda close to that line over their blonde appearance. There are also the two native Japanese girls who seem to have the budding of romantic links between them, especially the quieter, dark haired Aya in regards to outgoing Yoko. None of these really stray over the line of 'hinting' but they are most decidedly there. This gives the sugar sweet coating covering the show a bit of edge and interest.For the most part the story revolves around daily life and activities. Usually something comes up, a shopping trip, a beach trip, a school festival and we get Aya being totally nervous about it, and British Karen just totally becoming incredibly excited to participate in whatever it is. British Alice is only concerned as long as her exchange partner Shino is also interested, which works well as Shino bases her interest on what blondie Alice and Karen want to do.The show is broken up into several parts in most episodes, an overall theme might exist, but will be interspersed with quick little skits in between, some of them lasting only a few seconds at a time, and always played for a laugh. The show doesn't take itself too seriously at all, whether it be Shino tripping over the cuteness of blonde hair, or Aya and Yoko fighting in a mock way over some small silly thing. This is a show about basically nothing, just with a lot of humor injected into it. This is why the story scores a 5, there's nothing special to it, and while humorous most of the time, there's no real cohesion going on at all.Art: 7The art looks pretty good, only they over rely on the comedy tricks and tropes to the point it's a bit overdone. I think this is more a question of personal tastes, but I got a little worn out the 5th time they showed Shino sparkling in love with either Alice or Karen's blonde hair, among other tropes. Otherwise there's little to complain about, as there's not a lot of action to be had, just a lot of joke looks and funny faces.Sound: these are freshman teen girls, and they sound like it. Karen in particular can strike a nerve, she's so upbeat all the time and often prone to dropping broken Japanese, seemingly on purpose. Another complaint, one I think unique to English speakers is that when Alice and Karen are communicating in English, their native language is just as broken and rough sounding as their Japanese. I know its silly to expect perfect English out of an anime show without dubs, but they do sound quite awkward at times.The theme songs are fun and enjoyable and the background music worked well. The girls do sound their age, and if teen girls grate you, this isn't the show for you, for sure. Otherwise they all sound fine.Character: 6The characters are a bit one sided, in that Alice is crushing on Shino, who returns the feelings in an innocent way, but also is distracted by Karen's golden locks as well. Alice is polite and not prone to anger, but she really wants to be Shino's first and best friend. This makes sense as they spent time together in their childhood during Shino's exchange program.Karen is funny as she is Alice's friend from Britain and just seems to show up like it's nothing. Her family just jumped and decided to move half way around the world. Wish I could afford to do that! Karen is bubbly and always happy and excited. She's kind of the life of the party, even when not needed to be.Aya loves Yoko, but is loathe to admit it to herself. These are kinda young girls so we're not talking romance really, we're talking the seeds that might some day become romance. Aya is lost without Yoko, and Yoko knows it. The good think is Yoko doesn't mind and takes comfort in their relationship as well. The girls are all well written, and more than just a single trait.Enjoyment: 8I really did laugh my head off at this show. Maybe I have juvenile tastes, but that's fine, I don't mind. These girls were cute, and they were funny. Whether it be Karen's over enthusiasm or Aya's reserved view, they all mess together well and is a good time overall. It's a silly show, but silly sometimes is a great thing too.Best girl: Komichi Aya. She's the more 'grumpy' and down to earth one of the whole group and is fun to watch in her nervousness.If you can handle the rapid fire pace of the show, with the very short skits based around the general theme of the episodes, give it a shot.

The cute high schoole girls with stereotypical personalities and don´t actually have a real plot.However, even if almost all characters is the typical tomboy or the shy girl do the show adds some unique and interesting things to their personalities to separate them from the ""typical"". Even if this do the show more unque do I feel that the show could take it much further and that´s a pity.Like I said befor do the show not have a plot. It´s about five girls in high...schoole and their high schoole student life. something I found very enjoying was the culture shock. It was funny to see our main casts culture clashing and theirs misunderstandings.The show is VERY cute and never try to be something it´s not. Like adding something supernaturligt or giving a character some over the top sad back story just to separate it more from the ""Slice of life"" genera it is. And I really appreciates.I find my self enjoying this and give it a 7. Even do it is enjoying can the show feel annoying near the end.

It\'s super cute; I mean.. it\'s like cute on cute on cute. The girls are so adorable, pretty and cute.Kiniro Mosaic is an episodic based anime about 5 girls going through high school. It features two girls from England, Alice and Karen. Alice is totally adorable and could be an imouto. She\'s just the cutest and I want to hold her all day! Karen is also really cute having beautiful long blonde hair; she also speaks in broken Japanese which is just out of this world amazing. I\'ve never heard broken Japanese in an anime like in Kiniro Mosaic and it\'s...pulled off so well.Both Alice and Karen also speak English (Engrish) and it\'s really really cute! I love listening to the seiyuu speak in English and it\'s never annoying for me.The other girls are Shinobu, she looks like an Asian doll that Alice has, and it\'s really funny. She also loves blonde girls and gets all lovey dovey with Alice and Karen; she also loves to wear cute outfits and cosplays in them!Inokuma is a really pretty red head with a great personality. She\'s like the rock of the entire groups’ relationship, being level headed and capable of taking care of things. She\'s really fun and I love how she\'s animated with a little fang like tooth, showing how tomboyish she can be.Aya is the last girl of the group, having cute twintails (love twintails) and a personality similar to Shinobu\'s when Shinobu thinks about Alice; that is... really lovey dovey, though Aya is extremely shy about confronting her feelings towards Inokuma.I can\'t forget about the Karasuma-Sensei either, she\'s one the cutest sensei\'s in all of anime history; I\'d compare her to the sensei from Yuyushiki (everyone calls the sensei in Yuyushiki ""Mom""). Cute and adorable and really really fun!All the girls are fantastic and Kiniro Mosaic is one of the best anime I have ever seen. There is no story, it\'s strictly a slice of life based anime that uses an episodic format for its episodes. The girls are always funny and insanely cute. If you can get past the English (Engrish) of the first episode, you\'ll fall in love with Kiniro Mosaic for sure.The art style used is amazing and incredible. The colors are so light, but they\'re not exactly pastel (I don\'t think they are?). They just exude cuteness and huggable feelings when you watch. If you\'re ever down or want something really light hearted to pick you up or just make you feel good, give this a watch, it\'ll do it all!The sounds and music in Kiniro Mosaic is a lot like its art style, it\'s cute, it\'s light hearted, it\'s a lot of fun and it makes you super happy to just listen to it all. I love the BGM because of how happy and fun it can sound, same reason why I adore the OP and ED, it\'s just a whole ton of happy good feelings.Everything about Kiniro Mosaic is amazing, I love it 100% and it has shot up to Anime of the Forever for me (You can have more than one! I swear!). There are so many giffable moments; I\'d honestly have 50 + gifs just from Kiniro Mosaic if I really bothered. The amount of cute and colorful scenes are off the charts, it\'ll probably overwhelm people if they\'re not used to this type of extra adorable content.A lot of the episodes are really really good too, sure they use clichéd scenarios (high school folks), but cliché or not, I freaking love \'em. School festivals, celebrating holidays, summer break, it\'s all just a whole lot of fun. I loved seeing the Yuyushiki reference when the girls were looking at the magazines and you can see the three girls from Yuyushiki just there, enough to realize who they are, super nice touches like that are brilliant! pulled off so well.Both Alice and Karen also speak English (Engrish) and it\'s really really cute!

Also, if I don\'t make sense in some instances while writing this, my bad, I\'ll get you some lemon soda to compensate.On MAL, an 8 rating stands for ""very good"", and I\'m completely fine with giving Kiniro Mosaic an 8. To me, Kiniro Mosaic is like a better revamped sequel to A-Channel. The loli girls are once again cute and full of different personalities. Let us try again to keep this review short.Kiniro Mosaic\'s story is like many others, but with a twist. It all starts with pen pal buddies (Shinobu and...Alice) meeting in Europe. The two got along real well until Shinobu had to depart for Japan. Eventually in high school, Shinobu has received information that Alice will be coming to Japan for high school, and she\'s well prepared. They soon reunite and start creating more memories with three others, Karen, Aya, and Youko. Putting a twist to an ordinary basis is good, I approve.The art in Kiniro Mosaic is definitely something I don\'t see a lot. It has the style of the characters in A-Channel, cute, loli, and those bug ol\' eyes. I\'m a fan when it comes to this art style.Once again, sound is sound, and it isn\'t bad in Kiniro Mosaic. The opening and ending are fine, nothing too much.When I saw the characters in Kiniro Mosaic, they were pretty similar to those in A-Channel in terms of personalities, just that we have foreigners. It still doesn\'t stop the fact that they are cute and funny. We have cool klutz, smart normal people, man girls, blonde foreigners. You want it, they have it.I enjoyed this a little better than A-Channel and that\'s certain. I laughed more, had more fun watching this, and those musicals in every episode didn\'t exist. However, it\'s still a slice of life anime and I\'m not into those that much.Overall, Kiniro Mosaic was fun to watch. It\'s literally an A-Channel sequel that I wasn\'t aware of.

It's hilarious, cute, pure and composed almost entirely of A-Grade meme fuel. You should give it a go. It's hard to put my finger on exactly what is so funny about it, but I find that is quite normal with comedy Anime.If you happen to be from the UK there is the...added bonus of getting to see the shows take on the UK, which isn't a million miles off, but is still pretty funny.

It does nothing outstanding, but it does nothing terrible either. Granted, if you don't like this genre now, KinMoza isn't going to change your opinion.Like most in its genre, KinMoza takes place with a group of female highschool students, who exhibit the standard tropes. One way in which this is different is through the characters Karen Kujo and Alice Cartelet, who are English exchange students, and this is actually a point which extends beyond having blonde hair and randomly mixing English into their sentences like most anime seem to prefer doing. As would be expected in real life, these...two have difficulty assimilating to the Japanese lifestyle, with Karen being the strongest example of this. Rather than being calm and formal and hard-working like those that surround her, she is loud, eccentric, and does and says what she wants, and does not put much effort into her studies.KinMoza's mediocrity is its greatest flaw, and this is the reason why it hasn't scored an 8/10 or higher.

I do feel Manami Tanaka and Nao Touyama did a satisfactory job with their English. Nao Touyama specially used a different type of voice to VA Karen that gave the show an unique flair throughout the experienceAs for the Japanese girls of the friend group we course have Shinobu whom is obsessed with anything English.There was a time from 2009-2010 where I had a bit of this phase as well so I can relate with her in that regard...but not to the levels of her.Then we have Youko and Aya whom were put into the Yuri tease scenes of the show. Not my cup of tea but for some that would be their favorite partsAya is personally my favorite character in the show but that is most likely because I can relate to her the most. She is the most blunt of the group. She is the most melancholy of the group. I'm shy, she is shy. Now I didn't have anyone that I'd blush about all the time, that is where she has me beat.Looking at similar shows that I've watched. I do like this group of girls more than Non Non Biyori.Non Non Biyori has been my benchmark show for Episodic CGDCT.I like NNB but the show doesn't have enough substance for me to give the show a good score.Slow Loop is more recent show where the show starts with a strong story elements and then divulges into the Episodic CGDCT that you'd expect it to be.What it comes down to is how is the show during the learning process versus then the reinforcement of what you already know.The first three episodes your experience these new personalities for the first time.The interest level is rather high and coming off such a great prelude to the plot of the show worked wonders.If this show was only 3 episodes this would be in the 8s. Even 6 episodes it would of held pretty well thanks to my knowledge of Englishman in Japan. In Episode 5 Karen and Alice criticized the food and that remined me of Trash Taste. In Episode 6 Karen wanted to go to Mt. Fuji and that remined me of Chris Broad.But anything after Episode 6 was just your standard affair that you get from these type of high school setting shows.They did a school fair, they had a Christmas episode, they had a Summer Break episode, which all was about reinforcement of characters traits we already know with no central plot. The characters are good enough to get you to the ending without feeling too worn out but when it comes to rating story it is always going to be low. The prelude of course would give this show an advantage that other shows don't but it is still the weakest element.Something this show has above the rest would be their soundtrack. That is one of the first things I noticed in Episode 1.In Episode 6 I still felt the soundtrack was good. Not to the immaculate level of prelude but it holds throughout the show.The OP/ED songs are both good and was something I wanted to listen to before and after every episode. Soundtrack though has always been what I focus the least on when it comes to creating a finale score but it can give the show a few more ticks. Enough to get this show into the 7s. that worked to be a good compositionAlice is very adorable and has some of the best facial expressions in the show as well as being jealous when Shinobu fangirls about KarenKaren is one of the extroverts in the group and the contrast between Alice helps the show between the two foreignersIf you have issue with Japanese VAs doing English lines than this isn't the show for you because you will get a lot of that. I do feel Manami Tanaka and Nao Touyama did a satisfactory job with their English. Nao Touyama specially used a different type of voice to VA Karen that gave the show an unique flair throughout the experienceAs for the Japanese girls of the friend group we course have Shinobu whom is obsessed with anything English.There was a time from 2009-2010 where I had a bit of this phase as well so I can relate with her in that regard...but not to the levels of her.Then we have Youko and Aya whom were put into the Yuri tease scenes of the show. Not my cup of tea but for some that would be their favorite partsAya is personally my favorite character in the show but that is most likely because I can relate to her the most. She is the most blunt of the group. She is the most melancholy of the group. I'm shy, she is shy.

She befriends the daughter of her new family, Alice, and her obsession with Britain and blonde hair soars. Forced to part ways, the two make a huge impact on each other–so much that Alice decides she wants to live with Shinobu in Japan and go to high school with her.Thus begins the story of a weeaboo and a westaboo. Alice makes befriends Shino’s friends Aya and Yoko and, later on, Alice’s friend from Britain Karen joins the picture. From there, well, it’s just a series about their...random shenanigans. This is a slice-of-life that doesn’t care to have a plot of any sort; just sit back and bask in how freaking adorable it is.CharactersTo have a compelling slice-of-life, especially one with no plot, you have to give us characters we can invest in and love. Thankfully, Kinmoza has a fantastic cast of adorable girls who are around sixteen or so but look like elementary schoolers (and act like them too!). Even the teacher is a cute moeblob that I couldn’t get enough of.Let’s start with Alice, the blonde British girl.  I can’t discern much character from her aside from the fact she’s a total lesbian for Shinobu. But that’s okay because as a team mascot, she’s got enough humor and heart in her to carry forward.Shinobu is my least favorite character if only because her gimmick of being an airhead westaboo is not that funny. I like how she works off of Alice but I just didn’t like her as much as the others.Aya is my favorite character. She’s the diligent tsundere who loves romance stories and is definitely in love with Yoko. I found her to be the funniest and cutest character overall; her archetype exploited really well.Yoko is my second favorite. She’s the athletic tomboy, completely oblivious to Aya’s feelings. But she provides a lot of humor as well and the dynamic between her and Aya is heartwarming, even if it’s not amounting to anything.Karen is the other British girl and I went into the show thinking she’d be best girl. But the more you watch, the louder and more insane she seems. Karen’s definitely my third favorite but I really appreciate the subtlety and quiet of Aya after Karen’s segments.Finally, might as well mention Karasuma sensei. Why does she look the same age as the other girls? Aside from that, another entertaining and silly character.None of the characters are great examples of their archetypes but they all function well when put together, creating a fun dynamic to watch.AnimationThe animation is pretty good though nothing really special. It has that storybook quality to it with soft colors and white around the edges. That makes it much cuter and inviting. Character designs aren’t unique, but add to the happy, warm feeling. About the only thing I can say about the animation is that sometimes the eyes look a little derpy.SoundAgain, nothing memorable but it gets the job done. The opening and closing songs are pretty good and music during the show is what you’ve come to expect of slice-of-life’s like this. There’s a musical number at the end of the last episode that was pretty good; definitely check it out if you can.Usually I don’t comment on voice acting because I don’t speak Japanese so I can’t typically tell if actors are doing well or not, but the English in this show is absolutely hilarious. Yes, I know we’re talking about Japanese people trying their best to speak English, and no, I won’t put them down for trying. But, as someone who speaks English, it’s pretty hilarious to watch these segments. “Can I sreep wit you?”.EntertainmentI don’t watch shows like this ever because the comedy style isn’t for me. But I thoroughly enjoyed Kinmoza from beginning to end. It knew how to maintain the cuteness that drew me in while throwing in some great jokes and good character interactions. It’s an easy watch that helped me unwind.About the only issue I had were the sheer amount of title cards. These are used for scene transitions but become a little much when used one after the other.OverallKinmoza’s an adorable slice-of-life that manages an entertaining group dynamic while adding dashes of random humor to keep things fresh. It’s never very impressive (except for the final musical number) but it’s simple and fun enough that you won’t care and get drawn in. With a second season currently airing, now’s a great time to see whether you can handle such immense levels of moe. random shenanigans.

Kidou Senshi Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory,https://myanimelist.net/anime/84/Kidou_Senshi_Gundam_0083__Stardust_Memory,"[""Set three years after the events of the One Year War, Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory is a mixed bag. While it boasts strong visuals and action, its mediocre plot and the lackluster characters ultimately prevents 0083 from the full extent of its potential.The premise 0083's story is very promising at first glance. The valiant and desperate attempt of the Zeon remnants to pave a road for the future of its beliefs and its people makes them commendable antagonists, and the thus viewers are able to sympathize with both sides in the struggle between Federation and Zeon. However, upon closer inspection, one finds the...story riddled with the juvenile rivalry between Uraki and Monsha, as well as the thoroughly uninteresting romance between Uraki and Nina, which derails the focus from the promising overarching conflict to rather petty squabbles. When the story of 0083 is in high gear, it is quite rewarding, rife with exciting battles and unexpected twists. The problem is, like an aged car, 0083 often finds itself stuck on its low gears in terms of storytelling.Much of the faults concerning the plot of 0083 can be blamed on the main characters themselves. Uraki is a painfully generic mecha protagonist without much, if any, redeemable qualities. Angsty and lacking confidence, the story does not provide much room in which the view can sympathize with him, even considering the challenges Uraki faces over the course of the story. Nina's role as Uraki's love interest only manages to evoke either terrible boredom or the gag reflex; it is bland and devoid of any trance of genuine emotion. Gato, though certainly better than the aforementioned pair, also gets somewhat tedious from his own over-zealousness -- he is a character who seems to gobble up the very propaganda he spews, which in turn makes it more difficult to hold respect for the character.Fortunately, 0083 excels in the animation department. Each and every fight is smoothly animated with hand-drawn frames, be it a small training skirmish or a grand space battle. This OVA series features detailed and technical background art and some of the most exciting action scenes from the gundam franchise to date, especially those of the last battle, which can only described as epic in proportion. 0083 also features superb mecha designs not only in the form of the gundams themselves, but also the various grunt suits used by both factions. Even after seventeen years, the visuals of 0083 are still more than enough to lure the gaze of any mecha fan.The sounds of 0083 are standard fare. Typical gundam sound effects are to be expected here, which is just fine, as they serve their purpose well. The catchy opening theme &quot;Men of Destiny&quot; is full of that nostalgic 90's feel -- it gets the viewer in the mood for some giant robot action.In the end, the flaws of 0083's plot and characters limit the enjoyment of the OVA series exclusively to fans of the mecha genre. However, mecha fans will be able to find plenty of what they love: superb sci-fi action, and mobile suit battles they'll remember for a long time to come, provided they can manage to endure through the other aspects of 0083, which may feel agonizingly long and difficult. story riddled with the juvenile rivalry between Uraki and Monsha, as well as the thoroughly uninteresting romance between Uraki and Nina, which derails the focus from the promising overarching conflict to rather petty squabbles.

Does it do a great job of that? Personally, yes and no. Yes, because you learn about what happened to the Federation to where it become in Zeta Gundam, and no, because you don&rsquo;t really get to see what happens to the majority of the original cast from the series such as Amuro and Char, and mostly concentrates on the cast created exclusively for this saga. There are some other previous Gundam characters that will have brief cameos, but if you want to know, watch and...find out. But I say for what it does in an overall sense, it works out pretty well.Kou and Anavel do have good chemistry as rivals, but isn&rsquo;t really that epic in comparison to that of Char and Amuro. Not saying it&rsquo;s a bad thing, but you really can&rsquo;t top that. The cast does ok in standing out, but I just don&rsquo;t feel they have the kind of impact that an Amuro, Captain Bright, or another cast member from the original Gundam can have. But both Kou and Gato are likeable characters in their own right and you can see things in their points of view. Kou just has something to prove to himself and to his peers, while Gato is doing it for duty and patriotism to his nation.The only thing that bothered me was the Nina and Kou story arc. I felt it was thrown in there too much for convenience and I felt for the sake of giving it an all around story by adding in that element, which I felt was unnecessary. Yes, I will admit that Nina and Kou do have a good chemistry as well, but I just felt it was really useless and doesn&rsquo;t really advance anything and felt the twist to that relationship was anti-climatic. But anyway, the development is basic and the pace is moderate.I think the art design is really excellent for its time. It represents a certain transition era of how anime is done today to how it was done back then. Like if you&rsquo;re familiar with my other reviews, I always talk about how in the 1980s, anime was more circular and in the 1990s and now, it&rsquo;s more angular. Well, this anime was done in the early 1990s and you get a balanced mixed of those styles and they mesh excellently. I say Kou&rsquo;s circular design really represents he&rsquo;s still a kid, and Gato&rsquo;s more angular look shows more dignity and maturity and higher status to him. So I really like that use of those art styles to contrast those two in my personal opinion.The mobile suit designs I think are my 2nd favorite of all time. After all, the great Shoji Kawamori himself does the mechanical designs; you can&rsquo;t deny his presence and credit. I like how detailed and articulate they are. Though the mobile suits tend to look more packed and bulky, the skills of the pilots that are portrayed justify their agile mobility and fast speeds. The action is explosive, fast paced, and electrifying. Plus, the GP02A like some other Gundams sort of breaks the tradition with the head design of being more rectangular and not having the grilled mouth, which I thought was cool and looked intimidating. I really loved the features all the mobile suits have and you get overall variety.OK, I will state that I have no familiarity with the dub with this anime so I can only comment and score on the Japanese. Forgive me for not mentioning the dub since I have never seen it. I was shocked to learn that Horikawa Ryo, the voice of Vejita from Dragon Ball Z, happens to voice Kou Uraki! In comparison to Vejita with this role, he&rsquo;s more humble, childish, and developing. I thought he did excellent in portraying such a character. And I also enjoyed Ohtsuka Akio&rsquo;s performance as Gato. He also voices in Solid Snake in the Japanese Metal Gear Solid and is also famous for playing Batou in the Ghost in the Shell installments. He brings a unique kind of appropriate charisma to the character where you can also feel the passion he his motivations.The majority of the music is also highly energetic and suits the high-octane atmosphere of this series. The opening theme, The Winner is highly addictive and goes along with how I just described the soundtrack and atmosphere in an overall sense. And the first ending theme, Magic, is a unique George Michaels esque love song that is sung in perfect English. It&rsquo;s about wanting that moment with that girl now and forever and want to always make it special. Gundam 0083 does have some romance, so I felt it was an interesting touch.I say 0083 is more for the dedicated and hardcore Gundam fan. Those not familiar with the Gundam franchise will probably not understand some of the basic concepts such as who Giren and Kycilia are who are briefly mentioned in the intro to the first episode, and about why Sydney is under water. But if you want to watch it for the action, then you&rsquo;ve come to the right series. Also, if you want to watch cool looking robots, then you still came to the right series. The plot isn&rsquo;t necessarily the best, but I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s flawed enough to be considered bad or below average. Granted some things about it do get annoying, but in the end everything works out. Once again, I still say those who are familiar with the original Gundam, and especially Zeta Gundam are going to understand the story best considering the purpose of this anime. find out.

There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you hooked and waiting for what's to come. Both drama and action are given equal screen time and presented with equal intensity.ArtFor an OVA from 1991, the animation quality in this series is simply amazing. In fact, Gundam 0083 still shines by today's standards. The design of the artwork itself...is also a highlight with great detail being put into backgrounds and things such as uniforms.SoundThere is quite a bit of the typical background music you'd expect to hear in a war story. However, also included are some well-composed atmospheric pieces that set the mood for certain dramatic scenes. The opening themes are upbeat and catchy, with the second in particular being a highlight with it's brilliant guitarwork. Both endings are slower ballad type numbers. The contrast works well here as it fits with the anime's ability to balance dynamics. In terms of voice acting, the main vocal cast cast does a great job conveying the emotions of their characters. The English dub is also surprisingly well done and on par with the original.CharactersWe are the shown the perspective of both the Zeon and Earth Federation with the main focus being on Anavel Gato and Kou Uraki, respectively. The characters of Gundam 0083 are all adult which makes this series stand out from most other Gundam stories. Don't take that mean there ins't as much room for character development though, as plenty of growth occurs during the course of the OVA.EnjoymentAs the series progressed, I was drawn in more and more by the characters and found myself torn between the two warring sides. Every episode left me in anticipation of the next.OverallAs someone who isn't extremely fond of mecha series in general, Gundam 0083 was able to keep me entertained and make me wish there were more shows like it.9.5 out of 10 is also a highlight with great detail being put into backgrounds and things such as uniforms.SoundThere is quite a bit of the typical background music you'd expect to hear in a war story.

If you ever got a little hot when you watched Gurren Lagann's combination, aroused by the scent of a Gundam model, or felt flushed after watching Macross Zero's THRUST VECTORING, then you know what I'm talking about. If you don't, you'll probably be able to enjoy it, albeit on a different level. The best thing about Stardust is that the creators know that there is a segment of the human population that are raving mechaphiles (why else would their cheaply made plastic models sell so well...and be so damned enticing...), and the brunt...of the episodes (or at least the most that you'll take out of it) are composed of well-animated fight sequences in space, and a clever land battle. The OVA has all of the charm of old-school Gundams and Gundam fight scenes with the sophistication of 80's OVA animation: the mobile suits are dingy and get pockmarked with bullets and shrapnel, and most of the fights are determined by the pilots' skill and wits, rather than a magic Deus Ex Gundam. The space battles are orgasmic, with thrusters flaring about as the characters dodge beam rifle shots over lavishly-rendered backgrounds. All of the fights have a kind of heft and plausibility that some of the newer series just don't have. They are a blast to watch, and I can only imagine how good it'll look in the Blu-Ray release.The other thing you'll take away from it...is how poorly written some of the characters and scenarios are. Nothing really stands out: Nina's a bitch, Gato is manly and a fantatic, Cima wears too much makeup, Burning is Burning, and Kou hates carrots. Nobody's really worth mentioning, and whenever there aren't beautiful mobile suits on the screen, you want to skip past the aimless dialouge and watch some more giant robot matches. There's talk of conspiracy, and the ineptitude of the Federation's bureaucracy is a lot more apparent here than it was in first. The OVA ties into Zeta Gundam, but the references, and its place in the Universal Century timeline aren't too obvious the first time around, and feel a bit out of place. It's the same kind of problem that the Star Wars prequels suffered from: everything looks shiny and new compared to the older material, and a little bit of text at the end of the OVA keeps it from messing with the continuity. All of that aside, it fleshes out our understanding of the Gundam universe a little bit more, an gives us lots of cool-looking mecha to play around with. And most importantly, more cool-looking mecha to buy as plastic models. of the episodes (or at least the most that you'll take out of it) are composed of well-animated fight sequences in space, and a clever land battle. The OVA has all of the charm of old-school Gundams and Gundam fight scenes with the sophistication of 80's OVA animation: the mobile suits are dingy and get pockmarked with bullets and shrapnel, and most of the fights are determined by the pilots' skill and wits, rather than a magic Deus Ex Gundam.

It had started off fairly well, it was good enough and a solid 7/10, but halfway through it took a complete nosedive. Apparently, folks are saying that this is due to a change in director. You can really tell. It was as if someone beat every character upside the head with a mental pipe halfway through the show, and they had to continue with severe brain damage.The Good:It\'s fairly easy to get the good parts out of the way first. The sound design was nice, and the art was fairly good as well. The premise itself was also quite intriguing. Also,...in all fairness, i believe the show started off enjoyable enough.The Bad:1-The mobile suit designs are...either boring or ugly. The unit 1 is fairly bland and vanilla, the unit 2 looks stupid, and the worst abominations i think i have ever seen are units 3 and the Neue Ziel. They might fit the tastes of some folks, but for me they simply looked ridiculous. It\'s a ""Mobile Suit"" without any mobility.2-Timeline inconsistency. The events in this show are supposed to occur between the events of MSG and Zeta Gundam, and is supposed to provide context for the formation of the Titans and the Federation becoming ""evil"". Yet, there is absolutely no mention of any of these events in Zeta or ZZ. The only link between this show and Zeta is a brief glimpse of Haman, and the mentioning of a few characters key to the formation of Titans. They try and explain this by saying that the ending was covered up by the federation, but that makes absolutely no sense. How do you cover up a colony drop and a nuclear missile wiping 3/4ths of your entire fleet?3-The characters are for the most part uninteresting. Protagonist is vanilla as hell, no particular motivations, he\'s just kinda there while stuff happens around him. The supporting cast is somewhat redeeming, primarily Keith, Burning, and Cima. However, that all goes out the window in the second half, as most of these characters disappear an are forgotten until the final sequence.The Ugly: (Ending Spoilers ahead, but i don\'t consider the show worth watching anyways)What in gods name happened in the second half? So you have Nina. She\'s a somewhat boring engineer character, designer of Unit 1 and 2, and Kou\'s ""supposed"" love interest. She was mostly out of the way in the first half, but the new director decided that she wasn\'t getting enough screen time. So, he retroactively created a love triangle between her, the main antagonist, and the protagonist. How do i know that it\'s retroactive and not intended? Because in the very first episode, the main antagonist, Gato, walks right past Nina, steals her precious Gundam unit 2, and walks away and they don\'t recognize each other at all. Yet, in the second half it turns out they were lovers before the the war, and that she\'s completely obsessed with him. This sudden bombshell and giant plot hole signals the start of Nina\'s complete irrationality. After this point, none of her behavior makes any sense, and the only justification we get is her saying ""YOU GUYS DONT UNDERSTAND"" repeatedly.Her behavior becomes completely emotional, irrational, and nonsensical. She single-handedly derails the show. This leads us to what i consider the absolute worst scene in this entire show. Gato, Nina, and Kou on the colony as it\'s about to drop. Kou is going to kill Gato, but then Nina picks up a gun to protect Gato and threatens to shoot Kou. Instead of stopping Gato from dropping a colony on Earth, she lets him do it, and then threatens to kill Kou. She chooses Gato over Kou. The same Gato who nuked the fleet, same Gato who is about to drop a colony on Earth. Despite this being a huge blow to the viewers, and a complete 180 in the characters behavior, and a totally irrational move, i don\'t think it\'s that bad. What\'s bad is what comes next.So, Gato dies to the fleet, we don\'t even get the pleasure of seeing Kou kill Gato. Nina also lives, despite me praying and HOPING that the directors have enough sense to kill her off. Kou doesn\'t die. Had Kou died, then we would have had a nice moral about someone not being able to choose one lover and ends up losing both. Nope. You can\'t have that. Kou lives and goes to prison for a year, then when he\'s let out, guess what happens? Yup. He\'s greeted by Nina and the ending implies they run into each other\'s arms.Excuse me? What? Who the hell wrote this garbage? The main character is a total door mat that gets stepped on and treated like trash from the start of the show until the end. Had he showed any sign of development in that final scene, had he rejected Nina, had he done anything to imply that his character had grown and developed then i would have been able to let it slide. Maybe i would have given this show a 5 or 6 and a soft recommendation. But there is absolutely no payoff for the viewer. You leave this show feeling disappointed.If you\'re going to shift focus to a more character based story in the second half, then the least you can do is make your characters motives sensible or rational, and develop and grow your characters, OR AT LEAST give us some form of cathartic payoff seeing the characters we hate get what they deserve. But as this show does none of that, it\'s not worth watching. Don\'t waste your time.

People were more carefree and happy. It made sense for Gundam to reflect the spirit of those times. Stardust Memory is the younger, Asian brother of Top Gun, a popular Tom Cruise film which capitalized on booze, babes, planes and Val Kilmer. Stardust Memory tried emulate the best qualities of Top Gun and was relatively successful at first. But due to a change in directors, the story falls apart during the second half.We are introduced to a young Kou Uraki and his friend, Keith Chuck. Both...are pilots in training who laze their days away as the one year war comes to close. Gundams are starting to be produced in mass thanks to Amuro Ray’s success in battles during the One Year War. Two prototype Gundams armed with nuclear warheads are shipped to the base where Kou and Chuck are stationed. But in dramatic fashion, one of the mobile suits stole by Zeon! It is up to Kou and Chuck to get them back.The first thing you notice about Stardust memory is the feeling of levity. The atmosphere is much less heavy than both the original and Zeta Gundam. ZZ does not exist to me. The first few episodes introducing us to the world and characters were probably the best in show. It really captured the cool, Top Gun vibe. However, midway through Stardust Memory, the show turns uncharacteristically dark to its detriment. Gundam is full of serious moments but whoever was directing forgot the feeling that the show was going for. Stardust memory was more in the vein of Mobile Suit Gundam 08th Team than Zeta Gundam. The transition was jarring and created a dissonance that bothered me the whole show. And whoever wrote the ending of the show can honestly rot in hell. The conclusion was memorable in all the wrong ways and stemmed from the characters. But we will get to that later.The animation was fantastic in Gundam fashion. The movements were fluid and the mobile suits had a tremendous level of detail. The earth setting in Australia is probably the best suited to the Top Gun vibe they were giving off. The music reminded me of cheesy 80s romantic pop songs. The first ending, MAGIC, captured the late 80s early 90s charm. It had sensuality and cheesy but endearing lyrics about falling in love. It is a shame the early atmosphere of the show was contradicted by the show’s latter half.Woo boy, now let’s talk about the elephant in the room. The characters in Stardust Memory were nothing short of abysmal. Kou Uraki, the protagonist, is probably the most boring character in Gundam history. He has no definable traits that separate him from anyone else. Even his best friend Keith, had a charm to him and cool glasses which made him more interesting Uraki. His character arc ended with him becoming incredibly cynical which I felt betrayed the original spirit of the show. His relationship with the cast of veteran mobile suit pilots could have easily been the best part of the show if it were not for the poor love triangle. Nina Purpleton is easily the bane of this show. Every stereotypically negative thing about a woman is engrained in her character. She is obnoxious, irrational and overemotional. And she is only defined by the men she is in love with as she has no individual traits herself. There is nothing else about her that allows her to be a good character.Navel Gato, the Zeonic opposite of Kou could have been a great character if not for the show being split between two perspectives. He is haunted by the failures of his past in the One Year War and seeks atonement. If the show were focused on him reconciling his past with his future and trying to regain the honor he lost, Stardust Memory could have possibly been a great show. Gato’s parts we he talks about his loyalty to Zeon and his relationship with other commanders were easily the best portions of the serious side of the show. But, due to the possibly the worst twist in Gundam history, he character will forever be soiled in my mind.The Gundam franchise has been rather inconsistent in its quality but underneath the flaws, there always was a worthwhile message. Stardust memory has none of those qualities. It is another case of unnecessary romance getting in the way of telling a good story. And there was no Val Kilmer.

Sadly it spiraled out of control quickly.  I think they tried to do to much in just 13 episodes.  They should have expanded it to 24 or 26.  First off they add to many characters, which made the story get convoluted, and the end revelations meant nothing since there was no back story leading to it.  The ending seemed hurried and boring.  The only really good think about this seres is the animation.  The series...was made nearly 20 years ago in 1990, and they animation is better than some anime that come out today.  I'm not sure who did the animation, but they did a great job.  The music was done really well, but that's it. was made nearly 20 years ago in 1990, and they animation is better than some anime that come out today.

The events seen throughout 0083 mostly serve to feature the buildup of these events through the perspectives of Federation Ensign Kou Uraki and influential Zeon soldier Anavel Gato. For the most part, Gundam 0083 is solid in its plot buildup as more details concerning the motives of Gato and the Zeons come to light and Kou's skills as a mobile suit pilot improve throughout the course of the...series as he pilots a Gundam. A number of prominent characters among both sides, besides Kou, also get their focus and depth to show that those affiliated with both Federation and Zeon forces have their redeemable and not so honorable traits. In terms of visuals, 0083 is above average in quality for the time period it was made having well-detailed designs of scenery, mecha and characters with fluid and well-animated action scenes.Beyond my praises though, Gundam 0083 does have a number of issues that hurt its quality quite a bit for me. A number of 0083's prominent characters are rather underdeveloped compared to others, making them either rather shallow in personality or having you question the reasons for their actions during certain points of the series. To a degree, this issue takes effect in the rather sloppy and anticlimactic finale to the series as characters betray one another for no known purpose and leave you wondering why they did what they did. Towards the middle of 0083, the series also tossed in an unconvincing love triangle involving Nina and Kou which comes across as flat due to the lack of proper buildup and chemistry between the two in terms of developing such an aspect to their relationship. And while I'm not too hard pressed about it, there may be Gundam fans disappointed to know that none of the major UC Gundam characters from Gundam or Zeta Gundam appear at all in this series outside of cameo appearances by a few supporting characters from both titles.Overall, I found this chapter of the Universal Century continuity of the Gundam franchise to be a bit of a mixed bag. While a decent addition to the franchise to show what led to the creation of the Titans and having well-animated mecha fights, the sloppy finale, limited depth to certain major characters and unconvincing romances hurt its overall quality quite a bit.

And since those DVD\'s only had Chinese subtitles, I had to watch it in dub as my Chinese reading skills kinda suck these days due to lack of use. This may have resulted in lessening my enjoyment of the show, as it doesn\'t exactly have the best dubs I\'ve heard... but at least they\'re not the worst either.From what I can gather, ""Gundam 0083"" is a continuation of a chain of earlier Gundam series which eventually can be traced back to the original Gundam series, ""Mobile...Suit Gundam: 0079"". The original Gundam series is supposed to be pretty good, but it needs to be a lot better than ""Gundam 0083"" in order to live up to that kind of praise, because ""Gundam 0083"" is a bit lame. I may not know how good the series sound in Japanese, but given the uninspiring script, I doubt even a bunch of highly skilled voice actors would be able to make it sound good.It may be because I hadn\'t watched the previous series, but I found the story in ""Gundam 0083"" to be somewhat confusing. ""Gundam 0083"" fails as a standalone series, as it doesn\'t really provide any background on the seeds of conflict that has obviously been sewn previous to this installment. I don\'t know who this Zeon group is, I don\'t know where they\'ve recruited this psycho woman from... I don\'t even know why they\'re fighting. They\'re sacrificing their lives for what ideals again??At the heart of the ""Gundam 0083"", there are lots of paper thin characters. Knowing full well they\'re pretty poor, the producers then sacrificed realism and rationality in order to make them ""interesting"". As a result we end up with lots of strange twists in the storyline where people make bizarre decisions to try and spice up the predictable plot. The ending is terrible too. If, by some miracle, it managed to resolve anything, I must have missed it.Having said all this, most of this series was still enjoyable to some extent. The development of the relationship between Nina and Kou is quite pleasant to watch, even though it is a bit predictable. Visually, ""Gundam 0083"" has some nice and distinguishable character designs, and the battles scenes are competently done, if not exactly memorable. There is one thing that is memorable about ""Gundam 0083"", however, and that\'s the second opening theme ""Men of Destiny"". It\'s a very cheesey 80\'s kind of song... and I love it! Its grand and energetic feel means that it works nicely as the theme to a Gundam series. A pity the anime itself isn\'t nearly as good.Interestingly, I found my viewing experience of ""Gundam 0083"" to be opposite to that of ""Gundam Seed Destiny"". With the latter, I sometimes found it an effort to watch even though I acknowledge the quality of the anime. With ""Gundam 0083"", even though I knew what I was watching isn\'t particularly good, I just couldn\'t seem to stop watching it! Still, I guess I should count that as a positive trait.

A pity the anime itself isn\'t nearly as good.Interestingly, I found my viewing experience of ""Gundam 0083"" to be opposite to that of ""Gundam Seed Destiny"". With the latter, I sometimes found it an effort to watch even though I acknowledge the quality of the anime. With ""Gundam 0083"", even though I knew what I was watching isn\'t particularly good, I just couldn\'t seem to stop watching it! Still, I guess I should count that as a positive trait.', 'Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory is one of the many small OVAs (and movies) released between ZZ Gundam and the next TV series, Victory Gundam. It\'s also by far the most substantial installment, consisting of the highest number of episodes at 13 with each running a half hour. That\'s still less than half the total time of your usual Gundam series, but considering how damn long most of them are, often without a good reason to be, should anyone complain? All of the three OVAs released during this period focus on the events of the One Year War, with The 8th MS Team and...War in the Pocket focusing on the war\'s impact on smaller parts of civilization and the army. 0083 is its own side story and mostly concerned  with its original new tale, but is the most chronologically significant as it gives some background as to the rise of the Titans organization that kickstarts the events of the highly popular and earlier released Zeta Gundam.Specifically we follow rookie pilot Kou Uraki, who by chance earns the right to pilot one of three new Gundam models in a search for Zeon remnant Anavel Gato who has stolen one of the two remaining Gundams. Kou and the rest of the Albion crew\'s battle with the ace pilot Gato and what remains of Zeon\'s forces leads them into Zeon\'s massive plan for revenge: ""Operation Stardust"". What is the true purpose of the desperate Zeon force\'s new plan? Aboard the Albion, Kou is forced to grow as a soldier not only for the sake of his mission but also to earn the love of Nina Purpleton, the Gundam development team\'s most stupidly named crew member.Gundam 0083 is notorious for its reputation as ""mecha porn"". Not only is this one of the most disgusting combinations of words ever to come out of the English language, but it\'s an incredibly demeaning judgment that tells onlookers nothing other than to pass by this Gundam installment in favor of many others. Is this reputation deserved? To bring up the conclusion early because it deserves it: absolutely not. Gundam 0083 is far more than its high production values. On the contrary, it\'s by all measures one of the best Gundam installments ever made. I\'ve yet to see any Gundam without sizable flaws that need to be fought to ignore, but relative to the franchise as a whole it\'s very puzzling as to why Gundam 0083 has its reputation.It\'s logical then to start off addressing the most common criticism: that Kou Uraki and Nina Purpleton are terrible, frustrating characters. Among a franchise that\'s almost known for how its main protagonist is typically one of the least likable characters, it\'s bizarre to see 0083 getting so much fire for its characterizations. Kou\'s biggest offense in particular isn\'t so much his actions as that he\'s a fairly typical, normal man. Amuro Ray and Kamille Bidan were prone to some aggravating emotional fits, but they had a powerful voice with something to say and stood out among their peers. Kou is a hestitating soldier who gradually becomes a straight-faced normal one and at his most memorable is a bumbling lovestruck idiot who fails with women like someone who\'s never touched one in his life. While Kou and Nina\'s interactions and over exaggerations to each other\'s...  over exaggerations can be rather cringeworthy, it\'s worth noting that they\'re (sadly) still among the most tolerable main Gundam characters simply for the fact that when they are being stupid, it\'s -almost- never in ways that selfishly jeopardizes their mission or the lives of their fellow crewmembers. They\'re normal people who dip into awkwardness now and again, as opposed to awkward people who dip into slight bouts of Tomino-induced schizophrenia.From there we can get to one of the best qualities of Gundam 0083 that people -don\'t- talk about: its great supporting cast. Kou\'s best friend and fellow rookie pilot is the bespectacled Chuck Keith, a slacker dork who\'s basically the opposite of Kou in that he feigns confidence and fails at women and piloting completely while Kou gets anxious and sweats a lot yet succeeds. Keith grows as a pilot over the series as well but it\'s much more subtle since the focus is never on him, which turns out to be a waste (more on that later). South Burning (what) is their commander before and after their mission aboard the Albion. One of the franchise\'s better mentor pilots, we actually get to see Burning give Kou and Keith combat advice during their battles and his warm grandfather-esque guidance makes him immensely likable despite his also minor role. Bernard Monsha is the last major-minor character on the Albion and its third best pilot, despite his hiding of it through his excessive drinking, jealousy of Kou, and sexual harassment of Nina. Though not really a good person, Monsha is humanly flawed and his strong personality and expressions color some of the most memorable moments in 0083.On the Zeon side we mainly see the aforementioned Gato, an ace pilot compared to the Red Comet Char Aznable. To describe Gato\'s character requires also bringing up one of the things 0083 does right relative to other Gundam series, which is actually portraying Zeon in a respectable fashion. The original Gundam series wanted to push the belief that both sides had good people on them, but the good Zeon soldiers were mainly minor characters pushed away before long to service screen time to the megalomaniacal Zabi family. Meanwhile, most of what we saw of the Earth Federation were of our admirable heroes. In the end it really wasn\'t daring enough to make that a major theme and deal with the consequences, but in 0083 we\'re given the perspective of Gato and his fellow Zeon soldiers without the Zabi family. For the first time we see for an extended period their dignity as soldiers, love for their homeland, and respect for each other and their ideals over their individual ambitions. The Zabis mostly go unmentioned, which helps to explain some of their extremism from their perspective that they were simply denied their independence, rather than the evil ambitions of the Zabi family.Returning to Gato, he\'s a hero to the Zeon and a charismatic lynchpin of their rebellion, despite answering to the equally respectable Aiguille Delaz. Gato is also hinted to have some sort of a past relationship with Nina, but this ultimately amounts to very little and is handled so poorly it may as well not have been a part of the story at all. Gato is a cool character overall but an awkward rival for Kou, with the age and experience/perspective gap being too large to ever be cleared unlike Amuro/Char, and it doesn\'t help that the two actually barely have contact over the course of the series despite Gato getting several scenes dedicated to him. Kou eventually fights Gato on equal skill, but there\'s just very little chemistry to their relationship dynamic and we\'re ultimately treated to one of the franchise\'s more underwhelming rivalries. And of course, there\'s need to mention Gato being a significantly better character than Kou.On the other hand, the evil seeds of Zeon have passed down into Cima Garahau, a fierce queen bee who commands her own fleet, stylized like that of space pirates complete with animal furs lining the command center and an old ship wheel at the helm. It\'s a little ridiculous, but I love this villain. Her tastes are hardly contemporary but do nothing to undermine her fleet\'s power potential and add a lot stylistic flair without being too unrealistic despite tackiness. Cima herself is expectedly combative and frequently defiant of the Delaz fleet, and in addition to her wearing a cape and garnishing a hand fan her men wear worn and tattered uniforms. Cima is badass and fulfills the evil role on the enemy side while also making it very fun. Many of the series\'s most exciting scenes involve Cima and she overall contributes the most to the show\'s sense of style.Though Tomino is given a writing credit, I can only assume (and be thankful) that he didn\'t actually have much of a hand in the dialogue, which is the most down-to-earth behind The 8th MS Team, which is the most commonly cited reason as to why people favor that series. Kou and Nina can be weird and forgettable, but they\'re surrounded by likable archetypes. It\'s unfortunate then that after the midway point Gundam 0083\'s own director switches, and they push so many of these characters to the backburner in order to focus solely on Operation Stardust and Kou\'s weird obsession with Gato. These characters go from being in every other scene and talking to delivering a handful of lines each episode and lose what further chance they had at developing themselves. It\'s a real shame, and if the series didn\'t develop so much good momentum by this point it could have been enough to cripple what was left. Instead we\'re left with an above average Gundam cast that are yet utilized less effectively than most. It\'s a waste of potential.Getting back to the original point and Gundam 0083\'s legacy is the animation quality. In general the series is as detailed as early 90s anime ever got, and although greater things have been achieved since with even higher budgets, it\'s obvious that this OVA production still far exceeds your average TV production. On the other hand, it\'s got that same disease all early 90s OVAs and movies have where it looks like all the black ink pens were broken and leaking ink over every cel. In other words, many scenes are extremely dark and have a significant negative impact on the composition of a scene by so many figures and poses going unhighlighted. This is doubly troublesome considering almost all of the series takes place in the darkness of space, and Gundam 0083 isn\'t much an exception when it comes to space battles where they use heavy zoom-ins and no sense of perspective to have the action be chaotic and unpredictable. Laser blasts and enemies come in from any side of the screen whenever without a logical progression to much of the battle or fighting. The early battles that take place on the ground on Earth are by far the best, and it\'s unfortunate it\'s downhill from there when Gundam has a rare opportunity to make use of a fat budget.Though Gundam 0083 stumbles around here and there, so does every single Gundam, and yet 0083 is able to tap into some of the strengths of its greatest series to create one of the most cohesive entries in the franchise. The bizarre Tomino dialogue is nowhere to be found, characters aren\'t always mature but this doesn\'t result in completely insane actions and decisions, the often criticized ""Newtype magic"" is pretty much nonexistent, the cast is enjoyable and brought to life due to great detailed expressions gifted by its nice budget that also aids the show in general and makes the action better than ever before, and... boy, what\'s the problem? Stardust Memories isn\'t only one of the most unfairly maligned Gundam entries, it\'s one of the first ones anybody should watch. It\'s due for a more fair, less superficial analysis don\'t you think? War in the Pocket focusing on the war\'s impact on smaller parts of civilization and the army. 0083 is its own side story and mostly concerned  with its original new tale, but is the most chronologically significant as it gives some background as to the rise of the Titans organization that kickstarts the events of the highly popular and earlier released Zeta Gundam.Specifically we follow rookie pilot Kou Uraki, who by chance earns the right to pilot one of three new Gundam models in a search for Zeon remnant Anavel Gato who has stolen one of the two remaining Gundams.

It\'s due for a more fair, less superficial analysis don\'t you think?', 'warning that this review may contain spoilersFirst impressions, so stardust memory’s aka the prequel to zeta gundam which is one of my favourite   in the uc time line so far.In till I watch thunderbolt or origins   because I have heard there really goodSo I kind of went into this except something that’s somewhat decent,It was going to explain some of the details that we didn’t see between the first gundam and zeta.Which I was very happy   to find out about,Because zeta didn’t really go into that much depth of how the titans came into power. It was...very vaguely explained. So hoping to get some questions I had answered.Sadly it didn’t really deliver on it.Story,  5/103 years after the one year between the earth and Zeon forces had ended and peace has been maintained.A darkness from the past is starting to come forth, as a rouge Zeon group named delaz fleet  has risen from the shadows in order to finish an old score  with the earth forces   and to have Zeon rise again.Meanwhile  In a military  base in Australia a top secret project is under way.The creation of  two new  prototype  gundam units, The zephyranthes and the physalis are under way.The delaz fleet finds out about this and plans a attack in order to get the new gundam units.But during their attack they only mange to take the  physalis gundam which is now being piloted   by the a man known as the nightmare of Solomon.The only  man standing in his way is main character kou who is a training pilot. who while  in the attack manged to keep the zephyranthes gundam out of Zeon hands. But to make matters worse the physalis gundam contains nukes.So join kou and his crew as there race ageist the clock  begins to stop major war from braking out.So the basic story line or plot is pretty much main character  and crew mates involved in a game of cat and mouse between military  factions. Trying to get this gundam unit back.Which as a  standalone story for a gundam show is all right, Because it takes itself serious  enough and it’s still sticks to the theme of war is hell, And the other themes that gundam is well known for. And they have the main charter getting used to active military  service and all  the things that come with it.There also a nice little romance as well, Between the main character this engineer chick   That I felt was alright handed alright.So its above average.(Even though I still question the logic behind putting top secret project and nukes  in  all honesty Isn’t   exactly the most well defended  base they could have picked, and of course it  was the Australians  the dropped the ball)So any way as a  standalone story it all good but sadly that also where its biggest weakness is and my biggest gripe with  this show is.Because  this is supposed to be a bridge   between the first gundam and zeta  gundam. A prequel / sequel and in that context this show is horrible at that aspects if  one looks  at it through the lens of this is a prequel / sequel.Because let’s just say that continuity  isn’t exactly  this show strong suit. In fact the events that take place in this show  don’t really have much to connection to what happens  in zeta or any relationship to first gundam wants so ever. Most  of the things that   happen in this show don’t even come into play.In fact the only thing connecting this to zeta  is that  though the  events of the story at the end.we find out what trigged the titans forming  and we see a few characters from zeta showing up for a quick scene or two.   It’s almost like the story came alive and  a punched you in the face just for watching and completing itSo while I on the negative train I might as well mention  that this story is kind of forgettable and isn’t bringing anything new to the table.What I mean by that is that this story as a whole  is like a copy and paste of ever theme that  the uc time line gundam has ever had.Like the war is hell, freedom for the spacenoids and etc.Which on the   basic level is ok,but when I think about it  isn’t doing much with  those ideas and themes.  It mostly  being used as basic  favouring because.These ideas aren’t really being explored or a  new point of view being brought to the table.Which is sad because they could have come up with something new or fresh but they didn’t.Now you  can argue and say  that because this is a prequel / sequel they didn’t exactly have to do anything with those ideas or that  those themes and ideas are not the main focus of the show and  at the end of the day This is side story. Which just takes place in the same universe.But this was made quite a few years after zeta came out.I would think that they  could come up with better ideas with the  time they had  or even  a better plot for that matterBut they just gave us the same shit in  different  rapper.Characters 5/10The main character kou was ok.He this kind of chill dude who has a thing for tech.who thought out  the course of the series becomes more hardened  the more he experiences real combat.Which I thought was nice because it added some depth  to his character.Because in the beginning of the series  I really couldn’t put heads or tails on what his personality  is . He felt very hollow to me.Which is a problem for me, Because most gundam main characters usually  have a more notable  personality  or some sort of back story.Like for example  Domon kasshu or kamille bidan,Who have a more memorable  personality.Side characters are all right,They did the  roles they had well.They had nice banter I guess that I enjoyed watchingIt’s just personality wise, But aren’t really  memorable.They just feel like carboard cut-outs to me.Which  is a thing I am sick of saying but it’s very  true.The only thing that stood out for me character wise was the romance between kyo and Nina.Which far as anime  romances wasn’t bad because I have a bit of chemistry togetherWhich was nice,   but I guess my only nick pick is  that there relationship  feels a little dry and forced to me.Because there relationship together progress at quite the fast rate.                                            Like one ep she slightly has the desire to see what type of person kyo is and then  the next ep talking about feeling and shit.Its feels unnatural to me.Although it  could just be that this series only had a 13 ep so they  didn’t have time to pad out there relationship.Art 6/10The animation looked alright.  It could have been better though.Because there are  a few parts  where the animation takes a bit of a dip down wards in quality.The  backgrounds  look all right  and add a bit of grit to it.The battles are alright in animation wise because I have a very naturel flow about them.But on the bad side there not exactly the most fun to watch.Art style is fine was well.The charter designs are  fine.Just the standard   shit that  we have  all seen beforeI really do  like the more up dated mech designs  for the older models,Because they don’t feel that clunky  anymore and feel more like well-oiled war machines.Sound 6/10I really like the first opening  song and the other opening  song and there ending themes are very boring to me and don’t really stand out that much.   I would have gotten more  enjoyment  if I  listened to paint dry.But at the same time I see why people might like these,But for me there just crap.Ost was quite nice,Better than I  thought it would be.Some very good tracks in there.They fitted very well and was on pointBut nothing I would gone out of my way to listen to  by its self.The ost was done by Urakami, Yasuo,Who has worked on shows like,Project arms and gundam seed.The dub was alright and so was the  sub.I liked both.Enjoyment 5/10As far was enjoyment goes.I enjoyed this show for what it was,But my enjoyment doesn’t go beyond  that point.For me  was  one of those one timer experiences.  Because this is something I would not watch again.Overall 5/10If you like gundam or basic  Mecha shows  and just want a quick one timer then check this out.Because its aright as a whole, But it doesn’t really go beyond that point.But at the same You could just was  easily skip this series because it doesn’t really add much to gundam as a whole.if you want something that stands out more or in fact isn’t so basic and done to death.Watch something else. very vaguely explained.

He felt very hollow to me.Which is a problem for me, Because most gundam main characters usually  have a more notable  personality  or some sort of back story.Like for example  Domon kasshu or kamille bidan,Who have a more memorable  personality.Side characters are all right,They did the  roles they had well.They had nice banter I guess that I enjoyed watchingIt’s just personality wise, But aren’t really  memorable.They just feel like carboard cut-outs to me.Which  is a thing I am sick of saying but it’s very  true.The only thing that stood out for me character wise was the romance between kyo and Nina.Which far as anime  romances wasn’t bad because I have a bit of chemistry togetherWhich was nice,   but I guess my only nick pick is  that there relationship  feels a little dry and forced to me.Because there relationship together progress at quite the fast rate.                                            Like one ep she slightly has the desire to see what type of person kyo is and then  the next ep talking about feeling and shit.Its feels unnatural to me.Although it  could just be that this series only had a 13 ep so they  didn’t have time to pad out there relationship.Art 6/10The animation looked alright.  It could have been better though.Because there are  a few parts  where the animation takes a bit of a dip down wards in quality.The  backgrounds  look all right  and add a bit of grit to it.The battles are alright in animation wise because I have a very naturel flow about them.But on the bad side there not exactly the most fun to watch.Art style is fine was well.The charter designs are  fine.Just the standard   shit that  we have  all seen beforeI really do  like the more up dated mech designs  for the older models,Because they don’t feel that clunky  anymore and feel more like well-oiled war machines.Sound 6/10I really like the first opening  song and the other opening  song and there ending themes are very boring to me and don’t really stand out that much.   I would have gotten more  enjoyment  if I  listened to paint dry.But at the same time I see why people might like these,But for me there just crap.Ost was quite nice,Better than I  thought it would be.Some very good tracks in there.They fitted very well and was on pointBut nothing I would gone out of my way to listen to  by its self.The ost was done by Urakami, Yasuo,Who has worked on shows like,Project arms and gundam seed.The dub was alright and so was the  sub.I liked both.Enjoyment 5/10As far was enjoyment goes.I enjoyed this show for what it was,But my enjoyment doesn’t go beyond  that point.For me  was  one of those one timer experiences.  Because this is something I would not watch again.Overall 5/10If you like gundam or basic  Mecha shows  and just want a quick one timer then check this out.Because its aright as a whole, But it doesn’t really go beyond that point.But at the same You could just was  easily skip this series because it doesn’t really add much to gundam as a whole.if you want something that stands out more or in fact isn’t so basic and done to death.Watch something else.', ""Gundam 0083 is the absolute pinnacle of cel-shaded animation, rivaled only by Gunbuster. It also has a great 80s-era soundtrack, certainly one of the better ones among Gundam series.The only problem is it uses that animation & soundtrack to tell one of the most dogshit Gundam stories I've ever seen.One half of the show is every character making the worst, most nonsensical decisions possible. Like the equivalent of your mortal enemy dropping their gun and you picking it up and handing it to them and saying you're sorry that happened to them.The other half is every male character being over-the-top horny (but not enough...to be funny) for the blonde white lady character, and the other female characters acting like giddy middle schoolers about it. There is no perceptible depth to anyone in the show, and no real reason to care about any of them. I mostly just want to yell at them for being complete dipshits all the time. The one exception is Mora Borscht, who has a terrible name but is an absolute queen and the only character with any personality.It's really unfortunate, not only because of the animation & sound, but also because it has Hajime Katoki's mecha designs, which are some of the coolest in all of Gundam. I'm rewatching it right now and even though I hate it, I'm continuing to the end just to see Neue Ziel in action.If you're a Gundam freak or a completionist, then you'll have to watch this.

A young pilot and the crew of a Federation battleship take to the skies to hunt it down.This is meant to bridge the o.g. Gundam to Zeta & explain a few plot points that crop up there. In that regard it does a swell job. However, it insists on spending time focusing on the miserable romance between Kou & Nina...(we\'ll talk more about that in CHARACTER). This drags the whole experience down everytime it switches, and it loves to ignore the main story a lot.The story has some good beats when not focusing on them. The sequence after Lt. Burning recovers the briefcase in the mid-late show is fantastic and a great microcosm of Gundam\'s oft-repeated ""war is hell"" message. The whole final battle is a fun watch.There\'s an odd bit midway thru where Kou knowingly helps a crippled Zeon pilot build a mobile armor meant to fight the Federation. Then the next episode shows up and, well, one guess what happens. It\'s a odd little bit of writing but it kind of make sense.ART - Spectacular. Aside from the rare reused shot, the show is gorgeous, the character designs are top-notch, as is the mechanical design. The animation is some of the best the OVA ""genre"" has to offer.SOUND - Fair? The first OP, ""The Winner"" deserves to be in the pantheon of ""greatest anime OPs"" as its a real banger and unforgettable. The second OP, ""Men of Destiny"" is pretty damn good (it just fails to measure up to the sheer Top Gun-itude of The Winner). The endings are pretty whatever.Outside of the insert song ""Back to Paradise"", the score is bland and not that memorable. I can only think of two songs that I remember - one for its frequent use, and one for the actual composition.CHARACTER - Hoo. There\'s not much character to some of these characters. Kou hates carrots and uhhhhh likes to fly mobile suits? He\'s very whitebread. He likes Nina for some reason, and Nina is a gargantuan idiot who , depending on scene or episode, is either going ""I hope Kou doesn\'t pilot the Gundam today"" and ""I hope Gato doesn\'t kill Kou"".Gato, the Zeon lead, is a funnish character who\'s slavishly devoted to the Zeon ideals and refuses to compromise. Cima, the Zeon pirate, is a fairly fun character though a scene close to the end of the show forgets her ""i gassed a colony and regret it every day"" and has her cackle like a children\'s cartoon villain as she commits mass murder of civilians.Lt. Burning is a fine ""mentor"" type character. Chuck Keith is the best and his eventual girlfriend, the Amazonian Maura, are super great to watch when they\'re around.The Kou/Nina/Gato love triangle is awful and takes up most of the show. The climax to this triangle is infuriating in so many ways and the actual end of the show is baffling when you look at what happened just 10~ minutes prior.ENJOYMENT - It\'s fun. The mecha action is some of the absolute best around. The story is decent when not wasting its breath on the miserable romance.Ultimately its a 5/10 from me. What it does well, it does damn well. What it does poorly? It does really really poorly. The fun action bits and mecha porn are fantastic but that romance subplot drags down the story every time it takes centre stage, and the characters are mostly flat and dull or flat and decent.

Gundam shows by emission order, and I think this right here is the very definition of  ""ok show"". 0079 was not very good in my opinion, Zeta was amazing, ZZ is a crime against everything good in this world. CCA is horrible, but not as horrible as ZZ. War In The Pocket is the best Gundam show so far and my personal favorite, and F91 Is very bland with few redeeming qualities beside good animation.0083: Stardust Memory is just ok.The story is fairly average, nothing noteworthy but also not insulting like ZZ or...CCA.Most of the characters are very bland or undeveloped, but besides something Nina does in the ending they never do anything as nonsensical and stupid as the characters from...ZZ and CCA would do.Hey, this is an OVA, so the art direction and animation is the best part. If you\'re into Mecha porn or just Sakuga porn in general there will be several moments here that will delight you.This isn\'t gundam at it\'s brightest, but also it\'s not at it\'s worst. It\'s just ok. If you\'re a Gundam fan, go ahead and watch it. If you\'re a Mecha fan, you probably won\'t understand the whole thing unless you do your googling, but the mechs are cool and the fights too, so you can watch it.If you\'re neither of those...meh. Maybe you should find something else. not bad, but not remarkable. It\'s only 12 episodes long though, so maybe go ahead If you really want to.TL;DR: 0083: Stardust Memory is the Mc\' Donalds of Gundam. If you just want to satisfy your cravings for hamburger (Gundam/mecha) It will work just fine. If you\'re looking for a nice meal that you will probably want to repeat, I suggest looking somewhere else.

It acts as a bridge for Zeta and the original series. In 0083 a team of ragtag Zeon fleets that honestly act more like terrorists than soldiers to try and topple the Federation. They do use many Gundam cliches though, i.e. a colony drop. However, it is still terrifying and the way Operation Stardust unfolds is brilliant.The art is everything you've come to expect from Sunrise, in the last two decades anyway. The mechanical designs will blow you away and their fluent movement is positively gorgeous. Takashi Imanishi really knew what he was doing.The characters really aren't...anything different, except the protagonist Kou. He is considerably less emo than Amuro or Kamille. All the other Gundam stereotypes fit. Gato is the ace Zeon pilot who strikes fear in the heart of Feddie soldiers (Char). Synapse is the calm collected captain of the Albion (Bright).Overall despite the many cliches 0083 is very enjoyable, I recommend it to any Gundam or mech fan. I ecspecially recommend it to fans of Gundam Zeta. anything different, except the protagonist Kou. He is considerably less emo than Amuro or Kamille. All the other Gundam stereotypes fit.

It does however fall short of perfection for one very silly reason.The 8th MS team is the best UC OVA in my opinion but 0083 had a real chance of sitting on that throne if only the director hadn't switched half way through, the second half of the show (as enjoyable as it is) is told clumsily, the plot twists come across weakly and you can't...help but feel something integral is missing from the show. The first half episodes 1-7 are perfect and deserve a 10 rating on their own.The Characters are all fairly typical but they work well together, gato the nightmare of solomon especially, who I find to be cooler than char (just my own opinion). Nina and Ensign Uragi have a bumpy romance. As far as development goes Uragi is the only one who really changes but then in a 13 ep series its difficult to focus on developing the whole cast.The story is well told until episode 7  and afterwards bad directing aside the plot is multilayered, I won't say anything else because I don't want to spoil anything for anybody. I would reccomend this to any fan of UC gundam, not as an introductory series though.I love the art, we all know modern mecha can't compare to the classics, the handdrawn backgrounds bring the whole show to life. I want to give this show a 9 but for reasons I've already stated its getting an 8 =[. help but feel something integral is missing from the show.

It combines all the aspects of my favorite Gundam series. The original gave us the savior suit and all the lure that comes with it, Zeta gave us the tragic and horrible nature of war, 08th MS Team was a realistic perspective on the strategy and tactics of battle and how one man cannot win the war on his own.The story is a familiar one to Gundam fans. Zeon wants to attack Earth... again. It\'s up to a young, rookie Gundam pilot and...his friends to save the day aboard their new warship... again. But, rather than our young hero (Ensign Kou Uraki) hoping in his Gundam and laying waste to the enemy all the time, he relies on his teammates and takes time to learn how to be an ace pilot. The enemy, Anavel Gato, is neither the cool, calm, leader nor the Newtype that Char Aznable was. He is vengeful. Hot-headed at times. Those two center the series, but the side characters are very important and each add so much to the series.The subplots and side plots move along with as much steady pace as the main plot and the intrigue level is high. With only 13 episodes, the pace is rapid and exciting leading up to a very exciting and somewhat unexpected conclusion. The meat of the show, the mechs, are pretty awesome. Uraki\'s Gundam Zephyranthes is the standard stream-line Gundam with all the trimmings. Gato\'s stolen Gundam Physalis is one of the beefiest Gundams ever made. With massive armor, shield, and most importantly a nuclear cannon that would make Freud say, ""Compensating?""The art and sound are all very good for the time it came out. The soundtrack is decent (at one point borrowing from John Carpenter\'s ""The Thing"" I swear) Sub vs. Dub? Win for the Sub. With special mention going to Gato\'s Japanese VA, Akio Ootsuka (his English counterpart Kirk Thornton does well, too).The pound-for-pound amount of action, drama, and range of emotions that are packed into these 13 episode is the best of any series. There is not as much sweet, sweet, \'splosion porn to be had as in other series, but the strong plot more than makes up for it. I have watched this one series more times than any other.

It has some great plot elements, others couldn`t be more cliche for the UC. It has some interesting characters and some amazingly lame. As someone who has watched everything Gundam-related, for me, Stardust Memory is the only series of the franchise that I can`t properly classify. More bellow.Story: This is story happens before Zeta Gundam. As this series progresses its dark tone gets darker and darker, which totally fits it since this is basically a prelude to Zeta Gundam. I enjoyed the atmosphere of this series, as well for its dark...tone and the final acts, which are good, and truly provides you with a genuine plot-twist, that will set the events of Zeta. However, some things are very cliche, and they steal away some of this series charm. The fact that some characters are extremely lame ruins some interactions and pacing of the story. They also fitted a massively badly-written romance in the middle that just doesn't feel right. I can sum the story as enjoyable, with its dark tone and final plot-twist, but loaded with uninteresting characters that undermine what Stardust Memory could have been.Art & Sound: The art is amazing for the time, and the sound is pretty good. The OST is forgetfull. I must highlight how I enjoyed the atmosphere of the series. The art director of this series knowns who to create a good ambiance, the colors are well-chosen, the city has some sort of nostalgic fell about it. Props for the art!Character: This is a mixed bag. Some characters like Gato, are good and enjoyable, with personalities that you wish to see more, but most are either neutral (like 70% of them), or lame. The protagonist, Uraki, is cliche and childish to the point you don`t actually understand its motivations. One of the villans, Cima, is cliche at the point of evil laughs, and sly evil comments, which is very distant of the overall tone of this series, even Gundam in general. Nina has nothing to stand out, looking like a watered-down version of Sayla Mass with a touch of some Flay c**p. There is no character development, which is no excuse just because this is only 13 episodes because War in the Pocket was able to make great character development in 6 episodes. Uraki is a terrible pilot, maybe the worse Gundam pilot in the series, and an immature teenager to the end. At least you will get some more stories of characters that will be major in Zeta Gundam.Mechas: I like the main Gundams of this series, the GP01 to 03 types. They are variations of the RX-178 type, but with some cool mechanics and better appearances. GP01 is basically RX-178 in HD, but GP02 looks like Zeta mixed with ZZ, kinda nice. GP03 is a deluxe edition of RX-178, inside a Mobile Armor. Also, in this series, you will see what I think was the inspiration for MS Kshatrya, of Gundam Unicorn.Overall this is an enjoyable series because of the art, final plot-twists and its dark tone. But the characters (except for Gato) are tiresome and lame, especially Uraki, the protagonist, Nina, and Cima, one of the antagonists.

But the characters (except for Gato) are tiresome and lame, especially Uraki, the protagonist, Nina, and Cima, one of the antagonists. If you like Zeta Gundam and good art, see this series."", 'the fights were alright and animated well enough and the episodic episodes fit the show.most of the episodes follow the depressed npc mc screwing up getting to a gundam then either fixing it and making it worse. And then the side characters who throw him a pity party and are slowly drained from their personalities they had at the start of the show because of him.The ending was anticlimactic and was even more boring than the show as a whole which is not to undersell how boring this show is.BUTmy main point on why this is not a negative but a mixed feeling review...is because ""magic"" the first ed is amazing and a great listen even if you don\'t watch this show. is because ""magic"" the first ed is amazing and a great listen even if you don\'t watch this show.', ""Stardust Memory is evidence that a Gundam anime can actually endure terrible main characters and a story that craps its pants and collapses right before the finish line.  Functionally it operates as a prequel to Zeta and a sequel to the original Mobile Suit Gundam, helping bridge the transition from here to there.  It does suffer like most prequels from you being one step ahead of it because you know how things end up and characters who don't make an appearance later in the timeline lack importance.First off the story is serviceable for the most part, a ticking clock element with the race...to find the stolen Gundam and find out what Operation Stardust is and how to stop it.  Though the scale of time isn't properly conveyed so if you dwell on it you start to wonder why the Albion seems to be doing everything by itself despite a huge Federation fleet that is shown later seemingly doing nothing of importance.  It is only in the last few episode where the story completely falls on its face, this is partly the fault of the characters which I'll get into soon.  But it feels so rushed in the final act which does lend to the sense of urgency that the characters are supposed to be feeling but hours pass in mere seconds as if nothing happened during that time.  Lastly the ending is a complete downer, it makes sense since it leads into the downer world that is Zeta, but it goes a little too far in my opinion as 0079 was a plenty downer year already so it feels like just adding misery to the pile.  They do try to add some bitter sweetness to it but that too falls on its face because it is for two characters that I honestly couldn't believe anyone would like, no avoiding it now I guess.I'm not saying 0083 has a bad cast, quite the contrary I like a lot of the side characters a lot, and I wish more time was spent with them.  The problem lies in the main trio and the main antagonist, we'll start with him.  Admiral Delaz is an empty uniform, his entire goal is to take revenge upon the Federation for losing the OYW,as if the Federation didn't deserve to win or something.  A supporter of Ghiren Zabi that somehow lacks any sort of real personality or flavor to him.  This extends to his most loyal supporter Anavel Gato, whose main struggle is dealing with his feelings of guilt for not dying with his comrades, which is almost interesting until you listen to him blame the Federation for all of it, as if he doesn't have scores of fellow soldiers who he killed on the Federation's side.  He believes himself to be righteous, his zeal for Zeon just being his defining character trait along with smugness and being a ham.  His opposition isn't much better, main character Kou Uraki is interesting for the first few episodes and then I just want to strangle him with his own intestines.  He starts out as a greenhorn test pilot who is really interested in mobiles suits and as demonstrated, Gundams, and he is quickly confronted with real combat which hits him hard.  Then he sort of acts like an angsty crybaby and bounces around from episode to episode and then you start to pray for Keith to be the main character because at least he is consistent.  But considering who his love interest is I can't really blame him for being all over the place, if I had to deal with Nina I'd find the nearest airlock to jump out of after 5 minutes.  Nina alternates between hot and cold with Kou which while irritating isn't exactly a problem but her attachment to the Gundams just adds another layer of emotional drama that I just don't care at all about.  The two are awkward around each other, which I guess is supposed to be cute but it always leads to some melodrama and usually has an angsty undertone too it which doesn't help.  But Nina's, uhh, surprise revelation and what inevitably comes of it pretty much tanks the show, the pure daytime soap opera level of it all just detracting from the gravity of what is happening which is pretty damn important.But like I said, there are characters that I really enjoy, the bridge crew of the Albion deserved more time to shine as they all seemed like real interesting people, before they all became Titans.  The back up mobile suit team is full of personality that barely gets any focus besides the sexual predator who likely would have been imprisoned before the start of the show as there is no reason for the Federation to be so lenient on what would be defined as sexual assault.  Maybe he'd be funny if that wasn't the hat he wore but that was pretty much all there is to the character and if it wasn't played for comedy he'd be a henchmen for Yazan.  Chuck Keith is a cool dude, like Uraki he is a bit of greenhorn but he doesn't have a gundam so there is actual danger for him, and he doesn't screw up as much as his friend Uraki.  Chuck and the mechanic Mora's relationship was barely touched on at all and it still was miles better than the main romance.  I honestly wish those two were the main couple, as Uraki and Nina's relationship makes me long for death.  Even the side antagonist Cima Garahau was better suited to the role of main antagonist, bringing flair and depth to the Zeon side, that gets even better with the side materials that help explain her backstory as opposed to Delaz, who looks worse the more you consider the eventual history of the UC timeline.  While Cima is a tragic character while Delaz could only ever aspire to be one of the background officers for Hitler expy Ghiren Zabi.Okay now to talk about everything else which is pretty good to great.  The Art direction is just, imagine a chef's kiss and you got it.  The style leans closer to detail and a more militaristic feel.  The animation is great, the battles are all good and filled with exploding chaos.  The sound effect are 90's Gundam standard, if you've watched any shows from that era you know what I am talking about.  The openings are both good and catchy along with the first ending, the second ending is a little too generic sounding and forgettable.  The show is pretty enjoyable, you know so long as the main characters aren't on screen or Uraki is keeping his mouth shut.  Though I will admit one moment in a duel with Gato was extremely entertaining as it switches to the Albion bridge to Nina's perspective and you can still hear their grunting over the radio, meaning they can both hear it along with everyone else on their channel, and having it play over the shot of the bridge was just priceless entertainment 10/10.I may have undersold the positive qualities of this show and oversold some of the negative aspects.  Gato is a serviceable villain for Uraki, if a little too flat of a character.  But I am not kidding when I say Kou and Nina drag this show down, especially when together.  Their awkwardness isn't endearing because it is surrounded by melodrama.  The ending really does leave you with a bad taste in your mouth, the last time I watched it I questioned why even bothered to in the first place.  But on this rewatch I have found enough good to say that fans of Gundam or mecha or even anime fans with time on their hands should give it a chance, though the latter group should probably watch the original Gundam series or the movies to get an idea how everything sorta works.  Skipping the Nina and Kou parts doesn't make it too hard to understand I guess, and if you don't want to do that just wait until it becomes too unbearable before skipping to the next scene.  Give it a try, it isn't the worst Gundam series ever, Seed Destiny still has that title clutched in it's iron grip. to find the stolen Gundam and find out what Operation Stardust is and how to stop it.

It would almost be exactly what you want, but that ONE detail would render it inedible.That sums up how this show makes me feel.The synopsis sounds absolutely thrilling, if fairly expected of a UC Gundam show: ""After the One Year War, an Anaheim Electronics-designed Suit with nuclear capabilities is stolen by Zeon soldiers trying to revive the regime. Our Feddie protagonist has to get it, tragedy ensues"".It also looks and sounds amazing, my eyes were never bored from start to finish....The animation is as fluid and detailed as you\'d expect a late 80\'s-early 90\'s OVA to be, and every Mobile Suit battle is a delightful spectacle of mechanical gore.It\'s also the exact kind of plot-bridge that makes Zeta Gundam understandable (quite a task cause that show is often a mess). The political theater is so much clearer having watched Stardust; The motivations of each faction are consistent with their ideals, this is a critical moment for the development of the in-universe history for the UC timeline so it is worthy of being told. At a macro-level, this is exactly what a middling show like Zeta needed to be easier to follow, but that\'s the good part, the problem is the characters.The chemistry between the main character and his love interest is bafflingly superficial and I struggle to believe either of them would truly have any romantic feelings, she acts like a gullible and stupid woman around him, which is not consistent with how the rest of the show tries to portray her. The main focus is on characters whose motivations and personalities are so shallow and hard to buy into that they immediately break my suspension of disbelief.It\'s truly, truly disappointing execution in storytelling, in the most heart-breaking way. Stardust Memory is like being told, in detail, about the development of the Second World War through the lens of a cartoonishly fake soldier written by a sheltered teen who\'s never fought anyone or been in love.As it stands, I would have much rather watched the supporting cast focused on since they\'re actually likeable and act like believeable humans rather than caricatures of dysfunctional people with unclear, unresolved issues. That way you\'d still get supremely executed animation and the suspense of the overarching political situation, without the camera being focused on a gutless idiot and his spineless girlfriend, both of whom would feel at home in a bland throwaway romance show made for teens who\'d rather mope than face their problems.I\'m absolutely torn. At a technical level this show is impeccable, from sound to animation everything is just right for me. The problem is only who the camera is focused on most of the time.

The truth is I like the romance they put in but in the last chapters it is how it gets distorted and there is no more. In other words, the protagonist gives more importance to the old relationship than to the new one, the truth is shit. The main character is very flat, he has nothing to highlight this there to see his null evolution, he is always the same idiot. I was very disappointed in this anime hopefully they haven't done other trash like this. Be careful, this is comparing it with its own series, compared to...a series of generic mecha has its own thing, the universe where it takes place is very well built as always in gundam.En español:Por ahora la serie mas floja de gundam. La verdad me gusta el romance que meten pero en los últimos capítulos es como se distorsiona y ya no hay. O sea le da mas importancia a la antigua relación la protagonista que a la nueva la verdad una mierda. El personaje principal es muy plano no tiene nada que destacar esta ahi para ver su nula evolución siempre es el mismo idiota. Me decepcionó mucho este anime ojala no hayan hecho otras basuras como esta. Ojo esto es comparándolo con sus propias series , comparado con una serie de mechas genérica tiene lo suyo, el universo donde transcurre esta muy bien construido como siempre en gundam. a series of generic mecha has its own thing, the universe where it takes place is very well built as always in gundam.En español:Por ahora la serie mas floja de gundam.

Man important events are only mentioned while in my opinion it would be important they were shown so things would be clearer. In some moments, I was unsure of what was going on.The art is fair, nothing too good, nothing bad, but I think they could have invested a bit more in certain moments, we get many takes that have no movement at all, action takes with parts that were used more than once and some battle scenes just don\'t make it clear what\'s happening. By the other hand, some moments are amazing, with great direction, emotion and well animated combat scenes; all of this gave me the impression the energy of the creators was intensely focused in some specific moments of the animation while other moments didn\'t get the attention they deserved.The sound, in my opinion, is one of the best things about this anime. The openings are very well directed, the songs are very good and well used along the episodes.The characters maybe are the elements I liked the less, unfortunately. A lot of screen time is spent with characters that really have no objective or relevance to the main story, with conflicts that go nowhere and some romantic subplots that sounded out of place in my view. They could have focused more in fewer characters and develop them better. After 13 episodes we still know so little even about the main characters, some of them sound empty when it comes to reason or motivation. A lot of time spent with mecha details like doors opening or ships taking flight/landing that don\'t add much to the story could have been invested in the main characters, whose past is only mentioned and barely showed.I did enjoy watching this anime, but mainly during the first episodes and then the last episodes, with the middle of the story making me a bit tired, it felt a bit dull for me, since the story sounded lost in circles, giving us subplots that wouldn\'t take the characters or the story anywhere. Some ""romantic"" moments sounded out of place for me, and to be honest, with the magnitude of the events of the story, anything romantic needed to be very well written and executed to fit in, and the impression I got was that part was superficial, with a confusing turn of events that also didn\'t take the story anywhere, I also feel bad for that, since the characters did have potential to be better developed, as well as the links between them. I feel the story got a bit lost and they had to rush things in the last 3 episodes. The characters\' growth to me was minimum, if present, they seem all the same from episode 1 to episode 13. I really wanted to see more of the story of characters like Gato and Kou, in this case, more about Gato\'s past and the kind of person he is and more about Kou\'s future. In my opinion, there has to be a good cohesion between the characters, the story and the events, and that cohesion is a bit loose in Gundam 0083, the characters seemed a bit lost in the story in my perception, and it\'s sad because they had so much potential, if certain things had been executed differently in this anime, maybe if it had less episodes and focused more in the relevant events and character development.Still, I\'m a fan, I liked this anime and I think Gundam fans and mecha fans might like it. I really enjoy playing games where Kou and Gato are playable and I absolutely love the songs of this anime. Gundam 0083 can be interesting and fun, but I wish it was more objective and focused more in what mattered, like the main storyline and character development. built and that didn\'t affect the main plot in any relevant way, with characters that weren\'t developed at all showing up as possible antagonists or villains, leaving some confusion to the story.

Assuming you are aware of how the timeline of the show goes and have read my review of the original show, so I won’t have to repeat myself, this is how it goes. SM takes place between the first and second seasons and even attempts to bridge them together by explaining how those assholes the Titans got to power. Other than that, the whole show is a cheesefest.A major problem with the show is that it involves a major battle that could have changed...the course of history, yet none of the major pilots from the first series appears or is even mentioned. In a similar fashion many pilots in this series are considered to be elites but are also never mentioned in the main storyline later on. So as a side story it is thrown in the main events in a very sloppy way. This was not a problem with the previous side story, War In the Pocket, because none of its characters were major players in the war, and all the events that took place there were just an unimportant scrimmage that went unnoticed.Aside from that, even the overall story feels like a dumbed down rehash of the original show. The evil dudes steal a super mecha, the idealist protagonist steals an equally super mecha to stop them, and then you get the usual battles in each episode. There is a sort of a plot twist towards the end regarding a major treason and a second secret weapon of mass destruction but not even that managed to affect the showdown in any significant way.Even the characters feel too simplistic to care. Despite being elites and military higher ups, they barely have much of a backdrop or are fleshed out much. The protagonist in particular is a complete shounen cardboard, with absolutely nothing to remember him about. Also, there is so much action in this show that it ends up overshadowing character appeal for shallow entertainment.As far as action goes, it is great for the time it was made and if you are watching it just for that you will love it. The production values are very good, although I found the character designs to be typical and some robot designs too bulky and impractical.In all, this side story took the exact opposite route of War In The Pocket. You are going to watch it for the cool action and not for its characters or the story. And since we are already getting lots of good action in the main storyline, not even those save face after awhile. I mean the pacing is ok and the characters are rather colorful but nothing stands out enough to matter. Thus I recommend it only for mecha maniacs and Gundam completists. Those of you who are not deep into the franchise can skip it altogether.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 9/10Analysis: General Artwork 2/2, Character Figures 1/2, Backgrounds 2/2, Animation 2/2, Visual Effects 2/2SOUND SECTION: 7/10Analysis: Voice Acting 2/3, Music Themes 3/4, Sound Effects 2/3STORY SECTION: 5/10Analysis: Premise 1/2, Pacing 1/2, Complexity 1/2, Plausibility 1/2, Conclusion 1/2CHARACTER SECTION: 5/10Analysis: Presence 1/2, Personality 1/2, Backdrop 1/2, Development 1/2, Catharsis 1/2VALUE SECTION: 4/10Analysis: Historical Value 1/3, Rewatchability 1/3, Memorability 2/4ENJOYMENT SECTION: 3/10Analysis: Art 1/1, Sound 1/2, Story 1/3, Characters 0/4VERDICT: 5.5/10 the course of history, yet none of the major pilots from the first series appears or is even mentioned.

The figths are amazing and hand drawn. Thats all I can say or want to, you can read someone elses or just watch it.My biggest reason to write this is to express my disappointment with these characters. Kou Uraki is your typical whiny sulking bitch-boy who knows too much about Gundams for his own good. The plot device of a woman known as Nina is a shit engineer who frequently just cries over him or her ex, who for some reason still feels devoted to protect. In my...opinion, these two some how oversaturate the story, without allowing me to feel any connection between the two, nor did I even want to like them as much as they irritated me with their shit elementary school crushes.You can tell there was a shift in directors because the supporting characters that were just as enjoyable to watch as the fights themselves quickly took a backseat to the madness that became hard to follow the last 6 or 7 episodes. The op's and ending songs were very good, and if anything more compelling to want to watch the next episode.Only watch if you are going down the line, if not, just go straight to Zeta. opinion, these two some how oversaturate the story, without allowing me to feel any connection between the two, nor did I even want to like them as much as they irritated me with their shit elementary school crushes.You can tell there was a shift in directors because the supporting characters that were just as enjoyable to watch as the fights themselves quickly took a backseat to the madness that became hard to follow the last 6 or 7 episodes.

Mediocre to terrible, with the only decent characters in the crew kinda vanishing from the story as soon as protagonist Kou Uraki and local neurotic individual Nina Purpleton hog more and...more screentime with their zero-chemistry love story.So basically, the best way to enjoy Stardust Memory is by watching fight scene compilations on Youtube and listening to the OPs on Soundcloud.Thanks for nothing, Bandai. more screentime with their zero-chemistry love story.So basically, the best way to enjoy Stardust Memory is by watching fight scene compilations on Youtube and listening to the OPs on Soundcloud.Thanks for nothing, Bandai."", 'Man , the end to this show was one of the most frustrating endings I have ever seen.Like WTF were all those random plot twists supposed to mean, all the important character arcs were just abandoned, for no appearend reason.

The animation quality, while dated today, was ahead of it's time. Victory Gundam, released 3 years later than 0083, is definitely put to shame by how great this show looks.Despite the plot once again being a recycle of the same Gundam trope of an inexperienced pilot being thrust into the cockpit of...responsibility without preparation, and going on to be all-powerful by the end of the show, 0083 does enough things different to keep things fresh. Episodes 6 and 7 stick out as real highlights of the show, and include a great story that is not only powerful and emotional, but fits in well to the overarching story and helps to grow the characters. No prior knowledge is required of Gundam and the Universal Century, however, for U.C. fans, there is a lot to enjoy.The mobile suit designs in this show are at their most creative and expressive in a Gundam series compared to any show released before it. The GP02A has become one of my favourite designs, and the Xamel is one of the coolest, more expressive suits I've seen. Mobile suits in 0083 have a realistic finish to them, you can often sense their weight and impact. This show is probably the most realistic interpretation of the Gundam timeline I have seen.This show is, of course, not without it's flaws. A common criticism of the characters is how dim-witted some of their decisions can be, and while i can think of a couple of occasions between the main character and his love interest that left me wanting to kill myself, I feel like most of these moments can be justified, and serve the plot well. Every other character that is not one of the two main characters can often feel flat or unimportant, or can feel pushed to the side to concentrate on the two MCs.I loved my time with 0083. It's a show, and for me, the first Gundam I have seen, that seems to know what it's doing and stay consistent from start to finish. It knows what experience it's trying to deliver, and executes it flawlessly. At the time of writing, I have only seen Gundam shows released before this one, but to me, 0083 feels like, for the first time, Sunrise have worked out the formula for what makes a great Gundam show, and I wouldn't be surprised if future series follow in it's footsteps. responsibility without preparation, and going on to be all-powerful by the end of the show, 0083 does enough things different to keep things fresh.

But personally I enjoyed it up to the ending really. Now there will be some spoilers so skip the bracket. [[I wasn’t a fan about the ending when Nina straight up leaves Kou for Gato. Maybe if there was more writing about there past that explained why she had strong feelings for him, I think the story overall would be more enjoyable. And in the last episode she doesn’t even try to apologize for the stuff the made Kou go through. If there was some sort of apology in the ending then it...might have been more enjoyably for me.]] other than the fact the story gets a Bit choppy at the end, I still think this is a good gundam series.

For an OVA there are to many under developed moments.Art: Phenomenal mecha designs, attention to detail is excellent.Sound: Classic Gundam sound, good music.Characters: Boring, barely one dimensional, outshined by some side characters.Overall: 6.8This OVA is so close to being good but what holds it back really holds it back. The more you watch the other shows around this one the more things can make sense, which I guess it a bit obvious, it's a side story in itself to explain some events between main arcs. A bit more focus on the main plot and...the flat out dropping of some of the side stuff would have done wonders. the flat out dropping of some of the side stuff would have done wonders."", 'One thing I will say I really disliked right off the bat was the Nina Kou romance, especially so when it turned into a love triangle at the end. Tomino had nothing to do with this OVA, but the ""You can\'t call that betrayal when a woman does it. Women are quick to change their stance on things. So to a man, it looks like betrayal. [...] They give up on their men. Why do they abandon them’? It’s a sort of basic self-instinct, I think. \'Women can’t survive without depending on someone.\'"" quote kept ringing painfully in my ear whenever she was around....When she left the ship when Kou didn\'t take her to the movies and only came back when he said he loved her. Or caring about her love triangle far more than the colony drop on either her home on earth. Even if, again, this wasn\'t written by Tomino, it is a writer emulating the worst parts of the women Tomino writes. A woman whose whole political/life philosophy and raison d\'etre being the man he is attracted to at any moment is just boring. It\'s the same gripe Ii had with Reccoa and Sarah and Quess and others.That being said, there are a lot of things that I like about this OVA that made me give it an 8. This is also the most ""pro-antagonist"" of any Gundam I\'ve seen so far. I\'ve seen Gundam fans say that Gundam is a franchise where there aren\'t any good or bad sides, it\'s just everyone fighting for their own ideals. While I see where they\'re coming from, and Tomino has said on record that he makes sure to have all sides in the war have a point, I do have to disagree with the way that is framed. In Tomino\'s interviews and the way they always portray the antagonist side as poison gassing and nuking civilians or needing to brainwash children for their ends, it is obvious in a lot more ways than one that he sees the side that needs to be rooted for by the children is always the protagonists side. With this one, I liked how Gato was both Kou\'s reason to kill and also almost a mentor to him. Showing how skilled he could be with the Gundam if he tried while lecturing Kou about what it means to be a soldier, which to an extent Kou ended up taking to heart as the series progresses. It also has the Zeon higher ups as well as the individual soldiers being the only ones that fight for the big picture, while every federation soldier is more content to fight just because they\'re following orders or for the sake of their friends. Zeon is still the side that murders civilian lives the most, but it does feel overshadowed by the one or two scenes of civilian spacenoids supporting them, and that this is the Gundam that seems to have the least care for civilian deaths. Like when Kou found out the deaths were unavoidable, his only thought was wondering if him and his teammates fought for nothing.To list some more things I liked in short sentences: It was nice seeing a jock-type rival to the main character that, in contrast to Jerid in Zeta Gundam, was on the same side as him and was a barrier he had to get above at the very start. I liked how unsure and easily picked on Kou was at the start. Besides Bern and maybe Amuro, he feels like the character who develops the most in Gundam. Also Haman and Bask\'s cameos were short but were so well done. When she left the ship when Kou didn\'t take her to the movies and only came back when he said he loved her.

I really enjoyed how nicely the Gundam models were depicted, with many technical details and a clear attempt to make the movements and mechanics somewhat realistic, supported by a great Top-Gun inspired soundtrack and stunning visual art.When it comes to the plot, it also stays on the usual Gundam style, by depicting the various characters with a serious tone far from the usual heroes/villains approach, while also giving emphasis on the struggle of the war and how it impacts people relationships in order to pursue their ideals, without never exceeding in giving evidence about which...faction is wrong or right.That’s why I always loved Gundam, cause since the beginning it always attempted to be an adult show, not a kid-oriented one and Stardust Memory is not different from this. For sure a classic series which I easily recommend to all Gundam fans. Thanks for reading me! faction is wrong or right.That’s why I always loved Gundam, cause since the beginning it always attempted to be an adult show, not a kid-oriented one and Stardust Memory is not different from this. For sure a classic series which I easily recommend to all Gundam fans. Thanks for reading me!', 'Stardust Memory is a Gundam OVA that takes place between the One Year War of Mobile Suit Gundam and the events of Zeta, taking place 3 years after War in the Pocket.Operation Stardust is a plan spearheaded by Anavel Gato, a notorious spectre of the One Year War known as The Nightmare of Solomon, alongside the head of the Delaz fleet, Aiguille Delaz. These are ostensibly the antagonists of the series, but they are also the reason that there\'s a series at all, the engineers behind the events unfolding, and the necromancers behind the resurrection of warfare in Universal Century 0083.Resurrection, rebirth, memory. The meaning...of these words is probed throughout this series as they echo in the vacuum of space. Other than the protagonist Kou and his closest friend Keith, essentially every other character in the series is a veteran of the One Year War, or at least has experienced the repercussions of it firsthand. Whereas Kou and Keith are only indirectly familiar with the nature of war, which one could say is as good as not being familiar at all. Their fear is palpable as they\'re first thrown into combat. When Anavel Gato attacks the Albion and seizes a Gundam and a nuke at the beginning of the series, there\'s a shot of Nina Purpleton shaking as missiles rain down on the base. Mora Boscht asks if its her first time seeing a battle firsthand, and Nina continues to shake in silence, her eyes wide, as we get a great cut to Kou shaking in fear in his cockpit. With this wordless exposition we realize, though he may be a mobile suit pilot, this is his first overwhelming taste of battle. All Kou and Keith know of the One Year War are the spectres and legends that continue to haunt, like that of the Nightmare of Solomon, whom they initially conceive of as a foe whose legendary powers they couldn\'t possibly contend with.So far on my journey across the Universal Century, I\'ve seen Mobile Suit Gundam, 08th MS Team, and War in the pocket. Stardust Memory is the series that takes us back into space, and it\'s got a bit more action up its sleeve than those other two OVAs. While I preferred the look and feel of War in the Pocket, where the style and direction all feels a bit more purposeful, Stardust Memory certainly looks great, and takes the combat up a notch.Scars and spectres are everywhere in Stardust Memory. Yet rebirth and resurrection are as much about rewriting history, trying to ignore the parts we\'d rather forget, as they are reestablishing its continuity with the future. Kelly Layzner sees the resurrection of the war as a chance to redeem himself, and he intends to fight as if he never lost his arm in the first place, ignoring the scars wrought by battle. It costs him his life, when he could\'ve taken the opportunity to live a peaceful life with Lateura. Dazel is bent on making up for Zeon\'s humiliating loss at A Baoa Qu. On the Feddie side, Monsha can\'t accept that he\'s not the hero who wins the war and gets the girl in his narrative as he may have been during the One Year War, and relentlessly takes out his insecurity and frustration on Kou.Stardust Memory is an inspection of the ways the past haunts the present, the way our scars, legends and memories linger, and even seem to control our fates as we struggle against them. Gato harps on the value of his/Zeon\'s ideals, and the fight for independence for all Spacenoids; Delaz delivers a televised speech about the totalitarian rule of the Federation, echoing some of the Zabi propaganda from 0079, and the need for Zeon\'s fight to carry on; but are they not blatantly overlooking the self interest, racism, greed, and internal rot which caused the collapse of Zeon in the first place? How easy it is for one\'s ideals to get lost and drift by the wayside in the heat of war, as others within your own faction vie to seize control of the armed forces and the narrative. As one character says in Gasaraki (another amazing mech anime), it\'s much easier to start a war than to stop one. Will the ills of Zeon\'s past not haunt its rebirth, once the plot is set in motion and it\'s too late to turn back? Does success in the present ever pay for the past sacrifices and missteps? Does it transform a failure into an act of heroism?The other side of this, the haunting of the past, is the far more trying task of learning from experience. The older characters in Stardust Memory, for the most part, live in, or try to reenact the events of their past, perhaps trying to get them right the second time. Yet inevitably, they fail again. Rather than learning from one\'s own experience, experience is something passed on to the next generation, as with Lieutenant Burning and Kou. Burning is a sort of mentor and father figure for Kou as Kou acclimates himself to becoming a soldier, and a man.(Spoilers to follow)The event that the series is leading up to is a return to the Sea of Solomon, a sector of space drenched with history, for another battle. This is where the blood was shed and metal was rent and torn that earned Gato his nickname, the Nightmare of Solomon, and the legendary status that looms over him along with it. The Nightmare of Solomon is more than just his nickname though, it\'s a nightmare which continues to pervade the lives of all the characters involved in the series. It\'s Gato\'s nightmare as well. In the episode where the combatants rush back into the sea, we see Gato staring out the window of his spacecraft, second guessing whether he should really return, anticipating the potential repeat of history, and the loss of more of his Zeon comrades\' lives. A Sea of stars washes over his reflection in the window. Elsewhere, gazing out the window of another ship into oblivion, Haman Karn asks herself how long they\'ll be trapped in the cold of space fighting for the sake of ""ideals.""Shortly after, Kou returns from a sortie, having just lost Lieutenant Burning, and says to himself ""The sea [of Solomon] is hell"" through gritted teeth. He doesn\'t even have time to mourn before the combat picks back up. There\'s a feeling that the continuation of war is compulsive, inevitable, unstoppable. Once the Gundam is stolen, there\'s no turning back. Once the nuke is deployed, there\'s no turning back. Because people died for what they believed in years ago, because people continue to die, the surviving characters must put their lives on the line and fight, too. Gato must continue to test the righteousness of his beliefs until he\'s stopped, and Kou must stop him. That\'s the only way, Kou tells himself, for the hell to end. It\'s time to put everything Lieutenant Burning taught him on the line. And yet, does it ever really end? How will the memory of operation Stardust haunt the future?As they prepare to battle, the lingering debris and bodies, zombified mechs and soldiers from the first battle in the Sea of Solomon, obscure the Zeon troops. The scars, spectres and memories of a past clash; yet even beyond the grave they are in a sense involved in the combat. Perhaps Lieutenant Burning has become a piece of floating debris just the same. With no burial, no memorial, he\'s become a fact of the terrain of space. Anonymous but material. The man forgotten, his corpse and mobile suit preserved frozen in place. What threshold separates the dead and destroyed from the living? ""We\'ll use them for cover, and that\'s why we\'ll win"" Gato explains.Gato\'s nuking of the Federation\'s Naval Review is, it turns out, just the beginning of operation Stardust, and more of a symbolic victory. The reenactment of the One Year War doesn\'t end here, as after smashing two space colonies into each other, Cima and Dezal intend to smash a third colony into Earth itself, repeating the ""most terrible tragedy of the One Year War."" This isn\'t a mere matter of history repeating itself, it\'s an almost pathological compulsion to repeat history on purpose. As this war disease starts to take hold of Nina and Kou, Nina warns Kou that she wants them both to back out while they have the chance, now that the two Gundam units have been destroyed. But it\'s too late, there\'s a third unit, and Kou is the only one who can use it, with Nina\'s technical support, to stop the colony from barreling into Earth.And this is where the series really tips its hand.Up until now we\'ve seen Kou go through a typical coming of age arc, embroiled in this world haunted by its past, full of soldiers with codes of honor, allegiance to ideals, thirsts for vengeance and glory. Unfortunately, while Kou does become a man, everything he learns about being a man comes from these haunted soldiers, so he\'s trapped in the same exact mindset as them. By the end of the anime, Kou doesn\'t accomplish anything. He doesn\'t retrieve Unit 02. He doesn\'t kill Gato. He doesn\'t stop the colony from crashing into Earth. If everything he\'s learned isn\'t enough to save the day, to protect humanity, to stop the endless war, then how DO we get out of this mess?Well, the answer WOULD be Cima and Nina.At this point in the story, Cima reveals that she\'s been colluding with the Federation to stop Dezal. Nina reveals she had a romance with Gato between the One Year War and operation Stardust. These women have no sense of allegiance, and that\'s the key that allows them to step outside of the narrow viewpoint shared by the soldiers and see that the bloodshed is leading nowhere. Just like Haman Karn and Lateura, Nina and Cima are skeptical of the male soldiers\' obsessions with their ideals. At what point does the violence bring their vision into reality? Will it be when the colony strikes Earth? Is that when the Spacenoids will be free? Kou is utterly unable to grasp why Nina won\'t let him kill Gato, and thinks it is simply a matter of her having stronger feelings for Gato than for him. But she simply is brave enough to ask: what is actually gained by killing Gato, if the mission is already over?However, Nina fails to protect Gato because he won\'t allow himself to be protected. He sacrifices himself by ramming his mobile suit into a Federation Ship. Like Kelley, he insists on dying an ""honorable"" death in combat, while trying to reach Earth to pass on the legend of their battle to the future generation. Cima is similarly foiled by Gato and Delaz, and she\'s brutally murdered by Kou, right after she asks him ""Who\'s side are you really on?"" Ironic, coming from her, but it goes to show that this battle is not really between Zeon and the Federation, it\'s between those in allegiance to senseless murder in the guise of heroism, and those in allegiance to protecting innocent lives. The tragedy is that the few individuals (all women, mind you) who are capable of examining things from outside the soldier\'s perspective, are incapable of doing anything about it because they\'re horrendously outnumbered by haunted soldiers on all sides. of these words is probed throughout this series as they echo in the vacuum of space.

Gato harps on the value of his/Zeon\'s ideals, and the fight for independence for all Spacenoids; Delaz delivers a televised speech about the totalitarian rule of the Federation, echoing some of the Zabi propaganda from 0079, and the need for Zeon\'s fight to carry on; but are they not blatantly overlooking the self interest, racism, greed, and internal rot which caused the collapse of Zeon in the first place? How easy it is for one\'s ideals to get lost and drift by the wayside in the heat of war, as others within your own faction vie to seize control of the armed forces and the narrative. As one character says in Gasaraki (another amazing mech anime), it\'s much easier to start a war than to stop one. Will the ills of Zeon\'s past not haunt its rebirth, once the plot is set in motion and it\'s too late to turn back? Does success in the present ever pay for the past sacrifices and missteps? Does it transform a failure into an act of heroism?The other side of this, the haunting of the past, is the far more trying task of learning from experience. The older characters in Stardust Memory, for the most part, live in, or try to reenact the events of their past, perhaps trying to get them right the second time. Yet inevitably, they fail again. Rather than learning from one\'s own experience, experience is something passed on to the next generation, as with Lieutenant Burning and Kou. Burning is a sort of mentor and father figure for Kou as Kou acclimates himself to becoming a soldier, and a man.(Spoilers to follow)The event that the series is leading up to is a return to the Sea of Solomon, a sector of space drenched with history, for another battle. This is where the blood was shed and metal was rent and torn that earned Gato his nickname, the Nightmare of Solomon, and the legendary status that looms over him along with it. The Nightmare of Solomon is more than just his nickname though, it\'s a nightmare which continues to pervade the lives of all the characters involved in the series. It\'s Gato\'s nightmare as well. In the episode where the combatants rush back into the sea, we see Gato staring out the window of his spacecraft, second guessing whether he should really return, anticipating the potential repeat of history, and the loss of more of his Zeon comrades\' lives. A Sea of stars washes over his reflection in the window. Elsewhere, gazing out the window of another ship into oblivion, Haman Karn asks herself how long they\'ll be trapped in the cold of space fighting for the sake of ""ideals.""Shortly after, Kou returns from a sortie, having just lost Lieutenant Burning, and says to himself ""The sea [of Solomon] is hell"" through gritted teeth. He doesn\'t even have time to mourn before the combat picks back up. There\'s a feeling that the continuation of war is compulsive, inevitable, unstoppable. Once the Gundam is stolen, there\'s no turning back. Once the nuke is deployed, there\'s no turning back. Because people died for what they believed in years ago, because people continue to die, the surviving characters must put their lives on the line and fight, too. Gato must continue to test the righteousness of his beliefs until he\'s stopped, and Kou must stop him. That\'s the only way, Kou tells himself, for the hell to end. It\'s time to put everything Lieutenant Burning taught him on the line. And yet, does it ever really end? How will the memory of operation Stardust haunt the future?As they prepare to battle, the lingering debris and bodies, zombified mechs and soldiers from the first battle in the Sea of Solomon, obscure the Zeon troops. The scars, spectres and memories of a past clash; yet even beyond the grave they are in a sense involved in the combat. Perhaps Lieutenant Burning has become a piece of floating debris just the same. With no burial, no memorial, he\'s become a fact of the terrain of space. Anonymous but material. The man forgotten, his corpse and mobile suit preserved frozen in place. What threshold separates the dead and destroyed from the living? ""We\'ll use them for cover, and that\'s why we\'ll win"" Gato explains.Gato\'s nuking of the Federation\'s Naval Review is, it turns out, just the beginning of operation Stardust, and more of a symbolic victory. The reenactment of the One Year War doesn\'t end here, as after smashing two space colonies into each other, Cima and Dezal intend to smash a third colony into Earth itself, repeating the ""most terrible tragedy of the One Year War."" This isn\'t a mere matter of history repeating itself, it\'s an almost pathological compulsion to repeat history on purpose. As this war disease starts to take hold of Nina and Kou, Nina warns Kou that she wants them both to back out while they have the chance, now that the two Gundam units have been destroyed. But it\'s too late, there\'s a third unit, and Kou is the only one who can use it, with Nina\'s technical support, to stop the colony from barreling into Earth.And this is where the series really tips its hand.Up until now we\'ve seen Kou go through a typical coming of age arc, embroiled in this world haunted by its past, full of soldiers with codes of honor, allegiance to ideals, thirsts for vengeance and glory. Unfortunately, while Kou does become a man, everything he learns about being a man comes from these haunted soldiers, so he\'s trapped in the same exact mindset as them. By the end of the anime, Kou doesn\'t accomplish anything. He doesn\'t retrieve Unit 02. He doesn\'t kill Gato. He doesn\'t stop the colony from crashing into Earth. If everything he\'s learned isn\'t enough to save the day, to protect humanity, to stop the endless war, then how DO we get out of this mess?Well, the answer WOULD be Cima and Nina.At this point in the story, Cima reveals that she\'s been colluding with the Federation to stop Dezal. Nina reveals she had a romance with Gato between the One Year War and operation Stardust. These women have no sense of allegiance, and that\'s the key that allows them to step outside of the narrow viewpoint shared by the soldiers and see that the bloodshed is leading nowhere. Just like Haman Karn and Lateura, Nina and Cima are skeptical of the male soldiers\' obsessions with their ideals. At what point does the violence bring their vision into reality? Will it be when the colony strikes Earth? Is that when the Spacenoids will be free? Kou is utterly unable to grasp why Nina won\'t let him kill Gato, and thinks it is simply a matter of her having stronger feelings for Gato than for him. But she simply is brave enough to ask: what is actually gained by killing Gato, if the mission is already over?However, Nina fails to protect Gato because he won\'t allow himself to be protected. He sacrifices himself by ramming his mobile suit into a Federation Ship. Like Kelley, he insists on dying an ""honorable"" death in combat, while trying to reach Earth to pass on the legend of their battle to the future generation. Cima is similarly foiled by Gato and Delaz, and she\'s brutally murdered by Kou, right after she asks him ""Who\'s side are you really on?"" Ironic, coming from her, but it goes to show that this battle is not really between Zeon and the Federation, it\'s between those in allegiance to senseless murder in the guise of heroism, and those in allegiance to protecting innocent lives. The tragedy is that the few individuals (all women, mind you) who are capable of examining things from outside the soldier\'s perspective, are incapable of doing anything about it because they\'re horrendously outnumbered by haunted soldiers on all sides.']"
Kinnikuman,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3272/Kinnikuman,"['Ah Kinnikuman. One of the pioneers of modern Shonen anime. It makes me sad that series like these are barely recognisable outside Japan, and mainstream anime like nowadays don\'t captive me as much as 80\'s animes (Hokuto no Ken, Kinnikuman, City Hunter, Otokojuku, etc). At least the sequel Kinnikuman Nisei, also known in the west as Ultimate Muscle, gained more attention. So without further ado, let me give my opinion on the classic Kinnikuman.Story: 8/10The story is simple. Suguru Kinniku, known as Kinnikuman (Muscleman in english) is the son of the king and queen of Planet Kinniku, and heir to the throne. When he...was a baby, his father mistook him for a pig when there was a real pig right beside him and threw him of a spaceship and Suguru landed on Earth. So Suguru wanted to become a superhero more than anything, and he wants to protect Earth from evil monster attacks, but he is so clumsy and stupid that he can\'t do anything right. He then gains a kid sidekick named Meat, who also hails from Planet Kinniku. Meat is his advisor and though he tries to help Suguru through his life and training, he is also subjected to his clumsiness and most times loses his temper. The story then progresses from being a parody to the superhero genre towards a more serious over the top wrestling genre. Here is where the series starts to lose its comedic tone to become an epic, manly and action filled anime. Through the episodes, Kinnikuman becomes even better and stronger thanks to his intense training and wrestling matches against bizarre but tough enemies. He evolves from being a joke superhero to be a respected hero that definately fits to be the heir of Planet Kinniku. This series is also known for the ""power of friendship"", whick means that thanks to the support from your friends, there is nothing that will stop you.Art: 6/10The art is pretty much dated. This is an anime that came in 1983 (the manga came in 1979) so its art was good for its time, but now if we see it, it\'s not so great. But I love all the goofiness around its anime so a 6 it\'s fair.Sound: 8/10Soundtrack is epic! It has that 80\'s vibe that never gets old. However, the sound effects are pretty old and repetitive, but that\'s what you should expect from an 80\'s anime.Character: 8/10This series is very good thanks to its character development. Kinnikuman evolves from being a clumsy and childish superhero wannabe to a strong, dedicated, respected and manly fighter. The same goes for Terryman that goes from being a superhero that only fights for greed towards a friendly and respected warrior, and becomes Suguru\'s most trusted friend alongside Meat. Robin Mask also overwent a great transformation on his personality, from being a ruthless villain who seemed to only wanting to destroy others towards a highly respected fighter that fights with honor and later became Kinnikuman\'s ally.Enjoyment: 8/10The series is action packed, filled with manly scenes with also great comedy. The first episodes are kind of episodic being Kinnikuman\'s attempt to fight alien monsters but to not avail and are only for comedy purposes, but during the progression of the anime, we see a more serious fighting anime with epic over the top action, and even some manly tears.Overall: 8/10I really like Kinnikuman. This series is really known in Japan, but it\'s a shame that outside of Asia it\'s barely recognisable. I really think that this anime should need a remake with the current animation nowadays. Perhaps maybe it would attract more viewers thanks to the power of the internet (like Crunchyroll, etc). I wish they could do to Kinnikuman the same they did with Tiger Mask W. Sure there\'s Ultimate Muscle that is more recent than the original series, but Kinnikuman I think is even better with more memorable scenes, epic fights, comedy and, of course, manliness! was a baby, his father mistook him for a pig when there was a real pig right beside him and threw him of a spaceship and Suguru landed on Earth.

It’s Muscleman ! Or Ultimate Muscle if you remember that name , it’s the original series from Toei Animation, this show did not age well at all , first the animation isn’t the best , it’s choppy it’s slow , the characters proportionally look diffident from time to time , the series is  iconic but should use a DBZ Kai style recut , that right this show got Toei good old friend Filler , a bit too much if you ask , me Kinnikuman is a good MC , but other Chojins just out shine him..., there a bit too many people being hiding their identity in this show , I counted like 4 times that happened , it’s almost always  with the villains too , recommend but always skip when you see the rock guy , and the skeleton guy , those moments are filler , happy wrestling , there a bit too many people being hiding their identity in this show , I counted like 4 times that happened , it’s almost always  with the villains too , recommend but always skip when you see the rock guy , and the skeleton guy , those moments are filler , happy wrestling', ""Ahh, who could ever forget one of the grandfathers of the battle shonen genre. Of course everyone did...Kinnikuman is one of those “I'm too old for this sh*t” anime which is evident of its humour and depictions of people in other countries (literally Brockenman and Geronimo). The anime itself was a blast to watch despite of its rusty animation, slow fights, and weird voice acting. I did find myself laughing at the first arc which is really rough around the edges.The show's titular protagonist, Kinnikuman has got to be one of the most unique characters of its time. Not to mention the funny asf backstory...of him being dumped by his dad out of the space ship thinking he's a pigThe first arc (Kaiju Extermination arc) was really not that much enjoyable considering it being a parody from the likes of Ultraman and Godzilla. So I'd prefer to stay away from it unless you're a die hard fan and wanted to know who tf Kinkotsuman is, and how Kinnikuman met Terryman.The designs and creativity with the characters are what made me hooked up on this show as it offered brightly colored , dark, edgy, weirdly shaped, and cool looking characters such as Neptuneman and Robin Mask. It was a product of its time.But as further arcs go, it becomes rather interesting focusing more on the power of friendship, wrestling and even conquering unbeatable foes. It also does have some influence towards animes after its time, like DBZ, JJBA, and many more.However, there are very fatal flaws in this show, which is its outdated animation and humour focused more onto characters getting hurt in a cartoonish fashion and weird perverted jokes, overall offensive depictions of other characters from different countries like Brocken Jr. who's a Nazi with a very clear and uncensored swastika. The fights are charming yet slow, there is mostly dialogue making things very anticlimactic, there's only hints of character development, and mostly no flashy moves and just grappling (ofc, because its a goddamn wrestling anime)I won't recommend it to kids who are impatient with slow old anime and easily offended people since there are hints of racial jokes in the anime.(I honestly don't know how to review and just wants to get this out of my chest) of him being dumped by his dad out of the space ship thinking he's a pigThe first arc (Kaiju Extermination arc) was really not that much enjoyable considering it being a parody from the likes of Ultraman and Godzilla.

Koukaku Kidoutai Arise: Alternative Architecture,https://myanimelist.net/anime/29325/Koukaku_Kidoutai_Arise__Alternative_Architecture,"['What makes us human? A body made out of flesh and blood? Emotions? These are the kind of questions we ask ourselves when we look at the complex universe of Ghost in The Shell.Ghost in the shell alternative architecture is a 10 episode series that covers a more condensed version of the 4 Arise Borders 1,2,3,4 movies plus a new story arc, each divided in 2 episodes.-The Story: Section 9 solving different cases that involve cyberterrorism, ghost hacking and government corruption.

This is a good recap of the 4 movies with a bonus extra story in the last 2 episodes that ties in with the new Ghost in the Shell movie released in 2015.', 'Warning: This series reprises the original Arise story (and adds one new story arc), but it does so out of order, starting with the conclusion!  Don\'t watch this series until you\'ve watched the original films, or else start the series with episodes 3-8, then watch episodes 1 and 2 (the original Arise conclusion), and then episodes 9 and 10 (the new content) followed by GitS: The New Movie (2015).Now, some details: First off, GitS Arise: Alternative Architecture (or GitSA:AA) is a more-concise version of the four GitS: Arise movies, which basically focus on the creation of The Major\'s team (which eventually becomes the core...of Public Security Section 9) plus an additional two episodes of new content at the end.  But bizarrely, the first two episodes in the GitSA:AA series are the (trimmed-down) final Arise movie, Border 4: Ghost Stands Alone - in other words, the series starts with its climax, spoiling itself right from the start for people who haven\'t watched the movies yet.  That disorder is the main reason for my low rating for GitSA:AA; my rating for the original Arise films is higher, as they are the same good story but presented in a sensible narrative order.  GitSA:AA is an alternative architecture, all right: one that puts major components in the wrong places, resulting in the failure of the structure.  (Insert collapsing-bridge image here.)So if you haven\'t watched the four Arise movies yet, I\'d strongly recommend watching them first, and then just watch GitSA:AA episodes 9 & 10 followed by GitS: The New Movie (2015).  Or if you\'d rather watch the abbreviated version of the story, start GitSA:AA with episodes 3-8, then watch episodes 1-2, and finally watch episodes 9-10.  You\'ll be glad you did!  Either way, if watched in the correct narrative order, I would recommend these stories, especially for fans of the Ghost in the Shell franchise.Aside from the bizarre re-ordering of the story here, this is a good series overall.  It\'s hard to compare this series (or the Arise films) against the GitS: Stand Alone Complex / 2nd GIG series, which is a masterpiece and (in my view) the best anime of all time.  The original series\' depth of writing and characterization, exploration of existential and other thought-provoking themes, and brilliant filmcraft, all make a fair comparison impossible.  Still, the Arise stories feature competent, character-driven writing.  Although this series can be seen as an alternative continuity to the original series (which itself was a bit of an alternate continuity to the original 1995 GitS film), even the idea of different continuities without a ""privileged"" continuity can be seen as yet another facet of the existential themes that are at the heart of Ghost in the Shell.The characters are a bit different here: better in some ways, sure, but perhaps worse in others.  And if you watch the English dub, it can be hard to get used to the different voice actors.  But the series fleshes out its characters pretty well and does a bit more for side characters like Ishikawa, Borma, and Paz than Stand Alone Complex did, providing some additional (and in many cases alternative) detail in their implied backstories and more meaningful screen time.  And if you finish the series with GitS: The New Movie (2015), you\'ll get a satisfying conclusion to the overall Arise story.In short, GitSA:AA is worth a watch (again, assuming you watch it in the proper order to avoid the spoilers). of Public Security Section 9) plus an additional two episodes of new content at the end.

How come when a full cycle series (50x23min) casted by no one less than Hanazawa Kana, the most favorited #1 person on MAL and the most well known seiyuu in both Japan and in the West, starts airing, only like 200 people end up watching it by episode 10?Layton Mystery Tanteisha is yet another overlooked kids anime with wonderful atmosphere and more maturity to offer than any popular shonen anime from current season. From its core, the series is an episodic mystery-comedy. The tales center around our detective, Katri, who meets new clients and...takes a peek into their life and problems with her talking dog and an assistant.The settings for the series are really not much more than an excuse for the episodic slice of life drama where Katri, more than solves a mystery, helps the clients to discover something important related to family, friends and love. Overall, the mysteries and puzzles are life lessons. Heavy subjects, such as the death of a lover, approached with light and calming manner.There are quite a few differences between Katri and typical detective leads. For one, she is not an autistic mastermind who is uber smart and arrogant. She is practically a kid, and most conclusions she ends up making are comedic, and the reasons behind mysteries nothing less than cute and heart-warming. Katri's overwhelming positivity and outgoing personality make the series rather charming.The production is kids friendly, but also detailed and uncommon for today's industry. The comedy is often executed with small background animation, the art itself is simplistic yet doesn't feel like it is missing anything specifically. The BGM serves the series. There are lots of chill music presented and the team uses their tracks a lot. Especially the most dramatic conclusions for dramas are filled with uplifting music rather than the nauseating sad piano shite you hear everywhere today. The music choices make it clear that the series is not looking for you to pity the characters, rather to see how they overcome the personal challenges in their life.As a conclusion, Layton Mystery Tanteisha is a very happy and lights series which is suitable for people of all ages. It's worth of watching for several different reasons, and I have personally been enjoying the life lessons, as well as the characters, drama, comedy and most of all the atmosphere of the show. Most episodic shows suffer from quality differences. Here they are mild.

It's worth of watching for several different reasons, and I have personally been enjoying the life lessons, as well as the characters, drama, comedy and most of all the atmosphere of the show. Most episodic shows suffer from quality differences. Here they are mild. Overall, a great kids anime which I can recommend for viewing."", 'As someone that has closely followed the Layton games for several years, the idea of a Layton anime series excited me. Though, I was a bit skeptical about watching it at first because I was mixed about 3DS Katrielle Layton game and its lack of proper closure to the main story. I watched and closely followed the series in the second half of 2018. The Katrielle Layton anime slowly became a source of happiness as I binged more of the episodes, eventually following the series week-by-week. This review is written from the perspective of a Layton fan, so some of the things I say might...confuse you a bit.Layton Mystery Detective Agency definitely was a fun anime throughout its whole run. The anime is basically an episodic mystery anime throughout its run, with occasionally focusing on the bigger mysteries. Katrielle\'s lovable personality was the main draw of the anime for me. Kana Hanazawa and Katrielle meld together to create a very entertaining anime. Her performance in the Layton anime is probably the most expressive I have ever heard out of all the anime characters she has played. It almost feels like Kana was given free reign, almost as if Kana was actively participating in the production of Layton anime alongside Level-5 to bring out the fullest extent of her blissfully good voice talents. Kana\'s defining voice for all of anime belongs to Katrielle in my opinion. Kana Hanazawa is Katrielle Layton.There is also its unique aspect of making me as a viewer participate in the episodic mysteries. The show is carefully constructed in a way that makes me actively want to solve the mystery as the episode delves into its mystery more. There are a few episodic mysteries that felt jarringly illogical or poorly executed, but 80% of them were generally good. There is a frequent tendency to make me as a viewer cry when it comes to the resolutions, and that can be an issue sometimes. Some mysteries work well with the crying moments when the mystery/narrative are cohesively well-constructed, others are not so much.As for my thoughts on the main story, it is pretty good. The main story is not so much a main focus, but I did not mind it personally because Katrielle Layton alone entertained me enough to keep watching each episode. The grand mystery felt more like an extra dessert, while the episodic mysteries were the main course. I was pretty surprised that the grand mystery was well-crafted and well-thought out. I think the story-based episodes could have slowed down the pacing so that I could be given time to form my own conclusions on the mysteries. It is not a big issue though.As for other thoughts on the anime, I definitely wanted to see more of those kinds of episodes where it is focused on side-characters like Emiliana, Ernest, and the Inspector, the fun kind that extracts the wholesome, hilarious moments. The episodes that focused on Emiliana and Sherl  singlehandedly made me like the characters on a whole new level. Surprisingly, more of the mysteries focus on the lesser side characters like the farm boy, the seven wealthy people, and the swirly hair genius. I think out of all minor character casts in the Layton series, they felt the most fleshed out. Some of the NPCs in Layton games, while they have charming designs, are pretty forgettable. I felt more closely connected to these ""NPCs"" (minor characters) and welcomed their reappearance when they returned for another episodic mystery. There is a good sense of world-building in that aspect that made me more invested. It makes me wish that the 3DS game had the complete story with these character explorations.I am going to miss the anime series. I am dying for more Katrielle. I want the Layton anime to return so that Kana Hanazawa can voice her again.  If another season of Layton comes, I hope the staff can improve in crafting episodic mysteries, while also integrating interesting character explorations for characters like Emiliana, Sherl and the Inspector. Katrielle and Ernest are pretty much fleshed out now as of this season, and now there is room to flesh out the other characters. Personally, I am more excited about the prospect of another season of Katrielle episodic mysteries than the idea of a Layton anime based on the six Layton games (A.K.A. what Ace Attorney is currently doing right now with its anime adaptation). Should the six game anime happen though, I hope Hino considers the idea of fleshing out Luke, Flora, Emmy, and Layton more than just doing a simple copy and paste. Give them some substantial character arcs. confuse you a bit.Layton Mystery Detective Agency definitely was a fun anime throughout its whole run.

The Anime itself is a mystery series where the protagonist Katrielle takes on various cases and solves them by the end of the episode. Unlike Detective Conan, it's closest comparison, this anime rarely has to do with murders, settling on civil  cases, with the main overarching mystery being the disappearance of Katrielle's father. It has a more wholesome and grounded approach, making it a great watch for younger children or if you just want to relieve some stress.Even outside of that, the anime is lovingly animated and boasts it's own unique style. Katarielle...is voiced by the legendary voice actress Kana Hanazawa and the writing does it's dammed best to show off her talents at every possible situation. Katarielle's charisma, deductive capabilities and go-getter attitude makes her incredibly likable and can even function as an inspiration for younger audiences.This is a great show and deserves more people watching it. Please don't miss out.P.S.: This is based on a video game on the 3DS making it a great video game adaptation,  which is frankly rare. is voiced by the legendary voice actress Kana Hanazawa and the writing does it's dammed best to show off her talents at every possible situation.

There's a lot of average stuff in here but I definitely recommend watching the cases adapted from the game as well as the Relic's Treasure mini series which is related to the most recognizable characters in the series. Definitely a ton of interesting mysteries are featured and the art style is pretty good too. I think any fan of the Professor Layton franchise will enjoy watching this, especially the Relic's Treasure subseries within the story. ""]"
Just Because!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/35639/Just_Because,"['High school can be quite an experience for most young people these days. I remember a time during my high school years when everything seems to feel different. It’s almost like setting foot into a new world with new opportunities. Friends, activities, relationships. It’s a place beyond just about learning but for people to build a future. While it isn’t like college for career building, it definitely gives the chance for opportunities, even for relationships. For Eita Izumi, he comes back from his hometown after 4 years as he reunites with his middle school friends.As an original anime, Just Because felt like a breath of...fresh air despite the simplistic premise. It’s also made by Hajime Kamoshida, the brainchild behind Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. To me, this show stood out as a coming age of story about characters climbing the stairs to adolescence. It’s a time period for characters to develop and grow up to be more than teenagers. At the heart of the show, we have Eita Izumi alongside a group of classmates. The first few episodes gave me the impression of a melancholic story that’s filled with realistic themes that people can connect with. Beyond just the setting, the characters feel real and can be relatable. This is seen through the example of childhood friends Eita, Haruto, and Mio. As the story progresses, we see the relationship dynamics between the trio that will get viewers invested into the storytelling.For a show like this to work, it had to make its characters feel they belong there. Luckily, Just Because pulls off the right stops through its characters of diverse personalities. Each of the main characters feel different ranging from Mio’s timid personality to Ena’s enthusiasm. It’s what can draw viewers in as we see how they behave around certain characters. Indeed, character chemistry is an important aspect of this show. It connects between characters visually, dramatically, and meaningfully. Romance is slowly paced and not expressed like a shoujo but rather in a melancholic style. To me, this show focuses on relationships through character building. It emphasizes on establishing character personalities first while giving them the chance to shine through them. Ena is a prime example in the show as her character interaction with Eita is often noticeable because of how different she is from him. Some people may interpret the show’s character relationship dynamics as part of destiny, like certain characters are destined to be with one another. However, that’s not truly the case as expectations can be different after realizing the person they want to be with isn’t what they would expect. Honestly, I think this show sells its ideas pretty well to express that.To make things run better, the show never forgets about its themes such as adolescence. Every character has a goal for the future and although there’s a feeling of uncertainty, they strive to work towards that. Whether it’s becoming a photographer, be part of a band, or just to go to college, it’s inspiring and realistic. Think about the time when you were in high school and had that feeling of what you wanted to do in life. Relating to this anime doesn’t feel so different, now does it? At the same time, the storytelling continues to build relationships between the main characters. While it feels like a ship tease at times, the show never exaggerates or oversteps its boundaries. The drama is mostly lighthearted and doesn’t force it down viewers’ throats. It keeps its pace steady while getting its point across, like the way it should be. In several ways, the drama of this show is realistic enough to relate and easy to get attached to. There are some awkward segments between certain characters but the timing usually feels right. The downside about the drama is that it occasionally feels formulaic and repetitive. Not to mention, character relationships feel a bit predictable as to who will likely get who in the end. Still, it doesn’t hold the anime back. The characters are all very self-aware and realize what it means to be a high school student. Haruto is a good example as we see his life as a baseball player. The way he adapts to build his future becomes evident like a journey of life discovery. This also expands to other characters such as Mio and Ena. It’s like their chance to climb the stairs to adulthood and high school is one of the biggest steps they have to cross over.Original anime like Just Because doesn’t suffer from adaptation standards but there’s an instinct to recognize if the amount of episode is suited enough. For 12 episodes, it honestly felt just right to sell its story without going over. The first half of the show does a well job at establishing characters like their personalities and roles. The remainder half builds on them through relationships, discoveries, and characterization. It’s like a life journey these characters take for their future and stories like this can be inspirational to viewers.Adapted by Pine Jam, this show is expressive at crafting its visual elements. The key visual itself gives an atmospheric feel with characters being at a train station. Besides Eita and Mio, the others are going on about their daily lives like moving with their future. By raw quality though, Just Because’s biggest selling point is the character expressions. It fortifies their personalities and expresses attitude that connects with their personalities. It’s important to realize that human expressions often depict what a person feels at every moment. This anime does a clever job at capitalizing that to make them feel real. On the other hand, I can’t say the character designs are too impressive. Most of the main characters look too normal while the female cast doesn’t stand out much dynamically. Photography is also a part of the show itself and some of the photos taken by Ena doesn’t really make memorable impressions. Still, I think the show hits mark overall. Every character feels very alive and moves the story together.For soundtrack and music, it’s clear that Just Because needed a melancholic style to make it work. Thankfully, this is accomplished thanks to the music director for its creative themes. It’s lighthearted, slow paced, and consistent to make every segment work. Both the theme songs has a very realistic tone and lyrics that matches with the style of the show. Character voice mannerism is also important to convey character personalities and it hits the mark just right. The dialogues makes the characters sound believable and that’s what it’s important.Four years of high school really can really be quite an experience. For some people, it can feel like a quest to start a new life. For others, it may be like living a world of hell. Then, there are people who think high school may just be part of their journey to adulthood and there’s much more ahead. The characters in this show embarks on that journey and takes the viewers with them. For that reason, Just Because is worth watching as it explores high school relationships, making memories, and discovering what life really means. fresh air despite the simplistic premise.

Involves multiple love triangles and deals with real feelings of high school children. It's probably one of the best slice of life anime I've watched so far and definitely deserves a 10!The development of the personalities of various characters and how an event is shown from multiple viewpoints is a lot like what happens everyday. Misunderstandings, confessions, unrequited love, liking someone, finding your place in the world; that is all portrayed in the series.I've watched it twice, and even the second time round it had an effect on me! "", ""(No spoilers contained in this review!)When I first read over the synopsis for Just Because I couldn't wait to get my hands on the episodes. As a young adult not so recently out of high school myself, I wanted to torture myself by relieving the anxieties and emotions that run high during the last few months of senior year. And so as the story progressed, I couldn't help but feel disappointed in what was presented to me.Perhaps it was my own fault for having such high hopes for the anime, but what could've been a compelling story full of heartbreak, fear for the future, and...new hope, felt like a watered down version with ironically little depth. The story focused on a select few students, which was fine at first. That's where all the juicy bits of drama will go down, right? This is where friendships will break apart for the sake of final exams! This is where the long-standing relationship will feel the strain of their romantic clock ticking away until they have to part ways! But instead, what I found in that small group of friends was yet another cliched love triangle. (And let's be honest, we all knew where THAT was going).I found myself having to force myself to continue, although I did manage to get through all 12 hellishly boring episodes while all the while hoping for something, anything, to HAPPEN. I'm no stranger to slice of life anime, I know they aren't supposed to be action-packed or anything but jesus, in an anime about a bunch of teenagers having to leave behind their friends and find a place for themselves in society I was expecting a few tears at the very least.Just Because had so much potential and instead, it fell flat. The emotions never went deep enough, the drama never felt dramatic enough, it was almost like the characters just drifted through the story instead of it actually happening to them. Because of this, Just Because is currently sitting with a score of 3 on my list. new hope, felt like a watered down version with ironically little depth.

Also... Just Because.[Story: 7/10 , Characters: 8/10, Art: 5/10, Sound: 9/10, Enjoyment: 8/10]""It\'s all in the past"" - Eita IzumiJust Because is an original anime by Hajime Kamoshida, the genius behind Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo. However, just because at a first glance it may seem like this is a generic story about confused intertwined love relationships between group of friends trying to get through high school, the adaptation feels way to close to reality. For those that finished high school...or those finishing up high school, it will definitely bring back memories of your teen years. This anime shines in the tear-jerking nostalgia department and just because of that, it outshines from the rest of the generic love stories in the ever popular genres of slice of life combined with romance and school. From it\'s use of orchestra music to piano accompanied backdrops whilst looking back at your past, despite it\'s suboptimal animation standard given it\'s by the studio Pine Jam, this under the radar anime is definitely worth the watch.""I\'ve only given valentine cards to my dad and my two brothers every year"" - Hazuki MorikawaJust because the story is generic doesn\'t mean it can\'t be interesting. The story in a nutshell is about the transfer student Eita Izumi, who moves back again and attends the same high school all of his friends from middle school goes to as well. Reuniting with them once again reignites all the unresolved love and drama they had between each other plus coupled with the new friends they make in high school further alleviates this love triangle to an all out love pentagon between each other. The story for this anime is simple but its the character interactions that gives its complexity. At it\'s core, the plot is linear driven however flashbacks from middle school days are used to explain why each character behaves at certain situations. It takes two episodes to get used to the rhythm of the anime but given what a stellar first episode was and how the anime continue to build up with the different characters trying to figure out their feelings for one another while trying to finish high school and graduate, really makes it worthwhile to watch. Who doesn\'t love riding the nostalgia train.""Can I ask him out on a date?"" - Ena KomiyaJust because the characters appear mundane at first does not mean they do not possess complexity. The fun part about this anime are the characters. At its core the five major characters are: Eita Mizumi (the transfer student with a crush on Natsume), Haruto Soma (best friend of Eita with a crush on Morikawa), Natusme Mio (old friends from middle school with crush on Haruto), Morikawa Hazuki (band chick too shy to confess), & Ena Komiya (CANON camera chick too eager to confess to Eita). This complex love pentagon really drives this show. This anime takes its time developing each of the characters and giving them enough time and backstory to justify their importance and reason for the love they have for the other. Not to mention because each character acts as a foil for the other and how unique each of their personalities are, you really start to identify yourself with one of these characters. Soon enough you will be cheering on for your favourite ship while reminiscing about your old high school ship. Like I said, all aboard the nostalgia train.""If you tell him I\'ll kill you” - Natsume MioJust because the animation is subpar doesn\'t mean the music has to be subpar. Given the fact that the studio adapting this anime is Pine Jam, a rather small studio not really known for their outstanding animation standards, they\'ve done not too shabby of a job adapting this original anime. There were a few scenes that weren\'t blended well and seemed a bit choppy however, the overall pencil drawn characters gave it a nice cozy feel to the anime. It\'s funny how despite each of the major characters being completely unique to one another, they were drawn pretty similar to one another. It could be that it serves as a metaphor for life how we may think we are completely different from our friend sitting next to us in class but we are more similar than we think in the hardship and struggle we go through in our adolescence and teenage years with school and love. Aside from the animation what really sells this anime is the music. From the first episode and onwards the quality of the music never drops. From the usage of trumpets and drums to build the tension up to calm relaxing piano medley to reminisce about the past, this show knew how to use it all. Not to mention the OP and ED songs are both amazing to listen to on their own. It really stands out as a complete OST to listen to on its own. Lastly, the seiyuus for this show did a great job in giving life to these characters. Kudos to them.""No one likes getting rejected"" - Haruto Soma.Overall, Just Because was a simple anime with a generic premise that surpassed expectations it set for itself. It was not only a great coming of age story dealing with high school love and struggle of school to figure out your future, it served its purpose as a nostalgic ride to let viewers reminisce about their past. As the story progressed you start identifying yourself with the characters in the anime and though it was a slice of life anime featuring a love pentagon, it wasn\'t a cookie cutter romantic plot that made itself predictable from the start. Plus, who ends up with who in the end will really surprise the viewers. For that reason alone and just because how many puns you can make while watching this anime, I would highly recommend to everyone, not just fans of this genre, to give this anime a watch. Let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite ship and your favourite quote from the anime!P.S. Thank you for reading.

The story for this anime is simple but its the character interactions that gives its complexity. At it\'s core, the plot is linear driven however flashbacks from middle school days are used to explain why each character behaves at certain situations. It takes two episodes to get used to the rhythm of the anime but given what a stellar first episode was and how the anime continue to build up with the different characters trying to figure out their feelings for one another while trying to finish high school and graduate, really makes it worthwhile to watch. Who doesn\'t love riding the nostalgia train.""Can I ask him out on a date?"" - Ena KomiyaJust because the characters appear mundane at first does not mean they do not possess complexity. The fun part about this anime are the characters. At its core the five major characters are: Eita Mizumi (the transfer student with a crush on Natsume), Haruto Soma (best friend of Eita with a crush on Morikawa), Natusme Mio (old friends from middle school with crush on Haruto), Morikawa Hazuki (band chick too shy to confess), & Ena Komiya (CANON camera chick too eager to confess to Eita). This complex love pentagon really drives this show. This anime takes its time developing each of the characters and giving them enough time and backstory to justify their importance and reason for the love they have for the other. Not to mention because each character acts as a foil for the other and how unique each of their personalities are, you really start to identify yourself with one of these characters. Soon enough you will be cheering on for your favourite ship while reminiscing about your old high school ship. Like I said, all aboard the nostalgia train.""If you tell him I\'ll kill you” - Natsume MioJust because the animation is subpar doesn\'t mean the music has to be subpar. Given the fact that the studio adapting this anime is Pine Jam, a rather small studio not really known for their outstanding animation standards, they\'ve done not too shabby of a job adapting this original anime. There were a few scenes that weren\'t blended well and seemed a bit choppy however, the overall pencil drawn characters gave it a nice cozy feel to the anime. It\'s funny how despite each of the major characters being completely unique to one another, they were drawn pretty similar to one another. It could be that it serves as a metaphor for life how we may think we are completely different from our friend sitting next to us in class but we are more similar than we think in the hardship and struggle we go through in our adolescence and teenage years with school and love. Aside from the animation what really sells this anime is the music. From the first episode and onwards the quality of the music never drops. From the usage of trumpets and drums to build the tension up to calm relaxing piano medley to reminisce about the past, this show knew how to use it all. Not to mention the OP and ED songs are both amazing to listen to on their own. It really stands out as a complete OST to listen to on its own. Lastly, the seiyuus for this show did a great job in giving life to these characters. Kudos to them.""No one likes getting rejected"" - Haruto Soma.Overall, Just Because was a simple anime with a generic premise that surpassed expectations it set for itself. It was not only a great coming of age story dealing with high school love and struggle of school to figure out your future, it served its purpose as a nostalgic ride to let viewers reminisce about their past. As the story progressed you start identifying yourself with the characters in the anime and though it was a slice of life anime featuring a love pentagon, it wasn\'t a cookie cutter romantic plot that made itself predictable from the start. Plus, who ends up with who in the end will really surprise the viewers. For that reason alone and just because how many puns you can make while watching this anime, I would highly recommend to everyone, not just fans of this genre, to give this anime a watch. Let me know later how you like it as well as share with me your favourite ship and your favourite quote from the anime!P.S. Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!', 'the first episode throw me off little bit , but i decided to keep watching and so far its look pretty heart warming , its my favorite type of slice of life anime, no exaggerated comedy , heart warming and slow pacing , the character are little by too cliché, the love triangles and the unnecessary screaming gets in the way of enjoying the anime, the art is great although there one thing that i find annoying but its opinion based which the finger nails color change in the close shots which is not exclusive to this anime but i find it annoying , but...all in all its relatable and feels good to watch and i hope it stays this way... all in all its relatable and feels good to watch and i hope it stays this way...', ""I would like to straight away point out the fact, all that happened in 12 episodes, ending makes no sense, no development is shown leading towards the outcome of the ending.SPOILERS:Best girl looses, despite putting in so much effort and her character was the most developed. and we end up with the girl who liked the MC's friend and out of nowhere realizes her feelings for MC. No development is shown for ,for the MC, ending makes no sense. Bullshit.Thats all I have to say for this anime, feel like I wasted my time watching it, komiya best girl forever. "", 'An original anime that have a lot of potential to be great but ends so disappointing.[Story: 3/10]The story is slow (and with bad pacing) in most of episodes, mostly in the episodes 1-4 and 9-11. Sometimes some scenes are out of place, for example the baseball scenes with the adults in the middle.[Character: 3/10]Besides Komiya and maybe Haruto, all the characters feels boring, lack of personality and are one-sided. Komiya and his outgoing personality makes great moments for the anime, more that most of the main cast. Haruto in some scenes is good, in others not so much. Eita is boring character unless he...is with Komiya.Their moments with Natsume feels awkward and out of place. Morikawa lacks of personality until the last episodes. I like the friend of Morikawa, Yoriko. Finally, Nastume, a character that is so jealous and indecisive that feels annoying and as a plot device in much episodes. The worst part is that the anime is pro-Natsume and anti-Komiya.[Art: 6/10]I like the animation despite some episodes (ex. 5) have bad animated scenes.[Sound: 5/10]I have no problems with the soundrack. In my opinion, is not bad neither good. The opening is forgettable anyway.[Enjoyment: 4/10]Again, the only moments with decent comedy are Eita/Ena and Haruto. The scenes with Natsume makes me angry, she is jealous because Eita is with Komiya when she have some feelings for Haruto (because of an erase, really? ). I like the scenes with Yoriko, Haruto (sometimes) and Komiya, they are worth of watching.OverallJust Because! is bad. If Eita have ended up with Ena, it will receive a 6 or maybe 7 of my part but nope, a generic ending with the main girl that did nothing in the entire show. Poor Komiya.  4/10 is with Komiya.Their moments with Natsume feels awkward and out of place. Morikawa lacks of personality until the last episodes. I like the friend of Morikawa, Yoriko.

Poor Komiya.  4/10', 'Please note that there are spoilers below. This is primarily due to the fact that my main points cannot be conveyed without explaining specific events in the story. Sections with spoilers will be marked.Now when I first watched this anime I was attracted to its warm and calm atmosphere, something that is rarely seen in anime filled up with comedic scenes and the like. I liked the protagonist who was not like another blithering idiot that romance/sol/high school anime usually focus on. It was fine, and I liked it so much I regarded it on par with the other big two of this season (inuyashiki...and ancient magus bride) The OP sounded great, and the anime had a lot going for it.Unfortunately this was overshadowed by major issues, in particular the ideas that this anime seeks to promote.STORY: 3The story is generic and involves the usual anime-tropes seen in the genres this show is in. It does not deviate from what we would expect and the ending is extremely predictable. Often J do not focus much on  a show\'s ending as I believe in the process of story-telling more than the ending itself. However this show does not offer anything out of the ordinary and what was originally calm and soothing becomes boring. However that\'s not entirely why the story gets such a low score. As this is a romance-drama anime, its story is largely intertwined with its characters. Therefore, if the anime has bad characters who make bad decisions there will be a bad story.Art: 6The art is average. There are some awkward expressions but otherwise it is fine.Sound: 7Having listened to Yanagi Nagi and Jun Maeda\'s Owari no Hoshi no Love Song the anime opening didn\'t fall short. It provided an appropriate atmosphere for the show (calm and soothing) and I liked it. The ending was less impressive, but more or less alright.Characters: 1 (Minor spoilers)The anime\'s main and most damning problem is its cast of characters who feel more like cardboard cutouts. They\'re the kind of characters who talk and let the viewer know directly what their goals are but never actually demonstrate their intent, which is an extremely lazy way of building a character. The characters never pursue what they want and feel very much like cardboard cutouts. They don\'t blush, don\'t spend time together, don\'t actively pursue their goals. This will be further elaborated in the next section, enjoyment.Enjoyment: 3The problem with the characters is only symptomatic of a larger problem here: The main message of the anime, or the values it holds. Allow me to explain how the problem with the characters is related to this.MAJOR SPOILERS HEREAfter watching the anime I have come to learn that Natsume is a quiet studious girl and she likes Eita, and she was the ex-president. That\'s all. There is nothing else about her personality that is known to us and her thoughts and feelings are never revealed to us.  An example: She liked Soma and eventually reconsiders this, but we never really understand why exactly she did that. Some might argue that it was probably because Eita has been helping her out, but it\'s all just speculation and no direct confirmation. This would have been a nitpick if it were an insignificant plot device but it\'s not an insignificant plot device. It is something that has to be told to the viewer to get them invested in the main girl. To make matters worse it\'s not even safe to assume that she simply had a crush on Soma and wasn\'t serious from the start. There are just so many possibilities as to why she had given up on Soma and why she liked him in the first place. After all, she had been crushing on him for several years now and we know nothing of how she feels. She seems very fickle when it comes to this. And that\'s just one point.Natsume and Eita\'s ""friendship"" (if you could call it that) is weak and all Natsume did was put her studies first. Rita questions her as to whether she was using it as an excuse but was shut down immediately. Perhaps the original intent was to create tension between the main characters. But they were never close in the first place and all it did was  show me how distant the two are. She had no intention to pursue her crush (soma at that time) and when she suddenly switched to Eita i always get reminded of someone picking food off a menu. There\'s no indication whatsoever that she likes someone even if she says she does, she doesn\'t smile, she doesn\'t blush, she doesn\'t go out of her way to do something (the same applies for Morikawa, but at least she never actually said she liked soma, it was more of accepting -- or postponing -- his confession)All in all, Natsume feels like a cardboard cutout.On the other hand, we have a more well-made character, who unfortunately is shoved to the side. Komiya.The reason why people adore and support Komiya with Eita is that unlike Natsume, she knows what she wants and actively pursues it even though she has lots to lose. She actively shows us that she likes Eita and isn\'t fickle with her feelings. This is seen in the final episode when Eita graduates. She doesn\'t give up when things get tough; she\'s tenacious. She\'s everything Natsume is not. And most importantly, she actually has chemistry with eita. They joke, they talk, they help one another out. On the other hand Natsume never spared a thought for Eita and there was zero to no interaction.In the end, I realised what the main message of the show was: that love is determined by fate. Komiya fought but lost because it was fate. Natsume won because it was fate. Rita chose Natsume not because of her personality but because ""I\'ve liked her for a ling time"". (I quoted Eita). I chose her because I feel it is meant to be, not because of how wonderful she is, not how she makes me feel, not how much she cares about me. I find this idea very distasteful and seeing Komiya lose out was very heartbreaking.For those who say it\'s realistic, maybe it is in portraying how we make bad choices in choosing romantic partners. Otherwise, it\'s not. Natsume\'s character is extreme in how fickle and non-chalant she is, as with Morikawa and even Eita to a certain extent.My opinion? This anime is not realistic. It is NOT a realistic portrayal of how people act in real life and it is NOT realistic in how people get rewarded for nothing.Overall: 4/10This was a major letdown. and ancient magus bride) The OP sounded great, and the anime had a lot going for it.Unfortunately this was overshadowed by major issues, in particular the ideas that this anime seeks to promote.STORY: 3The story is generic and involves the usual anime-tropes seen in the genres this show is in.

Mood and setting of the anime are quite fitting for winter, so you'll be likely to identify when watching this right now.StoryThe anime starts off with a transfer student coming back to Tokyo for his last half year of high school, after his father was transferred back from Fukuoka. He's soon reunited with his long lost best friend from middle school and is finding himself confronted with some unresolved things from the past. As the story continues, the...characters have to face the reality of graduation and resolving  their plans for the future, while love and disappointments are quite hard to handle too.This seems quite uninteresting at first -you know, just your typical life of life story- but the characters get interesting and after two episodes I was hooked.ArtThe art, well, nothing all too special, but the natural colors and realistic settings (if you were in Tokyo (Enoshima) before, you'll recognize some parts) are comforting and easy to watch.

As the name of the anime implies, I truly did watch this anime ""Just Because."" (You can shoot me later for that)....Interestingly enough, I will begin by saying I\'m actually enjoying the anime for what it is so far, though I hope to see improvements in both pacing and detail as time goes on.Story ~5~As of episode 3, the story from my perspective is average. A handful of students who are about to graduate slowly change as one of their childhood friends moves back after four years. As this is a slice of life, I got what I expected in the first few episodes: Reunions, re-connections, and changes in relations and communication relative to each character. Nothing particularly stands out story-wise, though I believe that is fine in a ""Slice-of-life"", especially this early on.Art ~7~Most people seem to be on-or-off with the art, which is understandable because of how much the art shifts in detail between scenes. Throughout the first episode alone, I was taken aback at the stunning background art melding with the animations. The fluidity between 2d and 3d movement impressed me, and I could hardly make out when they genuinely used CG during certain scenes.Despite their successes detailing art and animation, the anime has the drawback of decreasing character detail during faster animations, such as in the baseball scene in episode 1. As for the characters looking ""Plain"", I see nothing wrong in a realistic anime with realistic designs, regardless of blandness, especially with the beautiful background scenes.Sound ~9~WELL HELLO THERE. I will say now I am HEAVILY biased towards the orchestral/piano side of music, otherwise I may have given the sound more of a 6-7 score. Allow me the pleasure of saying that the tonality of each piece fits into each scene perfectly so far, most especially in the climax of the baseball ""duel"" at the end of episode 1. The joys of reconnecting and success in one scene, along with the subtle peaceful string instruments and slightly awkward beats during piano pieces help make each scene come alive. In anime, a media form where emotion can be conveyed through more than just its characters, music can become a ""make-or-break"" factor. I can confidently say that this anime certainly does NOT break.Character ~5~*sigh* Well hello there. Welcome to single scenes that establish every character and the awkwardness of not being at a point where any true conflict has occurred to allow any true emotional development. At this point, I have no choice but to give the characters a 5 simply because the anime hasn\'t developed enough to show me any depth behind many of the main characters besides their given personalities.Enjoyment ~6~Allow me to explain for those of you who don\'t understand why I could give a slice of life in its early boring stages a 6/10 (which IS good), allow me to restate: There is Beauty in Simplicity. That\'s truly what this anime is: Simple. That\'s what I truly expect out of any slice-of-life anime I watch. The music, art, and potential of this anime impresses me, as did 3-gatsu no Lion; one of my favorite anime to this day. I truly understood it during the second half of episode one: allow me to warn you:~SPOILERS~During the second half of episode one, the MC finds one of his old friends from their baseball club. Their dynamic after four years is awkward and stoic. The school baseball team has recently failed their attempt at winning nationals and his friend wants to hit one home run as both revenge and as a ""prayer"". The MC (Who hasn\'t played for years) pitches for the friend, and the band members watching play a beautifully empowering piece in the background. Eventually, all the other main characters watch as the piece slows to a beautiful string orchestral piece as we see a slowed down home run, after which the MC\'s friend runs and hugs him, laughs, and proceeds to leave to confess to a girl he likes.THIS SCENE CONVEYS SO MUCH. The reunion and re connection between close friends, the attachment and encouragement a shared hobby gives between characters, the joy of mutual success, the awe of simply watching as the scene truly comes to life in its climax. That emotion paints a picture describing what I\'m talking about. That\'s the beauty in simplicity.Overall: ~6~The reason my overall is so low is because the anime hasn\'t given me enough to truly know whether or not it is ""good"". So far, I\'m enjoying the ride, and have probably ranted long enough. As the anime continues, I hope for the pace to quicken, drama to occur, and ships to both sail and sink, all set to beautiful music pieces. Interestingly enough, I will begin by saying I\'m actually enjoying the anime for what it is so far, though I hope to see improvements in both pacing and detail as time goes on.Story ~5~As of episode 3, the story from my perspective is average.

The MC (Who hasn\'t played for years) pitches for the friend, and the band members watching play a beautifully empowering piece in the background. Eventually, all the other main characters watch as the piece slows to a beautiful string orchestral piece as we see a slowed down home run, after which the MC\'s friend runs and hugs him, laughs, and proceeds to leave to confess to a girl he likes.THIS SCENE CONVEYS SO MUCH. The reunion and re connection between close friends, the attachment and encouragement a shared hobby gives between characters, the joy of mutual success, the awe of simply watching as the scene truly comes to life in its climax. That emotion paints a picture describing what I\'m talking about. That\'s the beauty in simplicity.Overall: ~6~The reason my overall is so low is because the anime hasn\'t given me enough to truly know whether or not it is ""good"". So far, I\'m enjoying the ride, and have probably ranted long enough. As the anime continues, I hope for the pace to quicken, drama to occur, and ships to both sail and sink, all set to beautiful music pieces.', 'The plot, in my opinion, had great potential, BUT it went really bad.I liked the fact that main character was obsessed with his past and his love. But in the meanwhile Komiya did everything for Eita, but this moron threw everything away from the window and trated her like a trash as she was not really important. to be honest i really could accept it, but the final was so forced i could not apprecciate at all.I liked every other characters except for Eita, so dumbass.By the way music, opening, were really cool and nice to hear.Same about the art. Really good for eyes...to see those drawings, nothing to say about them. Nice animations and nice particulars.Another thing i really liked it was the storytelling and the atmosphere created. Really good and well done. But with that forced final it was so wasted. to see those drawings, nothing to say about them.

Watch a third and you're in for the long run.StOrY 8/10The story is slow as first and moves similar to a train. Once you are at a cruise, you feel very comfortable. You watch the scenery just fly by while losing yourself in your own thoughts. After 3 episodes, you will find yourself thinking about what will happen with the love triangles, relationships, and school lives of the characters.ArT 7/10The artwork reminds me of certain old movies but it is very suitable for this kind of storytelling.

Along with that, they must make important decisions for their future, as well as for the each person likes.All characters develop at different speeds when they come to realize their feelings.  That's what this anime clearly showed. Each of the characters thought in their own way to come to have the courage to be together with the person they like. This anime is pretty distinctive in that aspect, which was what i liked.Along with the romance,...you've got all the characters' futures to be decided. Some of them don't know, some of them already decided and others don't care as long as they get a decent job. The fact that they used the last year of high school  is particularly effective in presenting the amount of pressure on all of them as they also have to consider what to do to make a move on the person they love. I guess that's why a lot of anime series use this time to create some drama.I liked the art, it fitted well with the melancholic mood of the anime throughout. But their were times when it was not at its best, the movements looked pretty forced at times too.As for the characters...Izumi, Eita:Nice character, I can relate to him a lot. The effort he puts in when helping out Natsume is incredible. Interesting that his future is kind of already planned, unlike the other characters.Natsume, Mio:Debatable here. A lot of people hate her, I understand that. Some of her actions were ridiculous and stupid but for me it got cancelled out when she realized her real feelings towards the end of the series. Very slow development but it was interesting to see her change bit by bit.Komiya, Ena:MVP. Does a lot for Izumi all the he way until the end. Direct and honest character who always knows what she's doing. Her determination to achieve her goals  is amazing, easily likable character.Soma, Haruto:Best friend of Izumi, he gives advice to Izumi and gets advice from him too. Their friendship is emphasized throughout the series, even if they didn't meet for quite some time. His face expressions were really funny.Morikawa, Hazuki:A character who cares a lot for her family and others' feelings. The way she responded to Haruto towards the end was a bit odd for me but since it involved her future I guess it was the right choice. Liked the hairstyle change.A lot of the story was predictable, but I guess wanting more original ideas is a bit too much. I enjoyed a lot of Haruto's scenes because of his face expressions, and i also liked Komiya's efforts to get closer to Izumi.

Slow, moody, and dialogue heavy shows like these are not usually my thing, and because of that I judge them harshly. If you have a more of a critical/analytical eye to entertainment, take everything I say with a grain of salt.If I described this anime in one color, it would be ""gray"". In addition to the art\'s murky color scheme and the overall somber mood of the anime itself, the characters just...feel lifeless and dull, especially Izumi. Everyone feels like they are constantly depressed, uninterested, and they have a lack of enthusiasm for anything.There are no bright colors, or anything that pops, stands out at all, the soundtrack is mostly nonexistent, or it\'s slow, moody type of music. OP and ED songs are fine, but nothing memorable or catchy. Except for the couple of times they play baseball, all they do is sit, talk and/or walk around, so there isn\'t a lot of action in the animation department either.There were actually a couple of hilarious moments, like when the Photography Club members were goofing off, or when Natsume got off on the wrong train stop. I also liked that every character were distinct from each other, so it was easy to follow the narrative and to not confuse them between each other. I want also add to that it was easy to follow the story and the plot itself, because there weren\'t any out of place jump cuts, sudden location changes, or any weird artsy stuff/editing. Voice acting was also good, but nothing exceptional.On the story department, I didn\'t think this was anything extraordinary, or something I haven\'t seen before. In my opinion, you shouldn\'t go watching this with the intention to find a heartwarming, dramatic love story that would make you cry, or emotional. If you think about the character, and relationship progression from the beginning state, compared to the end, there were none, or a very little amount of it overall.My score reflects what I said in the beginning, ""gray"". If ""white"" was 5 (Average), then ""gray"" would be one shade below it, 4 (Bad). Honestly, this was tiresome to watch from beginning to end, and I had one of the worst feelings after watching an anime that you can have, I thought it was a waste of my time. If I were realistic, I would give it a ""Mixed Feelings"", but I don\'t want to be indecisive, that\'s why I rate it as ""Not Recommended"".

It's either one.Story: 5/10Izumi is a boy that is moving back to his home town from Tokyo and from that moment on he starts to interact with old friend Souma which he met when he was walking around his new school. From that point, he starts to interact with the other people knew and interacting with new people that interact with his old friends aka Souma and Natsume. The story tries to make it feel as realistic as possible and don't try to over dramatic it's characters and the story itself. But at the...same time, the plot is almost like not there or sometimes its everywhere. When you watch the first few episodes, there is almost no story at all. You don't know what's happening beside Izumi is moving back to his home town. The story doesn't really explain much either. I assume they're trying to be realistic and let you see how the characters develops overtime by interacting but I'll explain that later. The story do start to pick up around episode 6-7 but I feel like that's already too late when the series only have like 12 episodes. It's like a story that has no story. That's why you'll either hate it or love it.Art: 6/10The art is not to be praised about but it's not terrible either. The characters sometimes feel flat to the point that there is not much depth into it. The art just feels flat but it's not like terrible either. I just wish they added more depth into the drawing which could raise the score up for this anime.Sound: 8/10The music is the best part for this series. The Ending song is really good personally and the Opening is pretty nice to listen to. The ost itself isn't really that great but I guess it fits some part of the story. I guess the OST is a bit bland.Character: 4/10I won't go too much in depth for this because it can spoil some stuff in the anime. The character development in this anime is just so PAINFULLY slow. It's so painfully slow that it's almost like there isn't any development at all. The show is trying to make the character and story realistic as possible but it fell short. There is barely any backstory for each characters.. You will barely know the characters backstory which literally makes the character development so slow. The idea of realism for each characters is executed so badly when the PLOT relies on the character development to make the plot itself.Enjoyment: 5/10I'm trying to enjoy the series as much as I can. I had watched tons of Anime so much to the point I got nothing left to watch. I watched so many Anime that I gotten to the point I'm too lazy to add it on my MAL list. The series is just so painfully slow but episode 7 did start to get a bit interesting for me to keep watching till the end.Overall: 5/10A plot with almost no plot. Realism executed so poorly. If you want to watch something to fill your over post depression of a series you watch or just bored then I guess you should watch this anime.

It’s not like I hate it, but I don’t find it interesting in almost any way.Well I cannot take it’s credits in one aspect and that’s trying to be original. It’s style is different from so many other romance animes, but it just did not work on me. Usually slow phased romance anime are my cup of tea, when I want to chill out a little. Unfortunately here it was so slow, that I had a feeling like I’m waiting for my package on post office staffed by employee before retirement and...end of the shift.[Story: 3/10]As I said story was slow, stagnant and almost all the important stuff you need to know happens in first 2 and last 2 episodes except of 2 ""rejections"". Same feeling like when you’re watching some boring moto GP race and you can easily watch first five and last five rounds with equal or better experience. There is still something happening, but most of the time it’s so unimportant, that practically nothing is happening. Minimum tension build-up, twists and scenes that makes you feel some emotions overall, which should be main component of the drama. There were scenes which this does not apply for (coming to school after long time, rejections, friendly moments between Komiya and Izumi, ending), but it’s not enough for 12 episodes. Negative elements like these made me wonder, when does it end and the story drags on like a toddler’s snot. To sum it up... Just Because story got it’s enjoyable moments, unfortunately they cover a very small portion of the story.[Characters: 5/10]Significant problem for me was male MC. I’ve probably never seen so flegmatic and uninteresting person in anime. He had same expression 90% of his screen time like someone just stabbed his dog to death. Only moments I could bite through his boriness were with Komiya. There weren’t enough quality moments between Natsume and Izumi, so I couldn’t really empathize with neither of them. Natsume made me angry with her jealousy and selfishness. She doesn’t want Ena to date Eita, even tho she isn’t dating him as well and she’s not doing anything to do so. Haruto, Izumi’s best friend was supporting, cheerful, typical best friend character.I found his relationship development with Morikawa more interesting than Natsume and Izumi one, although I don’t like this „Wait for me for 4 years until I finish school and we can start dating"" type of shit, because this just almost never happens in real life.Side characters are not great, not terrible as would say Anatoly Dyatlov. Overall except of two main characters they were bearable, some even good.[Art: 7/10]Release date was October 2017, you could easily find better looking anime in this year, but other than that it’s passable.I would say I like the animations it looked good.[Sound: 8/10]Best aspect of the anime was sound for me, it fits perfectly. Scenes where Hazuki played on trumpet had nice atmosphere.Opening is forgettable, but other than that it’s nice.[Enjoyment: 3/10]Well in short, I rather did not enjoy Just Because, but it has some good moments and some fans with different taste than mine.[Conclusion/Overall 5/10]:Base on my opinion I can’t recommend this wholeheartedly. end of the shift.[Story: 3/10]As I said story was slow, stagnant and almost all the important stuff you need to know happens in first 2 and last 2 episodes except of 2 ""rejections"".

I really think that no other anime comes close to depicting the mundane details of the characters' daily lives and facial expressions to such an extent. I can't recommend any similar anime to Just Because as the show is just so unique and different; Tsuki Ga Kirei isn't even close except for its romance genre.And the stakes here are high. An original anime series with a myriad of sponsors betting on this show - multinational corporations Canon and Odakyu to name a few. So for all the controversy surrounding the supposed 'delays', this anime is...nothing short of impressive.Story: 10/10In a world that's increasingly more uncertain the innocence of the story really provides a tiny bit of escapism for viewers. The depiction of everyday life, use of LINE, and the relationships among the main characters are particularly noteworthy. Episodes are barely melodramatic, aside from certain climatic exchanges that mainly serve to provide a direction for the overall story. Yes the premise might be cliche -High school, typical confessions, 2 guys & 3 girls - a recipe for a predictable story line. However, what is so remarkable is how the story unfolds and its execution. Furthermore there are some scenes that might appear redundant but they are critical to the progression of the story such as the baseball games in the first half of the show and the exchange between Haruto and his mum. The overall pacing is just nice, some episodes might feel slower as if nothing has been achieved. Yet it sets a perfect foundation for what is to come next. I just wished that the show was longer.Art: 10/10I'll say it again: Visual Masterpiece. The drawings of the monorail stations, baseball games, exchanges on the bridge, the buses and the bus stops are stunning. More attention is paid to the facial expressions as well (not just the colour of their eyes). Yet for all the complaints regarding the use of CGI, inconsistency in the animation quality, it is highly laudable for a television anime to produce art of such quality. The producers are relying so much on these minute details and it isn't hard to see why they've nailed the slice of life genre perfectly. The overall art creates a mood that is in overall so relaxing and calming and makes you wish to be back in Japan again.Sound: 9/10The ED is notable and the lyrics are fitting for the story and mode. Furthermore, they're performed by the voice actresses! I personally prefer it to the OP. Well, the voice actors of the various characters perfectly match the roles. They speak with intonations that really depict what the character is like. For example, the voice actor of Eita really draws out the dullness of his character the producers desire to depict. Transitions, footsteps and also the Trumpet - Pretty good!Character: 9/10Don't want to dive so much or I'll spoil the story. Thus far, I feel that Komiya is mainly used as a tool to progress the story. Her character is by far unique and the most interesting among the rest. I also like how they showed the personal developments of Natsume and Morikawa throughout the series. The bond between Eita and Haruto as well as the entire group also makes the show noteworthy. The only downside was that Inui Yoriko was neglected, serving as the character to help sail the ship for the main cast (I wish the show was Longer)Enjoyment: 10/10I need not say more.However, viewers should note that the supposed delays have nothing to do with the producers or the directors. I've been following @JustBecause_JP on twitter and the local broadcast appears to be on schedule every week on the various Japanese Channels. Furthermore, episodes are produced few months in advanced and the supposed one week break in the middle of the season was meant to give the local viewers a tour of the local Kanagawa sites that are featured remarkably on the anime. Hence, all the accusations against the director and the quality of various scenes are basically unfounded and largely bias. nothing short of impressive.Story: 10/10In a world that's increasingly more uncertain the innocence of the story really provides a tiny bit of escapism for viewers. The depiction of everyday life, use of LINE, and the relationships among the main characters are particularly noteworthy. Episodes are barely melodramatic, aside from certain climatic exchanges that mainly serve to provide a direction for the overall story. Yes the premise might be cliche -High school, typical confessions, 2 guys & 3 girls - a recipe for a predictable story line. However, what is so remarkable is how the story unfolds and its execution. Furthermore there are some scenes that might appear redundant but they are critical to the progression of the story such as the baseball games in the first half of the show and the exchange between Haruto and his mum. The overall pacing is just nice, some episodes might feel slower as if nothing has been achieved. Yet it sets a perfect foundation for what is to come next. I just wished that the show was longer.Art: 10/10I'll say it again: Visual Masterpiece. The drawings of the monorail stations, baseball games, exchanges on the bridge, the buses and the bus stops are stunning. More attention is paid to the facial expressions as well (not just the colour of their eyes). Yet for all the complaints regarding the use of CGI, inconsistency in the animation quality, it is highly laudable for a television anime to produce art of such quality. The producers are relying so much on these minute details and it isn't hard to see why they've nailed the slice of life genre perfectly. The overall art creates a mood that is in overall so relaxing and calming and makes you wish to be back in Japan again.Sound: 9/10The ED is notable and the lyrics are fitting for the story and mode. Furthermore, they're performed by the voice actresses! I personally prefer it to the OP. Well, the voice actors of the various characters perfectly match the roles. They speak with intonations that really depict what the character is like. For example, the voice actor of Eita really draws out the dullness of his character the producers desire to depict.

As you can see story wise the anime is pretty vanilla wich is not a bad thing but certanly doesn\'t help to make it more interesting.The art is ok, but the color scheme is pretty bland giving the anime an even more uninteresting look. Also the animation is pretty unsubstantial from a moment to another you are with a...grounded style of animation an then the show decides to go full on spocon. Sound is good, but nothing to write home about. The characters are more of the same generic slice of life tropes you\'ve seen a million times, with, once again, uninspired designs. Another thing to notice is that the humor is bad, it\'s all reaction base humor with jokes that never land.The enoyment of this series is almost non-existant it is mediocrity at it\'s best.Overall don\'t watch it unless you want to stack another anime or you REALLY like this genre. grounded style of animation an then the show decides to go full on spocon.

But no, not in the way that you might think.After all, Silent Voice broke me. Little Busters broke me. Your Lie in April broke me.But in this case, I was left completely broken in feelings of disappointment, confusion, yet joy? Sounds pretty dramatic right? That may be so, but what I truly felt was that a potential masterpiece with such a well set up atmosphere was ruined in just a few episodes.Let\'s begin with the introduction to the main story. The first 2 minutes or so beautifully introduced the setting and each individual character by piecing together related scenes alongside...the perfect instrumental music. What follows from there is your average high school life which manages to realistically capture the very essence of adolescence - even very early on there is already a heavy focus on what each character wants to do in the future, which only later on is cleverly linked with the romance between the characters. It just feels so real, and I can certainly say as someone who is pretty much at the exact same stage as the characters, that this anime managed to portray the beauty of this time of our lives. 9/10 for relatability and realism.The overall pace is slow but steady, and the use of silence is common, perfectly setting up an almost melancholic feel. There\'s lots of space for the viewers to feel comfortable and think things through. The characters are done well with unique personalities (apart from one..), and they contrast each other nicely. Unfortunately, one of the main characters in particular - Natsume Mio - despite having most of the screentime was so poorly developed I don\'t think I can recall anything positive or special about her. Her entire personality is pretty much her being high on copium for the entire series by avoiding most of her problems instead of tackling them head-on. On the other end though, is the saving grace of this whole anime probably - Komiya. Her amazing character is hard to put into words, one word to summarise is her unrivalled Enthusiasm; But personality aside, let\'s talk about the inclusion of Komiya\'s hobby - Photography. Although this subject is very general, I felt that the use of this in this anime specifically was not a mere coincidence, but rather is symbolic of capturing their final moments before graduation (a running theme throughout) and preserving these memories for much later on. It also serves as a great medium for the users to reflect on the anime as a whole, appreciating its story from start to end - and as a result the viewers might also look back on their own pasts. It indulges a brilliant sense of nostalgia.Now let\'s focus on the development of the romance between the characters, it\'s revealed that Haruto has feelings for ___ in episode 1 and plans to ask her out. The relationship between the tswo feels real, and is not settled until the final episodes. Although it was predictable at times, generally it was done quite well. In terms of the other ships: one ship steered amazingly smoothly, while the other was seemingly driven by a toddler and made anyone on the ship sick. But this is a romance anime, so guess which sunk? Yeah what you\'re thinking is probably correct. This section is what the majority of my criticism and disappointment lies, and it\'s not just due to bias. The story never even explains why.. and gives us very little backstory. You\'re pretty much supposed to just accept it. I can\'t really critique this part any longer without spoiling it so I\'ll leave this section here with a 5/10.Lastly, let\'s talk about the Art + Sound. The art and visuals were not particularly special. Certain scenes could have looked much more appealing and pretty, but the art style seemed to fit the overall feeling. 6/10 for the art.However, the music was astounding - the composer really managed to nail a very relaxing and suitable background music - consisting of mainly instrumental piano/guitar/orchestral music. A 10/10 for the soundtrack, and while I don\'t really care about OPs/EDs, they were also quite fitting, especially the ED. The VAs were also brilliant, with some very unique voices - like Morikawa\'s sister or MC\'s voice when he gets emotional.My overall enjoyment for the first 9 episodes was a 10/10, while the story gets a 9/10. But for the last quarter of the anime my enjoyment turned into a 3/10, same for the story. The ending is INCREDIBLY rushed, and felt like it needed another episode or even two to correctly finish it off - which is funny because this is an ORIGINAL anime which shouldn\'t have pacing issues. Even so, they should have at least moved the ending scene forward, adding a follow up onwards from it. With that said, I haven\'t even touched on the worst part yet - which links in with what I\'ve said already about the romantic development of a certain two - quite frankly there is none.I can\'t not recommend this anime to anyone. It\'s a great watch, but prepare to be disappointed by the ending, even heartbroken. It left me confused beyond words in the moment - ""broken""... but in the end I was glad I watched it.

It is a great complete story that does not leave on a undecided lover like most shows these days. It wraps up it story completely and concisely not overstaying its welcome by dragging out the plot and leaving on a cliffhanger to boost sells of another work. I think the anime being an original plays a part in that, but regardless, this is truly an anime that you should watch if you enjoy romance. The emotions that this anime invoke is something that I haven't felt from an anime in such a long...time. I was able to connect to the story deeply and felt very invested in the drama and characters to the point where I couldn't choose a favorite couple and felt legitimately satisfied by whomever the character was going to choose at the end. The romance was grounded by realism and the characters were the most realistic I've seen in an anime. A particular realistic scenario the characters had to consider was their future. Whether it be continuing their college career or joining the workforce, putting them in a dilemma as to whether they should even date at all. This realism hits all too close to home as a senior that is close to graduation and made me further enjoy the anime. To me this is the perfect high school romance anime. The atmosphere is great, the realism is great, the characters are great, and the end is great. Truly a great anime and I'd highly recommend it. time.

Which is not to say there’s much drama to be expected from this. On the contrary, the tone of the story is quite relaxing, considering this is somewhat of an ode to students and teenagers about to enter society. It is quite a hot pot: those who are already accepted...into university, those who are still trying to get into one and those who are going to university at all. To be honest, I am quite disappointed in the story. I constantly asked myself “what’s the focus of the story?” Before anyone even mention Slice of Life doesn’t need a focus, every slice of life has a theme about friendship, companion ship, adolescence, stress, love etc… This show has all of it yet focus on none of them, quite bewildering. I’m not saying I wasn’t entertained by the dramatic romantic relationship but the series backdrop sort of divert away from that. I get that having a backdrop of students about to leave for the next step in life would impose an air of urgency: confess your love before it’s too late! But instead of that, the series adopted a relaxing, calming air. Considering that the exams are 2 episodes, involving 2 characters. One of which has nothing at stake which kind of destroy the setting. Worse, some implication could be controversial even though the series denies it like: taking an important exam just to chase after your crush or conveniently getting jealous without making clear your feeling. The most serious problem is character growth. There was little sign of it. Characters experiment with love and that’s it. Except for the one taking the exam that changed their choice by having a short conversation, nothing else memorable really happened. There’s a lack of big moment in the story that truly dramatize the events. Everything was just so calm but not in a good way. Aria the animation is calming, this started out with a bunch of drama seeds, but things just seem to resolve itself by the middle. Because of that the last half felt like a marathon instead of being excited to see what happen next. Overall, the plot is almost nonchalant, nothing seems to matter and akin to a better written convenient plot that could have Shinkai drawn up, nicely transit into my next point.I wouldn’t be surprised if Mr Shinkai has a finger in the production but thankfully, he didn’t. While the plot is almost at Shinkai level of convenience i.e. swapped choices but someone conveniently couldn’t pass so they could reunite, the art is quite adept seeing as Pine Jam was only founded in 2015. The winter atmosphere drew heavy on the entire 12 episodes with really nice background, bright back drop, detail objects and sometime feels like a better Shinkai or KyoAni production. Which is to say that this has been a gigantic waste of budget. I would rather Shinkai taking up production instead. I understand the dark and grey tone because it is depicting winter, but this has not contributed to the plot at all. Shinkai always add in unnecessary details or segments to his overblown productions but I can appreciate that he’s always trying to set up things in his own crazy way. The art is excessive while not being able to match up to the atmosphere of the plot. Here’s something from Shinkai playbook: put in transport -> trains to create a scene association to daily life/movement/change/shifting situation/separation, sport is associate with competition/special event/effort/disappointment/youth/heat. The art seems to be a love letter to Kanagawa instead. The plot and the art production focus on different theme completely lost me in the middle of the series. Troubled production was noticeable as well with many strange morphing happening on characters. The show seems to be unable to use colour in a bold way, falling back to using grey tones and very uncharacteristic spectrums that brings nothing to attention. More troubling is while I’m sure Kanagawa is beautiful, the art failed to impress with its iconic locations. I think it is important that the industry trying to imitate Mr Shinkai madness, remembers that we learn to love the location depicting in the story because we love the story. Haruhi, K-On, Durarara, Steins’Gate etc.. all successfully captured the audience attention with its colourful cast and story before people start to take pictures of the location in the show.The other small things like music and sound is decent enough. While its piano BGM brings calmness, it is also very forgettable. Nothing to rave really.I asked myself why did they make this show? Was it all worth it? Why did Hajime write a bunch of stories that amount to nothing? I’m not sure did any of the characters really learn anything throughout the process. The art is great but why it is so great but in an average way. There’s no focus in the scenery, completely greying out the pretty bits that somehow makes it unremarkable instead of striking. The amount of Shinkai in this show scares me. After Violet Evergarden baffling mediocrity, a similar but decent show like this lack so much soul. I reminiscence to the days animations have so much characters while is art is hilariously terrible. To be honest, I think the troubled production ruined Hajime plans for the show. If there had been even more struggle to figure their feelings out, more friction between the characters, more spirit shown by anyone other than the side chick of the MC, more thoughtful scenes to convey change in characters instead of the extremely disappointing haircut part, the show could have reached much higher height. For now, I doubt it will be remembered for long. I hope this original show won’t be the nail in the coffin for original animated series. So many have fallen due to the industry expansion, demanding more quality, more episode, faster and cheaper.The important question is always: who is this show for? If you have plenty of time on your hand and would like to reminiscence about your exam period (you can see how the premise is quite flawed), this is a very calming show to get away from the everyday life rush. Other than that, I think this could be Pine Jam milestone project. The art team has shown promises and the general direction has been very positive. If Kobayashi is able to polish his direction, focus more the theme and manage his time table better, he could supersede Shinkai with hopefully more substance. into university, those who are still trying to get into one and those who are going to university at all.

However quite early on we already see some romantic threads being pulled, the most notable being Hazuki and Haruto\'s (the beta couple). The thing is after that the...main three of Eita, Ena and Mio gets a love triangle ohhh goodie and things for LA at least get worse from there.Ok, to get some things straight, Hazuki and Haruto has some trials and tribulations they face from Hazuki\'s own problems of taking care of her little brothers to Haruto trying to fit into Hazuki\'s life and Haruto\'s shyness getting in the way of things. The thing is for LA at least, though their trials and tribulations are trivial at best and are dealt with rather easily, LA saw their relationship as something of an adolescence romance taken in a mature way especially during their crossroads dilemma, its kinda why LA was rooting for them from the start. Seriously why couldn\'t Hazuki and Haruto be the main couple?. OK technically they gets as much spotlight as the main couple but in terms of focus, the love triangle of Mio, Eita and Ena by the halfway point GETS ALL THE FOCUS.So what\'s LA problem with Mio, Eita and Ena\'s love triangle, well for one, it\'s a love triangle that sprung outta nowhere mainly Ena\'s interest in Eita for LA came outta nowhere, something like a muse for Ena towards Eita that maybe bloomed into a puppy love or something like that by with this love triangle, LA was ROOTING for Ena instead as she kinda took the limelight for a few episodes. Mio\'s problem was the entire ""work vs. romance"" debate and mainly her trying to get the college she wanted being one of her focal points for the entire anime and Eita helping her (and with Mio in return doing her typical tsundere (more on dere) scthick). The major problem for LA about this love triangle is the mere case of  if the love triangle resolving itself quickly so that we can actually see the MAIN ROMANCE blossom, instead what we get is of them leaving things off towards the ending and them ""maybe"" having a proper romance we will never get to see, that and again bringing up the out of nowhere romance of Ena and Eita taking precedent AS WELL AS HAVING MORE SCREENTIME is odd for a love triangle like this, almost like Just Because WANTS us to root for Eita and Ena instead of Eita and Mio. If anything it feels like emotional manipulation that Just Because even did this, that\'s what really annoyed LA about this love triangle.Character-wise, all 5 of the main cast are your typical archetypes, from Eita\'s pessimistic nature, Mio tsundereness, Hazuki\'s calming demenour,  Ena\'s genkiness and Haruto\'s strong yet playful nature is shown in full force. The supporting cast are easily forgettable for LA, merely being NOTHING but supporting to their respective ships. Other than that...there isn\'t much else character wise considering how romance and school life driven Just Because is.Ok as much LA pretty much hounded Just Because for their main love triangle..LA has some...""nice"" things to say. for one, Just Because brings us back to the melancholy of high school in both a positive and negative light, pretty much showing us how teenager act and with the added smartphone texting utterly changing how these romance and communications has changed high school...wait this sounds eerily like *cough* Tsuki ga Kirei *cough*. *ahem* From that, for such a lethargic romance anime, it\'s one you don\'t need to get fully invested in and with it\'s nature as it is, it\'s not full forced dramatic with characters bickering and having petty squabbles and what not, the drama is rather tame all things considered even with a main love triangle dominating the latter half of Just Because. Ohhh and as a final positive thing about Just Because would be Hazuki and Haruto\'s relationship was the MOST mature LA saw as an epilogue for them especially on how they handled the situation was praiseworthy enough.In terms of animation by Pine Jam, the character designs are diverse enough for LA to distinguish the majority of the cast (though with only 5 main cast members it wasn\'t that hard anyways). The backgrounds and the attention to detail was especially great, though LA thought Pine Jam had an odd fascination in the animation for making their hair detail as realistic in traditional animation as possible which caught LA\'s eye. Though for LA, it felt like the animation latter down the line especially with it\'s characters went from detailed to the background to janky facial expressions at times...but maybe that was just LA. Either way the animation was decent if a bit inconsistent.In terms of voice acting, LA felt at least the majority of the characters fit their character archetype and ""sounding like teenagers"". Karin Isobe as Mio as good, but for LA, LA preferred Yuna Yoshino as Hazuki as well as Lynn as Ena better. Aoi Ichikawa and Taishi Murata did pretty well as Eita and Haruto respectively with how pessimistic with a jerk with a heart of gold archetype and the best friend shy guy attitudes. Oddly enough the voice cast was pretty great.LA gets it, it\'s high school, teenagers are gonna make dumb mistakes in their life, be it romantic or otherwise and with how the uncertainty of the future will hold for us but as LA said on the above statement if the beta couple in your ROMANCE ANIME is more interesting or worth investing than the main couple, then we have a problem.All LA wished for Just Because was for the main couple to have much tact and thought than the lesser screentime of the beta couple who just did great in terms of progression, the main love triangle just stalled and stalled until the end with the typical scthick we see in love triangles (with all the misunderstandings and out of nowhere love interests to boot)...see why LA prefers Hazuki and Haruto more?. But for the main love triangle it might as well have been...Just Because... main three of Eita, Ena and Mio gets a love triangle ohhh goodie and things for LA at least get worse from there.Ok, to get some things straight, Hazuki and Haruto has some trials and tribulations they face from Hazuki\'s own problems of taking care of her little brothers to Haruto trying to fit into Hazuki\'s life and Haruto\'s shyness getting in the way of things. The thing is for LA at least, though their trials and tribulations are trivial at best and are dealt with rather easily, LA saw their relationship as something of an adolescence romance taken in a mature way especially during their crossroads dilemma, its kinda why LA was rooting for them from the start. Seriously why couldn\'t Hazuki and Haruto be the main couple?. OK technically they gets as much spotlight as the main couple but in terms of focus, the love triangle of Mio, Eita and Ena by the halfway point GETS ALL THE FOCUS.So what\'s LA problem with Mio, Eita and Ena\'s love triangle, well for one, it\'s a love triangle that sprung outta nowhere mainly Ena\'s interest in Eita for LA came outta nowhere, something like a muse for Ena towards Eita that maybe bloomed into a puppy love or something like that by with this love triangle, LA was ROOTING for Ena instead as she kinda took the limelight for a few episodes. Mio\'s problem was the entire ""work vs. romance"" debate and mainly her trying to get the college she wanted being one of her focal points for the entire anime and Eita helping her (and with Mio in return doing her typical tsundere (more on dere) scthick). The major problem for LA about this love triangle is the mere case of  if the love triangle resolving itself quickly so that we can actually see the MAIN ROMANCE blossom, instead what we get is of them leaving things off towards the ending and them ""maybe"" having a proper romance we will never get to see, that and again bringing up the out of nowhere romance of Ena and Eita taking precedent AS WELL AS HAVING MORE SCREENTIME is odd for a love triangle like this, almost like Just Because WANTS us to root for Eita and Ena instead of Eita and Mio. If anything it feels like emotional manipulation that Just Because even did this, that\'s what really annoyed LA about this love triangle.Character-wise, all 5 of the main cast are your typical archetypes, from Eita\'s pessimistic nature, Mio tsundereness, Hazuki\'s calming demenour,  Ena\'s genkiness and Haruto\'s strong yet playful nature is shown in full force. The supporting cast are easily forgettable for LA, merely being NOTHING but supporting to their respective ships. Other than that...there isn\'t much else character wise considering how romance and school life driven Just Because is.Ok as much LA pretty much hounded Just Because for their main love triangle..LA has some...""nice"" things to say. for one, Just Because brings us back to the melancholy of high school in both a positive and negative light, pretty much showing us how teenager act and with the added smartphone texting utterly changing how these romance and communications has changed high school...wait this sounds eerily like *cough* Tsuki ga Kirei *cough*. *ahem* From that, for such a lethargic romance anime, it\'s one you don\'t need to get fully invested in and with it\'s nature as it is, it\'s not full forced dramatic with characters bickering and having petty squabbles and what not, the drama is rather tame all things considered even with a main love triangle dominating the latter half of Just Because. Ohhh and as a final positive thing about Just Because would be Hazuki and Haruto\'s relationship was the MOST mature LA saw as an epilogue for them especially on how they handled the situation was praiseworthy enough.In terms of animation by Pine Jam, the character designs are diverse enough for LA to distinguish the majority of the cast (though with only 5 main cast members it wasn\'t that hard anyways). The backgrounds and the attention to detail was especially great, though LA thought Pine Jam had an odd fascination in the animation for making their hair detail as realistic in traditional animation as possible which caught LA\'s eye. Though for LA, it felt like the animation latter down the line especially with it\'s characters went from detailed to the background to janky facial expressions at times...but maybe that was just LA. Either way the animation was decent if a bit inconsistent.In terms of voice acting, LA felt at least the majority of the characters fit their character archetype and ""sounding like teenagers"". Karin Isobe as Mio as good, but for LA, LA preferred Yuna Yoshino as Hazuki as well as Lynn as Ena better. Aoi Ichikawa and Taishi Murata did pretty well as Eita and Haruto respectively with how pessimistic with a jerk with a heart of gold archetype and the best friend shy guy attitudes. Oddly enough the voice cast was pretty great.LA gets it, it\'s high school, teenagers are gonna make dumb mistakes in their life, be it romantic or otherwise and with how the uncertainty of the future will hold for us but as LA said on the above statement if the beta couple in your ROMANCE ANIME is more interesting or worth investing than the main couple, then we have a problem.All LA wished for Just Because was for the main couple to have much tact and thought than the lesser screentime of the beta couple who just did great in terms of progression, the main love triangle just stalled and stalled until the end with the typical scthick we see in love triangles (with all the misunderstandings and out of nowhere love interests to boot)...see why LA prefers Hazuki and Haruto more?. But for the main love triangle it might as well have been...Just Because...', 'Senior year of high school is like a train station.Pick a train to decide your future. You can\'t say for sure what lies at your destination, but you know for certain it will take you away from your school and the friends you made there. This is the theme that Just Because puts forward with its story of seniors deciding their futures and many train station scenes. However, it does not have the intimacy necessary for these themes to be believable.Slice of life shows live or die on how intimate they are. And no, I do not mean romance. I mean the show\'s connection to...the audience. Without that crucial connection, you might as well be watching bugs run around for all it matters. A lack of intimacy is what prevents Just Because from being engaging.I have no doubt that the show has subtle character interactions that allow the viewer to make their own interpretations, but when it\'s so hard to give a damn about any of them, it\'s impossible to feel engaged with anything happening on screen.[Story: 4/10]After elementary school, you typically fall apart from your classmates. The story of Just Because is about those kids coming back together in high school and meeting up again. Eita Izumi left his town after elementary school, but now that he has transferred back to his friends\' town, he is reconnecting with them. The story is as basic as it needs for the slice-of-life and romance genres. We\'ve seen this structure many times over, which is not improved in this show. It follows 5 high school students through their everyday lives. They study to get into universities, hone their talents, and try to get dates. The show jumps around at such an inconsistent pace between the 5 characters that it\'s hard to get a grip on who they are and what motivates them beyond a shallow description. Characters walk around or sit about with bored-looking expressions on their faces, forcing the viewer to mimic their feelings.Just Because wouldn\'t be the first show I recommend to someone interested in a realistic young adult romance. I wish I could say that the characters make up for what the show lacks in the story, but they don\'t. The story moves at a snail\'s pace in the first few episodes, giving us small details about the central characters and long-drawn-out scenes to establish the atmosphere. Eventually, the pacing gets better. Once all of the characters are clearly established, the final half of the show is made up of somewhat entertaining if overwrought melodrama over little petty moments. Moments like going on certain characters going out on dates then the effects it has on the third wheel who\'s in love with one of the two on the date (trying to keep it spoiler-free, sorry to be vague).I\'d say I was disappointed by the ending, but it is consistent with the expectations the show instills in its audience. It\'s a bleak and quiet moment that puts forth the theme one last time \'there\'s beauty in simplicity, but it felt so undeserved to me. It felt like a contradiction to the build-up in the previous episodes, and I couldn\'t help but think, ""Why couldn\'t this have happened six episodes ago?"". Very little of the melodrama experienced throughout the prior episodes felt necessary by the end.[Character: 5/10]Just Because aims to create realistic characters, yet it fails to develop them enough to be believable. Sure, very boring people like these characters could exist in the real world, but who would want to subject themselves to watching their dull lives?Some of them are likable (if you can tolerate their personalities), but I didn\'t care for them individually. The only time I was ever interested in the characters was when they were with one another. Whether it be their arguments, making fond memories, or considering their futures. I just couldn\'t get myself to care about them while they stared off into space, trying to seem deep. We understand; your characters are tragic! They\'re going to college! Maybe you can tell us something else about them… like who they are as people beyond the fact that they\'re going to college next year. For example, Haruto plays baseball and likes a girl; great, who is he though? Why does he like her? Is there anything more to his life than baseball and a crush? All signs say no.This sentiment could be applied to any of the leads. I found them to be very one-sided, destroying the potential for Just Because to be an intimate slice of life. The show only takes its characters halfway to becoming good, then it stops leaving us half-baked hollow shells (filled with awkward silences and depression). Ultimately, I couldn\'t see the characters as the real people they were intended to be. There was not enough believability. Even Komiya, the character I liked the most for her outgoing personality, had very little going on besides her camera and crush.The saddest thing about the characters is that they were nearly good. They could have had the believability to compliment their likable personalities with a better writer and director. We can get in the headspace of a character and tell if they conceal their emotions and sometimes if they\'re lying through the abundance of close-up shots and a consistent tone. However, the art is pretty bad, so those close-ups are ugly and the tone so depressing that it only wants to pointlessly wear down your spirit.At least I can say I got into each character\'s headspaces and became depressed just like they were. But that headspace was totally vacant of interesting details!! I can relate to the IDEA of high schoolers who are struggling to decide their futures at the crossroads of their lives, but no amount of relatable ideas will get me invested in these cardboard cutouts.[Art: 4/10]Pine Jam dropped the ball on this one. Their last show, Gamers, didn\'t look nearly as rough as this. It\'s plagued with weak character art and poor animation. I\'m not sure if it was just a simple budget issue or if they couldn\'t handle a project as intimate as this, but to put it bluntly, it\'s harsh on the eyes. To make a quiet coming-of-age story, you need close-ups to get the audience into the character\'s headspace. That\'s not to say that Just Because doesn\'t try close-ups, but when it does, they\'re so ugly you\'ll wish the camera would zoom back out.The backgrounds look nice if you like looking at the color gray for 23 minutes. I can praise how the mellow colors of the characters and backgrounds blend together. It makes the characters feel just as melancholy as the cold winter town, but keep in mind the show strives to make you feel this depressing atmosphere.What weighs down the visuals the most is the lackluster directing. Most scenes have very boring camera angles, usually pulled far back from the characters, making them feel disconnected from the viewer. The director rarely creates intimate moments that connect the viewer to the characters. They usually feel like random extras in a greater story that has yet to materialize. Even during the scenes in the characters\' homes, there is very little detail to show who those characters are. Their rooms are devoid of defining details. So many opportunities to create believable characters were missed; it\'s sad to see a director waste such great potential.There\'s a bit of CGI usage during the later episodes, no doubt to cut down on the budget (most notably that awkward and overlong first-person bicycling scene).[Sound: 5/10]The opening song is quite good but sounds very similar to Oregairu\'s. This shouldn\'t be surprising, considering they\'re both performed by Nagi Yanagi. I would feel more inclined to score it higher if it didn\'t feel like a simple rehashing of an op from a better show in the same genre. Most scenes have music playing, which is nice to keep the show from becoming entirely empty during the simpler scenes. Typically it\'s orchestral music with a piano at the core. It highlights the mundanity of life by being so basic and plain, but yeah, that plainness is boring as hell, so... If that thematic consistency sounds appealing to you, then maybe it will add something to your experience with it. I think it does a decent job of establishing tone, but I couldn\'t care less about how it actually sounds because there have been so many fantastic soundtracks this year alone. This one\'s just passable.The voices are just as monotonous as you\'d expect. I\'d love to say this isn\'t a waste of acting talent, but I honestly can\'t tell if any of them are talented because they\'re all forced to perform the same subdued style, which gives them little opportunity to give the character some individuality/distinction. Excluding Haruto, his voice actor had a few scenes that allowed us to see his talent, but sadly he was just one of the ensemble cast. And due to the overbearing melancholy tone of the show, he was rarely able to be his peppy self.[Enjoyment: 3/10]It\'s so disappointing that the comedy in Just Because is bad because in the creator\'s previous work, ""The Pet Girl of Sakurasou,"" the jokes made me laugh a lot. There was plenty of drama in Sakurasou, which would\'ve come across fairly well in Just Because if only it wasn\'t so damn boring. Its attempts at comedy are dreadful. Typically, there is very little feedback when jokes are said, and sometimes you can\'t tell if it was a joke or just confused writing. The show also uses the social media application Line to show messages between characters. The messages are usually dressed to look like humor with emoticons and such, but the messages are so nondescript that it could be anyone who is texting. They don\'t at all add to the characters or relatability.The reason why I\'m so tough on Just Because is that it has taken on a challenge. If Just Because strived to be just another one of the trashy romcoms we get every season, I would treat it like trash and just move. However, Just Because chose to be realistic and mundane. I don\'t believe the creator understood how difficult it would be to make a compelling viewing experience with such a barren presentation. Instead of aiming to be great, it settled on mediocrity, which may have made for a good show if it was just another harem romcom, but it makes this one feel incredibly underdone. No part of Just Because! is deserving of the exclamation point at the end of its title.Boredom ≠ Good[Overall Score: 4/10]If you want a standard (and forgettable) high school drama/romance, then Just Because has what you\'re looking for. That is, as long as you can live with the alienating direction, subpar character art, and a crushingly depressing tone. The humor is cringe-inducing and never funny, but at least the melodrama in the second half is moderately entertaining. While it has the bones of a good slice-of-life show, it fails to come together in an engaging way. There can be beauty in simplicity, but nothing in Just Because is beautiful, and everything is bland. the audience.

It starts off with a boy named Eita who has just transferred for the third semester of high school to a new school; which incidentally, some of his old friends attend. Overtime he gets to know a particular girl, who becomes fond of him. Thus, spiraling this love-triangle into gear. Honestly this anime might be one of the most simple slice-of-life anime I\'ve ever seen. It\'s very simplistic.The characters are quite bland, specially the MC. But I feel that it adds to that ""slice-of-life"" aspect well, as most people in real...life aren\'t too overboard. Pretty good development.The animation and art is easily the best thing about this anime. It\'s subtle, but really shows detail when need be. Sound is quite alright, nothing special, but good.Overall I\'d really only recommend this one if you enjoy a pure slice-of-life anime with decent characters and a controversial ending. life aren\'t too overboard.

Good, bad, mediocre, generic, ugly, I’ve seen it. This show, from its description, sets the groundwork for such an interesting premise that I couldn’t help but gravitate towards it. Just Because follows 6 high school students. 5 of them are seniors nervous about their futures, and one of them is concerned with maintaining her “all I have” photography club.This anime markets itself to follow the lives of imminently graduating seniors going in different directions. Some are studying for college entrance exams, pursuing sports, and others are going straight...to the work force. If this is what the anime would be about, which let me remind you is what it’s advertised as, it would’ve been interesting and relatable. Nonetheless, this engrossing premise serves as nothing short of a trivial side plot until the absolute last episode. Sure, the characters discuss their futures briefly throughout the anime, but it loses all merit when we’re introduced to the characters. Let’s discuss them.There are 6 characters, but I’ll only discuss 5 as one (Yoriko Inui) of their entire motivations, is given in a CLOSING SCENE. I would love to tell you the other characters are more interesting, but this is a review not a fable. The actual cast follows Komiya, Natsume, Izumi, Morikawa, and Souma. A love square is established between Komiya, Izumi, Natsume, and Souma until Souma decides he likes Morkiawa turning the square into a triangle.Souma and Izumi have a brotherlike relationship bound together playing baseball growing up. Komiya photographs Izumi pitching and falls in love with him seeking approval to submit the picture of him to keep her Photography club afloat. Natsume spends the ENTIRETY of the anime with bottled up emotions and studying for entrance exams. Izumi makes a strong case for being quite possibly the most uninteresting main characters in anime history. He’s so dull and void of emotions that he’d belong better in a Shonen or battle anime. I forgot that we had to separate Shonen and battle anime for some odd reason. I’ll save the Shonen discussion for another piece.I’ll never understand why Atsusi Kobayashi, the director, found a character architype like Izumi appropriate. Morikawa is boring. Souma is the comedic relief and is one of the somewhat interesting characters in this story. Interesting characters can save a bad anime. If Kobayashi knew how to write decent characters, the bad animation, mediocre plot, and everything else, to a degree, could’ve been forgiven. Unfortunately, these are the characters I’ve persevered 12 episodes with. And preserver we did.Komiya and Souma are the only characters worth talking about so let’s briefly discuss them. Komiya began the photography club because she doesn’t have many friends and loves to take pictures. When Izumi questioned why the club was so important, she replied “it’s all I have.” My dilemma with this is that her life was never developed more than I don’t have friends. If I were to dig deep deeper and give this anime more credit than it deserved, I would say this character creation was meant to establish a theme of solitude and loneliness. However, if you’ve seen the anime, which I don’t recommend, you would understand that this is my imagination running wild in an attempt to verify my watching of this show. It would help if her home or personal life were developed. Instead, we’re told to care about her for the sake of caring about her. None of her life warrants sympathy from the viewer.Souma is more one dimensional. He’s not worried about work, school, or anything outside of his relationships with Izumi and Morikawa. He has feelings for Morikawa because she worked harder than anyone else playing the trumpet. Morikawa is another boring character who’s more of a mother than the mothers in attendance. Here’s the bottom line: because this show is littered with nontheistic characters, I had to root for these two because they had a MOTIVATION for their actions. Izumi and Natsume can’t come admit emotions for each other, Morikawa is a mother to her siblings and a love interest, and Inui doesn’t deserve to be mentioned.The projected plot separates itself from other slice of life’s. The standard of following high school drama is pretty streamlined in this anime’s genre. Covering the anxiety and challenges of graduating high school students is something rarely covered in a landfill of slice of life anime. I was so excited reading this description it thrust itself to the front of my bottomless pit of anime I planned to watch. This show is a textbook example of wasted potential. Not wasted potential because the show had potential to be good, trust me it didn’t have that; but wasted potential in the sense that the premise alone was interesting enough for me to watch immediately. Unfortunately, it’s a mediocre melodrama, with boring characters, and below standard animation.This show is by no means trash but let me propose a question. Would you recommend this show to a friend? No. A slice of life without an interesting premise is fine. A slice of life without relatable or developed characters would be a crime to recommend.Review Score: 4.5 to the work force.

Anyways, let\'s get to the review, shall we?.Disclaimer: This is a Spoiler-free review, please forgive me if you find difficult to understand some parts, as English is not my first language and this is the second review that I write (feel free to read my first review on the anime ""Blend S"").Just Because !: A...collection of intimate moments, but without fussWhen I decided to follow Just Because! I said I would do it because yes, without more. After watching his 12 episodes, I\'m left with the experience of an anime that with little it says much. That manages to catch, without being really a portent in any area.The strength of this anime is how it presents a common story in a normal, almost boring and yet captures you. It depends completely on the characters, that no matter what they become, whether they reach their goals or not, they put you into their life. Like most slice of life, the story of Just Because! it is simply the daily life of five students, and how they will spend their last months in High school.It is that stage of transition, just when school ends and you face the unknown, the future, when you become an adult. It makes sense that many of the most important scenes of Just Because! occur in a train station, because all these guys are about to take one to their future.From a 100% objective point of view, the lives of these guys, except for specific moments, are quite boring. But is not real life like that? And maybe that\'s where the charm of this series lies. His characters are not particularly interesting, except for Komiya. They have nothing special and none has any real problems. Maybe that\'s why for many this series has nothing to say.And yet, there is something that gives value to this original anime from Pine Jam.It is that amalgam of normality with classic tropes, which are slightly subverted and then fall back into them. Maybe it\'s that calm environment and its deliberately slow pace. Without being a work of art, this anime manages to entertain and keep you interested, despite using the familiar resource of a love triangle. Although it started being a geometric figure with more edges.Weaknesses and strengths of Just Because!The story of Just Because! introduces us to a mysterious exchange student ... which is not. Eita Izumi is not unknown to the rest of the protagonists, on the contrary. Four years ago he studied with most of his castmates, but a move took him away from them. Eventually he lost contact, but he did not forget the girl he liked or his best friend back then. His return acts as a catalyst in everyone\'s lives, and a very successful ""duel"" scene on a baseball diamond with his best friend puts the plot in motion.The story focuses on undoing the love polygon that I mentioned a few lines back and at the same time, decide the direction their lives will take in a few months. Eita struggles to clarify her feelings about Mio Hatsume, an old schoolmate who in turn used to be in love with her best friend, Haruto Souma. In turn, Haruto is interested in timid Hazuki Morikawa, who played in the school band. In the formula is also Ena Komiya, a girl one year below the future graduates, who falls in love with Eita after photographing him while he is facing in an improvised duel of batter and pitcher with Haruto.The rhythm of the first episodes is inconsistent and it seems that the story is not going anywhere, which affects the experience. However, in the last episodes it takes speed. In the case of the characters, they are all nice, but none stands out too much. Komiya is probably the best character in the series and yet the series does not show enough of her - or of the others - to understand her motivations. Despite this, they manage to drag us to their inner world, however superficial it might be. For some this may seem a weakness, but for those of us exhausted to see exaggerated personalities in the anime, or one-dimensional characters created around a single edge -like the classic tsunderes- it is actually refreshing to see normal people. However boring they may seem.As for art, it is probably the thinnest point of the series. The character design is simply weak. Once again, with the exception of Komiya there is no really outstanding character, neither among the main nor the secondary ones. This contributes to the feeling that it is a mundane story, with nothing extraordinary. As for the animation, it only has two really good moments, and both are about the baseball field. The construction of these scenes of the first and last episode served to make a thematic closure in Just Because! which is appreciated for its symmetry.Music, on the other hand, is the element of the highest quality without being overwhelmingly good. The opening ""Over and Over"", interpreted by yanagi Nagi helps convey the feeling of melancholy that permeates the work. However, I prefer the incidental music of Just Because !. The debutante Fukusawa Erika does a great job in giving atmosphere to the story, something that can be seen in the most emotional scenes of the anime.As for the performances, except for specific moments can be very monotonous. The greatest example of this is Eita himself, who despite being the protagonist, is perhaps the least energetic of the characters.Recommended ... but not for everyoneIn summary, I have to say that I would recommend Just Because !, but not for all public. In essence it is an anime with a typical story and that does not stand out particularly in anything. It does not have a brilliant technical execution, on the contrary, it has more than one pothole. And yet, it has its appeal. The fact that he deliberately tries to be mundane and common gives him a realism not so common in anime. Also, avoid becoming trapped in many romantic dramas, to add frankly exaggerated or melodramatic conflicts to maintain interest.Avoid curling the curl in love relationships and when it seems that you will make a turn of this style, take the logical, normal route. In that sense, his characters seem to be more mature than normal for his age ... except for some scene of jealousy. They make rational, but boring decisions for those who seek pure and simple entertainment. As someone who has seen a lot of anime in his life, the boring Just Because! In fact it is refreshing.Obviously it is not the best school romance of the year, that honor is for Tsuki ga Kirei, a very superior series. But as a way to pass the time, I found it more than adequate. It is not an ambitious anime and it will certainly pass to oblivion, but it does not cease to be reasonably entertaining for me. Although his final scene was somewhat anticlimactic, my ""Ship"" arrived at safe harbor and I am satisfied.Although someone should teach Eita how to change the wallpaper of his phone.SUMMARYJust Because! It is an anime without a great message, story, characters or animation. Nothing stands out in excess, however, its apparent mediocrity is refreshing. It will soon be forgotten, but it fulfills its purpose.Personal rating6.5/10 collection of intimate moments, but without fussWhen I decided to follow Just Because!

Nothing about Just Because is above average but in the same vein, nothing is quite below average. If you want some vibrant characters with some stereotypical archetypes followed by cheesy dialogue with poor animation and an ordinary soundtrack, then you should watch this. Why? Just because.Also, I was quite disappointed with the ending. The show was on its way to being a decent 6/10, maybe a 7/10 if the ending was well executed but it, unfortunately, fell flat for me and left me feeling unsatisfied. Also, the animation is QUITE bad. The show...had trouble airing episodes on time and had to hire a few contractor animators for unknown reasons so the art seems rushed and poor. Doesn't detract TOO much from the general feel of the show but a lot of emotional scenes fell far too short of evoking any other emotion other than awkwardness from me because of how unattractive it looked. had trouble airing episodes on time and had to hire a few contractor animators for unknown reasons so the art seems rushed and poor.

Its a pretty lengthy review which WILL contain some spoilers so I\'d advise you to read with caution.If I were to be asked ""Was there much progression between Mio Natsume (the girl MC likes since middle school) and Eita Izumi once they rejoiced?"" well my answer would simply be there was HARDLY ANY. Most of the time we were stuck with hearing Mio complain and make excuses to our main protagonist for why she hasn\'t made any progress in confessing to his friend Haruto. At that point it was playing cat...and mouse, nobody wants to make a move and confess their feelings for the one they liked (between Natsume and Eita).For several episodes we are rewarded to some nice touching moments of another girl named Komiya relationship with Eita. Without going too much into details, Komiya goes out of her way to assist Izumi for his exam while at this time ""the witch"" Mio is practically non-existent. Throughout all these episodes, the only time we see ""the witch"" Mio was when she catches the two hanging out for the first time (which probably fueled her rage to the maximum) or too busy being very concerned with Haruto & Morikawa.When I finished the show, I felt more satisfied with the Eita\'s friend shipping than his own. Haruto/Morikawa relationship blossoming was more healthy and understandable. It didn\'t feel anywhere as bad as the official ship between Natsume and Eita which was forced and rushed. Whenever Mio & Eita interactions were shown, it mainly displayed how jealous and b*tchy she truly was. It\'s not as if there was an episode or two showing Mio & Eita hanging out with each other and getting any closer than they were before which if that happened, I probably wouldn\'t have nearly as much of a frustration over this relationship.I hope that my review will help prepare others for what\'s to come in this anime. I mainly liked Just Because for Haruto/Morikawa moments along with Komiya\'s refreshing energetic personality. I would give this anime a rating of 6 out of 10 at the moment though a quick look over at this anime at a later time may cause me to change it. and mouse, nobody wants to make a move and confess their feelings for the one they liked (between Natsume and Eita).For several episodes we are rewarded to some nice touching moments of another girl named Komiya relationship with Eita.

My biggest worry was if that was enough time to develop a realistic romantic relationship between some characters. For a few it did, for others it just seemed extremely rushed and force. Which is surprising because I felt like the forced relationship was between our two main characters.In the end this was basically like any other 3 Female 2 Male romance show. The best girl finishes last.Art: Holy lord I had to give the Art a five, but that mainly came down to the animation as a whole. The...background images were very well done but my god the animation at points just took a nose dive.Sound: A slightly above average BGM with an Average opening and ending. I found myself skipping both after the second or third episode.Characters: I actually liked the characters a lot. One or two stood out to be fantastic characters, while the others were fairly enjoyable as well, with one character falling into my ""Hate"" list, but hey it makes for a good balance when it comes to this anime.Enjoyment: While I enjoyed this anime at points, there were some points where I could have just been without. Basically when watching this anime the enjoyment will come from which couple you support.Overall: Nothing really stands out about this anime other then Komiya being one of the most awesome female characters of 2017. Yes of the entire freaking year. I would seriously recommend watching this anime for Komiya she makes this anime much better then it should be. background images were very well done but my god the animation at points just took a nose dive.Sound: A slightly above average BGM with an Average opening and ending.

A school setting, romance in the air, high school students trying to figure out their future as they go through their everyday lives. And Just Because! shows it all. Or does it show it all?Let\'s start out with some of the positives.Story 8/10 - It\'s a typical school romance anime, but with a nice twist that makes it unique. It has a more dramatic vibe to it but they add in really heartwarming moments and comedic scenes to help lighten the tone.Sound 9/10 - I love the piano in the background as it\'s perfect for...this type of anime, and the OP and ED were both very solid.Enjoyment 8/10 - Every episode kept me going and made me want to watch more, as I would be struck with each of the character\'s emotions and become immersed with their dialogue.Now for the more ""eh"" parts of this show.Animation and Art 7/10 - Don\'t get me wrong, the art in this anime can look really nice, but at other times, really poor. Some examples would be how their faces would look normal, but then in other scenes look completely different and disoriented. As for the animation, it felt clunky at times, shown when the characters were playing baseball, or just walking around.Characters and their relationships 7.5/10 - At first, I really did like the personalities of the characters in this show, but some of them became to be bland and repetitive in their actions. The MC is a good example, as I thought he was more interesting, but he kind of just acts lifeless in most of the episodes, except for one, where he actually showed that he cared for a certain character. The other characters were fine for the most part. As for the relationships, I felt like there should have been more time showing the progression of their relationships and more screen time with specific characters to explain them better.And then for that last episode, and this is where if you want to avoid any possible spoilers or hinting, should skip this part and head to the bottom.Man, that last episode. It could have been so much better, but it just wasn\'t. This anime literally depended on that last episode, as the past 4 or 5 episodes were all just build up for these last scenes. I was thinking about the last episode heading into it, and wondered if they were really going to give us a satisfactory ending, where they\'re able to tie up everything about the relationships and leave us fulfilled, and I realized that there really wouldn\'t be a way to do so unless they extended the episode by like 10 minutes. But it was still a 24 minute episode, and they used up every second of those 24 minutes, but they just did not deliver. And what\'s crazy is that even though the ship I was rooting for won, you don\'t really know about the progression of them or moreso how they will progress, and that\'s just because(lol no pun intended) there\'s just not enough screen time with them, in the last episode and in the previous episodes. At least all of the characters are sent off with a nice ending, but I just wished it was presented in a more satisfactory way.Overall 7/10 - It was a roller coaster of emotions all the way through, and I became quite invested in the story and the relationships between them, and it ended in the way I had wanted it to, but just not executed well enough, shadowing over the rest of the anime. But it was nice, and although unlikely, I\'d love to see their college life in season 2, where they\'ll have an opportunity to really build on the relationships made in season 1. this type of anime, and the OP and ED were both very solid.Enjoyment 8/10 - Every episode kept me going and made me want to watch more, as I would be struck with each of the character\'s emotions and become immersed with their dialogue.Now for the more ""eh"" parts of this show.Animation and Art 7/10 - Don\'t get me wrong, the art in this anime can look really nice, but at other times, really poor.

As for the relationships, I felt like there should have been more time showing the progression of their relationships and more screen time with specific characters to explain them better.And then for that last episode, and this is where if you want to avoid any possible spoilers or hinting, should skip this part and head to the bottom.Man, that last episode. It could have been so much better, but it just wasn\'t. This anime literally depended on that last episode, as the past 4 or 5 episodes were all just build up for these last scenes. I was thinking about the last episode heading into it, and wondered if they were really going to give us a satisfactory ending, where they\'re able to tie up everything about the relationships and leave us fulfilled, and I realized that there really wouldn\'t be a way to do so unless they extended the episode by like 10 minutes. But it was still a 24 minute episode, and they used up every second of those 24 minutes, but they just did not deliver. And what\'s crazy is that even though the ship I was rooting for won, you don\'t really know about the progression of them or moreso how they will progress, and that\'s just because(lol no pun intended) there\'s just not enough screen time with them, in the last episode and in the previous episodes. At least all of the characters are sent off with a nice ending, but I just wished it was presented in a more satisfactory way.Overall 7/10 - It was a roller coaster of emotions all the way through, and I became quite invested in the story and the relationships between them, and it ended in the way I had wanted it to, but just not executed well enough, shadowing over the rest of the anime. But it was nice, and although unlikely, I\'d love to see their college life in season 2, where they\'ll have an opportunity to really build on the relationships made in season 1.', ""I've seen multiple Slice-of-lives and honestly, I can say this is the one, has hit closest to home for me.I got a feeling of selflessness throughout this whole anime, mainly from Izami and Morikawa and at points Ena.So why my love for it? Because it does exactly what it entails, it's a romantic drama that I feel will be ripping my heart out at the very end of it.It feels real, like this life they are describing is one I had previously experienced. It's that feeling right there that makes me fall in love with it.This is something that I have...yet to feel from an anime. Your lie in April, Clannad, Angel Beats, were the saddest animes I have ever seen but I never felt it was true to real life. This is the first anime I have seen that has been able to do such.The problem being, it is too ordinary, plot-wise; I'm willing to bet my guesses from episode one, which I won't be mentioning, will come true.Along with the fact I HATE the way the author ships the characters. You have two completely selfless characters and you don’t put them together? (Yes, Mio could be seen as selfless, but I found her jealousy to be too overwhelming. Her character feels dependent on Haruto, to where Izami is a supporting character to their hurdles in life.)It's a romance story yet I personally feel that when it reaches its ends... a group of singles college students would be fitting than relationships. When every character is only looking out for those around them they miss what is right in front of them. I’ll quote Ena “You’re the type of person that doesn’t turn down their friends’ requests, aren’t you?” This is the flaw that makes the story feel real. yet to feel from an anime.

It's mostly due to me being kind of late to this series and plus there are many other reviews already written about it. I must say, I enjoyed it more than I thought. While this show isn't as groundbreaking or as ambitious as other better anime turns out, it is still an enjoyable...watch. The plot is somewhat recycled but the characters and the way the plots are carried out are interesting. I know a ton of people compare this to Tsuki ga Kirei and I can definitely see why. The way the romance is carried out is quite similar, with opposing characters to try to pose a challenge for our main lovebirds. But that compared to 'Just Because!'? I think Just Because does a way better job on not just the story and the execution, but the characters, the humour and in almost everything. I must admit, I do wish the production of this show was better because the painful animation and art kill a ton of the emotions and mood of some scenes. It's a bummer but it's still way more bearable than Tsuki ga Kirei, gosh that shit is the epitome of zero production. Another thing I feel that the show does a poor job in is the sense of time, in scenes where there is a flashback or a forward/backwards in time, it's hard to tell and it leaves me the viewer slightly confuse. But other than those two, I say the rest is pretty decent, not fantastic but pleasing to watch.-SCORES-Character- 7/10: While there were many characters in the show, I feel that the writers did a good job of giving each one depth and interest. What I love most about the characters is how they are so relatable at times. For example, when my man Haruto gets somewhat rejected on Valentine's Day by Hazuki, definitely it was a big F for him but the way he turned it around and even cracked a laugh at it just struck me as an amazing thing. These are the kind of scenes that I truly love, it takes something bad and turns it around. This show does it a few times and I must compliment it for it. I also like how likeable all the characters are, they aren't anyone that is annoying or I hate. For example, Ena, while she does want Eita she knows her boundaries and respects his choice. The scenes where she just breaks down was... painful. But do you get where I'm coming from, all the characters are likeable.Art- 6/10: One of the issues, I really wished it was better because it would just make up a ton of the enjoyment loss because of the low production this show have. Not the best but certainly not the worst.Writing- 7/10: There were some weird and stupid moments like the fact that Eita doesn't know how to change his wallpaper just boggles my mind, but I like to think that he wanted to keep Ena as his wallpaper. Sometimes the writing is bad like that but other times it's a massive W. An example when like I said before Haruto turns his situation around or when Mio still pursue her interest in Eita. It's moments like these that really push the show forward. Still though, when Eita failed the exam for a less prestigious school, apart of me was like 'Bruh' but the rest was like 'I'm a loser baby, so why don't you kill me' -Beck.Sound- 7/10: I say it did its job, some scenes are exceptions. The intro and outro didn't strike me much but it's listenable.Overall, great watch to binge on if you aren't looking for a high expectation romance show. Like, come on, this is way better than Tsuki ga Kirei, that shit had no depth to it. Characters were out of words to say for the majority of their screentime, still can't believe that that got higher than Just Because!Light 7 watch.

As always, my review is quite short so if you hate reading long reviews with countless paragraphs and sentences, you're welcome!I love watching SoL anime and I was hyped for Just Because!. But the first episode was very bad, slow and boring. Still that shouldn't make you drop it, the anime becomes sadder as episodes go by.I started watching this anime, because the moment I'm writing this, I am in my senior year of high school (or 12th grade). I wanted to get the same feels a high school student experiences when taking an entrance exam and focusing on his/her studies.There are several...scenes with studying/worrying about the future, but still this is mostly a romantic anime. The main problem is which of the girls will the MC choose and as you may know, this started a war in the fandom. (People were either #TeamKomiya or #TeamNatsumi)Still, Komiya and Natsumi have both their flaws and disadvantages.Komiya is a girl that loves taking pictures, but she often gets in trouble for taking pictures of strangers. She is outgoing, but also very nosy. As for Natsumi she likes studying, but she gets salty and jealous sometimes.One of the best scenes was when Puta (a cat) sent a message with its paw. I think everyone needs a cat like that to text their crush...I give this anime a 8/10, the animation is great, the Opening and Ending are so melancholic (I love them both), but the story is not that great. I expected something else besides romantic drama. Also, if a Dub comes out, watch that. The subtitles are pretty messed up. I am still thankful for the one that translated this anime, but they could have done a much better job, smh.A much better version of this is called Tsuki ga Kirei, and I suggest you watch that first (if you haven't) scenes with studying/worrying about the future, but still this is mostly a romantic anime.

The “just because” means that they are going to go down their own path, no matter what. This is what this anime all about, how characters go about with their lives, and creating and solving conflicts along the way. It is what makes this anime a relatable, enjoyable anime.Story: 9/10Just Because! Presents the romance/slice of life genre well. It doesn’t completely transform the genre, but rather has many good qualities of the genre in...the anime. It is a quiet and simple anime, but at the same time, it can grip onto your attention the same way a epic action film does. The anime explores the themes of self discovery and relationships, as well as love and rejection. The way slice of life genres way to build drama and conflict are tiny misunderstandings between characters, and this anime does that well. At times though, it may appears to be a little unrealistic(e.g. Eita’s phone wallpaper). The anime in the beginning episodes make your “ships” quite unpredictable on whether they are going to sail or sink, giving you the excitement in watching. The ending was a conclusive one as well, not leaving up anything to big to interpretation, or begging for another season. Overall, it is an very enjoyable anime to watch and it will make you end up rooting passionately for one relationship or another(#TeamKomiya).Art: 8/10The art was alright. It may not be Gurren Lagann explosive animations, but it has that quiet and calm art style, which fits in the mood and environment in the anime. The art, although simple, still gets the information across to the audience. When the characters text to each other by their cell phones, those texts displayed on the screen for the audience to see(there is no way this show is not sponsored by LINE). This helps for the audience  to relate more to the characters and the story, as well as the struggles one faces through texting(Komiya’s cat is literally evil). The way the art displays the facial structures structures realistic, nothing exaggerated. The art enhances the the storyline by creating a relatable behaviors and sets up the school life mood.Sound: 7/10The music in the anime was well done, with soft melodic notes of the piano during the times of poignant moments.  It is nothing special, but really puts the scenes in the mood. The voice acting is any typical voice acting you would expect it to be. The sound does not play a big role in the anime, it just adds those moments when something important is happening.Character: 8/10These characters stumble around in their own lives and with love triangles, and how they work to resolve them. They are very relatable characters, people who are still unsure of themselves and are discovering who they are as a person through relationships. They also do school related things, such as preparing for that entrance exam, texting with each other, and visiting the shrine for comfort. Most of the characters grow throughout the anime, as they begin to mature and realize what makes a good relationship, as well as dealing with rejection. The anime shows how characters respond to different events that happen, positively or negatively. There were clichés such as the camera girl, but these clichés did not really hurt the characters in any way. Overall, the character development was one of the strong points in this anime, and the characters created are very relatable.Symbols:Even though this is not really an evaluation point, the symbols in this anime really bring out its flair and what makes it interesting. One big symbol was when Eita and Soma played one on one baseball whenever they needed confidence or support. These symbols enhances the storyline and characters a lot. It helps you think about how each of these characters are facing life at the moment, as well as in their future. Symbols are definitely one of the more important parts to this anime.Enjoyment: 9/10This anime really left me wanting more after every episode, to see what would happen to each relationship or how one character would react another. There were a lot of parts that “sunk my ships” but then right after the episode, it made me reconsider my thoughts. As I mentioned above, symbols was a very big part of the anime for me. These symbols really put more meaning in to the anime, and connected the life in the show to the life we live in the real world.Overall: 8.2/10This anime will definitely be worth your time watching.

I felt the same drama-energy as that of OreGairu (adding the fact that Nagi Yanagi sang the opening). I did not feel that it would be something exceptional, but it was enough to satisfy my craving for drama. What I liked the most is the pacing of the story, it felt like a slow burn story. It did not rush to conflicts, it walked on its own pace.In terms of the animation, it was mostly rough and awkward movements (especially the running). The...fast movements were blurry animations.

I often saw or heard people thinking this was a romcom (WRONG DUDES; it definitely is not).This anime wasn't one aimed at making you laugh, neither was it aimed at creating a synthetic environment  in which everyone could find an escape to reality. The story is centered around high schoolers facing that last step which many animes seem to depict as a light event in our lives. We surely one day had (or would have) to part ways with our friends...and school. That moment is always a sad one be it for the ones leaving or the juniors staying. As a junior you surely have many things you still want to share with your seniors (maybe confess your love to your senior) or you just thought that those wonderful days were everlasting. As a senior, you have to leave behind memories (both sad and good), an environment which was part of the whole (you), maybe a club (and dreams with the club); you also have to think of and work towards your future. There's maybe a crush you want to be with for the rest of your life and thus have to think about the distance between you due to your respective choices to a good future.This was one of the rare animes in I was totally rooting for all the female characters (heroines if you want).If you want to feel what you felt when you left a place together with people really important to you and not just have the writer create synthetic environment where you could have felt better then just watch this.Story:10Characters:10Characters are lovable and definitely a 10 for them. and school.

It took me longer than i'd like to admit to finish 12 20 minutes episodes..It's super boring, where animation is okay only at certain moments and it's mostly horrible ( i really don't understand why would they animate characters running / walking from behind when it's so badly done. It gives 1980s vibe ).Main characters are horrible, super bland. Only one thing is in their mind for 12 episodes and there's no development whatsoever. Supporting characters are better, with much more development than main ones. You'll probably enjoy side stories more than the main...story because it's super boring just because characters are one dimensional.Nothing much to say about this one, better skip it or watch grass grow....3/10 story because it's super boring just because characters are one dimensional.Nothing much to say about this one, better skip it or watch grass grow....3/10"", 'The ending was too abrupt, there was no development shown towards the final episode!The female lead makes no effort at all to approach the male protagonist. Just because she is the female lead then clichely she has to be the winner? Such a plot is too predictable.Initially, the male protagonist was only a second choice for the female lead. Only with the woman being aware of her feelings at the end of the story, suddenly she becomes the winner. Yeah, just because he finally realized his feelings, then she won. Unfortunately, there is very little development of deep romance between the two throughout the story.Overall,...the character development and relationships between characters in this anime are not strong enough so that the final impression of the story feels forced and unnatural. More nuance and precision in script writing is needed so that the romance story is more real and touching.Again! JUST BECAUSE the girl is aware of her affection for the MC the story ends LOL the character development and relationships between characters in this anime are not strong enough so that the final impression of the story feels forced and unnatural.

It might be short but it doesn't have to be longer even though I wish it was.I'd say this is what a Slice of Life/Drama/Romance series should be like. There are interested characters and you'll want to root for every main characters happiness. I can see why people have different opinions about it, but from my perspective it's really a masterpiece. "", ""I watched Just Because. Here are my thoughts:Overall this anime has an unmistakably amateurish and low-budget feel to it. Despite its flaws though, this story plucks at my heartstrings. In a lot of ways, Just Because is a fairly standard-fare highschool romance story. However, I found that the character dynamics and interactions feel very real. The story genuinely feels like something that could happen in real life. The writing is very down to earth and involves ordinary people and ordinary events. It feels very organic and wholesome. The story in this feels like soil between my fingers – it is so authentic, lifelike and down...to earth. I found Just Because very immersive because it felt like a genuine depiction of real life. This is not something that can be said for most anime, romance in particular.I had this show on my mind a lot. Long after each episode ended it would still be creeping into my mind. Despite it being a slow-paced show with mundane events, I finished it in under 5 days (very rare for me, particularly for a 'low-intensity' anime like this). I always eagerly looked forward to watching the next episode and did not want to watch anything else until I had completed this anime; I was quite captivated by it.This anime has a unique atmosphere to it. It is consistently very calm and soothing – almost hypnotic. Despite there being interpersonal conflict, nobody ever really yells or fights, or even interrupts. Most characters' emotions are conveyed gracefully. The dialogue is nearly always slow and calm. This might sound like a trivial observation, but these qualities are relatively rare for anime. It's also worth noting there is basically zero comedic relief in this, which in ~90% of cases is a good thing for anime, in my opinion.Although I've praised aspects of the writing above, one of my main criticisms of this show is that the characters are fairly bland, especially the MC(Izumi). Pretty much the entire cast is bland and underdeveloped, with the possible exception of Komiya. I'm not sure this could have been avoided given the size of the cast and the 12-episode runtime, but it is a weak aspect in any case. Of all the characters, I empathized with Komiya by far the most. Another criticism I have is that the plot does seem to rely excessively on coincidences to make things work. Maybe that is an intentional artistic decision though (recall the title of this show).I don't particularly like the character designs. A lot of characters have these overly blocky square faces; feels like this is a romance in Legoland. In general the visuals are lackluster and unpolished. I found the character animation very lacking overall as well – even with the simplistic character designs it still often looks sloppy. Very often. In fact the character animation is often embarrassingly poor. However, sometimes the urban landscape does look nice (so many trains, yay!). As a whole, this anime looks very low budget and sloppy. The character animation in particular is often dreadful; I am usually quite forgiving about this kind of thing but it was bad enough to break my immersion sometimes.I didn't like the voice acting for the male MC; it was very dull and unemotive. On the other hand, Komiya's VA does a good job. The OST seemed alright, although admittedly I didn't pay much attention to it; this is a pretty dialogue-heavy show. I do recall there being some okay piano songs. Also, the music consistently fits the calm soothing atmosphere I mentioned earlier; I recall there being few (if any) uptempo tracks.I should probably mention this: despite having a significant romance component, this show has zero sexualized fanservice. Although I typically don't really care either way, I know that some people might find that a desirable feature. This is one of the many ways this is a wholesome show. Despite involving romance there is pretty much zero sexualization, which I think is noteworthy.Between the two main male characters, I found the romance arcs involving Izumi more engaging than those of Souma. This is because the female partners for Izumi were more-interesting better-developed characters, and also because their romantic chemistry was much better. I found Izumi's romance arcs much more emotionally engaging – they have a lot of truly precious moments that made this anime a worthwhile experience.My personal overall rating: 7/10I have really mixed feelings about this anime. As I've said, it is quite amateurish and low budget. The character animation is sometimes awful. The characters themselves are bland and underdeveloped. However, despite these flaws I still found it a very captivating show and couldn't turn it off. The character interactions felt so real to me and the writing is very down to earth and lifelike. There are some really touching moments in this anime; it invoked emotion in me. I liked the consistently smooth graceful calm atmosphere as well.There is also the simple fact that this show avoids two very common pitfalls of romance anime: unfunny poorly timed comedy and intrusive tone-breaking sexualization; simply not making these common unforced errors is praiseworthy.If you like highschool romance then Just Because is worth a try. This anime made me feel strong emotions. I literally sobbed during the last episode; there was one scene in particular that was a gutpunch tearjerker.SPOILER-ISH COMMENT BELOW:I think that Natsume's emotions in general were not demonstrated to the viewer as clearly as they should have been, given the importance of her character. I think I would have empathized with her more if the show did a better job of depicting her feelings.Just for the record, I shipped Komiya x Izumi really hard in this, in case you hadn't guessed already. to earth.

Though it is still a little rough around the edges at times in terms of the animation and some of the voice acting, it still pulls through, with the roughness even adding to its charm in certain ways. Combining subdued yet visceral character performances and a concise, focused story, it makes for an endearing show about relationships, nostalgia and the transition from one stage of life to the next.The primary way Just Because! differentiates itself from many of its peers in how grounded it remains in its...tone and atmosphere. Romance dramas set in high school tend to take an over-the-top, anime-esque approach to their plot and dialogue to keep the viewer engaged. This often relies on the ability of animation to exaggerate its subjects to create this sense of heightened reality where the extreme or unrealistic is believable. But in the back of the viewer\'s mind, there is always this awareness that they are watching something that can never translate anywhere close to real life. Being a part of some ill-defined, wacky afterschool club filled with eccentric personalities or in some absurd situation is a hallmark of most Shounen romances. While these shows can still make for an entertaining watch, there is this missing sense of a visceral connection to the characters or their circumstance. Despite being far more mundane as the story of a group of people who bond together, Just Because! has a strong sense of realism that anchors the audience in its characters and their relationships. It makes for a powerfully down-to-earth show that does not rely on exaggeration to get the viewer to empathise with the characters.As a character-driven story in the truest sense of the phrase, the setting and circumstances the cast find themselves in only serves as a catalyst for them to come out of their shells. Again, Just Because! differentiates itself from most high school dramas by setting itself in the final term before graduation. It is the conclusion of a massive chapter in people\'s lives which creates this atmosphere of bittersweet remembrance since everything is about to change drastically. In fact, it is a wonder that so few stories focus on this period with how pivotal it is and how many themes can be explored. For characters like Soma, it feels like the end of his youth, with him going off to work straight from high school. But even for the rest of the cast going on to university, there is this understanding that higher education will not be the same, both for good and bad. And with all periods of significant change, there is this palpable anxiety throughout the show. Whether it is due to uncertainty in Natsume\'s case because she still needs to sit for her entrance exams or because it is their final chance to do something before the chapter closes. The atmosphere created by this setting grounds everything and ties it all together into this mellow story of closing out their adolescence and moving on to becoming young adults.The arrival of Izumi is what brings our cast together and delves into the themes the show is trying to explore. Prior to his arrival, everyone was more or less in their own bubble, attempting to cope with the impending change on their own. It gives the initial episodes this mellow, almost melancholic tone as the cast steadily grows out of their isolation and forms a bond with each other. Although they have been with their previous friend groups throughout high school, none of them can really understand their situation anymore because of the different paths they have chosen for their post-high school life. Alone, they feel continuously smothered by the impending change. And although they all interacted with each other throughout high school, they never hit it off until Izumi appeared. It is in this element that the show starts to take on its hopeful, optimistic tone with the idea that you can build bonds with people even in the most uncertain times and that it\'s never too late.Izumi\'s return to Kanagawa goes beyond being the inciting incident of the plot and brings up many of the themes. For characters like Natsume and Soma, he is from their past and brings up the nostalgia of the end of schooling, pushing them to tie up loose ends. On the other hand, Izumi is quite literally the future for Komiya since he is a means for her to save the photography club. Although there is some conflict with how all their personalities, circumstances and dreams for the future intersect, it is never melodramatic and all refreshingly subtle. There is this realistic level of subtext and even passive-aggression when the characters push against each other during conversations instead of the usual ""subtext is for cowards"" approach that makes a lot of anime so hamfisted and unbelievable. Even the character with the most forthcoming personality, Soma, does not simply bluster through everything and shows a great deal of self-doubt and anxiety before he can finally push himself to be direct. It succeeds in balancing the melancholy and uncertainty of high school ending with this optimism of starting a new chapter in their lives and finding a way to maintain their current relationships.Still, the worries and difficulties of the cast are always presented in proportion to what they really are. Being rejected by someone, never reconnecting with a friend, or having one\'s club shut down are painful moments, but the characters nor the framing of the show ever portray them to be soul-crushing end-of-the-world moments. Even the challenges of maintaining a long-distance relationship or moving away from family, prime conflict fodder for many shows, are not melodramatised in a bid to create a cheap flash point. The cast all have their worries, but being true to life, it is something they try to manage instead of it instantly or cheaply boiling over into a big row for entertainment. While there are some minor red hearings regarding potential love triangles within the group, they never become obstructive and are quickly dropped. Instead, it is played off more as fondness, with the cast establishing a convincing chemistry from there. Most of the show is appropriately light-hearted but never goes overboard to become saccharine like some other slice-of-life shows. Even with the subdued cast, there is still that spark of eccentricity and energy through Komiya\'s performance, which balances things out and gives the audience something more anime-esque in tone.As mentioned, some rougher elements in voice acting and animation exist. At times the tone and line delivery can feel just slightly off with it forgoing the usual anime exaggerations but not quite being something you would hear in real life. But perhaps this can be explained by the relative inexperience of the cast, with it being the first major role for many of them aside from Lynn and Murata Taishi. While the cast\'s collective performance is still good overall, it is perhaps no surprise that Komiya and Souma tend to steal the show, both because of their more lively personalities and their voice actors having the most experience. But as a debut performance for Izumi and Natsume\'s voice actors, Ichikawa Aoi and Isobe Karin, it is definitely impressive, with the subtler expressiveness coming through.The cinematography is still excellent, lingering on characters\' expressions to drive home their feelings without the need for dialogue. The use of text messages and how they appear on screen is also one of the better instances in anime. Instead of sticking out, it feels like a fully integrated part of the visual narrative. And it adds to that sense of realism with how accurately they capture chatting on LINE with the many stickers they animated. It also creates a strong visual juxtaposition between the character\'s usually subdued expressions and the highly emotive stickers. It feels exceptionally true to life with how people can send these while looking completely deadpan. However, some of the backgrounds and more niche animations have suffered. While the smudged oil painting style backgrounds are a distinct stylistic choice, they are sometimes too dominating, with only the characters being sharply defined in the scene. It gives the feeling that everything is in an out-of-focus blur and draws unnecessary attention to itself. And though brief, the animations of trumpet playing also lack synchronisation with the music they are playing and come off as incredibly stiff. There are other minor instances, like the poor compositing of the CGI Shonan Monorail, but all these are forgivable since this is one of studio PINE JAM\'s earliest productions. While the animation quality still cannot match the industry leaders and could use some additional polish, it is more than adequate.Overall, Just Because! is an excellent drama that feels far truer to life than most other anime ever come close to. A solid 8 out of 10 for anyone looking for a more grounded drama that deals with themes and problems far closer to home. It is easy to believe that the characters are just as real as any classmate you might have had in school. And while it does not break new ground, it is a solid performance that covers its theme of the end of adolescence excellently. With so many other anime content to be set in high school but never deal with its conclusion, it is hard not to see the uniqueness in Just Because! tone and atmosphere.

Everything that I write here would be everything I feel about the story. We have our mc that like the main heroine,the main heroine like mc best friend,mc best friend like another girl. Easy love triangle tropes that used a lot,but depending on how it used,it could be good,or just no good at all. This show? No good. The story try to make it looks like a beautiful romance drama between a highschool student,but it is...nothing like that. It\'s nothing new. The main problem here is the main heroine,mio. She\'s basically has no charm at all other than her look. If you tell me she has a good character development or something,man.... There\'s something wrong with you. First,she like mc friend,and it\'s so obvious to mc. After mc best friend decide to confess,she\'s trying to give a lame exscuse to comfort herself. When mc concerned about her,she bash at mc. She keep being selfish,and try to be friendly with mc when she didn\'t even know his feeling. And then what? She moving on from her feeling toward her old crush,and suddenly move to mc. Yeah2,that ""the true one that I love is actually...."" thing. But let me tell you,she moved on too fast. She keep misunderstood mc,and being selfish.""without knowing people feeling....."" she said this about mc at some point in the story...CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? She\'s the one that cluesless for the entire show. I amazed at how people could like her..... Now,let\'s talk about the best girl,komiya. Another possible girl for mc,and as you expected,she was created to lose. At first I don\'t like her. She keep talking she want to post mc pic to a competition. Even I wont like that. But after she realise she like the mc,boom,she turned into the  best choice of girl for the mc. She\'s being honest with her feeling,and trying so hard to make her love come true(well any lose heroine in any anime was the same). After ep 10,I can\'t see any way that mc couldn\'t realise that she is the best choice for him. Guess what? Ofc she got rejected. At the end of the show,this cross in my mind,""WAIT,SO THE MAIN HEROINE DID NOTHING FOR MC TO LIKE HER,BUT SHE WIN AT THE END? WHY?"". Yes,basically,mio did nothing to progress her love with her old crush,neither with mc. The only she did is she decided to confess if she pass the exam. THAT\'S ALL. Well,it is common for the main heroine to win. I\'m not really expecting a good ed. This show could be 6/10,if they didn\'t introduced komiya. Then the only choice girl would be mio. At first i would want to give 4,but since this show help me kill some time today,I decided to raise it to 5.ArtNothing special. It is average. Not so beautiful,not so bad either. Though sometime the art looks weird time to time. The animation is so-so,though there\'s some sakuga,it\'s not eally needed.SoundNothing really hit me in the hearth,even the sad ost,just feel so-so to me. OP and ED seems normal to me,but I\'m quite like it.CharacterI have write a bit about the main heroine,mio and side heroine,komiya in the story part,and most of what i want to say is there,so I wont explained any further about those two. Others character seems avarage to me,It is a type of character that you could find anywhere. I\'m quite like mc personality. it reminds me of hachiman and houtaru(though he\'s no good compared to these two).EnjoymentTbh,I\'m not enjoyed it at all,rather make me stress. But it is a good time killer,so I would give it credit for that.OverallNothing special about this show,and I doubt I would recommend this show to any of my friends or even rewatch it. One time is enough. If you have nothing to watch,well,kill time with this. nothing like that. It\'s nothing new. The main problem here is the main heroine,mio. She\'s basically has no charm at all other than her look. If you tell me she has a good character development or something,man.... There\'s something wrong with you. First,she like mc friend,and it\'s so obvious to mc. After mc best friend decide to confess,she\'s trying to give a lame exscuse to comfort herself. When mc concerned about her,she bash at mc. She keep being selfish,and try to be friendly with mc when she didn\'t even know his feeling. And then what? She moving on from her feeling toward her old crush,and suddenly move to mc. Yeah2,that ""the true one that I love is actually...."" thing. But let me tell you,she moved on too fast. She keep misunderstood mc,and being selfish.""without knowing people feeling....."" she said this about mc at some point in the story...CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT? She\'s the one that cluesless for the entire show. I amazed at how people could like her..... Now,let\'s talk about the best girl,komiya. Another possible girl for mc,and as you expected,she was created to lose. At first I don\'t like her. She keep talking she want to post mc pic to a competition. Even I wont like that. But after she realise she like the mc,boom,she turned into the  best choice of girl for the mc. She\'s being honest with her feeling,and trying so hard to make her love come true(well any lose heroine in any anime was the same). After ep 10,I can\'t see any way that mc couldn\'t realise that she is the best choice for him. Guess what? Ofc she got rejected. At the end of the show,this cross in my mind,""WAIT,SO THE MAIN HEROINE DID NOTHING FOR MC TO LIKE HER,BUT SHE WIN AT THE END? WHY?"". Yes,basically,mio did nothing to progress her love with her old crush,neither with mc. The only she did is she decided to confess if she pass the exam. THAT\'S ALL. Well,it is common for the main heroine to win. I\'m not really expecting a good ed. This show could be 6/10,if they didn\'t introduced komiya. Then the only choice girl would be mio. At first i would want to give 4,but since this show help me kill some time today,I decided to raise it to 5.ArtNothing special. It is average. Not so beautiful,not so bad either. Though sometime the art looks weird time to time. The animation is so-so,though there\'s some sakuga,it\'s not eally needed.SoundNothing really hit me in the hearth,even the sad ost,just feel so-so to me. OP and ED seems normal to me,but I\'m quite like it.CharacterI have write a bit about the main heroine,mio and side heroine,komiya in the story part,and most of what i want to say is there,so I wont explained any further about those two. Others character seems avarage to me,It is a type of character that you could find anywhere. I\'m quite like mc personality. it reminds me of hachiman and houtaru(though he\'s no good compared to these two).EnjoymentTbh,I\'m not enjoyed it at all,rather make me stress.

One time is enough. If you have nothing to watch,well,kill time with this.', 'For many years now, the anime genre “romance” has definitely given us a VERY wide frame of shows. It has the extremely perverted harem shows, the cliche action-ecchi show, the very annoying super-natural ""romantic"" shows. This anime however is free from all of the above -it is a slice of life- it is like taking a breath of fresh air after being cooped in a smoking room for 6 hours.Now that I have said all that; please let me make a review as short and informative as possible.The story is extremely slice of lifistic- uh I mean realistic. Everything about it, the characters actions, developments,...even the characters themselves.Speaking of the characters, I am really impressed by how the characters changed so much during the show -of course I am not comparing it to Toradora- it was great.The style of drawing them (the characters) was pretty much mediocore- nothing really special.I really did not like the ending. It reminded me of my previous vow to never watch a slice of life anime-but when my favorite anime turned out to be a slice of life, I decided to give it a shot.The word life rings throughout the whole show, the no kissing part, the typical and NOT over-dramatic characters, and the wrong girl choice. Oh well I can\'t be mad: it is called slice of LIFE, and life is bitter._________________Anime\'s with similartraits________-Kinda wanted to point out how the MC of this show seemed like he was based on Hikigaya Hachiman from OreGairu- even the walk is the same.-The baseball+romance thingy is suspiciously similar to that of Clannad and Clannad after story.-The plot about the MC returning from a journey is cliche enough but it resembled the anime Myself;Yourself VERY much.-That being said let me finish up this mini review.________________Overall____________I am not mean enough to rate this show low, because the ending did not match my desires.Instead I will please myself by rating the enjoyment low.Lastly, if you enjoy horribly realistic scenes please feast your eyes for here is one for you.+++Thanks for reading.

But unfortunately, it falls short of that by a small margin. It has all of the ingredients for a perfect drama but fails to deliver in a lot of aspects. However, for what it's worth, the show was fairly interesting in some parts and the characters were somewhat compelling.To get some of the less important complaints and compliments out of the way, I thought the artstyle looked pretty good. All of the characters were as distinct as their personalities and the scenery looked...all right too. One minor nitpick is Eita's face; there's just something about the nose or the general structure that looks different from all of the other characters and makes him stand out like a sore thumb. I couldn't help but notice it all the time during the show, but it was not that big of a deal. The music, although forgettable, did the job well. Overall, the audiovisuals of the anime were not terrible.The story is where I am a little conflicted. The main character, Eita Izumi, transfers to his old school during the final semester of his senior year and tries to reconnect with his old friends. They build new connections and romances throughout these final months while also planning for college or whatever they want to do after graduation. It is a pretty good premise for a romance, and there is plenty of drama between the characters.However, for as much drama and complicated emotions there are between the characters, none of them are very compelling. Eita Izumi is so boring and monotone to the point of having basically no redeeming qualities other than being nice, Hazuki Morikawa is just too dumb and boring to like, and Mio Natsume does not gather the courage to act on her feelings for a very long time. However, at the very least, some of the bad qualities of each character are called out by others and lead to drama. But I quickly found myself getting attached to the only two characters who speak louder than 4 decibels: Haruto Souma and Ena Komiya.In my opinion, there aren't enough scenes of the friend group doing things together and developing more feelings between the crushes. More of these would have transformed otherwise boring characters into ones that you want to root for, but unfortunately, lacking these leaves some characters uninteresting and generic. It also would have been nice for the final conflict to not have been resolved so easily.Just Because was an enjoyable show where romance conflicts with accepting that you might never see the people around you again after graduating, but it fell short in creating engaging characters and more interesting plotlines. Most of my issues would have been resolved had there been more character development, but the show can still be a good watch if you can ignore those faults. all right too.

But Story wise/plot, its not that moving really. Slow paced plain and simple no extra sauces and spices. The kind that you can watch it all now and tomorrow you'll probably forget all about it, not all but i guess some parts. But, Love the fact that they based it closely to real life events and situations, like high school struggles, puppy love, future plans, more studies and other cutesy stuff, i mean, who can't relate to that? Unless you skipped high school or whatever.I was expecting alot of drama and romance but i didn't get it here, unlike...other heavy romance, drama animes i've watched that literally made a baby out of me (talk about a 32yr old Otaku man) but i guess it is soothing and heart warming to watch these kind of stuff. Made me a little soft, just a little.Art/Animation quality was GORGEOUS! Characters are kawaii (i was referring to the girls)! Plot was well put so it's kinda okay!  The Sound Tracks was soothing kinda made me sleepy though. If you ask me if i would watch it again. Hmmmm.. maybe sometime in the future, if i feel like it.CHF always win! Always! And it only happens in Anime. XD. other heavy romance, drama animes i've watched that literally made a baby out of me (talk about a 32yr old Otaku man) but i guess it is soothing and heart warming to watch these kind of stuff.

I wanted all the episodes to come out so that I can watch it without delays. While waiting I was looking at the reviews and I was hesitant to watch this anime because it had many bad reviews with low scores. Despite of that, I watched it and it was pretty good for a 12 episode anime. It was tiring at some points but at least the last 3-4 episodes were enjoyable. So overall it's not the best but it's not bad!Well the story had some parts...were you had to be really observant to comprehend but the plot twists were pretty good in my opinion. were you had to be really observant to comprehend but the plot twists were pretty good in my opinion."", ""Art:What i like most from Just Because! is of course the art. I like it when an anime has a beautiful and wonderful art. Art is one of three factors beside story and music that will make me stay tune to watch an anime until the end. Just Because's art, for me personally give some kind of warm feeling when i'm watching it, and it's enough for me to enjoy it.Music:When an anime has a beautiful art, it has to be supported by a beautiful music for it to be great. And Just Because has it, the combination between beautiful art and beautiful music will...give you peacefulness. give you peacefulness."", ""This was a really grounded slice of life romance anime.A lot in the genre feel need the need for big theatrics but this anime is abouta group high schoolers in their final year about to head off to university or jobs and the delicate emotions, obstacles and relationships that come with that time.The thing I really enjoyed most about this anime was the fact that the stakes for most characters were very real. Whether it be passing a test, winning a competition or hitting a home run. These felt like kids leading regular lives and trying to live with as little regrets as possible knowing...their high school days will soon be over.The art is nothing amazing but I really enjoyed the character designs and there's a lot of scenes where you know a lot of love and effort was put into it.The music didn't really grab my attention too much but it did it's job decently and set the mood.If you want a nice slice of life romance to fill the void left by the previous one then I would whole heartedly recommend giving Just Because! a go for atleast 3 episodes. their high school days will soon be over.The art is nothing amazing but I really enjoyed the character designs and there's a lot of scenes where you know a lot of love and effort was put into it.The music didn't really grab my attention too much but it did it's job decently and set the mood.If you want a nice slice of life romance to fill the void left by the previous one then I would whole heartedly recommend giving Just Because! a go for atleast 3 episodes."", ""-Just Because-Alright, so since the show is still airing I can't say as much as I would have liked. But from the amount of episodes that have aired so far I have to say this is really good. Though the animation kinda fluctuates in appearance, it is barely noticeable. Also the community on Reddit for this series has to be one of the best I have seen in a while! (I'm TeamNatsume for those Komiya lovers X3) So overall the story is very interesting and gripping while the characters are very relatable.I pretty much recommend it, well mostly those who liked 'Tsuki ga Kirei' because...both shows have the same 'Feel' (Hah I made a pun from the animation studio)  , just different ages in characters. both shows have the same 'Feel' (Hah I made a pun from the animation studio)  , just different ages in characters."", ""Check it out, its worth 1 watch...Just Because conveys its messages through its themes, and symbolism; most of these elements can be parsed from the OP, and as you watch more you will see that it is indeed a reflection of the story. To those with a background in literary analysis, seeing these elements tastefully placed in an anime was satisfying. Ironically these symbols and themes felt like extra baggage that is irrelevant to conveying the story; this problem is most noticeable in the last episode when all manners of contrivance hinder the final key steps to the main romance's closure. This makes me question...the anime as a whole,  and I feel that if I re-watched it that many of the scenes would indeed feel quite tedious. The plot could be compressed to less run time or fleshed out more in the time it was given, leading to an ending which feels very rushed--it happens as the credits roll which to me signals that it was an afterthought like the director saying you don't even really need an ending do you?The main characters are tepid, they have few friends outside of the love Pentagon (as another reviewer coined it), they do help move the plot along but they don't get any development so when they are given screen time you just want them to get away from the camera, and get back to the ACTUAL CAST. The characters don't get intimate with each other and they certainly don't get intimate with you, even the ones who are attracted to one another keep each other at a distance, it is irritating.The music is good, save for Morikawa's trumpet playing, a thematic motif that I find rather boring. I suppose that the art isn't all that great when I compare it to my favorites from the 90's which look a lot more inspired and full of life (Evangelion).Even with its faults this anime deserves at least one watch, but don't bother with a re watch, as I don't think you will find anything new (unless you forgot the whole story in which case go ahead with that re-watch). It tickled my fancy at times,  and there is definitely the impression that it could have tickled my fancy more if the writers and director knew how to keep tickling it at every turn without sounding alarms for clear intervention on the part of the authors. the anime as a whole,  and I feel that if I re-watched it that many of the scenes would indeed feel quite tedious.

The main character Izumi Eita goes back to his hometown for the last semester of high school and reunites with his old friends from middle school, Natsume Mio and Souma Haruto. Now, with graduation approaching and Eita back, they have their last chance to face their unresolved feelings from middle school times.This anime is different from most romance animes as it\'s not upbeat and colorful, but rather realistic, soothing and even melancholic at times. That\'s not to say it\'s boring, the story is thoroughly interesting and is filled with funny, wholesome and emotional scenes. Each scene...is important to the plot somehow and keeps you intrigued about what happens next, which is expected from a short original anime, since there\'s no need for fillers. The main reason for it being so good is the characters and their relationships being so well presented, so you can quickly like and care about each of them. Another thing is the development. As the story progresses, the characters and their relations change a lot, the anime was perfect in this regard. I recommend if you like romance and want something more realistic than most romance animes out there.Spoilers ahead.Now, even after many good things that happened in the anime, many people would say it\'s bad because of its end, since we don\'t get what we want. And it\'s understandable to some extent. The fact Eita ends up with Mio and not Ena is upsetting. Not because Ena is a better character than Mio, but because the romance between Eita and Ena was so much better developed. In hindsight, it was obvious from the start that Eita and Mio would end together, they are the protagonists, clearly above the others. And most of all, Ena was the only one among the main characters who wasn\'t about to graduate, so it makes sense she is ""left out""; and also, maintaining her group and winning the prize felt like a satisfying enough conclusion for her, while Mio didn\'t really have anything like that. But still, the scenes between Ena and Eita were so great, that while I was watching, I thought maybe the author would actually go for it, especially since this anime feels so different from others, maybe we will get some different conclusion for a change. But no, in the end, it was the most obvious conclusion. And to be fair, the romance between Eita and Mio is not bad either, it has many good moments, like in episode 7, when Eita helps her arrive on time for her entrance exam. Or the fact that despite Mio liking another person and indirectly rejecting Eita, she still wants him close and doesn\'t want him with another girl, evidenced when she tries to prevent Ena from dating Eita. She is a cute tsundere. And also, the fact that Eita keeps liking her through all the anime, despite knowing she likes Haruto, having his heart shattered in the ""kankei nai"" scene. It was shown that his love for her was unwavering, and he would always be there for her. When you think about that, Ena never really had a chance, and Eita never showed any signs of having feelings for her. Even though he grew to like her more and more, it never became romantic feelings. Furthermore, yes the ending can be disappoint, but that\'s because we care about the characters and root for something to happen. That can only happen when the characters and the story are good enough for the viewer to be invested in. That proves the storytelling was great, and I don\'t think it\'s right to say the anime is bad just because the end you wanted didn\'t happen.Eita is the reserved protagonist, he is calm, considerate and helps his friends. His personality is akin to the likes of Hachiman and Houtarou, except that he is a bit kinder and friendlier than them. He seems aloof and dull at first, but starts showing more emotions through the anime, especially in his relationship with Ena. It\'s a decent character if you don\'t hate this type, but he doesn\'t stand out as much as Hachiman and Houtarou, maybe because he is too simple, lacking a quirk like the others. But perhaps this is a good thing considering the realistic atmosphere in this anime. Haruto is Eita\'s best friend, his personality is basically the opposite of Eita\'s, he is outgoing, unreserved and a bit obtuse. Except when he is facing the girl he likes, Morikawa Hazuki, then he becomes shy and selfaware, it\'s cute and funny seeing he changing his behaviour when around her. The good thing about him is that he is straightforward and takes the initiative, even being humbler than the others, as shown by the fact he doesn\'t go to university like the others. Hazuki is the girl Haruto is in love with, but who is not interested in love. She is the Yamato Nadeshiko, kind, quiet, beautiful. Hazuki is the perfect girl who anyone would want as their wife, so it\'s understandable Haruto falls for her. Even the fact she has three younger siblings and takes good care of them highlights that she would be a great wife, yes, she is too perfect. She also has great development, learning to care more about herself and becoming more assertive. It seems like Haruto\'s confession was a turning point for her, even though she was not interested in romance. Haruto should be grateful that he only has to wait some years for her, because it would be worth a lot more. The next girl is Komiya Ena. She is not perfect like Hazuki, but her personality will make you fall in love with her. She is cheerful, clumsy and adorable. Her relationship with Eita was the best part of this anime. The contrast of their personalities, the fact she slowly gained his affection, even though he kept her at arm\'s length at first, everything was too perfect. It also has the best progression, it was not predictable like the others. They were just strangers, then slowly becomes friend, until romantic feelings arise. And the fact it seemed such an unlikely couple at first just makes it better, it\'s endearing the fact they grow great chemistry. Here is the only unrealistic thing about this anime: how didn\'t Eita fall in love with Ena? It seems impossible.And finally, Natsume Mio. Different from the other main characters, Mio is not pure and idealized. She has insecurities, can\'t make up her mind and act upon it, has envious moments and you could even argue she is evil sometimes. But that\'s why she is actually a good character, she is real, maybe too real. Mio is the reason for most of the drama in the anime, all the relationship problems are connected to her somehow, so she is an essential character for the story. The problem with Mio is that she is a bit empty compared to other characters, since she doesn\'t really have a passion like the others. Ena has her group and photography, Haruto has baseball, Hazuki has music, Eita has... Mio, and she doesn\'t have much. Even her choice of university was just her imitating her sister. Well, at least here there\'s a development, she changes her choice after deciding she was not going to chase after her sister, and would make her own choice. But the problem is she just chose Eita\'s same university instead. All she had going for her was focusing on studies, but it turned out she was just using it as an excuse to take action. She has some faults, surely, but she is probably the only character who seems real, not idealized and imperfect. If people hate her, maybe they don\'t want a realistic character after all, so they shouldn\'t complain about plain and one-dimensional characters. It\'s understandable to dislike her at some points, like when she tries to hinder Ena, but her actions are understandable, even if they are not correct. I disliked her while I was watching, but after finishing the anime and thinking about it, I see that she was actually a good character. Ena and Eita would still make for a better couple, but Eita and Mio is good as well. It\'s like a clumsy couple of teenagers making mistakes until they finally understand they love each other. And I admire Eita waiting for Mio to solve her feelings for Haruto, and being there for her, even if he was the second option. That shows he truly loved her.The art was fine. It\'s pretty simple, not too colorful and bright, which is pretty suitable for a realistic romance like this. The animation is not what stands out in the anime, but it was good most of the time. There are some moments when the characters\' faces look weird, specifically Eita\'s face, just look at his nose, but it doesn\'t look too bad.The opening ""Over and Over"" is sung by Yanagi Nagi, there\'s nobody better than her for anime openings, the song is great and the lyrics fit with the anime themes, and the visuals are beautiful too. The ending is sung by the female characters\' seiyuus and it\'s always a nice touch when animes do this, since it feels like the characters are singing it. The lyrics were fit as well, considering their hesitation when facing their feelings, especially for Ena, since she avoided getting an answer from Eita all she could. The seiyuus were all great, without exception, which was a surprise, since they are not famous nor have many roles in other animes. Isobe Karin as Mio was remarkable, it was so good to hear her voice and it definitely did a good job in giving life to the character. The OST is excellent, there are many memorable songs, which made for outstanding scenes. Such as, the scene of Eita and Ena meeting in the train station when it plays ""yasashii hito"", or that scene in episode 4 when Mio says to Eita ""kankei nai"", another epic scene that was enhanced by the OST, when ""glass kara afureta mizu wa"" played. is important to the plot somehow and keeps you intrigued about what happens next, which is expected from a short original anime, since there\'s no need for fillers. The main reason for it being so good is the characters and their relationships being so well presented, so you can quickly like and care about each of them. Another thing is the development.

But perhaps this is a good thing considering the realistic atmosphere in this anime. Haruto is Eita\'s best friend, his personality is basically the opposite of Eita\'s, he is outgoing, unreserved and a bit obtuse. Except when he is facing the girl he likes, Morikawa Hazuki, then he becomes shy and selfaware, it\'s cute and funny seeing he changing his behaviour when around her. The good thing about him is that he is straightforward and takes the initiative, even being humbler than the others, as shown by the fact he doesn\'t go to university like the others. Hazuki is the girl Haruto is in love with, but who is not interested in love. She is the Yamato Nadeshiko, kind, quiet, beautiful. Hazuki is the perfect girl who anyone would want as their wife, so it\'s understandable Haruto falls for her. Even the fact she has three younger siblings and takes good care of them highlights that she would be a great wife, yes, she is too perfect. She also has great development, learning to care more about herself and becoming more assertive. It seems like Haruto\'s confession was a turning point for her, even though she was not interested in romance. Haruto should be grateful that he only has to wait some years for her, because it would be worth a lot more. The next girl is Komiya Ena. She is not perfect like Hazuki, but her personality will make you fall in love with her. She is cheerful, clumsy and adorable. Her relationship with Eita was the best part of this anime. The contrast of their personalities, the fact she slowly gained his affection, even though he kept her at arm\'s length at first, everything was too perfect. It also has the best progression, it was not predictable like the others. They were just strangers, then slowly becomes friend, until romantic feelings arise. And the fact it seemed such an unlikely couple at first just makes it better, it\'s endearing the fact they grow great chemistry. Here is the only unrealistic thing about this anime: how didn\'t Eita fall in love with Ena? It seems impossible.And finally, Natsume Mio. Different from the other main characters, Mio is not pure and idealized. She has insecurities, can\'t make up her mind and act upon it, has envious moments and you could even argue she is evil sometimes. But that\'s why she is actually a good character, she is real, maybe too real. Mio is the reason for most of the drama in the anime, all the relationship problems are connected to her somehow, so she is an essential character for the story. The problem with Mio is that she is a bit empty compared to other characters, since she doesn\'t really have a passion like the others. Ena has her group and photography, Haruto has baseball, Hazuki has music, Eita has... Mio, and she doesn\'t have much. Even her choice of university was just her imitating her sister. Well, at least here there\'s a development, she changes her choice after deciding she was not going to chase after her sister, and would make her own choice. But the problem is she just chose Eita\'s same university instead. All she had going for her was focusing on studies, but it turned out she was just using it as an excuse to take action. She has some faults, surely, but she is probably the only character who seems real, not idealized and imperfect. If people hate her, maybe they don\'t want a realistic character after all, so they shouldn\'t complain about plain and one-dimensional characters. It\'s understandable to dislike her at some points, like when she tries to hinder Ena, but her actions are understandable, even if they are not correct. I disliked her while I was watching, but after finishing the anime and thinking about it, I see that she was actually a good character. Ena and Eita would still make for a better couple, but Eita and Mio is good as well. It\'s like a clumsy couple of teenagers making mistakes until they finally understand they love each other. And I admire Eita waiting for Mio to solve her feelings for Haruto, and being there for her, even if he was the second option. That shows he truly loved her.The art was fine. It\'s pretty simple, not too colorful and bright, which is pretty suitable for a realistic romance like this. The animation is not what stands out in the anime, but it was good most of the time. There are some moments when the characters\' faces look weird, specifically Eita\'s face, just look at his nose, but it doesn\'t look too bad.The opening ""Over and Over"" is sung by Yanagi Nagi, there\'s nobody better than her for anime openings, the song is great and the lyrics fit with the anime themes, and the visuals are beautiful too. The ending is sung by the female characters\' seiyuus and it\'s always a nice touch when animes do this, since it feels like the characters are singing it. The lyrics were fit as well, considering their hesitation when facing their feelings, especially for Ena, since she avoided getting an answer from Eita all she could. The seiyuus were all great, without exception, which was a surprise, since they are not famous nor have many roles in other animes. Isobe Karin as Mio was remarkable, it was so good to hear her voice and it definitely did a good job in giving life to the character. The OST is excellent, there are many memorable songs, which made for outstanding scenes. Such as, the scene of Eita and Ena meeting in the train station when it plays ""yasashii hito"", or that scene in episode 4 when Mio says to Eita ""kankei nai"", another epic scene that was enhanced by the OST, when ""glass kara afureta mizu wa"" played.', 'Just by the premise I could tell that this wouldn’t be a masterpiece for me, but it actually wasn’t all that disappointing. Complicated love relationships as the main theme are inherently unstable, as not only are they unrealistic in real life, but they often lead to over-dramatification that is obviously meant to target a specific demographic of viewers. However, I would say it was done as well as it could have here.As expected with a show of this premise, the romance between characters not involving the main protagonist tends to be underplayed and resolved quicker, as is the case with Haruto and Hazuki, but...they’re never left behind in the dust. Instead, the spotlight is on them for the beginning, while it shifts over to Eita later on for the climax. Rather than overlooking Haruto and Hazuki, it feels like a deliberate choice rather than a mistake, which I appreciate.Ena was also well done here. Avoiding the typical stereotypes of a fifth wheel as is often the case in groups of friends like this, Ena has clearly defined character traits, and somewhat contrasts with Eita’s rather mellow mood. At times she is contradictory, such as saying that she will support Eita and his relationship, but then becoming the biggest obstacle to letting their romance blossom. However, her being able to be so open to Eita about her feelings is a refresher considering how awkward everyone else is about their love.Then there’s the unbelievable amount of coincidences. Everything from the group’s initial founding (Eita and Mio happened to reunite at the same place that Haruto confesses to Hazuki) to the whole ordeal with the entrance exams (everyone in the group knew about either Eita or Mio’s secret decision, but no one knew about both of them) happened by chance, making the whole show seem detached from real life. The entrance exam especially was painful, with it stretching for two episodes longer than it should have just to drive the point home that Eita and Mio secretly like each other but can’t say it outright. But in spite of that, I decided to look at all of these coincidences as a single mistake, rather than deducting points for each one, since realism isn’t necessary for a romance drama like this and the whole show is built on chance happenings anyways.What I would consider a more serious issue is the shallowness of the love involved. What I mean by that is that characters seem to fall in love for the most mundane reasons, and although I know that school crushes often work like that in real life, Mio’s sudden change of interest from Haruto (who she only liked because he picked up an eraser for her) to Eita feels a bit… rushed. I’m not doubting that feelings could arise even for those in their last semester of high school, but there just isn’t enough screen time with all of them to make it feel genuine. Even at the end, I looked at the group more as friends, which is an achievement in itself, due to the times they spent hanging out together.Yet, despite all of these weaknesses, I can’t argue that Just Because didn’t accomplish what it set out to do. Sure, it seems a bit unrealistic and the romances too sudden, but it could also be argued that that was the effect it was trying to achieve. All of the main characters had some merit in them existing, so that the show wouldn’t be the same if one of them was gone. And if you’re into this type of romance, I’m sure you would enjoy this.Also, as a final note, the music here is great. Honestly, I think it has one of the best osts tied with nagi asu. they’re never left behind in the dust.

Spoilers ahead!)Like a couple of the characters in Just Because!, I too went through the grueling process of test taking in the hopes of earning high scores and favorable university-related invitations. They went to cram school, so they have a one-up on me in terms of drive, but, as someone who empathizes with their position, I don’t envy them one bit.As for the tale told around them and their close friends, the results may just barely pass the mark.STORYFiction sometimes depicts fantastical lands and strange creatures. Other times, it will take a typical setting, twist it...slightly, and produce a new take on a familiar concept. But then there are those stories which simply mirror real life in a straightforward way, following the small struggles and everyday events which push most people.Just Because! takes to heart that last category and never lets go. As the plot focuses on a handful of adult-bound teenagers who must deal with prospects and relationships, the anime revels in its mundanity. No bombastic dialogue. No ultra-exciting happenings. Only believable moments that beget a sense of realism which most people either relate with or otherwise understand firsthand.This approach can be a double-edged sword of sorts, for a plot of this nature can tread into dull territory if mistreated. Especially so in this instance when the school setting argues against it for lack of originality (despite being an original project in origin). The drama must therefore have an allure which elevates it to a worthwhile spot so that it may engage the audience with its content.Thankfully, this show discovers that allure. Very grounded and very personable scenes form a quiet direction whose sincerity supersedes any perceived dullness. Rekindling a friendship between two people who had grown apart in recent years. Visiting an aquarium as a group. Playing a poignant trumpet out by the river for all to hear. Quizzing someone on the train to calm their nerves. Getting someone a foodstuff from the nearby convenience store. On paper, these scenes appear mediocre at best, but, in practice within Just Because!, they highlight the anime and its ability to capture those mundane yet believable moments.A breakdown of the narrative, though, starts to unveil cracks in its makeup. Certain story beats – such as self-promises not being kept or wagers causing the same result regardless of their existence – do not matter as much as preordained. A grander theme fails to weave in-between those nice moments, too.It can get worse when Just Because! invites those two frustrating neighbors from down the bloc just past Romantic Avenue: Ms. Communication and Ms. Understanding. Their involvement prevents some delicious payoff throughout the entire season, and their combined might can even cause plain silliness when, for example, an obviously intelligent student not only amuses a “friend” where feelings are already known but also somehow cannot change the background of his own phone to avoid obvious confusion.Now, yes, these neighbors drive the plot and allow the necessary conflict to arise. However, for a story so presumably proud of its realistic portrayal, their arrival often replaces dramatic weight with induced eye-rolling. Thankfully, they aren’t so obnoxious that they outright ruin the show, for the consistent, deliberate events eke out at least a slight victory.ART & ANIMATIONJust Because! has a small debate which surrounds its visual acumen.Not in question: the atmosphere. A strong sense for lighting sets the mood quite well as somber thoughts and the unknown future cloud not only the wintery air but also the characters which carry this tone with them.As for the background art, it dazzles amidst this cloudiness thanks to the constant establishing shots and realistic detail given to the many areas visited. Often, the audience feels as though they are there at the school, the surrounding city, and even within the homes of the characters as the show goes super out of its way to create a space alive with opportunity.The debate comes with the animation quality. On the one hand, its looseness leads to expressiveness, allowing for a larger spread of actions and reactions. On the other hand, it can get (very) rough on occasion and therefore not exactly pretty to look at, especially in contrast to the rest of the artistry.But it goes back to the realistic approach which Just Because! champions. How this expressive, rougher style coincides with the anime’s overall direction. Better yet, it lends itself to higher emotion and stronger purpose in the scenes depicted. If nothing else, it can be nice to see some risk now and again, and such is the case with this interesting decision here.Tougher to defend is the CG usage, but it’s infrequent enough that it doesn’t impede the show too much. And, while the color palate for the character designs may be too washed out, that aesthetic follows the grayer mood of the story. Plus, the simplistic looks of Eita and the others ensure that the realism levels remain right where they need to be.And this anime deserves a special shout-out for its phone and texting display. Letting the speech bubbles and stacking exchanges pop up near the characters as opposed to always focusing in on their phones was a neat choice. It gave Just Because! more chances to let the quietness and the normalcy of the visuals breathe, and so the debate deescalates again.CHARACTERSJust as the story hugs docility, the cast members within Just Because! contribute to that same feeling. Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki do not necessarily pounce with fervor but instead contend with their personal predicaments in a subtle, reserved manner.Take Eita. Having been away for a while due to his father’s work, he must reacclimate himself with this familiar-yet-distant environment. Not just the area itself but the people too. Haruto, his once best friend. Mio, the girl he has always had a crush on. While he and they know each other, it isn’t until now that he puts in the effort to really know them on a deeper level.That doesn’t mean he overwhelms them with information or digs into their psyches. Rather, Just Because! follows their small conversations, their everyday interactions which create between them those lasting relationships which talking and understanding could only achieve. Be it running into Haruto out on the streets and asking questions about each other or apologizing to Mio (and her in turn as well to him) after the two took part in a small spat, these interpersonal moments allow them and their connections to grow.It can also be seen in the other relationships. Hazuki and Mio chat together at a quaint café or in a secluded spot of the school as they discuss feelings and futures. Haruto and Hazuki have an aside all to themselves on the local baseball field. Mio confronts Haruto about her own thoughts (with eraser in tow). And they all meetup to have a warm, hearty meal to combat the cold weather, taking comfort in the friendships they currently share.All the while, as these interpersonal problems play out, they face their individual issues with that same sense of subtlety. Eita chooses to ignore the flow, not letting the leisure of life keep him sedated. Mio stops making excuses and realizes that hard work can pay off. Haruto picks up tons of courage, fights his fears, accepts compromise, and promises to do what he can. And Hazuki begins to think less about what others want and, through makeovers and introspection, starts to think about what she needs as well.Altogether, Just Because! creates in these characters a theme of agency for them to embrace. It doesn’t always manifest in quite the same manner between the lot, but that docile drive to forge their own path rings true. Given the premise, how they are becoming adults very soon and must therefore grasp such independence, this theme gives the anime strength of writing throughout most of the season.The odd one out, then, is Ena, for she already has that agency. An outsider to this group, and, indeed, only really ever interacting with Eita, she’s a go-getter through and through. Her ideas, her photography, her emotions, her words. Ena may be difficult to handle at times, but her self-understanding arguably puts her above the rest when it comes to reaching adulthood.Which is why her outcome in the love triangle ends up as one of the most intriguing parts of her arc and the anime at large. The denial comes off as a semi-surprising decision but a realistic one at that. Even better, it juxtaposes with the others in the cast. That having that agency and going for it all does not always equate to success and to happiness.Perhaps it goes against the spirit of Just Because!: because everyone else lives happily ever after (more or less). But loss is yet another means of growing up. With a story centered on characters experiencing precisely this transitional phase, this sad outcome fits right alongside the strong character writing present in Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki’s own arcs.MUSIC & SOUNDUnfortunately, this anime hits a few walls regarding the audio elements it includes.Within the OP, titled “over and over”, the piano flourishes and parts of the vocals get at that poignant feeling which Just Because! adheres to. Yet the fast pace contradicts the flow of the show, other parts of the vocals sound flat, and whatever energy it tries to go for gets lost along the way in its straightforward presentation.“behind”, the ED, fights back against its title by moving ahead of its OP counterpart. A mid-tempo pace and a slew of ambient effects give this at-times gentle, at-times empowering song a solid foundation. The harmonized vocals, the return of that piano, and the orchestral edge push it further ahead as well.The original soundtrack has both its positives and its negatives. While it can have a couple of nice melodic tunes, some of its more slice-of-life offerings are way too all-over-the-place, making for an unfitting listen that clashes with the subdued vibe of the show.A couple of the voice-acting performances attempt a save even if nobody exactly knocks it out of the park. Taishi Murata as Haruto brings forth enthusiasm and gleeful responses. And Lynn (her full name given on database sites) as Ena overbears others with her loud, persistent speaking but can also lay bare her softer, emotional side.Aoi Ichikawa as Eita may not have had the most skilled or impressive performance, but, given that it was his first ever role in the medium – and the main lead at that – he deserves a little leeway as he sharpens his craft in future projects.In total, they do not completely falter, but the audio elements within Just Because! at least seem to be some of its weaker facets.ENJOYMENTIt probably comes as no surprise that I’m a big fan of these mature dramas. “Mature” defined here as “focusing on a believable cast with a realistic backdrop and grounded conflicts.” I’m all for stories with lots of action, a comedy side, or a fantasy angle. But I also gravitate towards these intriguing replications of the human condition.For this reason, I liked this anime despite some of my grievances. While not a “slow burn” per se, watching the events play out in such a calm, normal manner was not only a nice change of pace but also a mellow experience. It would be fair to say that this tale roots itself too much in non-excitement since almost no parts of it truly stick out as memorable, but its consistency and care within the narrative are positives to me.On the characters themselves, some were favorable and a few not so much. Haruto was a good dude, and I admired his attitude when dealing with his situations. Mio didn’t do a whole lot in the anime, but she was cute and likable nonetheless. And Yoriko, the runner girl, was a nice person to have around, too, if only for her wing-girl helpfulness.I didn’t much care for Eita, though, for I found him devoid of any interesting motifs. I wanted to like Hazuki more, but she didn’t have the presence or the impact to get me fully on her side. Indeed, her slight aloofness made me sad to see.Most of my dislike, though, comes from Ena and her wedging herself into the situation. I know that that’s her personality, and it’s only fair that she has a shot at love like the rest of them. However, she got on my nerves more and more as the season progressed because she just wouldn’t let up and pushed things in a semi-selfish manner.However, credit where credit is due on the show’s part: The last episode had me antsy, agitated with how long it was prolonging its final reveals. It knew what it was doing, and it did it well, for I shouted at the screen at least once, pleading with the anime to “get on with it already” (or another such similar phrase). So, kudos to the show for having me invested in its proceedings.Doubly so for giving me the ending I was personally rooting for. I will say, though, that I would have preferred greater justification for the winner since their romantic relationship isn’t the most electrifying. The idea is that their future together now will expand on their love for each other, but this story didn’t heavily involve such a throughput, and we the audience will (presumably) not be getting to see it unfold anyway.Either way, as the title implies, a two-word phrase is sometimes the only retort required.Just Because! holds a lot of ambition and capitalizes on a few of its ideas. A realistic premise, strong artistry, and a meaningful thread for its characters battle against plot problems, sufferings in the musicality, and some missing excitement. But, if it were to earn a grade, it still passes.SUMMARYStory: Fine, reveling in mundanity, this believable tale about a bunch of soon-to-be adults finds strength in its quiet setups but invites frustration with its romantic storybeatsArt & Animation: Good, an overcast mood, detailed establishing shots, a rough-yet-expressive style of movement, simple designs, and neat displaying for the texting achieve a big thumbs-upCharacters: Good, Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki enlist subtlety and embrace agency, and Ena juxtaposes them for added benefitMusic & Sound: Fine, a weak OP, a gently empowering ED, a subpar OST, and a set of passable VA performances leave the audio as a tossupEnjoyment: Fine, a likable, mature drama with half the cast lacking appealFinal Score: 6/10 slightly, and produce a new take on a familiar concept.

A strong sense for lighting sets the mood quite well as somber thoughts and the unknown future cloud not only the wintery air but also the characters which carry this tone with them.As for the background art, it dazzles amidst this cloudiness thanks to the constant establishing shots and realistic detail given to the many areas visited. Often, the audience feels as though they are there at the school, the surrounding city, and even within the homes of the characters as the show goes super out of its way to create a space alive with opportunity.The debate comes with the animation quality. On the one hand, its looseness leads to expressiveness, allowing for a larger spread of actions and reactions. On the other hand, it can get (very) rough on occasion and therefore not exactly pretty to look at, especially in contrast to the rest of the artistry.But it goes back to the realistic approach which Just Because! champions. How this expressive, rougher style coincides with the anime’s overall direction. Better yet, it lends itself to higher emotion and stronger purpose in the scenes depicted. If nothing else, it can be nice to see some risk now and again, and such is the case with this interesting decision here.Tougher to defend is the CG usage, but it’s infrequent enough that it doesn’t impede the show too much. And, while the color palate for the character designs may be too washed out, that aesthetic follows the grayer mood of the story. Plus, the simplistic looks of Eita and the others ensure that the realism levels remain right where they need to be.And this anime deserves a special shout-out for its phone and texting display. Letting the speech bubbles and stacking exchanges pop up near the characters as opposed to always focusing in on their phones was a neat choice. It gave Just Because! more chances to let the quietness and the normalcy of the visuals breathe, and so the debate deescalates again.CHARACTERSJust as the story hugs docility, the cast members within Just Because! contribute to that same feeling. Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki do not necessarily pounce with fervor but instead contend with their personal predicaments in a subtle, reserved manner.Take Eita. Having been away for a while due to his father’s work, he must reacclimate himself with this familiar-yet-distant environment. Not just the area itself but the people too. Haruto, his once best friend. Mio, the girl he has always had a crush on. While he and they know each other, it isn’t until now that he puts in the effort to really know them on a deeper level.That doesn’t mean he overwhelms them with information or digs into their psyches. Rather, Just Because! follows their small conversations, their everyday interactions which create between them those lasting relationships which talking and understanding could only achieve. Be it running into Haruto out on the streets and asking questions about each other or apologizing to Mio (and her in turn as well to him) after the two took part in a small spat, these interpersonal moments allow them and their connections to grow.It can also be seen in the other relationships. Hazuki and Mio chat together at a quaint café or in a secluded spot of the school as they discuss feelings and futures. Haruto and Hazuki have an aside all to themselves on the local baseball field. Mio confronts Haruto about her own thoughts (with eraser in tow). And they all meetup to have a warm, hearty meal to combat the cold weather, taking comfort in the friendships they currently share.All the while, as these interpersonal problems play out, they face their individual issues with that same sense of subtlety. Eita chooses to ignore the flow, not letting the leisure of life keep him sedated. Mio stops making excuses and realizes that hard work can pay off. Haruto picks up tons of courage, fights his fears, accepts compromise, and promises to do what he can. And Hazuki begins to think less about what others want and, through makeovers and introspection, starts to think about what she needs as well.Altogether, Just Because! creates in these characters a theme of agency for them to embrace. It doesn’t always manifest in quite the same manner between the lot, but that docile drive to forge their own path rings true. Given the premise, how they are becoming adults very soon and must therefore grasp such independence, this theme gives the anime strength of writing throughout most of the season.The odd one out, then, is Ena, for she already has that agency. An outsider to this group, and, indeed, only really ever interacting with Eita, she’s a go-getter through and through. Her ideas, her photography, her emotions, her words. Ena may be difficult to handle at times, but her self-understanding arguably puts her above the rest when it comes to reaching adulthood.Which is why her outcome in the love triangle ends up as one of the most intriguing parts of her arc and the anime at large. The denial comes off as a semi-surprising decision but a realistic one at that. Even better, it juxtaposes with the others in the cast. That having that agency and going for it all does not always equate to success and to happiness.Perhaps it goes against the spirit of Just Because!: because everyone else lives happily ever after (more or less). But loss is yet another means of growing up. With a story centered on characters experiencing precisely this transitional phase, this sad outcome fits right alongside the strong character writing present in Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki’s own arcs.MUSIC & SOUNDUnfortunately, this anime hits a few walls regarding the audio elements it includes.Within the OP, titled “over and over”, the piano flourishes and parts of the vocals get at that poignant feeling which Just Because! adheres to. Yet the fast pace contradicts the flow of the show, other parts of the vocals sound flat, and whatever energy it tries to go for gets lost along the way in its straightforward presentation.“behind”, the ED, fights back against its title by moving ahead of its OP counterpart. A mid-tempo pace and a slew of ambient effects give this at-times gentle, at-times empowering song a solid foundation. The harmonized vocals, the return of that piano, and the orchestral edge push it further ahead as well.The original soundtrack has both its positives and its negatives. While it can have a couple of nice melodic tunes, some of its more slice-of-life offerings are way too all-over-the-place, making for an unfitting listen that clashes with the subdued vibe of the show.A couple of the voice-acting performances attempt a save even if nobody exactly knocks it out of the park. Taishi Murata as Haruto brings forth enthusiasm and gleeful responses. And Lynn (her full name given on database sites) as Ena overbears others with her loud, persistent speaking but can also lay bare her softer, emotional side.Aoi Ichikawa as Eita may not have had the most skilled or impressive performance, but, given that it was his first ever role in the medium – and the main lead at that – he deserves a little leeway as he sharpens his craft in future projects.In total, they do not completely falter, but the audio elements within Just Because! at least seem to be some of its weaker facets.ENJOYMENTIt probably comes as no surprise that I’m a big fan of these mature dramas. “Mature” defined here as “focusing on a believable cast with a realistic backdrop and grounded conflicts.” I’m all for stories with lots of action, a comedy side, or a fantasy angle. But I also gravitate towards these intriguing replications of the human condition.For this reason, I liked this anime despite some of my grievances. While not a “slow burn” per se, watching the events play out in such a calm, normal manner was not only a nice change of pace but also a mellow experience. It would be fair to say that this tale roots itself too much in non-excitement since almost no parts of it truly stick out as memorable, but its consistency and care within the narrative are positives to me.On the characters themselves, some were favorable and a few not so much. Haruto was a good dude, and I admired his attitude when dealing with his situations. Mio didn’t do a whole lot in the anime, but she was cute and likable nonetheless. And Yoriko, the runner girl, was a nice person to have around, too, if only for her wing-girl helpfulness.I didn’t much care for Eita, though, for I found him devoid of any interesting motifs. I wanted to like Hazuki more, but she didn’t have the presence or the impact to get me fully on her side. Indeed, her slight aloofness made me sad to see.Most of my dislike, though, comes from Ena and her wedging herself into the situation. I know that that’s her personality, and it’s only fair that she has a shot at love like the rest of them. However, she got on my nerves more and more as the season progressed because she just wouldn’t let up and pushed things in a semi-selfish manner.However, credit where credit is due on the show’s part: The last episode had me antsy, agitated with how long it was prolonging its final reveals. It knew what it was doing, and it did it well, for I shouted at the screen at least once, pleading with the anime to “get on with it already” (or another such similar phrase). So, kudos to the show for having me invested in its proceedings.Doubly so for giving me the ending I was personally rooting for. I will say, though, that I would have preferred greater justification for the winner since their romantic relationship isn’t the most electrifying. The idea is that their future together now will expand on their love for each other, but this story didn’t heavily involve such a throughput, and we the audience will (presumably) not be getting to see it unfold anyway.Either way, as the title implies, a two-word phrase is sometimes the only retort required.Just Because! holds a lot of ambition and capitalizes on a few of its ideas. A realistic premise, strong artistry, and a meaningful thread for its characters battle against plot problems, sufferings in the musicality, and some missing excitement. But, if it were to earn a grade, it still passes.SUMMARYStory: Fine, reveling in mundanity, this believable tale about a bunch of soon-to-be adults finds strength in its quiet setups but invites frustration with its romantic storybeatsArt & Animation: Good, an overcast mood, detailed establishing shots, a rough-yet-expressive style of movement, simple designs, and neat displaying for the texting achieve a big thumbs-upCharacters: Good, Eita, Mio, Haruto, and Hazuki enlist subtlety and embrace agency, and Ena juxtaposes them for added benefitMusic & Sound: Fine, a weak OP, a gently empowering ED, a subpar OST, and a set of passable VA performances leave the audio as a tossupEnjoyment: Fine, a likable, mature drama with half the cast lacking appealFinal Score: 6/10', 'Just Because was able to deliver a modest approach to “koukouseikatsu” and to that with a sigh of relief.  The lack of ecchiness or fanservice actually makes this a relaxing slice of life to watch. Some might say it is a slow pace anime but for someone that also watches Asian dramas the pacing is not that bad.One element that I enjoy is how the MC doesn’t necessary get all the attention during the first quarter of the show and they used it to their advantage; It really shows how the MC is just an average guy which for myself can certainly relate....There isn’t any MC super plot system where girls just somehow get attracted to him.The show excels at showing the innocent high school crush feeling. The uncertainty of feelings and also how feelings develop when they least expect it. We need to make choices in circumstances and situations that are given to us even though that might be the only chance that we get. The only thing I wish they had more was flashbacks on how the characters come to like their “Counter Part”.This show is similar to Tsuki ga Kerei in that aspect but definitely lacks the toki doki or the feels but even then it still keeps the viewer watching the next episode.  This show is definitely worth watching if you are looking for an anime that is relaxing and also enjoyable to watch. I’ve only finished up to episode 8 but depending on the ending this show might end up being something special.One special thing to note is how this anime has an episode 6.5 where the VA’s show you around city the anime was based on.

Despite this, the sound effect is utterly pleasant to hear, especially the ED. It sounds impeccable when you are in a sad mood, so I highly recommended you to look up for the ost and op&ed of this anime.For the characters review, I would say it is difficult to understand these characters if you dont have the same experience, so the characters somehow looks irrational and cheesy for people who come from another culture. But if you are in a similar situation, you will find a concrete connection between you and characters which makes them look more profound to you.

Not quite Tsuki ga Kirei level, but a great series nonetheless.', ""I'm a sucker for Romance-Anime. I've just always enjoyed seeing people start to fall in love, so Just Because! was an anime, that got my attention real quick. And i wasn't dissapointed.Story: 8The story seems really realistic to me. The characters are in the last year of highschool and are trying to figure out, what to do after. But of course love comes in the way and causes some drama between the soon to become adults. This drama never felt fake to me and i could relate sometimes (and almost cried once). It felt like something, that could happen in the real world anytime. (and...i personally really liked it)Art:Nothing too special and nothing too amazing, but it still had it's own charme.Sound: 8I don't remember that much, but what i do remember is, that i liked opening and ending alot.Character: 8Felt all kinda relateable. There wasn't a single character, who i didn't like. My favorite was probably Haruto.The character designs were rather simple, but they fit right into the entire theme.Enjoyment: 8I had fun watching the episodes. Sometimes not that much, but i was all hooked, when drama was happening.Overall: 8Just Because! was a really good anime in my opinion.I still havent't convinced you to watch it?

Well watch it!-Why?Just Because!"", ""Much more of a slow-burn type of show, however, I do appreciate the 'realism' and slow-paced nature. Aside from Haruto and Komiya, many of the cast aren't overly loud or boisterous, so when it comes to the topic of romance and dating, this becomes very frustrating.Honestly, this whole show was just a back and forth of miscommunication and passivity, and that's what makes the show so irritating, if only the protagonists (Eita and Mio) had just been frank with each other then it wouldn't have dragged on for so long; anime logic for you, though.In terms of dating compatibility, Eita and Mio are definitely...much more practical, however, they both lack any sort of chemistry onscreen. This lack of chemistry makes it hard for me as a viewer to support them at all. This one-sided notion of love/crushing is just so toxic and laughable. Terrible compatibility between the two, Komiya and Eita are much more suited for each other. much more practical, however, they both lack any sort of chemistry onscreen.

It wasn't overly complicated, which is difficult to find, at least for me. Especially since the simplicity was accompanied by a genuinely good story.The only negative thing I'd have to say about this anime is that I wasn't crazy about the character designs, but once I fell in love with the characters themselves, that was a small thing to overlook.For a romance/slice of life anime, personally, I'd say Just Because! exceeded my expectations. It had the right tinge of drama without being overly tragic, and the relationship building was pretty realistic for the most...part. I'm not usually a fan of mundane stories, but this one was enchanting.I would definitely recommend this if you want something to watch that's simple and enjoyable.

Highly recommend this anime to someone that is in a similar situation to any characters here because i think this anime has a really good message even with all the depressing vibes the overall color palette gives alongside the phasing and characters emotions. a really stressful year of a lot of people\'s life because it represents going into adulthood and what you are going to do with the rest of your life.

You just end up liking everyone and don't know who to root for. I can't stress enough about the integrity the more recent romance/drama/slice of life anime's are missing nowadays.

This is the kind of series that I absolutely love and Just Because does an admirable job at showing so much emotion.Story: Just Because! tells us the story of five friends: Eita, Hazuki, Haruto, Mio and Ena.  Due to his dad transferring jobs (again), Eita ends up going to the same school as the other four characters.  He previously knew Haruto and Mio from...when he used to go to middle school with them, before his dad transferred jobs the first time around.  Eita, Hazuki, Haruto and Mio are in the final semester of high school and join a LINE group together to keep in touch during the course of the semester.  Most of the story explores how our characters connect with each other and complications that come when high school crushes are involved.Just Because! doesn\'t go over the top with its story and keeps things fairly simplistic.  The baseline of it sounds unimpressive and to some, it will be.  But the reason you watch this is for the characters.  Every interaction between characters holds meaning and while every character in our main cast doesn\'t interact with every other one a lot, it\'s interesting to see the conversations and actions that do happen, just because they do feel very different from one another.  How much do they care for each other and what lengths will they go through to make sure they\'re okay?  There are a lot of obstacles in the way of each of our character\'s goals and how they overcome them is fascinating to watch.  There are times where you wish the anime moved at a quicker pace, as the steps our characters take can feel slow at times, but the final product is fantastic.If you\'re looking for a lovey-dovey romance anime, you will not find it here.  However, what you do find are a lot of heartwarming moments and will make you go ""aw"" and there are ways that characters express their interest in each other through their actions.  There\'s no better example of this than episode 7, which is easily my favourite here.  A character needs to go somewhere really important and they get flustered in the process.  However, another gives up their day to try and make them succeed, no matter what.  The setup was there, the entire episode ran smoothly and the resolution was satisfying.Where this anime does stumble a bit is the way they ended the series.  You do get a glimpse of what every character does after they\'ve moved on, but if it\'s something that really pulls audiences in, it\'s the final result.  I don\'t feel like the ending does some of our characters justice.  It needed to be longer, if you ask me.  However, you don\'t need an overly complex story to this type of anime.  (8/10)Characters: As previous mentioned, Just Because! is very character focused and if a series goes in this direction, you have to pull it off well.  And they do that here.Eita has a history with both Haruto and Mio, and you couldn\'t find two characters in which he interacts with more opposite to each other.  It\'s a little jarring, but shows that he\'s excellent with people, despite the seemingly dull nature.  However, he\'s a really good friend to have.  He seems to be very aware of what\'s going on around him and gives his honest opinion on most every situation.  He\'s a lot smarter than he comes off - as he seems to always appear as being boring and monotone in his speech.  Despite this, his obvious flaw is that he doesn\'t make key decisions correctly and we notice it almost costs him at times.  Contrast this with one of the members of his middle school baseball team, Haruto\'s very competitive, even if the team around him isn\'t.  He\'s got a ton of energy.  It\'s revealed very early on that his family isn\'t exactly well off, money wise, which causes his future to be predetermined.  You can tell that he doesn\'t love this, but he remains a very confident individual that has to learn to deal with the cards that he\'s dealt.  That is, until you mention his crush to him.  He is very clearly not confident in that aspect.  Eita does help him along a fair bit and one pair of character interactions that are really neat.  His storyline is one of the ones that I was pretty satisfied with and there are aspects of it and I can relate to.  Mio takes her studies very seriously, and this feels like its her number one priority.  Like many of our cast members, she has an obvious crush that\'s conveyed to us fairly early on, but she does very little to forward it for almost the entire series.  You might think that these two facts make sense next to each other, but she clearly wants to be noticed and it makes this character frustrating to watch, at times.  Some of her best interactions are with Hazuki though.  I would go as so far to say that they could have done more with the back end of her storyline because they almost created more problems than were necessary.  Due to her family\'s everyday life, Hazuki seems to commit almost the entirety of her non-school time to making sure she is able to take care of her two youngers brothers and, to a lesser extent, her younger sister.  She cares deeply for them and never feels burdened.  This does explain why she\'s so mature for her age.  However, she keeps such a cool head throughout the entire series that you almost get a sense that people view her as a perfect person, despite her hesitancy on it.Ena is very clearly the ""fifth"" main cast character, but she does have a role in this series, especially when it comes to the romance feelings of our characters.  She has a serious passion for photography and this fuels her drive through the entire series.  Everything kind of just runs back to that.  Despite being a year behind the rest of our cast, she meshes well within our story and that even allows us to see how a younger character looks at her future goals, or lack there of.  Yoriko gets a special mention because she actually has a lot of key interactions in the story, even though she gets less screen time.  Despite not having a significant other, she actually is a fantastic addition to our cast because of the way she recognizes what our main cast feels, similar to Eita.  I love her as an addition and she almost could have had a bigger role here if they wanted.Our cast members all have fantastic moments amongst each other and its these that make Just Because! shine.  Mio might be the one that frustrates me the most, but you can sort of see why by the time you get to finishing the series.  (10/10)Art: Where this series unfortunately does suffer is the animation.  A lot of the backgrounds have this watercolour look to it, and at times, it almost looks muddy, which does not mesh with the foreground. Many of them are also dull and, even with a lot of the anime taking place outside, it didn’t pop as much as I would have liked. It’s a fine looking anime, but this is something I would have liked to see improved, especially because one of the characters focuses so much on her photography. From a visual standpoint, there is an impressive amount of known brand names (or least I’m assuming they are in Japan), including Canon. Their names are also in the credits so I’d have to wager a guess that the director needed permission to show all this. It’s a neat feature, even if it’s a pretty minor one to most people. The characters themselves only really look fine when we\'re looking straight at them and as soon as we get any distance on them, the animation completely falters.  (5/10)Sound: A lot of the OST are made up of piano or violin sounds, all of which are very light.  One of those tunes actually uses the melody from the OP, which I always appreciate.  The OP and ED themselves sound fine as well.  However, the VO work seems really rough in many spots.  The best of the bunch is predictably Luci Christian (Mio).  Brittney Karbowski (Ena), Blake Shepard (Haruto) and Patricia Duran (Hazuki) are all just a step below, but still strong for the most part - the latter of which surprised me because she doesn\'t have much of a resume to this point.  However, I find it very difficult to like Greg Cote (Eita) here.  This might be the result of having such a monotone character, but there wasn\'t much here that I was impressed with.  In addition, a lot of the side character\'s lines feel very thrown in and don\'t feel convincing at all.  I really didn\'t like the side cast, unfortunately.  (6/10)Overall Enjoyment: Just Because! does a lot of things well.  The storytelling, characters, as well as their interactions are all very strong.  We, as audiences, see these interactions and know, for the most part, why our characters are doing what they do.  But, it\'s high school, and teenagers will have difficulty when it comes to talking to the one they are crushing on.  The art and sound faltered in a lot of areas, but I found myself still enjoying this series a lot.

However, alongside them, was Pine Jam’s newest release, Just Because!, a slice of life-school romance with some unique story telling traits that sets it apart from the rest.What makes Just Because! different from other anime in its category is its approach to the characters and conflicts. Its strong suit is not its romance but its realism, as each student faces their own conflicts such as university exams, job searching and the general uncertainties that come with growing up.

In just 12 episodes, the characters’ development and growth is evident as by the end of the series, each character has matured and gained a clearer vision of their wants in life.

Most romance anime suffer from an extremely slow start and an incredibly rushed conclusion, thrusting viewers through the climax and toward the conclusion, which usually leaves unfilled gaps and plot holes in the story. Just Because!’s relationship dynamics develop with the plot at a steady rate from beginning to end so that there never seems like a moment that is unimportant or elongated. The strong writing allows for good development of chemistry between characters without any unnecessary moments to fill for time. Unfortunately, it does follow the trend of having a predictable plot as certain conflicts are resolved in an easily anticipated manner.The animation is mediocre as the setting is appealing visually but not always very detailed. However, Pine Jam is a very new studio as Just Because! is only their third release and so the quality of their future releases can be expected to improve over time. The soundtrack is unexpectedly good, with strong opening and ending songs that accompany the anime well and a soundtrack that fans are sure to be anticipating the release of. The voice acting for each character fits, but is nothing spectacular.On a final note, something to appreciate about Just Because! is its lack of fanservice. Unlike other romance anime, there are no panty shots, awkward groping or lewdness of any kind. Its romance is pure and light which could be a turn off to some but is refreshing considering the amounts of harem seen in recent fan favourites. In addition, the primary mode of communication between students is the use of the Japanese messaging app LINE, and the animation of its messages were a nice touch. Overall, Just Because! is a pleasant take at the classic coming of age story that highlights the experience of high school, adolescence and growing up, earning it a rating of seven out of ten. characters being primarily students, the plot is light-hearted.

The characters progression is nice, but sometimes makes you also confused. I loved the art it's one of my favourites and the snow/winter setting makes it all the more enjoyable.This anime could be a solid 8/9 and maybe a 10 if...it really did make a surprise.The problem with this anime is that the ending was already sort of spoiled in the opening theme, don't get me wrong i loved the OP and the music, but it spoiled the ending. And once we got to see the ending, we got disappointed, not only did we already know who it's going to win, but it was so bland and like rushed at the last minute that it made us feel empty inside. Did i spend so much time waiting for each episode which were nice but the last one was a major flop. That's what i always hate, the ending, very few of them make you really satisfied sadly this one did not. At least give us a few seconds of them actually like holding hands in future how do we know they actually got together and not like ignore each other.Overall good anime with a bad ending, i can recommend the first 11 episodes but the last one better don't watch, haha. it really did make a surprise.The problem with this anime is that the ending was already sort of spoiled in the opening theme, don't get me wrong i loved the OP and the music, but it spoiled the ending.

Though the art for me is a bit too stiff, but the story will be it's saving grace. I'm not saying I don't like the way they did this but the animation quality is better than some animes that I have previously watched. The character designs are quite appealing for me, personally.I know the anime just started but from the few episode I have seen I can tell you know that this anime won't disappoint you.  I am confident that you guys who love romance animes will enjoy this from beginning...to end. to end."", ""They tried the best they could to make this a good anime. They followed the recipe of a slice of life/romance but it just doesn't work.The two main characters barely talk or express their feelings to each other or even try to. No plot points are ever resolved. They introduce something and you think they're going somewhere with it but no. I feel like I'm watching the room. And after watching 12 episodes of them running away from each other and suffering from convenient issues that could've been resolved after 1 minute of texting we're treated to an epic finale. Nope just kidding.The...art for me sometimes really didn't work. Like sometimes I laughed which is weird because the art style is mainly good I don't know why it goes wrong sometimes.This could have been much better. And the ending is disappointing. art for me sometimes really didn't work. Like sometimes I laughed which is weird because the art style is mainly good I don't know why it goes wrong sometimes.This could have been much better. And the ending is disappointing."", ""Just Because! is a twelve-episode story which could have been told in six episodes.The main issue I have with the story is that you discover far too early what the conflict is about. The revelation is in actuality already made in epiosde one, but comes fare more clear in episode two. From that point onwards, the show drags on. The viewer can already see how the characters want to resolve their conflict, but they themselves seem to keep dragging it out. Between the conflict and its resolution there are barely any scenes of relevance. The core story is about the challenges of leaving high...school, going to college and stepping into the adult world and each character has their own way of dealing with it. As such, the main focus of the story is the struggles and development of the characters. Important to all of them is that they want to keep to their final-year-resolutions, but little attention is spent on achieving this. The characters tend to talk a lot about issues, without really knowing what the goal of their discussion is and when the plot demands that they finally take action, they do. This happens without the audience getting the impression that any of these characters have experienced a change.This way of storytelling has made the animation department far too complacent. While the character design is somewhat unique, not giving you a copy-paste impression, everything else in the show is sub-par. The animators are good at creating non-moving, pretty images and every now and then there is a scene of a car driving by that feels somewhat convincing, but that's all there is. At times when characters are performing complicated actions the animators zoom in on their faces to avoid a lot of work. Worst of all is that most scenes barely have an interesting angle. The locations seem to be picked for variety's sake without trying to use clever angles, lighting etc. The images are simply there, because that is what is expected of a visual medium.The least intersting part of the show was the soundtrack. There were a few melancholy, lackadaisical tunes, but nothing stuck. This type of execution as such didn't draw upon any emotion from me. When you heard the piano play it felt more like a que that you were supposed to interpret the scene in question in a certain way, but without relevant dialogue, a sustained storyline or creative animating techniques the scenes just felt lacking.Finally, although the show felt like a drag to get through at times, I could draw some enjoyment from watching it. The characters did have somewhat of an identity, although it was equated with the goal they wanted to reach. In fact, their goal seems to be their character and in every scene of dialogue the challenge associated with the character in question is brought up. Nevertheless, I wouldn't call these characters one-dimensional, but I wouldn't call them three-dimensional either. They were somewhat two-dimensional, but I deed feel the desire to see their personal arcs conclude. Overall, I rated the series with a 6. Undoubtedly, the same type of story with more depth and more character developoment would have been awarded with an 8. school, going to college and stepping into the adult world and each character has their own way of dealing with it.

It explores relationships that are genuine and earnest. You will realise that relationships aren't so clear-cut as it turns out to be, such as friend zones because of long-distance relationships and studies.The person I felt most relatable to was, Morikawa. Her reasons of not wanting to pursue the relationship further reminds me of myself a lot, just that I have no one chasing me. Showing your love to someone from a different place isn't always easy and most people,will rather choose to take the easy way out. I was touched by Haruto, as he demonstrated resilience and was willing to carry on, despite the circumstances the relationship was placed in. As for Natsume, I really can't emphasise the common friend zone I face in school, using academics as a barrier and because of that, missing out on opportunities for meaningful interactions.Ah, this anime depicts the life of Japanese students, especially in the academics in high school. So far, I have not seen a slice-of-life anime that is equivalent to the way Just Because! illustrates the academic system in Japan's high school. In the high school, you have top students who have already received their university recommendations, average students who are considering of applying to university and the students who felt that they will rather work instead of pursue their studies prior to their high school. I felt that the anime has a realistic focus on the academic system of Japan and not lumping everyone into going to college straight after high school.Overall, this anime is spectacular and realistic. It is a good show for those that might be wondering how do Japanese high school students go about their lives and are into genuine romance.

People who are already in colleges have faced the difficulties of maintaining friendships or talking openly about love and problems they face.Characters are lovely, even supporting characters had a good development. You know that Eita take either the left or the right road, so just be patient and see for yourself which one. Music is outstanding, entire show has this melodic atmosphere which is simply splendid. It is probably the best part of anime when you have those moments where images are still but music keeps on building.Overall, I believe whoever watches this will not leave with too many...negative comments. Watch it, enjoy it! negative comments. Watch it, enjoy it!', 'I\'m not really sure what the fascination is with love polyhedrons and love chains - these small groups of platonic friends who are in a hopeless network of mostly-non-mutual attractions. You can see this in similar, recent series like A Lull in the Sea (Nagi no Asukara), Waiting in the Summer (Ano Natsu de Matteru), and Glasslip. Maybe it\'s just a simple way to pump some drama into an otherwise ""boring"" romantic storyline, or at least to give something better than the Will-They-Won\'t-They that two-character Romance stories tend to be.The cast, arguably the most important part of any romance-centered story, is somewhat of a mixed...bag. Of the five main characters, I could really only make the argument for two of them that they are complex and dynamic. Over half of the cast could have been demoted to supporting roles, and pretty much nothing would have been lost - and I, as an armchair storyteller, would also say you would\'ve been left with a much more compelling story, albeit a very different one.What was pretty refreshing about Just Because was the prominence of its main theme - people going through the craziness of graduating from a Japanese high school. I get burned a lot by anime with an interesting premise that basically backseat that premise (A Lull in the Sea, Waiting in the Summer, and Glasslip all did this to me). To have the theme not only be present but also the primary driving force for the entire cast is, to me, a sign of good storytelling.What is not a sign of good storytelling is the frankly unbelievable volume of freak coincidences that move the story from one point to the next. While it\'s difficult to really call out a specific example, just go in with the knowledge that absolutely nothing that happens on screen is a secret to anyone in the cast - if they didn\'t just happen to be nearby when it goes down, they will accidentally and inevitably find out almost immediately all the same.I do want to give a shoutout to Komiya Ena, one of the main characters. She\'s probably my favorite character of 2017, and she came pretty close to saving and carrying the show all by herself. She has a very charming earnestness and aggressiveness that I don\'t see often in this medium.In short, it\'s an alright romance story that uses a romantic pairing format I\'m getting tired of, but is actually smartly using its theme to progress the events. The story is driven by crazy coincidences and the crushes are driven by trivial things that happened in middle school. If you liked Waiting in the Summer, you\'ll probably like this.

That will keep you coming.Story: You have the summery to read on the story. TL;DR - It\'s about a boy who moved away from his home town in middle school, only to move back in his last semester of high-school. And as you would expect, seeing his friends, and crush again, after some much time. Is a sweet, and memorable moment. However, in the back of everyone\'s mind, in the approaching graduation. From there, the story takes on a traditional love triangle. There\'s nothing really unique about it. A girl who is...fighting to keep her photography club alive, and the MC\'s childhood crush.One thing about the story i personally didn\'t like. Was the fact that, there\'s really no closure. (*PLEASE NOTE, THE FOLLOWING SENTENCE CONTAINS SPOILERS. SKIP TO THE NEXT PARAGRAPH TO SKIP IT*) The show builds up to this climatic love confession. Only for it to fall flat. And shove everyone else\'s confessions above the MC\'s. Only to finally, give us - a tiny bit of closure. With a meh love confession in the final 10 seconds of the show. Aside from that, there\'s no kiss, no date, absolutely nothing beyond a lackluster love confession. Needless to say, i didn\'t care for the endingArt, Characters, and everything else: I\'m going to condense the rest into a short paragraph. As none of these categories are particularly note worthy. The art is pretty standard of a newer show. Good uses of color to set the scene. The sound, again pretty standard. Although, it\'s a bit above the average. And it plays a role in the love of 2 secondary characters. The characters are great, except for the MC. Which is why i gave it a 7. MC has no characteristics. And barely speaks. I guess that\'s an attempt to make him ""mysterious."" But it falls flat. And ultimately, i didn\'t connect with him as i should have. Overall, it\'s an incredible enjoyable show.

Yes, this is platoonic triangle we have here, however Haruto has sight on another girl so the triangle is not working as thought at least that for now.

Except Izumi all main characters have their own clique (Haruto with his boy gangs, Natsume with her gal gangs, Morikawa with Inu and Komiya with her camera club members aka her secret admirer) where them have interaction with their own clique.Interestingly, Izumi the main character didn't have any interaction with most supporting characters except Inui so far as Izumi is transfer students so making sense there.Over all Just Because is a mundane highschool life with usual teenager antic with more realistic view without any annoying generic trope, much similiar to Tsuki Ga Kirei.... romace Just Because also presented the characters struggle for future in their final year and bit of sport and of course we not forget Komiya and her camera club which are the extra plot for this main story.I have no comment for music as i am enjoyed the Opening and Ending song which led me to repeat that until i am bored.The Characters in Just Because is not so narrow minded on main characters, other supporting characters have their fair character which led lime to sight.

Drama... Romance... not really a unique combination of genres.. but what makes Just Because! different from the others? Let us elaborate for a bit.This anime might have an unusual plot unlike any other common school, slice of life titles of the same genres. However, the setting is typical and most likely, composed of common scenes. In the first few minutes of the episode, you might be wondering what's it all about and may even lead you to some assumptions of the plot. With the lack of original setting,...the art however makes up for it and I can say that the scenes are well drawn and detailed. Despite the genres of romance and slice of life, the backgrounds are somewhat gloomy and not that beaming compared to other romance focused titles. The backgrounds show seriousness and melancholy which highlights that the drama feel is more focused on this series. Though Just Because! has the focus of drama, there are some comic reliefs in between sad scenes to ease the drama buildup through and through. The sound and background music is well matched for the scenes and music is one of the factors that makes this anime decent. The characters of the show aren't that uniquely drawn and the main character is not aimed to be a bishounen just like most romance anime. Plain looks and plain personality. Though he might sound like a rough character, his development though is what would make up for what he lacks. Realizing everything that I said, I know that there isn't anything special about this series. It's just like any other school romance that you have seen and you might drop it after the first episode. Surely I tell you that this is not a series that will hook you up right off the bat on the first moments. This is a progressive anime that takes patience for the viewer to see the brighter side of it. The plot, the tragedies and shenanigans, and dilemmas of usual romance can be seen here yes. But what if those events turned out on a different way? This series is not something that most people would enjoy because in my opinion, this is not something that you're supposed to enjoy. This is a series where you have to put feelings on it to put this show to good use. Your feelings will not be wasted because don't worry, everything will work out in the end. I recommend this to people who have time and patience to watch a new series.P.S. There isn't a single episode wherein the monorail doesn't show up even in a single glimpse of a scene. Why does it always have to be there? Maybe the monorail was the focus of this anime all along.. well.. that's just a theory anyways...

First 2 EPs already won me over due to the sound and art. I know that the animation quality suddenly dropped after two EPs but I kinda let it slide for now since that news article that featured the Pine Jam production team where the director is having problems in terms of making Just Because!. But then I realized that they\'re the same...guys who made Gamers! anime and I was like ""Dude. Two animes in a row?"" I get that making animes is their job but making another anime after a season?  That\'s where I immediately sympathized them and I\'m fine with the sudden quality drop in animation.Looks like I went off the review now. Going back, Just Because! is another school romance anime by Pine Jam and I must say after watching Gamers!, this is a step up from the last anime they made.Storyline wise, it\'s about as simple as it can get. It\'s about 3 high school students who are almost graduating but then a transfer student arrives and this is where everything changes. Now I don\'t mind usual school romance stories and this is one of them. As for the pacing, as you expect from a school romance anime, it\'s slow but in Just Because\'s case, the slow pacing is alright.Art. Well as mentioned above the first 2 EPs were good in terms of the art quality but eventually EP3 arrived and that\'s where the art quality suddenly dropped but for me I really don\'t see much of a quality drop but it varies by person.Sound. Good. Very good music. The songs used fits well to the Winter atmosphere of the anime. Can\'t say much from here.Characters. Well I do admit that Eita Izumi reminds me a bit of Makoto Yuuki from Persona 3 in terms of his personality. But anyway the characters, they\'re alright and not one character made me hate him/her.I enjoyed the anime overall. As a guy who keeps on looking for good romance anime (especially school romance), this one is good because it captures that feel where you\'re almost about to graduate and you need to make some moves quick especially when it comes to love confession with someone you liked over the years during your high school days. It actually made me remember my days as a high school student.Oh and last thing: Pine Jam, please get yourself a well deserved rest. You seriously need it especially after doing two animes in a row. You deserve it. guys who made Gamers! anime and I was like ""Dude. Two animes in a row?"" I get that making animes is their job but making another anime after a season?

The opening was done by Nagi Yanagi(Ehem) and the ending was originally sang by Mio Natsume, Ena Komiya, and Hatsuki Morikawa which are the three main heroine of the Anime.Character: The Character were charming on their own way and it will make you root for other love interests as well and as the story progress the character development was spot on as you will be able to clearly see the growth of each individuals.10./10Enjoyment: Like i said the story and the conclusion might be predictable but hey the executions of those scenes were really great to the point that you might think that the story was original which is really true. Anyway a perfect 10/10Overall: Well its really a Masterpiece Anime (at least for me) so 10/10 and with that said go and give this Anime a shot if you like it then good for you and if you don't then go find another anime here at myanimelist :D opinion its 10/10.Art: No complained at all. someone might argue that the art style was similar to getsuyoubi no tawawa/ tawawa on monday but hey they were animated by the same studio pine jam so that's why i'll also give this a perfect 10, because why not? they were able to give a crispy story.Sound: The opening and ending was absolutely perfect no question asked.

As anime that focuses on the relationship between characters, the audience may find it a little difficult to recognize the main characters that appear in this episode, but the confusion is gradually helped by the connection between characters that slowly shown in this first episode. Tone colors used in Just Because! it does look very flat, but fits perfectly with Japan\'s dreary winter atmosphere with gray clouds everywhere.For the audience who wants anime romance with Seishun Seasoning, Just Because! may be the right choice for you.I suspect viewers came to this anime...because of Tawawa and Sakurasou. Regardless of the size of the chests of characters who are big and uplifting, Just Because will be the romance of a high school adolescent that may end well, may end flat. As an original adaptation, the problem is not whether who will involve with whom, but how the process towards inventing (or ending just friends) will eventually be able to be enjoyed well by the audience.One other interesting thing is the scenery part of this anime (which is also used as a promotional event for one of the leading camera brands in Japan) which is quite realistic for an anime television. Seen how the scenic background is depicted with the details in this series (including the Shonan Monorail hanging chariot depicted in this anime). For those hoping for a ""boing-boing"" atmosphere of Getsuyoubi no Tawawa, the anime is not as precocious as its predecessor, so let\'s watch with the upright hope that this series will promise a love story at a fun and exciting school.

No more and no less.', ""At first, I wasn't really interested in Just Because when I read the synopsis. But, a friend of mine invited me to join him binge watching this series with him and I agreed. I have to say I didn't regret my decision back then.In my opinion, Just Because is an anime which focuses solely on how relationships between people begins and grows. It shows us how we are who we are because of those around us. Overall, I would give this anime a 7/10.For each aspect's score:Story [6/10] : For me, the story was quite well-written. It clearly depicts how a high school student lives...both in and out of school. Unfortunately, it lacks a certain depth to it. The setting and the plot of the story was quite generic with some interesting twists. But, those twists simply doesn't make up the lack of depth that I felt when watching the series from the beginning.Art [5/10] : As for the art, I think a score of 5 is what it deserves. Throughout the series, I always felt a little bit awkward whenever the view changes to the close-up view of a character's face. The characters' facial expressions was a bit weird and wasn't animated properly in my opinion and ruins a scene's mood every once in a while.Sound [8/10] : Overall, the quality of the sounds throughout the series was very good. Every character's speech was very clear and perfectly articulated. Not only that, the background musics throughout the series were nice to listen to and helps to set the mood for certain important events.Character [9/10] : As I said at the beginning of my review, this is precisely what Just Because focuses on and thus they really did a great job depicting and designing the characters. They were able to somehow make all those characters with different backgrounds and personalities to interact with each other in a natural manner and make it each other grow through those interactions. Not only that, each character was also very relatable because they all had their own problems, problems that are precisely what we faced during high school, the various choices that will most likely define our adult life significantly. The way the anime focuses on how each character faces each of their problems truly make me feel that they're high school students that truly exist somewhere out there facing their final year in high school.Enjoyment [8/10] : For personal enjoyment, I give it an 8/10 because I really like animes which are centered around romance in high school. Whenever I watches those animes I felt like I was back in my high school years when I didn't have as much responsibility as I currently do, when I was happily laughing and playing everyday with my friends, friends that I rarely could meet with nowadays. And the time when I faced problems that truly made me who I am and where I am right now. I guess you could say that I truly enjoyed this because whenever I watch it, I felt like taking a trip down the memory lane to back when I was still a high school student. both in and out of school.

I'm just going to go in depth on my love for this show. Just Because! came into my life for the last 12-13 weeks and I couldn't thank Pine Jam enough for that. I eagerly waited every Thursday to catch the new episode. I'm a little sad that Just Because! is now behind me. I dream of the day where it gets a movie or maybe even a 2nd season. I'm sad to see it go. I loved...every single second of this anime.When this show only had 2 episodes out, I had already placed it close to my favorites. I did a top 40 favorite anime of all time blog on AA and placed this series at number 37. Of course though now its much higher now that I have completed the show. I know it seems dumb to put it in your favorites when only 2 episodes had aired. Though that's the thing, Just Because! had a different aura around it, a different feeling. I had this vibe that it had the potential to be that next big anime. For me at least.This was my 2017 anime of the year. No doubt in my mind. Ill look back at my time with this show fondly. Knowing that the fall 2017 anime season will have a place in my heart now. Ill miss Mio's stupid pouty faces. Ill miss Eita's cool and calm demeanor. Ill miss Komiya's dumb ass irritating everyone. Ill miss Haruto being best boy. Ill miss Morikawa being realistic and lovely. I just can't help but put this into my top 20 favorite anime now.The atmosphere in this show was so realistic. Capturing the feeling of adolescence, your teenage years, and graduating and moving on. These 5 characters truly felt like real people. Going though the reality of there high school days together coming to an end. I loved how the storyline involved Eita coming back right near the end of school. His relationship with Haruto reminded me of my relationship with some of my friends near graduating. When on screen they made me smile.Also the twist near the end where Eita failed and Mio got accepted to his school... Borderline genius writing right there. On episode 10 and 11 I was so scared that this wouldn't have a happy ending. Well with that said, I hope Morikawa and Haruto get together happily once she's settled in college. I wish all these characters the best. Also, wanting to thank them for the precious time I spent with them. I hope there will be another season. You can only dream I suppose.... I guess with all that said.. I can leave Just Because! behind me. I knew I would love it, and I did. 12 episodes of passion. Thank you Studio Pine Jam. Ill never forget my time with this anime. every single second of this anime.When this show only had 2 episodes out, I had already placed it close to my favorites.

Kimi no nawa is an outstanding romance movie but here we have Just Because!, something that doesn\'t have...all those fantasy or sci-fi themes and instead, it focuses on bringing out the realism of a few student\'s life.Story was rated 7 because I felt that the ending was underwhelming. It was the correct ending in my opinion but it wasn\'t ended properly.Art was rated 8 as I can see that the animators paid attention to shade the hairs and even more details to the backgrounds and still images. To top it off, trumpeters are in for a treat.Sound is an 8 though I would have given it a 9 if the OP wasn\'t out of tune. The ED is my favourite this season and it\'s meaning fits well with the theme of the show with a hint of yearning in the lyrics. For the next and last part, Yes the trumpet part. I have no idea if it was intentional or the lack budget but the performance of the piece ""In Unison"" which is only found in the anime was like an amateur yet still beautiful which makes me believe that it was played In the show and not a person being recorded in the studio.Characters were a 9, the voice acting was great and so were their behaviours. They constantly showed how a person would behave realistically, their insecurities, their over consideration of many things, their rash full behaviours as teens. Each of themain characters also have deep meaning behind actions and insecurities, very much like real life and I assure you that there is definitely good waifu to look for in this show.10/10 enjoyment. My favourite ED this season, theres a few trumpet part although it\'s the same song over and over again. What more do I have to say?? I even took the time to write a review seriously and the only other review i wrote was more like a joke for a joke of an anime. all those fantasy or sci-fi themes and instead, it focuses on bringing out the realism of a few student\'s life.Story was rated 7 because I felt that the ending was underwhelming.

Later on after being hooked, I became increasingly relaxed with the pace and atmosphere of the whole series: safe and sound, safe and sometimes thrilling, peaceful but often dramatic. The storyline however disappoints me quite a lot: the one who actually strove to the limit failed miserably, the one who had recognised her failure changed her direction, and then succeed without breaking a sweat. Even though I appreciate the harsh truth aspect of Just Because, which is not everything will be how it's supposed to be, I still feel somewhat dissatisfied at the ending of...the movie. Overall, personally I think the strength of the story is not equivalent to how good the art and sound of the series is. What a pity! the movie. Overall, personally I think the strength of the story is not equivalent to how good the art and sound of the series is. What a pity!"", 'I don\'t usually write reviews, but this one deserves it. Just because. Probably one of the only realistic slice of life that stimulates reality. You dont get as much anime as this so I would cherish the moments. The soundtrack was beautifully alluring and serene, yet dramatic. It was well designed and perfected the scene playing within the background. The story was amazing, showing an unrequited love between a group of three middleschoolers which one, the main character, Eita Izumi,moving away for a few years until he returned during his senior year in high school. I don\'t really want to spoil as much just so...you guys can embrace the wonderful experience within this underrated anime. Overall, this anime deserves a perfect score just because it gives you a vibe you will never forget. This anime is golden, and deserves more attention than those cliche ""I go to highschool and I start relationships with 20 girls"" type crap. you guys can embrace the wonderful experience within this underrated anime.

This anime is golden, and deserves more attention than those cliche ""I go to highschool and I start relationships with 20 girls"" type crap.', ""Review written in SPANISH (original) and ENGLISH...ENGLISHStory 17 / 20This is a romantic anime that is based on the dialogue and situations of a group of friends who socialize, go out and share their youth, making it a calm story where you look, a light drama, with light comedy, showing more romance and dialogue that nothing. For this type of story, it seems to me that a suitable plot is handled, an acceptable sequence, whose direction goes towards the individual objectives of the characters. Emotions are portrayed in a slightly realistic way, but nothing to brag about. There are scenes in which they capture...a lot of interest from the viewer, where the emotion of the moment is handled very well, such as when they get serious on the baseball field, or at the end, in the results of the exams. Not badAnimation 18 / 20Although it is not totally to my liking, it seems to me an acceptable work of animation and art. I really think that the character designs, although I liked them, the animation of their expressions, among other details left a lot to be desired, although it is compensated by the amount of details in the background, and a good animation in general, as well as good proportions in the drawings. The scenarios are very well done, and there are scenes with great animations, which require a lot of work.Sound 16 / 20Nothing bad. Completely suitable to follow a romantic plot, both in the case of the opening, as the ending, and even the ambient music. The work of the voices is very well accomplished in the same way, with a performance that tries to bring a relaxed atmosphere, without exaggerating them.Characters 17 / 20Since the series is based on the interaction and the development of the story of each character, this is the most important part of the work, especially since there is no manga, there is no light novel on which it is based, this is an original project. There was a good handling in each of the main characters, they make clear the personality of each one and they are known as the story progresses. Each one has clear objectives, and these are being developed as the story progresses. I think they should have taken a little more work on the supporting characters, but it's not disappointing, either.Enjoy 16 / 20An anime that personally pleased me enough to spend time, as it's relaxing, and it's not a job you have to force yourself to endure. In fact I have seen some scenes more than four times, and the complete series twice, but I will say that it is not the best either, and it is not remarkable. You may recommend this series to someone who is just beginning to watch anime and wants to watch something relaxing to adapt to style and art.General 84 / 100A romantic series, with light comedy, with some drama and good dialogue, perfect for spend time, with good drawings and animations, a good musical atmosphere, and good character handling. Overall, an anime to chill out, to hang out while you wait for a new episode of your favorite anime to come out, or to watch it in the background while playing a video game. It's not bad at all.SPANISHHistoria 17 / 20Este es un anime romántico que se basa en el diálogo y situaciones de un grupo de amigos que socializan, salen y comparten su juventud, por lo que es una historia tranquila por donde se mire, un drama ligero, con comedia ligera, mostrando más romance y diálogo que nada. Para este tipo de historia, me parece que se maneja una trama adecuada, una secuencia aceptable, cuya dirección va hacia los objetivos individuales de los personajes. Las emociones son plasmadas de manera ligeramente realista, pero nada de qué presumir. Hay escenas en las que captan mucho interés del espectador, donde se maneja muy bien la emoción del momento, como cuando se ponen serios en el campo de baseball, o al final, en los resultados de los exámenes. Nada malAnimación 18 / 20Aunque no es totalmente de mi gusto, me parece un trabajo de animación y arte aceptable. De verdad que pienso que, los diseños de los personajes, aunque me gustaron, la animación de sus expresiones, entre otros detalles dejaron mucho que desear, aunque se compensa por la cantidad de detalles en segundo plano, y una buena animación en general, así como buenas proporciones en los dibujos. Los escenarios están muy bien logrados, y hay escenas con animaciones muy buenas, que requieren de mucho trabajo.Sonido 16 / 20Nada mal. Completamente adecuado para seguir una trama romántica, tanto en el caso del opening, como el ending, y la música de ambiente. El trabajo de las voces está muy bien logrado de la misma forma, con una actuación que trata de llevar un ambiente relajado, sin exagerar en las mismas.Personajes 17 / 20Ya que la serie se basa en la interacción y el desarrollo de la historia de cada personaje, esta es la parte más importante de la obra, sobre todo porque no hay manga, no hay novela ligera en la que se base, este es un proyecto original. Hubo un buen manejo en cada uno de los personajes principales, dejan clara la personalidad de cada uno y se les va conociendo conforme la historia avanza. Cada uno tiene objetivos claros, y estos van desarrollándose conforme la historia avanza. Creo que faltó un poco más de trabajo en los personajes de soporte, pero tampoco es decepcionante.Disfrute 16 / 20Un anime que en lo personal me agradó lo suficiente para pasar el rato, ya que es relajante, y no es un trabajo que debas forzarte a soportar. De hecho he visto algunas escenas más de cuatro veces, y la serie completa dos veces, pero diré que tampoco es de las mejores, y no es destacable. Puede que recomiende esta serie a alguna persona que apenas está comenzando a ver anime y quiere ver algo tranquilo para irse adaptando al estilo y el arte.General 84 / 100Una serie romántica, con comedia ligera, con algo de drama y buen diálogo, perfecta para pasar el rato, con buenos dibujos y animaciones, buen ambiente musical, y buen manejo de personajes. En general, un anime para relajarte, para pasar el rato mientras esperas a que salga un nuevo episodio de tu anime favorito, o verlo de fondo mientras juegas un videojuego.

Hay escenas en las que captan mucho interés del espectador, donde se maneja muy bien la emoción del momento, como cuando se ponen serios en el campo de baseball, o al final, en los resultados de los exámenes. Nada malAnimación 18 / 20Aunque no es totalmente de mi gusto, me parece un trabajo de animación y arte aceptable. De verdad que pienso que, los diseños de los personajes, aunque me gustaron, la animación de sus expresiones, entre otros detalles dejaron mucho que desear, aunque se compensa por la cantidad de detalles en segundo plano, y una buena animación en general, así como buenas proporciones en los dibujos. Los escenarios están muy bien logrados, y hay escenas con animaciones muy buenas, que requieren de mucho trabajo.Sonido 16 / 20Nada mal. Completamente adecuado para seguir una trama romántica, tanto en el caso del opening, como el ending, y la música de ambiente. El trabajo de las voces está muy bien logrado de la misma forma, con una actuación que trata de llevar un ambiente relajado, sin exagerar en las mismas.Personajes 17 / 20Ya que la serie se basa en la interacción y el desarrollo de la historia de cada personaje, esta es la parte más importante de la obra, sobre todo porque no hay manga, no hay novela ligera en la que se base, este es un proyecto original. Hubo un buen manejo en cada uno de los personajes principales, dejan clara la personalidad de cada uno y se les va conociendo conforme la historia avanza. Cada uno tiene objetivos claros, y estos van desarrollándose conforme la historia avanza. Creo que faltó un poco más de trabajo en los personajes de soporte, pero tampoco es decepcionante.Disfrute 16 / 20Un anime que en lo personal me agradó lo suficiente para pasar el rato, ya que es relajante, y no es un trabajo que debas forzarte a soportar. De hecho he visto algunas escenas más de cuatro veces, y la serie completa dos veces, pero diré que tampoco es de las mejores, y no es destacable. Puede que recomiende esta serie a alguna persona que apenas está comenzando a ver anime y quiere ver algo tranquilo para irse adaptando al estilo y el arte.General 84 / 100Una serie romántica, con comedia ligera, con algo de drama y buen diálogo, perfecta para pasar el rato, con buenos dibujos y animaciones, buen ambiente musical, y buen manejo de personajes. En general, un anime para relajarte, para pasar el rato mientras esperas a que salga un nuevo episodio de tu anime favorito, o verlo de fondo mientras juegas un videojuego. No está nada mal."", '""All it takes is a single step""There’s something about watching a school-themed romance anime that tickles your heart and brings back memories. For the really good ones, you even get to learn a thing or two from them.That’s exactly what I felt after watching Just Because!Eita Izumi’s final months as a high school was pretty much like everyone else. The thought of moving on to a new world and having all the doubts on whether you’ve done what you could in the little time you had left… These are things every one of us had gone through at least once or twice in life. You...might have planned things out ahead, but there will always be that slither of doubt forcing you to think again and see whether you’ve done things right.Meeting his childhood friends, Haruto Souma and Mio Natsume, just before graduating high school was the spark that changed his outlook into the future. But it’s not just his path that changed, his friends including Hazuki Morikawa and his kouhai Ena Komiya will end up having the future they thought was set changed.How many times has that happened to our lives? You know, those times when we’ve planned things out only for something so significant to come our way and force us to think everything over. How do we adapt to these changes? What if a piece of the past returned and you’re suddenly at a crossroad?Just Because! revolves around the changes that occurred in the lives of our 5 main characters, each having a personal dilemma to overcome. From getting accepted to a college, to making sure a club doesn’t get terminated, their stories become intertwined in a spectacular fashion that makes my heart pound as I wait for what’s next.With this context, the show was able to remind me something I still go through from time to time:When faced by a challenge, when asked to decide, how do you convince yourself to take a step forward? Most of us here put a lot of thought into thinking what’s best to do to resolve our problems but end up hesitating to take the next step. Why? Because the future is a dark world that no one sees. Every step you take is a gamble in life. Just like in a lottery, the chances of having the future you pictured is as slim as winning the jackpot.Despite all the complexities involved in our decisions in life, the longer we hold things, the worse our problems become. No obstacle is overcome by keeping silent and doing nothing. Somewhere along the way, we should take the risk and take that one step forward.---Just Because! may not have the most unique of storylines among romance animes, but how they were able to fit in a slow-paced story into a 12-episode seasonal anime without making any episode feel dull or rushed is highly commendable.The character progression was perfect. PERFECT. Regardless of whether you felt that the ending was bitter or sweet or a bit of both, no one can deny how the show perfectly shows the changes in each of the characters while having a short timeline to work with.The visuals were great. Perfectly placed shadows, crisp landscapes, moving background characters all account into having a treat to the eyes of the viewer.There was minimal use of audio in scenes but it definitely works, especially since dialogues between characters are of the essence in this anime.In all, I am left impressed and both wanting more but satisfied with how things ended. This anime is bordering a masterpiece of romance and slice of life.

For me the train represented their journey. I read this from someone he said""the trains represent that they will be going somewhere but they don\'t know yet"".

I was all excited and shi when I noticed Komiya started to have feelings for Izumi and the way it started and evolved was just... real. I may be exagerating when I\'m saying that Komiya\'s character was amazing, but she\'s probably one of the best ""just a second girl used to make up a love triangle...with the mc and his crush so their couple progresses and evolves and this second girl gets rejected even though she had the most authentic feelings"". What I mean is that Just because! failed to break the cliché of the love triangle problem and just ended as a basic, average anime. I don\'t understand when will they finally get it that we\'ve had enough of 3rd characters getting put in the romance just to do drama (even that, it couldn\'t do it with originality). Both Mio and Komiya are valid options, but I think that Komiya was a better match. Even the goat Haruto said it. I blame the author for ruining this. We could\'ve seen Natsume\'s character more in depth, as well as Haruto and Morikawa\'s relationship and... every other character too xd.There is a big problem with the characters, because it just felt like they were unrelatable in any kind : barely developped, no social interactions between the friend group shown, no flashback or just any information about their personal life besides the fact that they\'re students with hobbies, etc. Dull asf too especially Eita, who disappointed me because I thought we\'d get another type of mc like hachiman, but he was just some cringe sociopath.

This is helped especially by the voice acting and dialogue, undoubtedly the highlight of the experience.The biggest point of contention lies in the outcome of the story.

For the FMC that a lot of people hate, honestly i don't really hate her because i know how hard to forget our first love and the fact that she doesn't do anything to make Haruto notice her feeling since her middle school until high school maybe because our FMC still doesn't really understand if she was falling in love with Haruto or just happy because someone help her.

Did I like it? Not quite, but I didn't hate it too. I continued watching it because I didn't like to drop it, that's all.Coming to the story, it's your generic school romance. There's a transfer student, there's the beautiful school council president, a nosy kouhai and some good friends. What unfolds is a story so expected that anyone could have predicted the outcome. Transfer student Eita loves the president Mio, and the other characters dangle around them. There's the red string of fate theme, which I...don't hate at all and the outcome? Let's just say the best girl wins.The art was fantastic, barring the last epsiode. The nature shots, character details and lighting, everything was excellent.As for the sound, no matter what others say, Just Because! OP and ED are my favorites this season. They are just calm and soothing, the kind of music I like the most.The character is one department, where the anime stumbles. Eita is just a quite melancholic boy who doesn't show any sign of emotion. Mio is just eccentric, though she's the best girl. Komiya shows some emotion, but I still hate her for her nosy attitude and as for Morikawa, she's just a plain idiot. Sorry for the harsh words, but she's just so stupid that I felt like wanting to go and slap her if I could.Now for the conclusion. If I could watch the anime again by binging it, I could have raised my scores a bit, but for a seasonal where you have to wait for a week, Just Because! was horribly boring for the first two episodes. The first episode is so bad, that I wanted to drop it. Fortuntately, it starts to gain pace afterwards and does justice. The last episode was also horrible and the last scene? Oh my god, I wanted to kill the director. Destroying all that he built up with some cringy old plots and carefully executed misdirections.Long story short, if you are a romance fag like me, go watch it and cheer for Mio and hate Komiya. If you have better things to do, or consider yourself an elitist, don't bother watching Just Because!I know this review is more of a rant, and less of a review, but sorry I couldn't help it.

Komiya shows some emotion, but I still hate her for her nosy attitude and as for Morikawa, she's just a plain idiot. Sorry for the harsh words, but she's just so stupid that I felt like wanting to go and slap her if I could.Now for the conclusion. If I could watch the anime again by binging it, I could have raised my scores a bit, but for a seasonal where you have to wait for a week, Just Because! was horribly boring for the first two episodes. The first episode is so bad, that I wanted to drop it. Fortuntately, it starts to gain pace afterwards and does justice. The last episode was also horrible and the last scene? Oh my god, I wanted to kill the director. Destroying all that he built up with some cringy old plots and carefully executed misdirections.Long story short, if you are a romance fag like me, go watch it and cheer for Mio and hate Komiya. If you have better things to do, or consider yourself an elitist, don't bother watching Just Because!I know this review is more of a rant, and less of a review, but sorry I couldn't help it. Fresh from watching the last epsiode I wrote this, and you'll probably understand once you watch it too."", ""I liked the side characters more than the main couple. The MC was boring af no much substance and neither a personality. The art was decent but atleast they made the MC look the part. Sound was generic. Characters were meh. I did enjoy it but didn't feel much emotion or anything special from it. Overall it was a good anime but I can't recommend it cause there are better anime in the genre which is worth your time. I watched a few episodes of this anime a while back, I think it was just before I took a long break from anime. I probably...watched like 3 eps and stopped. When I came back, I was looking for an anime in this genre and came across this and I had no clue I had watched the anime before, basically what I wanna say is this anime isn't very memorable. watched like 3 eps and stopped.

Lupin III: Honoo no Kioku - Tokyo Crisis,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1437/Lupin_III__Honoo_no_Kioku_-_Tokyo_Crisis,"[""This Lupin the 3rd movie doesn't really have much that sets it apart from the rest of the series. The only odd things about the movie is that for all but ten minutes of the movie, Goemon doesn't have his sword, and Jegan's toothache keeps him from shooting straight. One good thing this particular movie does is that you get to see into Inspector Zenagata's personal life and his motivations for doing what he does. Other than that though, it's a pretty average Lupin movie. "", 'Of all the Lupin animated features that the saga has had in its long history, this one is my top favourite. It embodies all the elements that make up a great Lupin tale, but also stands out as being different from a normal expected Lupin tale. And it\'s just so much fun to see, too! Not since the Miyazaki era has there been a Lupin story that has been as entertaining as this one.The story is the standard for a ""soft-boiled"" Lupin tale: Lupin and his mates carry out a caper with Zenigata in pursuit, Fujiko has her own plans in effect, and then everyone...gets sidetracked by an innocent\'s plight who they help out against the bad guy troubling them. While it\'s the basic status quo, it\'s told competently and well and provides a great blend of action, comedy, danger and fun that engages and entertains.What makes this a refreshingly different story for Lupin fans, is that the focus is on the tenacious Inspector Zenigata, an underrated character in the Lupin saga. Zenigata is famously portrayed as a comical figure that Lupin loves to make a fool of, but what most fans overlook is that it takes a master cop to catch or even catch up with a master thief. This feature gives Zenigata an excellent display of serious intelligence and bravery and prove himself a real hero to Maria, this story\'s supporting female.Consequently this sidelines Lupin and his gang, a little uncomfortably but not unreasonably. The master gunman Jigen is hampered by a toothache, the master swordsman Goemon loses his sword and gets utterly emasculated, and Lupin and Fujiko are seriously outmatched by the villain, businessman Michael Suzuki. It serves in making Suzuki more dangerous and unstoppable, and his campaign is made more sinister by Maria experiencing visions of a terrible future... Of course the heroes manage to save the day and pull off their caper, but it\'s not really a victory unless their enemy was a serious threat.The artwork is wonderful for a 1990s anime, the voice cast is reliable (in both the original Japanese and English dub), and the music is jazzy in both an exciting and mellow manner. It\'s a great ride to go through, and anyone who wishes to learn of Lupin III would be well advised to start off with this story. gets sidetracked by an innocent\'s plight who they help out against the bad guy troubling them.

Tokyo Crisis is formulated beautifully to the beats of The Castle of Cagliostro. Lupin seeks a mysterious treasure under the guard of a nefarious aristocrat; glorious chase scenes follow; an innocent damsel is tied up with the mystery; political pressure on the always-resolute Zenigata causes him to despair, yet he pursues his sense of duty outside the law; Fujiko seeks the treasure by her own means; Jigen and Goemon exist as running gags rather than as primary characters. One could accuse it of imitation, but the fate of a long-running franchise is to perpetually tell the same story....The key to keeping it interesting is not in total differentiation, but in the creativity of the action sequences and in the different ways one can play with the distinctive characters. After all, the audience is here for the love of the formula... and for the sheer cool factor.G.K. Chesterton wrote in his first Father Brown mystery, “The criminal is the creative artist; the detective only the critic.” Indeed, what would Sherlock Holmes be without a meticulous crime to meticulously unravel? We admire Holmes—or Hercule Poirot, or Philip Marlowe, or Lieutenant Columbo for that matter—for his amazing, complex deductions; but the crime is the sole reason the deduction was either amazing or complex. This was the genius of Leblanc's original Arsene Lupin tales: the reader gets the thrilling creativity straight from the artist, rather than secondhand through the magnifying glass of the sleuth. Tokyo Crisis carries on Leblanc's tradition in its anime ways; fanciful gadgets, amusing disguises, and absurd acrobatics are its raison d'etre—excuse my French. The beauty of animation is that you can bring the most whimsical of schemes to life.Tokyo Crisis has a primary focus on the beloved, bumbling, steadfast Inspector Zenigata. Though his obsession with capturing Lupin carries his relevance to the franchise, his true duty is to the honor and justice of law. The man of wholesome integrity might just seem like a foil to the crooked master thief, if not for their constant teaming up. Though Zenigata favors order and Lupin favors excitement, they both believe in objective justice. One puts aside his institutional loyalties and the other puts aside his debauchery in order to stop the truly dastardly doings from succeeding. However, Tokyo Crisis does end—with a little help from our friends—in the success of law enforcement over the corrupt antagonist. It's a breath of fresh air from recent titles' more cynical conclusions, and a pleasing little win for the frequently disappointed Zenigata.When the perversions, political absurdities, plot holes, and convoluted intrigues of the current Lupin III seasons fatigue you; old specials have a way of recovering one's weary fandom. Tokyo Crisis is a joyful experience that exemplifies everything that makes the Lupin III franchise great. All Lupin fans need to watch it, and can absolutely use it as an introduction for Lupin newbies. Watching The Castle of Cagliostro and following it up with a mediocre anime episode can give the impression that Miyazaki is exceptional and the rest of the franchise is empty of value. Miyazaki certainly is exceptional, but Lupin and co. can do quite well for themselves without him. I'm ready to retract my claim that heroism no longer belongs in the franchise—you just need to do it right. What a lovely reminder that writers can do things right.

The special delivers his traditional buffoonery early on so that he can later be a badass without it detracting from the character history. Which I think is important because with Lupin being a ridiculously amazing thief, his opponent (even if a quarter of the time they end up more friendly than enemies) needs to be top notch too. This one features a lot of Lupin and Zenigata working together, which I have to admit I am a fan of. But don't worry, the dynamics are back to...normal by the end. However, as the special focuses on Lupin and (separately) Zenigata, that doesn't leave much development time for Jigen and Goemon. Jigen...has a toothache. And Goemon...has lost his precious sword. Not much going on there. Although I have to admit, once those two things are resolved it's pretty funny.The art? Much better than I expected, considering it came out of the 90s. Compare it to the Harimao special which came out just 3 years earlier and you'll see a drastic difference. My only complaint is that no matter what the special so long as it's out of the main series, the animators seem to have difficulty animating anything in a style similar to the main characters, which leaves a bad taste in the mouth since they look like they're from different anime than everyone else in the special.The sound? Once again we get the off the wall English dub with completely different pronunciations of the names that were established, for example, for many many episodes in the second series (and even the video game). That really grinds my gears every time I hear names or voice acting that just seems out of place. normal by the end.

Mahoutsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto: Natsu no Sora,https://myanimelist.net/anime/4483/Mahoutsukai_ni_Taisetsu_na_Koto__Natsu_no_Sora,"[""Every now and then, anime shows us a world wherein people smile more often than they do in actuality. From the very opening sequence of Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto - Natsu no Sora it becomes apparent that it is one of those precious shows.Though it seems a sequel to the 2003 Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto, they only share the same fictional rendering of Japan and it is not necessary to have watched the earlier show to appreciate Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto - Natsu no Sora (hereinafter, Natsu no Sora), as all characters and most of the setting have changed.Within...the fictional universe of Natsu no Sora, magic is real. So much so, in fact, that it is considered a commodity and performing magic is a service industry. While the ability to perform magic is still a rare gift, the presence of mages is part of society, meaning that the populace at large will not be stupefied when witnessing it. The interaction of magic and society as a whole is touched upon: the show makes it known that there are laws and regulation for performing magic and that all mages must be registered, and mention is made of magic being used in national defence. Yet what the viewer is presented with is smaller-scale magic used in the practice of everyday life. The magic we see is of a constructive kind, sweet and helpful: broken chinaware is mended, lost items are retrieved, dolphins stranded on the beach are helped back into the ocean.The magic itself being rather small in scale and quite homely, it becomes clear that it's an extra, something that enhances the plot instead of shaping it. What the show mainly presents us is a glimpse in the life of a small number of mages in training who receive their education during the Tokyo summer. Protagonist Suzuki Sora, a kind, smiling and innocent 15 year-old, fresh from a country town in Hokkaido, and a few of her classmates that have converged in Tokyo for a few weeks are mostly seen wandering parts of the city and taking in the sights of summer.For most of the show, the actual happenings consist of the achievements and failures of the mages as they try their hand on professional magic and of the interactions they have with each other and the inhabitants of the city. All is calm and gentle, devoid of the outrages of joy and tragedy so prevalent in most shows, and the story happily takes a backseat and shows us the characters' discoveries of small-scale wonders such as a street corner singer who sings for a daily growing audience, the diverse sights of a shopping mall and the sunset over the sea at Enoshima. There are a few cheap jokes added, but since, for once, these manage not to be to someone’s expense they actually enhance the general cheerfulness.And, slowly, it shows us how the characters get to know each other better, their feelings evolving into friendship and a sweet and innocent puppy love. Of course, not all goes well all the time, and the characters have to struggle with failure in their training and the small fights and arguments that will certainly erupt between people, but most of the time things can be talked over without having to resort to emotional outbursts, as the show takes for granted that everyone will, in the end, try their best to help out in any way they can.One would suppose that having a romantic relationship enter would steal the focus away from the cheery setting, infusing it with sudden passion and emotion that comes too late for a show of this length. Sadly, it does, even managing to have one of the protagonists have one of the very standard and clichéd secrets that almost promised to destroy any developed story. Natsu no Sora, however, has the good graces not to have this come to the forefront for too long and without too much fuss once more embraces the highly satisfying happiness of summer.Given how much time is spent showing parts of Tokyo in summer, it should be no surprise that the art is gorgeous. Consisting mostly of photographs with a thin animated overlay, the background show us diverse sights of a city bathed in sunlight and occasional shadow. Superimposed on these stills is the hustle and bustle of people going their business, cats yawning and stretching and traffic moving purposefully. All these latter elements are drawn in a rather minimalist animation style which contrasts sharply with the realism of the background and makes it quite clear what the focus of the eye should be upon. In very many cases, this focus should be on the smiling faces of the people inhabiting this fictional world.The main characters as well are devoid of many details. Their facial features consist of rather simple lines, angles and curves, giving all of them a distinct facial shape accompanying their personalities. This lack of detail gives them very clear expressions, a wide range of which are visited. Lips and lip sync are done very well, yet ever better are the many shots in which the camera's focus is on a character not speaking but replying only by means of her visible expressions. Moreover, what the characters lack in detail they gain in a very well developed sense of poise, the way they're standing, walking and sitting oozing personality, be it shuffling in a slump or happily moving with a spring in the step.As varied and contrasting as the major art styles are is the music. Natsu no Sora has one of the more diverse soundtracks of the series coming out lately, with music ranging from a cheery flute and fiddle, via the rock/pop of the street corner singer, who we hear singing a different song every few episodes, to what the show itself describes as 'British new wave electro'. Despite the variety, most songs are happy or uplifting, with only a very few sadder pieces added to the mix. To this diversity is added a distinct way of using it: music is considered a part of the background and often switches with the elements of setting show. An example of this switching, which is by and large done exceptionally well, is the aforementioned shopping mall, where the music changes with each shop visited, culminating in silence on a floor that is empty.The best element of the sound in Natsu no Sora, however, would be the use of voices. Unlike most shows, the camera doesn't always focus on the person speaking, showing equally often the listener, resulting in the voices coming from outside of the screen. This enhances both the feeling of being in the conversation and the effect of noting the expressions visible on the faces of the listeners. Moreover, many sounds coming from elements outside of the screen altogether add to the idea that the show is set within a living, breathing world.As said above, characters are easily distinguished graphically and are able to express a wide range of emotions. Most characters of importance are fairly young and innocent kids who spend their days in pleasant companionship, though, of course, they all have quite distinct personalities that blend well together even if these are somewhat clichéd: from the sweet and innocent Suzuki Sora and the initially brooding yet kind-hearted Midorikawa Gouta to the domineering but insightful Asagi Honomi. Most of the characters are also given a personal quirk, which is something of a cheap shot yet works remarkably well to give them personality. A good example would be Asagi’s tendency to always call people by both their family and given names. Most importantly, because all of the characters are, by and large, kind and content folk, talking in pleasant tones and properly polite, the few times that their rawer emotions come out are special and memorable and, hence, have far more of an impact than even the most dramatic scenes from most other series.Natsu no Sora is a show that moves slowly through summer days, both of the city and of the characters, and that shows the best both have to offer. We are invited to simply take a look around and see the simple beauty in many small things, leaving for a while those issues of importance that elicit stronger feelings. Calm and cheerful conversations, subdued and down-to-earth negative emotions and an innocent love are bound to make you smile for a bit and help you recuperate from the generally completely irrational outbursts of emotion most other shows bombard you with.Sweet, simple and charming it makes you look upon a potato harvest, city highlights and a sweet girl's smile with the same feeling of contentedness. the fictional universe of Natsu no Sora, magic is real.

If those are you type of genre then this is the show for you.  Very relaxing to watching and no viewer stress.  The story is a simple story about a girl, named Sora, becoming a full-fledged mage and her journeys to becoming one.The ArtBackground hard is just stunning.  Although, that would be a given since they are actual photos of the real world.  Some may say this is a downer because it makes the producers lazy, but for me it really won me over.  I love that style of background....My only complain about the art is the character design when drawn in as if they were at a distance.  They just don't look very fluid.  But we I can't let that pass.  The characters when really close up are quite well done, especially if you want episode 02 or even the ED, they put in a lot of effort to draw in &quot;singing&quot; lips.The BenifitNever been to Tokyo? Want to learn more of it? Well this show definitely has a lot of that.  You get to travel with Sora to several different spots in Tokyo! Learn a few areas in Tokyo along the way.  The culture lessons aren't as focused as some shows like Minami-ke Okawari or Gintama, but there's definitely some stuff in here you won't hear about in other animes.NoteMy first review!

So for a spin-off to get a 10, is even more-so impressive.Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto ~Natsu no Sora~ is not an ordinary anime by any means. I have no idea why it would be rated as 7 or below by so many people unless they are incapable of viewing this for what it truly is.As a very picky anime viewer, I must say that the art work in Mahou Tsukai...ni Taisetsu na Koto ~Natsu no Sora~ is impeccable. I found it interesting that the characters were drawn so simply while the atmospheres they were in were so vastly realistic, and in some case, downright cinematic and photographic. The amount of detail and precision in the artwork is fundamental to the stories depth and the intellectually of the whole anime as a product.  If you love great art in anime\'s, you will love going through each episode and trying to guess which scene was filmed, which was photographed, and which was a mix of drawing, photography, and film. It\'s not easy at all to fit all of these components together and make it worth watching, but this anime achieves it so well that it has SPOILED me for many other anime\'s. My expectations have increased so much more than they were before.Story wise, it\'s simple. Not dumb simple, not plain or ordinary or boring simple. It\'s classic simple. It\'s rich in detail, rich in curiosity,  and pleasurable to the mind. Instead of dragging you on a million mind bending twists and turns to distract you from the flaws of the anime (in my opinion there are almost NONE), it gives very well chosen moments to leave you going ""wait, what just happened"" and as in my case, gripping your pillow in eagerness to find out what\'s developing. The story may seem slow paced to some, but have patience, the entire point of this anime is patience. Learn to love it for what it is. It is art, it is the emotions and fears that we all have somewhere inside of us.Character development is basic. I like that. Yes I love character growth, and this anime does have it, quite a lot of it actually. It\'s subtle though, natural. Like real life. No one changes from one day to the next, and a good anime will remind us that not even magic can change someone from night to day. An individuals maturity develops over time, and the pace of this anime makes it so that we grow with the characters too. In all of its efforts to display the characters as real as possible, Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto ~Natsu no Sora~ has succeeded. Their faces are sometimes simple, not overly done. This allows us to really know them for their stories and personalities, and not for the surface alone.Overall, this has now become one of my top five favorites, and I\'m so stubborn about anime that really, it takes a very good anime to make me budge on any of my current favorites, but this one just bumped one of them off and it\'s a spin-off for goodness sake.I\'ll say this much though, since I\'ve praised it to death. Not every anime fits every person. I do suggest watching this, as much as I suggest watching Beck or Noein, but if you don\'t enjoy it, it doesn\'t make you any less deep than anyone else. Everyone develops at a different rate. If you don\'t like it now, you might like it in 10 years, maybe never, but it just might help you figure out where you stand on art, affection, and cultural exploration. These are all pretty great things.Enjoy! ni Taisetsu na Koto ~Natsu no Sora~ is impeccable.

However, it does have a similar feel as Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto and story arc.  However that's about it, Natsu no Sora takes a very Humanistic approach to Anime. You might even go further by saying that it is simply a story about the human condition, told with the help of Magic to illustrate important aspects of our struggle. I was very impressed with the very loving and calm nature of the main character Sora Suzuki. Her purity and naivety really...set up some truly transcendent moments. The blend of music and amazing cgi graphic art really drove this story home for me.  I've read complaints from other reviewers that the 2d characters placed into this almost realistic cgi atmosphere didn't mesh right.  I just thought this series was amazing.  The story is not fluid, every episode stands on it's own, but in the end all paths meet beautifully.  I did feel like I wanted more, but realized that this series had already made me travel through so many ranges of emotion that I can't help but feel this work did an amazing job in the Mahou category. The beauty of this work was in it's very simplistic and  subtle method of story telling which used a really great musical soundtrack to set the mood, along with it's message of peace and love for one other and the earth.  There was a lot of Transcendentalism and or Shinto/Buddhist philosophy behind the core morals of this creation. The  Only criticism I have with this work was that it's simplistic approach really became hard to watch around the third episode. It took me a while to finally finish this one because it stalled episodes 3-8, but then began to get really interesting again after that.  I kept waiting for something really dark or evil  to occur to off balance all of the good, but nothing really ever developed.  If you've ever seen the french movie &quot;Innocence&quot; this series has very similar approach and feel. set up some truly transcendent moments.

It is impossible to not love the stories' protagonist Sora Suzuki, she is a lovely young girl of 12 or 13 and drawn with amazing expressiveness for an anime.  I also really enjoyed the performance of her friend Gouta Midorikawa.  It seemed appropriately dramatic and realistic.For me, the story had some serious flaws that are hard to forgive.  One of the main supporting characters in Sora's circle of friends, Asagi Honomi, is constantly harsh and high-and-mighty.  She is paired up with Kuroda...Kouji who obviously likes her, but she never gives him a chance to get close to her.  She misses no opportunity to criticize him, yet he still seems to pine after her.  I wish the relationship had been allowed to progress to a final conclusion that the viewer could understand.  Also, the classroom teacher is always formal and never breaks from this demeanor.  Where is her humanity?  Why is the assistant instructor so odd?  We never get an explanation.  Finally, the ending is sad.  Very, very sad.  Almost pointlessly unnecessarily aggravatingly sad.  Why did it have to end this way?  Why???  What is it with the Japanese story writers and their preoccupation with train-wreck story endings?  I am deducting another point from Story for this alone.Still I recommend watching the series.  It ends too soon, but it is fun while it lasts.

This series mostly serves as a slice-of-life title delving into the everyday developments faced by Sora and her classmates as they study up and improve their magic to earn their mage's licenses. The series features a likeable cast of characters with differing issues concerning their abilities as potential mages and personalities that the show usually...takes time to explore. Like the previous series, the show also goes into depth exploring the personal matters of whomever Sora and other mages help out with their magic which consist of anything from unlocking a vault containing a family heirloom to trying to get dolphins washed up upon shore back into the ocean. The major rough spot for the show comes in the final episodes when something terminal effects one of the characters which felt more like a cheap excuse to toss in drama due to the lack of foreshadowing and genuine suffering seen of said mentioned character throughout the series as the series was otherwise mostly relaxed and mellow in its mood before said events occur.On the visual end, Someday's Dreamers: Summer Dreams is a bit of a mixed bag. The settings are impressive sporting photorealistic detail and beautiful on the eyes, though these shots are mostly used as background stills when characters are moving through in a scene and scenery shots that do feature camera movement are mostly hand drawn in similar quality as the plain looking designs used for the characters. Animation quality is also hit-or-miss as well. While character movements and moments of magic being used are reasonably fluid, the series occasionally gets choppy in properly conveying details for character designs and scenery during ranged camera shots. The show's soundtrack mostly consists of mellow and low-key indie music that fit in perfectly with the mundane developments faced by the show's characters and are great to listen to.Overall, Someday's Dreamers: Summer Dreams is not too different from its predecessor from five years earlier featuring the aspiring efforts of a teen from the countryside to bring happiness to others while trying to be licensed as a mage. Despite its shoddy developments for its final episodes and a mixed bag of a visual presentation, the series still makes for a solid slice-of-life title to look into exploring the unique developments of Sora and her classmates as aspiring mages. takes time to explore.

Technically, it’s the second part of the series but it’s also the one I was asked to review and it looks like it’s set in the same universe as the first, but unrelated. Hal Film Maker handled the adaptation. You may remember them as the studio behind such anime as Bottle Fairy & Dokuro-chan. Given that one of those was quite good and the other was shite, I don’t know what to anticipate. So, let’s just look and see.Story:We open with our heroine, Suzuki Sora, being accepted...into a month long program to become a mage. Because, apparently, magic exists in this world and you can master it in a month. That’s something that immediately bothers me. Being a mage is presented as a great thing that opens up all kinds of doors for you or that can, in and of itself, serve as a comfortable career. But they recruit for it by having a bunch of sixteen year olds study for a month. This world is kind of dumb. From there, we see Sora and her classmates go through the training.The most pervasive issue with the series is simply that it’s kind of boring. We’re watching a bunch of under-written characters do relatively mundane things. Which you might think is strange when the series involves magic, but we’re looking at requests to “clean up my messy house and find this thing” or “open my safe.” It’s not exactly a dynamic, exciting way to use magic. The closest we get to that is Sora stopping a crashing vehicle in the very beginning. Which is not reflective of how magic is used for the rest of the series.The romance is also a bit rubbish. You know there’s going to be a romance the moment Sora’s friend talks to her about how she “needs a boyfriend.” You also know who it’s going to be because he’s the “kind of distant” type of dude that makes for a very trite romantic interest. The actual set up for the romance is pretty bad though. It’s pretty much “they’re living together during their training and sometimes they faff about Tokyo together.” But there’s never any chemistry betwixt them nor is there a real sense of development for their relationship.The closest the series gets to being interesting is having Sora go beyond her clients’ magic requests to try and make their lives better. At those points, the series shows what it could have been. They aren’t great scenes but they’re, at the very least, decent. All two times we see that happen.Characters:I already mentioned the characters being under-written, which is a big part of the series itself being boring. Slice of life style series work when the characters are either funny and endearing or really well developed and compelling. This series has characters that are just archetypal. They aren’t interesting nor is the series funny. Which not only makes the series uninteresting but renders the tragic element ineffective.Art:The artwork doesn’t help the series. The facial expressions are highly lacking with most scenes giving the characters blank looks. A lot of the art is fairly minimalistic. With details being left out like the animators were on a severe time crunch and could never actually finish an episode properly. Don’t get me wrong, it doesn’t look bad, just kind of lazy.Sound:This series got some actors I’ve heard before and have respect for the abilities of. Like Hanazawa Kana, Inoue Marina, Namikawa Daisuke & Takahashi Mikako. The direction in this, however, is not very good. They’re clearly going for slow, deliberate delivery but a lot of the time the result is that the characters sound bored. Rather like I was watching the series. The music is the best element in the series. There’s an ongoing thing with a blonde woman, voiced by the singer Sasao Miku (micc), performing songs. And they’re really good.Ho-yay:There’s one part where some random background character I can’t remember the name of says he’s fallen for the male lead. Which might or might not be him joking. It never comes up again so it doesn’t really matter.Areas of Improvement:Have the program for becoming a mage take longer. You don’t have to show us the whole thing, but a month for that is dumb.Either lose the romance entirely or properly develop it. I don’t really care which but as is, it’s not interesting or well handled.Focus more on Sora going beyond to try and help her clients. Like I said, these moments are where the series is most interesting. If you had her trying to help improve clients’ lives as a bigger part of the series, this could have been a decent anime.Final Thoughts:Ultimately, this is not a good series. It’s not interesting. The artwork and animation come across as lazy. The directing results in bland performances and the characters are under-written. That being said, I can’t say the series is bad. Most of my issues come down to it being boring and seemingly lacking any effort into making it anything but trite. So, I’ll give it a 5/10. If the premise of mages training for a month to do minor errands with magic seems interesting to you, go ahead and try it. Overall, I don’t recommend it though.

But oh well, it is still a great series.The story is basic, the setting is like the first season, unique, but the plot itself is pretty cliche. Not that it's bad, but as the first season, it didn't use its unique settings to its power.Characters are pretty forgettable but at least the main ones are great. I love Sora and Gouta, though I wish they had a bit more interaction. Like, 12 episodes but their interaction isn't even 4 episodes long.Animation is decent. It's fluid but it isn't consistent enough.Music is really great. First...impression, I was disappointed. Season 1 had bangers but then season 2 is like this???

The comedy is also decent, it hits sometimes and not sometimes. The meat and potatoes here though is the character's emotion. They felt real though albeit forgettable.Overall, it's a great series.

Directed by Osamu Kobayashi. Animation by Hal Film Maker.Music: Opening theme is “Fly Away” by Thyme. Closing theme is “Kawaita Hana” by Micc.Duration: 12 episodes....Adapted from the Manga written by Norie Yamada and illustrated by Kumichi Yoshizuki.Synopsis:In an alternate reality, magic is another resource regulated and controlled by the government. All magic users must be registered. Use of magic for personal reasons is strictly prohibited, and severely punished. Requests for magic intervention are made to the Bureau of Magic, which then assigns a mage a carry out the request. Young people showing magic abilities are trained at Schools run by the Bureau. During this time, student mages are apprenticed in an established office, where they live and work with a experienced mage, as well as taking classes at school.Suzuki Sora has had one ambition. To become a mage! She is accepted into the Bureau’s Central Training School, in Tokyo.Country girl in the big city, Sora becomes lost on her first day, and is late to her first lesson. On the way, she has used her magic to prevent a dreadful road accident, holding a petrol tanker in midair after it comes off a fly-over, preventing it from landing on an old woman, and a teenage boy. This is the first indication we have that Sora is a very powerful magic user. Chided for her lateness, and personal use of magic, Sora is downcast when she finally makes it to her new home. This Mage Office is home to two experienced mages, and both have students this year. The following day, Sora meets her fellow student, Midorikawa Gouta. The boy whom she saved the day before! She finds out at class that he can’t use magic very well, and the other students look down on him.So Sora’s training progresses! Classes at the Bureau. Mage requests with her mentor. Each request reveals some thing new about Sora, and her use of magic. In the evenings, and at school, there are conversations with the mages, and with her new friends.All the students are tested by their apprenticeship, and some find it harder than others. Sora herself always fulfils the requests made of her (although she does need the assistance of her mentor at least once), but her own view of the world compels her to add a little twist or nudge to change the people that she meets.At first strained and awkward, Sora and Gouta soon get to know each other, and Gouta’s grasp of magic increases dramatically with Sora’s help. Slowly and subtly, the feelings between them grow stronger until everybody sees them as a couple, and they finally go out on a date to the seaside.However, Sora is hiding a terrible secret. A secret that will take her home to Hokkaido, and away from Gouta for ever!Characters:Suzuki Sora. (Voiced by Hanazawa Kana)Sora is a kindly, open hearted girl, whose father died a while before the story opens. She lives with her Mother, and dog, in the small rural community of Biei in Hokkaido. She does small magical favours for her friends & neighbours, and dreams of becoming a proper mage, like her father. She delights in the wonders of Tokyo, although she is initially overwhelmed by it’s size and complexity. She is especially delighted by the way the streets come alive at night with small shops, street entertainers and restaurants. She believes that her gifts should be used to help people.Midorikawa Gouta (voiced by Maeno Tomoaki)Gouta’s father fell in love with, and then married, a girl who hated magic, and mages. As a result, he hid his powers, and never became a practicing mage. Gouta is understandably surprised when he receives the summons to training at the Bureau of Magic, and struggles with his new found powers. He is at first unable to complete even the simplest of magical tasks, despite the fact that he obviously has a lot of power. He never received the early training that the others all got at home. Living in the same house with Sora is at first a trial for him, but she gradually wins him over, and things get easier for him when she shows him the way to unlock his power.What do I think?A little gem of a series that I loved from start to finish!Not to everybody’s taste, the pace of the series is really quite slow, and almost dreamy in places. The characters develop very naturally, and you can almost feel yourself sharing the breakfast table with the mages and their students.The title translates as “Things that are precious to a mage”, and we certainly find out that each of the mage students have different ideas of what is important.You also get a feel for the society that the mages live in from the requests they have to deal with. No earth shattering monumental tasks, but the opening of a locked safe when the key has gone missing, or the finding of a lost document in an untidy room.You know that the two young mages are meant for each other, but they take a gentle and meandering path to find out for themselves. Gouta is devastated when he finally acknowledges his feelings only for Sora to seemingly betray him with her mentor. When Sora’s secret is revealed, it is like finding a wartime bomb on a holiday beach. Totally unexpected, it overturns his life completely, forcing him to take a good look at his life and ambitions.Weaving through every episode, the music fits so perfectly with the series. You even meet the “singer”, a music student who writes her own songs, and busks on street corners for experience. She sings ballads about life and love, and has quite a faithful following which gather wherever she performs.Another series that I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend, I give Mahou Tsukai ni Taisetsu na Koto - Natsu no Sora a 9/10 Adapted from the Manga written by Norie Yamada and illustrated by Kumichi Yoshizuki.Synopsis:In an alternate reality, magic is another resource regulated and controlled by the government.

Although, I wouldn't have minded if the story moved a bit slower, in my opinion the last episodes cover too many things in a short period.Art (10): Very sweet, nothing too special, but the landscapes and style is quite enjoyable.Sounds (10): If you like melancholic but...somehow happy music, you'll enjoy this, it's filled with this nostalgic sense of being so small in the streets.Character (9): Although I think each character is pretty unique by themselves and portray humanity very well, I wish some of them could have developed a bit slower.Enjoyment (10): I didn't wanted to finish it, each chapter had it's special something and the spin gave me a big, nice surprise.Overall (9.6): If you enjoy slice of life dramas, I'm sure you'll like it, it leaves an interesting bittersweet taste afterwards. somehow happy music, you'll enjoy this, it's filled with this nostalgic sense of being so small in the streets.Character (9): Although I think each character is pretty unique by themselves and portray humanity very well, I wish some of them could have developed a bit slower.Enjoyment (10): I didn't wanted to finish it, each chapter had it's special something and the spin gave me a big, nice surprise.Overall (9.6): If you enjoy slice of life dramas, I'm sure you'll like it, it leaves an interesting bittersweet taste afterwards."", 'In Someday’s Dreamers Sora, we follow the main character Suzuki Sora. She’s a young girl who has really strong and capable magical abilities. When we first meet her, she’s scared by some loud noises and uses her magic to save a falling truck, pretty incredible stuff. The next main is Midorikawa Gouta, a young man who is also a mage, but he’s incompetent at being a mage due to just finding out recently that he had the capabilities for it. There are a lot of other supports in Someday’s Dreamers Sora and many of them are mages in training.Most of the anime takes...place revolving around Sora and Gouta and what they do with their magical powers. We have episodes of back story and we have romance elements involved too. Another large aspect of the story is about becoming a certified mage, like in the original Someday’s Dreamers; the difference being that in Sora, you train in a classroom and it’s less about the politics of becoming a mage and more about the effects of being one. We witness many elements of non-mages being upset and not understanding how difficult it can be.The art style in Sora is really…. weird. Most of the art seems to be real pictures, as in, not drawn or anything, but then at other times it seems like its real pictures with a slight artistic touch. It’s the first anime I’ve ever seen that does this and it’s very unique. I’m not sure if it’s because of budget restraints or what-not, but because there were very little hand drawn art, I feel like this allowed the studio to focus on having better animation quality towards the characters and their interactions; though that’s clearly conjecture and really baseless. The animation on the other hand does seem to be good. Unlike in Someday’s Dreamers, Sora is animated much better for just about everything, though the biggest problem with Sora is that there are many repeating scenes and things of that nature. It’s all very condensed.Music: Like in Someday’s Dreamer’s, Sora has a fantastic sound track. It’s merged beauty and simplicity really lets you in on the story and adventure that’s taking place. The music is really rather good and the OP and ED are good listens too. Good Old Days… =)The only type of issue I had with Sora was how the story progressed itself. For about half of the episodes, it was very jumpy and made it hard to follow, because even though it’s episodic based, there was no real pacing and easy way to follow things. It’s not until you hit passed episode 7 or so that things fall in line in a clear manner and the story picks up.I didn’t expect the type of twist that occurred in Sora at all, I didn’t see that coming at all, so talk about a surprise. I knew there was something weird going on, but couldn’t make it out entirely. It was good and I really enjoyed the anime too, though I prefer the first one for sure.Note: I know I keep using the word magical powers, but don\'t think of the magic being like mahou shoujo type of magic, it\'s a far more ""realistic"" take on how magic would look like and be like in our world, it\'s a little flashy, but incredibly mysterious. place revolving around Sora and Gouta and what they do with their magical powers.

Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40974/Kuma_Kuma_Kuma_Bear,"[""If you like to watch every seasonal cliche fantasy or isekai then this is for you. I see a lot of bad reviews on animes like these but I love them. I've seen a lot of bad anime before and this definitely isn't one of them. Don't start watching it and expecting it to the best anime ever, just relax and enjoy.Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is a cute lighthearted run of the mill isekai fantasy anime. The main character is a lazy stay at home high school girl who is transported to the world of a game she plays. She is forced to wear a...bear costume, all her magic is bear related spells and her summons are cute bears of course. The thing I like about Yuna the most is she is very relatable and honest. Although Yuna is able to do a lot of things through her magic she stills needs help from others and she builds many relationships along the way. I really recommend if you like lighthearted fantasy anime or slice of life. Its by no means a masterpiece but I love this show. Also as a bonus the ending song is really good. This was my first review and I am not very good at them but i tried.Story: 7Art: 8Sound: 9Character: 9Enjoyment: 9Overall: 9 bear costume, all her magic is bear related spells and her summons are cute bears of course.

Specifically, RPG of the MMORPG genre are real time sinks. We find out the easy way once 15-year old Yuna is introduced to the show. As an adventurer in the online game, World Fantasy Online, she is best described as the typical nerd at home.Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is exactly what it sounds like. What it advertises is what you get and that is our main character dressed up in a bear outfit. It may...seem like a peculiar trend but with the countless amount of fantasy shows in recent years, nothing surprises me anymore. Coming into this anime gave me the impression of playing a video game as we follow Yuna on her fantasy adventure. And here’s the catcher: Yuna enjoys her life in this new world more so than the real world.World Fantasy Online is perhaps the most generic sounding game I’ve ever heard of. It’s taking the three most oversaturated words of the isekai genre and put them all in one basket. And as expected, the game itself has a colorful world setting of creatures, NPCs, characters, and of course, Yuma in a bear outfit. Despite the anime seemingly throwing everything to you at once, it’s actually pretty easy to figure out where Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is headed. The premise follows the plot and doesn’t take deep understanding to figure out the show altogether.First off, there’s Yuna, the 15-year old poster girl who is carrying this show in her bear outfit. Like most teenagers, gaming is part of her hobby but she takes it to an obsessive level. There’s charm about her character despite this unhealthy hobby because let’s face it, she’s nerdy on the outside but adorably cute on the inside. Watching Yuna solving problems such as dealing with roaming monsters in the wild, discovering treasures, or collecting certain objects reminds me of modern JRPGs. Only here, Yuna doesn’t have a main questline to get through to beat the game. At least from this anime’s plot, she’s free and builds her own life in this virtual world. And because she is so free, Yuna has come to love World Fantasy Online and the gaming culture.Make no mistake. Yuna’s no pushover when getting work done especially when judging on her combat skills. It’s actually amusing once you witness her feats in the show. Fighting monsters seems more like an annoying chore for her than an actual challenge. The anime built her character to be powerful, and by powerful, she is pretty much unrivaled throughout all her fights. I could go on to list her achievements but you’ll have to see to believe it. The bottom line is, Yuna is more than just unbearably cute. She’s a selfless girl that has the personality of a teen but also with heart of gold. She even forms some important relationships with others such as Fina and Noire. While on her adventure, you can see more of Yuna’s real personality when she interacts with these characters.With the show’s cour length being just 12 episodes, there’s concern about how the studio would handle the adaptation. Honestly, stuffing over 15+ volumes into a single cour is never a favorable impression when you know the juicy part of the franchise lies in the light novels. That being said, Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear does have a smooth pacing and flows on its own as a story. With every episode, we discover that World Fantasy Online can be a dangerous place to other adventurers. There’s monsters, bandits, and other creatures roaming around that can kill, rob, eat, and commit all sorts of sins you can imagine. Remember, it’s a fantasy story and common logic is often thrown out the window. Yuna herself represents a defiance of common sense. I mean, just asking yourself this question: how can a little girl of her size in a beat outfit be so damn overpowered?Limiting the anime to 12-episodes did set off red flags but thankfully is tolerable as you can enjoy the show for more than its length. Comedy wise, this show loves its recurring gags specifically with other characters making fun of Yuna’s bear outfit. She herself even realizes how ridiculous it looks despite the overwhelming stat advantages. Studio EMT Squared and the director designed her in such a way to sell the show’s appeal. It creates many moments of charming chemistry between the cast. The world setting itself is designed to reflect fantasy elements with the castles, dangerous creatures, and oversized bears. Even if you’re not a bear fanatic, there’s no doubt the show wanted you to experience its world.I’m sure everyone can agree that we have way too many fantasy anime every season. Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear may seem like a clone with some added twist but deep down, this is still a charming anime. Without a complex story or characterization, we are presented with a show about a girl in a bear outfit enjoying her fantasy life. Life isn’t easy in the real world but Yuna makes it look like a piece of cake in her own world. seem like a peculiar trend but with the countless amount of fantasy shows in recent years, nothing surprises me anymore.

Even if you’re not a bear fanatic, there’s no doubt the show wanted you to experience its world.I’m sure everyone can agree that we have way too many fantasy anime every season. Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear may seem like a clone with some added twist but deep down, this is still a charming anime. Without a complex story or characterization, we are presented with a show about a girl in a bear outfit enjoying her fantasy life. Life isn’t easy in the real world but Yuna makes it look like a piece of cake in her own world.', '***THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS***Sunk cost fallacy is a peculiar thing. When presented with a show I know wasn\'t going to get better, somehow some psychological effects in my brain kept telling me to soldier on and to see it to the end of this frankly mediocre as hell show. And by the tail end of it I was exhausted by it all and I\'m here right now to tell you why you shouldn\'t be like me and waste your time on this. After reviewing so many shows for close to a decade, I\'ve found it most difficult to articulate why a show is boring or...mediocre as opposed to being plain bad. And that\'s the thing, on the surface Kumax3 Bear is reasonably competent. The artstyle is fine, the girls are cute, nothing is particularly wrong about any aspect of it, and I\'m the person who\'s willing to find some value in even the most broken of shows. Kumax3 Bear doesn\'t give me any material to work with at all.Kumax3 Bear is an isekai, but one more focused on SoL than adventure or existential dread. I do enjoy slow paced SoL shows, but even if we do focus on that one aspect of Kumax4, it\'s still unable to deliver since the show does go out of its way to intersperse poorly written and very tonally contradicting drama into its show. It really reminds me of last year\'s Average Abilities Show (which by the way was below average) where the show wants you to care about its characters and world, but no one is particularly likable in the slightest when all of the show\'s conflicts can be solved easily with Yuna\'s bear powers (which the show also never shuts up about even after the nth time it\'s established). This is not to say drama or conflict has no place in an SoL, but it\'s just handled so poorly here. In order to have good drama and conflict, the viewer has to bond with at least someone from the main cast in order to empathize with the cast\'s plight, otherwise everyone comes off as some whiney jackass who needlessly antagonizes our main character for no good reason.There\'s no real reason to be particularly connected with the main character or anyone else for that matter in the show. Yuna is your typical trapped in isekai protagonist with OP powers (just bear themed this time) and no real gimmick beyond the bear theme. She\'s bland as bland can be, bringing in her modern world knowledge and OP bear powers to solve whatever problems she meets or is tasked with. Alongside her is Fina, her companion of sorts who occasionally follows her to bear witness to her impressive feats and do very little otherwise. Apart from that out of nowhere and definitely unearned yuri confession at the very end of the series, I see no reason why Fina would suddenly be so infatuated with her. The character interactions, or lack of thereof, is really poor in comparison with other similar Girl meets Girl show, and that scene right there at the end just shocked me for how sudden it was. There is no buildup, no development, no growth in characterization for these two.To paraphrase internet superstar Rich Evans, I will use the following quote to describe the comedy in this series.""There are jokes that make you laugh, okay? And then there are jokes that you have no reaction to. But every now and then there\'s a joke so bad, it makes you less laugh. Like, you\'ll just be sitting there normal, and then the joke will happen, and then you\'ll slightly less smile, even though you weren\'t smiling. And that is called Non-medy.""But really the attempts at humour are abysmal. The ""Oh look is that a bear?!"" joke was never funny the first time and it sure isn\'t funny the 100th time. As is the required by law ""Isekai Culture Shock"" gags and the ""Soy sauce? Miso? GOHAN?"" food observations that really make you wanna pause the show and ponder what went wrong with your life choices to be watching a show this mediocre 10+ episodes in just to bear witness to that observation.Kumax4 isn\'t the worst thing I\'ve watched this season (that dishonour goes to Maesetsu, a show so boring I actually had to physically stop myself from watching it), but given I had to sit through its mediocrity for about 5 of my Earth hours, I leave with this warning to not touch the show in any capacity unless you have a penchant for boring shows or if you need some sleeping aid.4/10 (How the hell is this getting a second season) mediocre as opposed to being plain bad.

Our 15 years old girl Yuna confines herself to her house playing the world\'s first VRMMO. One day, after taking a survey in the game, she receives a bear costume without any clues where, why, what to do as a bear. But she quickly recognizes the power of bears and uses it to help people in need. And so, the story of our heroic kuma begins.Real life sucks. Well…this is a point that we often cannot deny. Our main character Yuna also has...the same view and thus her journey in the fantasy world begins. She meets friends there that she really likes. Every day she experiences new adventures with them together. The poor in need are helped by her power and the limit of the evil dukes are finally shown.How does she make all of this possible? The answer is the bear costume. This present item has definitely cheat powers and can literally beat anything and anyone. Shortly after arriving the fantasy world, she saves a young cute girl named Fina from a pack of monsters. You can feel the harmony between the two girls and see that they get along perfectly. Fina guides her through the small down and after discovering the Adventures Guild, Yuna has found her destiny. She will become an adventure and fight against the evil! From an adventure without rank, she climbs them faster than lightning.Yuna is initially presented as a lazy, carefree and lonely NEET. Real life simply sucks in her opinion. She also doesn\'t care about the opinions from other people, she is doing the things she loves. Despite her somewhat anti-social demeanour, Yuna is exceptionally kind and has a certain sense of justice. She also shows a soft side towards the people she loves like Fina or Fina\'s imouto Shuri.Fina is the person saved by Yuna, not from the monsters only but everything. Meeting Yuna was the best thing could happen to her. With her help, Fina\'s mother recovered from her illness as well. Despite her young age (10), she already knows how to take care of her family. But not only Fina\'s world changed because of Yuna, instead also Yuna\'s view about the people who she really cares got in a positive way.If you are a fan of the CGDCT genre in general, you will like the style here for sure. All the girls are shown very cute. Yuna\'s life becomes more colorful through this world, which is also well represented. It is colorful and you can feel her happiness through the bright and beautiful colors. The scenes are also well animated, even those where a little fight takes place.The OP song “Itsuka no Kioku” is performed by our cute Fina aka Azumi Waki. She is also known as part of the legendary Blend S OP ""Bon Appétit ♡ S"" where she voices Maika. You can feel how happy Fina is meeting Yuna-oneechan from the music and the lyrics. She is the one who saved not only her but also her whole family and brought them the joy they deserve.But what really stays in your head is the ED song ""Ano ne"" sung by Yuna (Maki Kawase). Maybe one or the other will still remember the ""anone anone"" from the Platelets (Hataraku Saibou – Cells at Work!), which is also just too cute. We saw your stories with happiness, Yuna. With this song she shows that she would do everything to protect this world and her friends. It is a place where she is accepted and feels home.Although I am a huge CGDCT fan, I was a bit skeptical after the first few episodes. I have to admit that I found the bear costume a bit strange at the beginning. I would love to see Yuna more without it to be honest. I like her casual outfit much more. But gradually I got used to it and it didn’t bother me anymore. What really fascinates me is Yuna\'s attitude how much she is willing to help the poor and vulnerable people without expecting anything in return. I hope especially for Fina, Schuri and their family they can have a great time now, those two young ladies deserved it.Relax a little, just lean back and enjoy the adventures with our bears! See how a 15-year-old girl save the world and put smiles on people\'s faces again.I hope we will see more adventures with our kuma in the future as well! the same view and thus her journey in the fantasy world begins.

If you are fan of either of those then you can rejoice because this show combines both of them into the most painfully mediocre show you can imagine.Art: 6Pretty much standard moe art, nothing offensive, nothing special. Fights were decently animated, CGI is ok-ish.Sound: 7Only decent thing about this show. Both OP and ED are nice, voice acting is fine too.Story: 3There is almost none. It\'s your average CGDCT crossed into isekai power fantasy with grossly overpower MC. Things happen only for the sole reason...of MC being able to flex how awesome her powers are. The little quirk of bear theme can\'t build a story by itself.Characters: 2Nonexistent aside from the MC. Every other character exists either so they can fawn over the MC or to be a comically bad fodder villain.Enjoyment & overall experience: 3UnBEARable to watch...

Then we had Spring 2020\'s Bofuri, which takes the former\'s inspiration and gives it a light-hearted, cutesy ""moe blob"" twist. Now welcome to the next level with the mish-mash of both shows, and you\'ll get the result (that is) Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear. KUMA??? GAO~~~The Isekai power-fantasy genre has always been confined in a state of amassed ""love-hate"" relationships over the years since the introduction of Reki Kawahara\'s hugely popular LN series (that still to this day gets a bad rap), and many novelists have attempted to compose their own ""unique twists"" to varying degrees of successes and failures. It\'s not until...fairly recently that there has been a resurgence with the ""moe blob"" twist, starting from Bofuri (which has the overly-cliche OP character, but relatable and fun in every way). And you can take everything about that show and apply it here, not forgetting to add the ever-so-popular bear-ish CGDCT genre for an even intriguing adventure of a pure, laid-back relaxation and enjoyment in a traditional VRMMORPG-like environment.Forget what you remember of the tropes and clichés of similar shows in the past, and come along for this ride that is anything but typical. A stereotypical OP character, stemming from her lazy-bum personality who became a NEET at age 12, and never wanting to go back to the real world? Now that\'s something you don\'t hear much, and the atypical 15-year-old Yuna is just that. Being transported into the Isekai world, forced to be clothed in a black-or-white unBEARablely costume suit helming bear-able magic attacks, along with adorable and fluffy summoned beasts (white Kumakyuu and black Kumayuru), this is the adventurous story of Yuna travelling in spades, while giving off entirely different impressions of a ""heroic"" OP MC character (mostly being embarrassingly noticed because she\'s a donning a bear onesie), interacting with townspeople and imparting some assets of the real world to surprise them with wonderous mind-boggling awe. Oh, and make the ""House of Kuma"" and cook up Japanese food, just because she can and has real-world withdrawals of nostalgia to recreate.The immediate thing about Yuna (as is with Bofuri\'s Maple) is that more than just being relatable, she\'s not trying to be over-pretentious about the various situations of encounters in her journey, be it wild monster battles or exacting her sweet, sweet revenge (of Kuma attacks, Jojo style) on greedy and heartless people that take advantage of oppressing common folk in simple one-note circumstances, giving a mix of both light and dark undertones for a competent and balanced story plot structure (unlike Slime Otoko\'s). That\'s not to say that she goes through this journey alone, as the growing and budding relationships with other characters (well, mostly ""moe blob"" lolis) makes for a somewhat conventional journey, even much more enjoyable.Take for example, Yuna\'s first friend: 10-year-old loli, Fina. Living together with her younger sister Shuri and their single mother Tiermina, she is the sole breadwinner of the poverty-strickened family, and forced to take care of the family\'s circumstances, molding her character development of both responsibility and maturity at a young age (which accounts for her abnormal mentality of such a young child). It\'s not until another the Adventure Guild staff member (Uncle) Gentz does the family\'s happiness really takes off, and having a stepfather helps in the family\'s growth as well. Nice one.Along with the other characters that come in toll as the series progresses (from a single-family and an orphanage to royalty), more than just the ""coincidental"" blessings in disguise, Yuna learns a lot about the meaning of life, being true-to-honest about her own reflections of her past in the real world and living the best out of the current times. I love stuff like these that just speaks to my heart-strings, and gives me the inspiration and perseverance to keep on living (and so should yours too).Director Yuu Nobuta helms this anime project over at low-budget studio EMT Squared, and rightaway source readers see this as a ""disappointing adaptation"", due to the fact that Episode 1 was pre-screened early (started by yours truly), garnering mixed feelings from both source readers and anime-onlys due to the weird choice of pacing and the sub-par animation quality (that spawned spoilers for irrefutable reasons, that you can blame series composer Takashi Aoshima). Despite all the hoopla for a shaky start, Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear slowly but eventually found its footing and from thereon, started the progress of a fast-paced recovery that only got consistently better as time passes. Also, no matter how simplistic the visuals feel with the tag-along low-quality animation that the studio is known for, it never once feels drab and out of place, but instead creates a colourful, vibrant world that matches an imperfect-but-wonderful background setting.The OST is about as lively as you\'d expect of the familiar nature of CGDCT shows, and is more of the same in that regard. Both Azumi Waki\'s OP and Yuna\'s VA Maki Kawase\'s ED may sound quite shallow, but they sound really nice and energetic, which also gives Kuma Bear the sizable competency of a good OP/ED pairing in a season of high-quality ones.If you\'ve been looking for the seasonal ""LN Isekai power fantasy adaptation"" cliche that IS worth watching, this is for you. This anime is by no means a masterpiece (nor even a mediocre) work, but getting a mid-range sized character cast with the lore of just enjoying a likeable OP MC rage her black-and-white fists in a world accepting the ways of ""Miss Bear"", that\'s saying a lot for a show that I\'d recommend for those of you who can just turn off your brains and let loose the unBEARableness.Underrated show this is not, but it\'s at least worth a watch. *Nipah-like* KUMA~~~ fairly recently that there has been a resurgence with the ""moe blob"" twist, starting from Bofuri (which has the overly-cliche OP character, but relatable and fun in every way).

The main problem in this part is that Yuna does it all with the soulessness of a puppet. Zero personality. Perhaps she\'s an autist.After 4 episodes of that it devolves into a \'food tastes good\' anime. I don\'t know how many times people need to be reminded...that food tastes good, but this anime is here for all of it. Look, I get that Japenese people live lives intentionally devoid of most luxury and taste is one of the only things they allow themselves to become indulgent in, but jesus can we stop this trope already? almost the entire rest of the anime is her cooking food and everyone remarking how good it is. maybe they switch it up AND SOMEBODY ELSE COOKS and then everyone remarks how good it is. Occasionally you will get a ""You mean if I go beat monster X, I can eat food X!?!?"" type of scenario and it still sucks. the fights are completely lame considering she\'s so OP. literally never faces any real danger herself the entire time. She\'s also kind of a nitwit and not very efficient with using her powers. The only rule to them is she has to be thinking about bears and she doesn\'t even remember to do that most of the time.But here is the kicker, at THE LAST HALF OF THE LAST EPISODE(!) it again devolves into a pure yuri anime out of nowhere. It doesn\'t make any sense. The show itself ends on a confession that really doesn\'t get resolved. Is the bear girl a lesbian with the other little girl now? I don\'t know. I don\'t care. I was honestly wishing they would just go eat some food and talk about how good it tastes again.I find it rather confounding this thing isn\'t scoring in the 5 range. It\'s awful.

But the show takes all the dark themes away and what is left is... a kids show with only one real character. Not what I expected given all the action the book includes.If you haven't read the book, its infinitely better than the show plus it has real secondary characters.

Not in a bad sense at all, nor does it make it bad. But more so far, it seems a bit chill, a bit on the relaxing side. There is a sense of mystery behind it with it's premise. But so far, we haven't dived into that so much, besides finding out what basically works. Which is fine for the show.The show drops us off into seeing our MC in action, showing us just who she is, and what the bear suit is capable of. Though it does feel a little...disjointed, all because of it being episode 1, and then ep2 starts off explaining things. It's a bit confusing at first glance, you may think you've ended up in ep 6, rather than 1. But it does a job in showing you what is what I suppose.As for the story itself, think like Goblin Slayer in terms of an adventures guild, with all kinds of jobs that one can take, with a ranking system. But it's not just that when it comes to the story, as I said, there is a sense of mystery, as this isn't no isekai, or least it believes it's not, it's a game. So one can wonder who is behind the game, and what their goal is. It's pretty interesting to say the least. I'm expecting it to get more interesting as it goes along.As for the characters themselves, we've seen a fair few, with our MC in Yuna getting more of the spotlight, and just being chill and fun, but also quite the wonderer when it comes to everything that is going on. The other that's had more focus is Fina, who is a delight and a sweeite. I'm sure more will pop up as we go along, but fairly decent cast so far.Same can be said for the sound and art of this show. The art is colourful, and pretty. There are some dark tones when needed, but most of it is a more pretty kind that seems more friendly. While the sound is fitting for each scene.Should you give it a shot? Sure! It's looking decent so far, it won't be anime of the season, but it's certainly a good show. Give it a go. disjointed, all because of it being episode 1, and then ep2 starts off explaining things. It's a bit confusing at first glance, you may think you've ended up in ep 6, rather than 1.

The creativity to continue the bear theme is certainly impressive and the good-naturedness of the show is welcomely wholesome.Unfortunately, as the show continues it suffers from the wash, rinse, repeat of it all with little to do with character.The show itself is pretty and chose a unique palette for the art to emphasize the cuteness. It\'s a fun watch nonetheless.There really isn\'t much substance, and when compared to...other shows within this genre it also doesn\'t stand up to the mediocre ones as it can easily slip the mind and not be too memorable.It\'ll be hard for me to recommend this outside of a ""good afternoon to recharge yourself."" other shows within this genre it also doesn\'t stand up to the mediocre ones as it can easily slip the mind and not be too memorable.It\'ll be hard for me to recommend this outside of a ""good afternoon to recharge yourself.""', ""Before we get to the review this is very important in my opinion: Start episode 1 at like 20:42 once she's back in the real world. After you finish episode 3 you can go back and watch it. The truth is it makes zero chronological sense where that part is because her VRMMO avatar didn't look like that, so it takes place after she's isekai'd. Just ignore the other scene from 2:18 to 2:30 in episode 1 that briefly cuts back to the real world. Episode 4 picks up directly after the events of episode 1. Whoever set it up to start like that is...really a dummy. It makes absolutely zero sense. So just do yourself a favor and follow my advice on that one, kay?That being said it's a really wholesome anime. I can't say there's really all that much story, though things definitely do happen and it's definitely a cohesive story rather than episodic. Though it's not epic or anything by any means. It's very bingeable and super adorable.The bottom line is that there are better adorable animes and better wholesome animes and better animes in general. But if you're looking for that sorta thing and want something to watch then I don't think this one will really let you down. It won't really blow you away or anything, but it'll be a nice little show to watch.I'll say that the art isn't all that great, a 5/10 at most. Some just isn't very good. There's even a few scenes where it's just a still image with a bunch of talking in the background for like almost a solid minute before going back to stuff being animated. And some of the backgrounds and such look a little shoddy sometimes. Though it's not really distracting and they didn't use CG models. Though that being said the character design is really adorable.The characters are generally quite likeable. Though it's definitely a really wholesome kinda world that they're in where most people are surprisingly good people, with some token bad guys here and there.The MC's pretty much a Mary Sue good at everything with a near god mode cheat set of armor (the bear onesie) that gives her more power than you can shake a stick at. Like literally being able to effortlessly defeat over 10,000 monsters on her own in short order just randomly on a whim on her way somewhere. really a dummy. It makes absolutely zero sense.

If you think my opinion is bad, fair enough. With that being said, let me say this. There is no reason to watch this show unless 1) you need to add another show to you anime list 2) you really long for something chill even though it doesn\'t make sense and 3) you\'re younger than 7 years of age (which would be by today\'s standards still an insult to the...intelligence of modern children with access to the internet.)1) The show/MC (Yuna)This anime is your run of the mill isekai with a very intelligent main protagonist that, of course, trades in stocks and plays VR games and likes to be introverted most of the time. So far, so standard. What\'s the issue? Aside from this being just moe-moment-of-the-week type of anime, action scenes are not bad, everything else is kept to a pretty good standard, some corners are cut, like non-animated scenes of the landscape and of the city, animating just the characters we need to be aware of. Yuna is fine and just slightly, relatable, but I will not give out any more than that on her. You make your own judgment on her as a character, that\'s why we have our brains, not to be a flock of sheep, but think about everything we see, hear, touch, experience. I have no reason to write reviews except for ego boost and clout chasing.2) CharactersThey have a very simplistic design, Noir and Misa are forgettable at best, annoying young brats at worst. I like the character of Fina, she feels less forgettable and slightly relatable, unlike the former two. Art is standardized, meaning no matter the scene or place of the show (so far), you will be hard pressed to find anything wrong with their faces or anything of that sort. They\'re not doing much, but they always look flawless, so bonus points for ""keeping it real"". As for other characters, there\'s nothing so far to talk about.3) The sound designNot gonna lie, the fact that animation is good enough to not be a disaster or a masterpiece would make this anime just fine. But the music...as someone with a musical background, I gotta say, the music playing in the background or during action scenes, it all fits perfectly. Most of the music is fitting the general theme of the world, aka fantasy. Use of strings and reverb make some scenes more impactful and I have to stress, if the music is right, you won\'t notice it. If the music is good, you will come to appreciate and...yeah, I appreciate it. It\'s simple, but it works REALLY well.¨As for sound design concerning the action and the impact of...Kuma fists? I\'m not an expert in this field, I don\'t make sound effects, but I know SFX are made once and reused until they become noticeable and recognizable in many animes. I think around 2018 or 2019, when we started to hear explosions in anime, we started to hear this ""tearing, cracking and exploding bubbles of C4"" type of explosions. So far, I was not able to detect any similarity with other animes, but I\'m sure some of the impact SFX are being used from the soundbank somewhere in Japanese servers of animation studios.4) Opening and EDThis opening is the perfect summary of this anime, it\'s gamey, it\'s lovey-dovey and incredibly unbearable to watch even once. Nothing interesting.ED sound nice, you can vibe to it, much better than the opening, but unless you\'re a girl and like this type of music, as a guy, I can only listen to this once every 3 weeks. I\'m not into this type of the song, but it sounds good, take a listen. It\'s not industry-changing or appalling, it\'s good.Final conclusion: Don\'t watch it, you gain nothing and lose time.They try to make this anime a worthwhile endeavour to watch, but their efforts are cut short by the non-existent story and lack of any meaningful direction.

It managed to take a lot of traditional isekai tropes and throw them out the window. If you’ve ever strayed away from isekai because of generic OP MC’s, horrible plot logic or writing, harems, fan-service, etc., you will find something refreshing in Kuma Kuma bear.What I really loved the most about this show is how it focused on the real implications of being transported to another world. Yuna has to provide for herself and...ends up becoming an entrepreneur of sorts. A lot of isekai tend to skip over these details in favour of showing cool fights or introducing girls into the harem, which I also like, but it’s nice to have a change of pace and focus on things that “matter”.I think fans of Bofuri will recognise a lot of similarities between the two series, both in terms of the MC being a young cute girl and the worlds, character interactions, comedy, etc. Bofuri ended up becoming a lot more popular, probably due to it being Silver Link, while Kuma Kuma ended up under the radar. If you liked Bofuri, you will probably enjoy this too.Kuma Kuma bear was a sleeper hit of the season and I honestly can’t find anything that I didn’t like or would change about the show, other than it only being 12 episodes.

Kuma Kuma bear gets 10 bear suits out of 10.', 'I have never seen a show pull a 180 so fast and so effectively, I\'ve to talk about it.Honestly this show the previous 11 weeks used to be mindless fun, something to relax every wednesday morning, a charming protagonist helping people and learning how to interact with people, that was her only hurdle most of the season because in terms of power she started so strong in the alternate world that she didn\'t face anything on her level until her very last battle.But that wasn\'t episode 12, episode 12 was completely different but also used the same elements it established since the first episode to...deliver something beautiful.Let me explain.Yuna started as a loner that enjoyed being alone since episode 1, that was fine but it never looked like the show was gonna do anything with it, and I was okay with that, a chill show in which you just enjoy the slice of life with the occasional battles that never even have any sakuga because why would they? They aren\'t the focus, it was a simple show free of any serious issues, everything the protagonist faced wasn\'t taken seriously.So I couldn\'t see what the show was building up since the start.I noticed in one of the latest episodes our protagonist Yuna realized in a scene how nice it is to get along with people, it didn\'t last long but I thought that was a nice reminder of how much she has changed from what she used to be. It would end like that and move onto the next arc.Oh how wrong I was.Enter Fina, the first meeting she had with Yuna was considerably different to the meetings Yuna has with the rest of girls in the show, a bit hard to notice because Fina was before everyone else but now looking back in retrospective, it was kinda obvious they were setting up something back then.But that\'s the thing, in retrospective.The show did a perfect job to mask what it was setting up for 11 episodes, using adventures and battles and silly slice of life interactions with snarky remarks and good timed comedy. But everything was building up in the background.Fina\'s feelings were building up.Fina got a whole nice segment around the middle of the show about her and Yuna going out together the 2 of them and no one else. When the episode 12 preview showed its title I thought the last episode would be a repeat of that but on a much larger scale because it\'s the finale.Oh, how wrong I was.Turns out everything Yuna did until this point had consequences, namely neglecting Fina because she had to take care of all the people she knew. This wouldn\'t work if the whole show didn\'t play out as it did, we see Yuna do the things she usually does every week but this time from Fina\'s perspective, we see what she feels and what she thinks and at this point she had enough, she decides to distance herself so she can be as worthy of her presence to Yuna as all the other ""useful"" citizens are to the bear.But that\'s not what she wanted, that\'s not what Yuna wanted either.Enter Noa, all the previous bonds Yuna made through the show will always be important even if they aren\'t as important as Fina\'s, and now that the 2 main girls are distancing themselves those bonds have to help our protagonists. Noa is a delight of a character and she shines the most here, as much as she loves the bear she has to help these 2 useless lovebirds to realize what they are doing wrong.And help she does.Yuna doesn\'t understand it but she knows Fina is the only one that fills the emptiness in her heart, meanwhile Fina always knew but because she lacked courage she couldn\'t say it. When it finally happens and both let everything out and tell each other how much they want to be together, it\'s the most cathartic moment ever not only because of how the episode built up to it but also because everything that was presented since the very beginning. This wouldn\'t work if we hadn\'t seen a lonely Yuna in the first episode and how their meeting played out in 2, things that were seemingly meaningless had the strongest meanings all along.And that\'s beautiful.10/10, this show should be a guide to everyone about how to write a proper romance. deliver something beautiful.Let me explain.Yuna started as a loner that enjoyed being alone since episode 1, that was fine but it never looked like the show was gonna do anything with it, and I was okay with that, a chill show in which you just enjoy the slice of life with the occasional battles that never even have any sakuga because why would they?

We'll call it '3KB') just might be the most cutest, fluffiest and adorable-est of them all.Literally everything about this show is absolutely fucking precious. The music, the artwork, the characters, the adventures, and even the motherfuckin’ title - all of it will bombard your every sense with the purest essence of cute-itude. There is not a single moment in 3KB which is lacking in cuteness, even when...the story presents a number of unpleasant situations. The viewing experience was so cute, light, fluffy and that I felt as though I was floating in the sky on a cloud made of cute… although that might have been the drugs.Do you get the idea yet? No, you don’t. You really fucking don’t…Here is how I rated this scintillating bastion of moe:Story: 8Art: 8Sound: 10Characters: 8Enjoyment: 10OVERALL: ***9/10***STORY: The premise is indeed as simple and formulaic as one would expect from a ball of fluff like 3KB - I mean, it is an isekai story with a world based on an in-story VRMMORPG that focuses on the adventures of an OP NEET, minus Truck-kun. What sets this series apart from others in the isekai genre, though, is not only the abundance of interesting details, but just how committed it is to maintaining its specific atmosphere. While the storyline may have a flaw here and there, the progression is smooth and the mood is pretty much always maintained. This show knows what it is, knows what it does best, and doesn’t deviate too much from that.ARTWORK: I would say the artwork is about average in terms of quality; however, I personally rate it a little higher because, well, I just so happen to enjoy its overall style. Wanna fight about it, bruh?! The animation matches the content very well, and there is very little in the way of gratuitous CGI, which usually bugs the shit out of me. The character designs for the main cast had some unique qualities about them, and at least some effort was put into the supporting characters, although some do look pretty generic. In terms of aesthetics, DA BEARS is cute, polished, adorable, and cute.SOUND: This, for me, is one of the high points of the show. The first thing I noticed regarding audio quality is that I didn’t find any of the voice acting to be annoying, which could have easily happened with a CGDCT-fest like this - that alone is worth an accolade or seven. The background music, while not particularly memorable, wasn’t off-putting or distracting, and that is more than enough for me in most cases. The real bright spot, though, is the ED, which is FUCKING ADORABLE. The OP is pretty good, too, but the ED is so cute that it might lead to an overdose of sugar moe.CHARACTERS: Obviously, most of the focus is going to be on Luna, our intrepid MC and bearer of all things beary. She is a delightful protagonist, and her pursuit of the cuter, sweeter, funnerer things in life keeps the show shining brightly from beginning to end. What is even more interesting, though, is her effect on her surroundings, particularly as she gains friends & followers along the way. I won’t delve any deeper into this aspect of the series, because doing so would cross into spoiler territory - you will just have to watch and find out for yourself.ENJOYMENT: Just in case you didn’t notice, I absolutely fucking loved this show. 3KB is not only a perfect offering for its intended audience and a great diversion for anyone looking to get their fix of sugary entertainment, especially as we near the end of this era of gloom & doom known as 2020. There is one aspect I have yet to mention, though, one which helps tie everything together in a nice cute bundle: This show is extremely funny. Even looking past the obvious self-awareness, there is plenty to keep you at least giggling for most of the runtime, and a few of the jokes had my sides splitting. I must say, if this show were any more precious, it just might be unbearable. You know why that’s funny? It’s because the word ‘unbearable’ contains the word ‘bear.’ Huh huh. Huh huh.-----------------------------IN SUMMATION: 3KB is just what the doctor ordered for those who are isolated, depressed and starving from a dearth of cuteness. What you will get from this huggable teddy bear of a series is plush, adorable fun with plenty of chuckles and even some entertaining action mixed into the stuffing. Cute, fun, bright, fluffy and funny - anyone with a sweet-tooth could not possibly ask for more! Such a moe-fest is definitely not for everyone, but if you can loosen up that sphincter and shut out the world for a bit, you just might catch yourself having a good time... the story presents a number of unpleasant situations. The viewing experience was so cute, light, fluffy and that I felt as though I was floating in the sky on a cloud made of cute… although that might have been the drugs.Do you get the idea yet? No, you don’t. You really fucking don’t…Here is how I rated this scintillating bastion of moe:Story: 8Art: 8Sound: 10Characters: 8Enjoyment: 10OVERALL: ***9/10***STORY: The premise is indeed as simple and formulaic as one would expect from a ball of fluff like 3KB - I mean, it is an isekai story with a world based on an in-story VRMMORPG that focuses on the adventures of an OP NEET, minus Truck-kun. What sets this series apart from others in the isekai genre, though, is not only the abundance of interesting details, but just how committed it is to maintaining its specific atmosphere. While the storyline may have a flaw here and there, the progression is smooth and the mood is pretty much always maintained. This show knows what it is, knows what it does best, and doesn’t deviate too much from that.ARTWORK: I would say the artwork is about average in terms of quality; however, I personally rate it a little higher because, well, I just so happen to enjoy its overall style. Wanna fight about it, bruh?! The animation matches the content very well, and there is very little in the way of gratuitous CGI, which usually bugs the shit out of me. The character designs for the main cast had some unique qualities about them, and at least some effort was put into the supporting characters, although some do look pretty generic. In terms of aesthetics, DA BEARS is cute, polished, adorable, and cute.SOUND: This, for me, is one of the high points of the show. The first thing I noticed regarding audio quality is that I didn’t find any of the voice acting to be annoying, which could have easily happened with a CGDCT-fest like this - that alone is worth an accolade or seven. The background music, while not particularly memorable, wasn’t off-putting or distracting, and that is more than enough for me in most cases. The real bright spot, though, is the ED, which is FUCKING ADORABLE. The OP is pretty good, too, but the ED is so cute that it might lead to an overdose of sugar moe.CHARACTERS: Obviously, most of the focus is going to be on Luna, our intrepid MC and bearer of all things beary. She is a delightful protagonist, and her pursuit of the cuter, sweeter, funnerer things in life keeps the show shining brightly from beginning to end. What is even more interesting, though, is her effect on her surroundings, particularly as she gains friends & followers along the way. I won’t delve any deeper into this aspect of the series, because doing so would cross into spoiler territory - you will just have to watch and find out for yourself.ENJOYMENT: Just in case you didn’t notice, I absolutely fucking loved this show. 3KB is not only a perfect offering for its intended audience and a great diversion for anyone looking to get their fix of sugary entertainment, especially as we near the end of this era of gloom & doom known as 2020. There is one aspect I have yet to mention, though, one which helps tie everything together in a nice cute bundle: This show is extremely funny. Even looking past the obvious self-awareness, there is plenty to keep you at least giggling for most of the runtime, and a few of the jokes had my sides splitting. I must say, if this show were any more precious, it just might be unbearable. You know why that’s funny? It’s because the word ‘unbearable’ contains the word ‘bear.’ Huh huh.

Although many...people complain about the simplicity of the plot, I believe that the simple plot is what makes this show so amazing. It\'s less about bracing yourself for unexpected plot twists and feeling your pounding heart as something goes horribly wrong, and instead feels like a peaceful cruise through the happiest place in existence. Watching these characters walk through their simple conflicts and resolutions is a hidden joy that can only be found in a select few anime. This show is undoubtedly the happiest I\'ve ever been watching an isekai anime, and maybe even any anime ever. Many shows that have a complex story tend to leave either leave behind their theme, or tunnel vision onto the theme.

Once the all the episodes were out, I immediately and swiftly binged the entire show in a day, and if you couldn\'t tell from this review, it did not disappoint.

Obviously, no. all shows will have their flaws here and there, but this show is about as close to perfect as I will ever be willing to admit.

I would put it as designed for pre-teen and tween girls and maybe the odd furry.The story is a simple one, the girl does not do much but plays the game, shut in the house, works from home, goes to sleep one night, doesn't wake up, but instead is in the VR world.   A consistently overused idea.Aiming it more at girls also cuts its audience for me, i am not saying a boy can't enjoy it, but would be looking for more ISekai generally and...less Slice of Life.   The simple fact is the girl is transferred all her account money from the real world to her new account, by a user labeled GOD as if she died.As she goes to the new world she has a personality transplant from being a shut-in, doing what she has to, and then not mixing with anyone.  Suddenly, somehow between her overpowered character building up resources and her notoriety growing out of fear and jealousy, she seems to have to fix everything as she goes along.  Orphanage broke, have to help, people out of business, have to help, a boy with a village under threat, has to help.It just feels unnatural that someone would do all this when they have never cared really for people before even family.    It's a lovely story, a lovely idea, but it just feels too sickly sweet for me.   Is great for those who love the feel-good idea, but for me, between her empire-building business-wise, her op skills, and not using them hunt anything but low-level monsters most of the time as she buts in on higher-level quests to take them, more than appearing at the guilds, as nothing high level in her town.The thing it did get right is how strained ties become especially when your used to have someone to yourself, and suddenly she has so many eggs in a basket, that is pulled from one end of the region to the other.   Is a time filler anime, but if your looking for a real isekai, I feel this is not it, the fightings short, limited and is no real direction where this wants to go, despite her saying she wants to adventure less Slice of Life.

Let me be clear here, if you are an anime-only viewer, and looking it purely from the anime's perspective, this anime deserves a 7 or 8/10. But this is coming from someone who read the Light Novel and Manga first. I was a fan of Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear, and I was so excited to see an adaption. I didn't shut up about it for weeks when it got announced, and now that I've finished seeing it, I have mixed feelings. Let's go with the good parts...first.The animation was good. It had this colourful, candy-like theme. It supports the story's theme of being fluffy and cute, and it made watching the anime very enticing to watchThe sounds were good. The voice actors were top-notch. Yuna's Voice Actor started off okay, and gradually got used to her role, and became even better, as the series progressed. You can clearly see the difference when comparing early episodes to the last 2 episodesLet me be clear, Kuma kuma kuma Bear isn't simply a generic Isekai with an OP protagonist. It's not supposed to be a Yuri focused story. The anime shifted its tone to this. From the impressions I got from the LN and manga, Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear is supposed to be a fluffy comedy, that focuses on adventure, with some dark undertone, such as past trauma, some drama, and a bit of cold, and merciless statements from Yuna herself. She's supposed to be so much more than what the anime represented her to be. The anime clearly wanted to be more fluffy, and yuri, over the unique balance that the original plot had.The anime had cut out important details and plotpoints, just to lessen ghe dark undertones, and to add more Yuri, and Shoujo-Ai drama. Not saying the Original Kuma Kuma Kuma bear didnt have these, but the anime took these Yuri footnotes, and turned them into dragged on, episode long plotsCase in point, Episode 7, and the Finale. These episodes had very dragged on drama. I don't remember the manga ever dragging these points out, and the LN didn't make so much special attention to these, that it warranted being a central plotpoint. And this is why, i have to give Kuma kuma kuma bear anime, a 6/10. It's an okay adaption, but for me, it was not a very faithful adaption, with its massive tone shift, and deliberate cutting of important and interesting plotpoints. So much so, some people are now even talking about Kuma kuma Kuma bear as this season's moeblob Yuri anime. Again. This wasn't supposed tol be a Yuri-friendship focus. This was an honest Isekai comedy fluff with dark undertones to balance things out.Conclusion, as an adaption, Its okay, but it leaves much to be desired. As an anime, it did an okay job. It was fairly entertaining, and I think its something that the manga and LN readers can find as an interesting, new take on story, and anime only viewers can appreciate it more since it is, in the end, still a cute moeblob with a fluffy theme first.The animation was good.

There\'s never been a better example of what can be considered a pellucid undergoing. In this way, the anime becomes cohesive, with a simple premise and an even simpler narrative execution. Do not expect much for plot contortions or any such complexities. No, this is as direct as serial anime gets.If you\'ve ever watched an isekai — particularly of the vrmmo typing popularized by SAO — you will be well primed to...understand all the elements in this one immediately. Even if you haven\'t, it\'s still elementary, that it could be even enjoyed by young children as well, if it weren\'t for the occasional ""bastard!"" or periodic brutal slaying of orcs and wolves and such (as one is wont to do in isekai). And still those situations are tamer and more modest than the usual faire. That doesn\'t mean that it\'s entirely derelict or bankrupt of value or enjoyability. What the anime lacks in cerebral depth and novelty, it makes up in what I would call ""cuteness overload"" and other dimensions of loveliness, in addition to quality character designs, enjoyable character interactions, and competent animation, direction, dialogue, and sound production: all of the components you might expect as prerequisites in making an anime consummate. It\'s fun and adorable, and thusly by no means a bad anime; in fact, I\'d almost postulate that it\'s fairly above-average. Rarely do I rate an anime better than its MAL score, but I\'m confident that Kuma Kuma is fairly valued, or possibly underestimated by my calculations. Don\'t get me started on the IMDB scores.Those things being said, I\'d caution anyone to hold any expectations whatsoever, as it never seems to consist an overarching plotline; the episodes are largely unconnected and conflicts are inured to resolve in the same episode in which they come into being. If the episodes are held together by any fabric, that phenomenon must be driven by character connections as relationships form, develop, rather than by a well-structured tale. Things seem to flow sanguinely at the character level, if but a bit in a gallivant manner when considering the narrative as a whole instead. The most essential relationships that contribute to the series\' successes center around Yuna and her adoptive sisters, or when the story calls for it, Yuna and her business partners / the guild masters. The show revolves around these interactions.After all, Yuna\'s main selling point as a character is her authentic purity — despite a penchant toward a certain cynicism of the world and adults (particularly other wealthy individuals) which she bears with her from the real world to the game world. She isn\'t very corruptible, and that personal quality is central to the entire show\'s ethos. What better way to show it, than by situating Yuna in circumstances that allow her to befriend the otherwise helpless? The purity that I speak of manifests in the way she bonds with other characters, essentially assuming the role of a big sister and protectress. That isn\'t to say that she doesn\'t have her flaws; rather, she\'s quick to dismiss others\' concerns as not her problem unless she\'s already emotionally invested or in some way gains an advantage or comfort (such as food). In cases when she does, she\'s impressively magnanimous, as money in this world, like the real one, is no object to her, because she\'s enduring the harsh reality of endless pockets. Despite these couple unfortunate parts of her makeup, she is overwhelmingly just and good, and proves it by making a few selfless decisions and treating others with dignity.With such dedication poured into the protagonist and her friendships, and with such little concentration placed on plot-building, I can\'t help but focus on the fact that there\'s no true antagonist, nor really a central conflict at all. How would these factors have affected the anime if they had been included? Certainly, they would\'ve added some level of complicacy, but if fashioned badly could also have jeopardized the show\'s candid elegance and easiness with unnecessary convolution.The writers ultimately opted to strip it to a more bare-bones approach instead: a rich 15-year-old girl is trapped in an alternative universe, with magic and monsters, along with a bear costume that unlocks unreasonably broken skills, and a hoard of cash, to make friends and defeat the incidental enemy. And you know what? SHE LIKES IT. While for other characters the prospect of death from an illness or monster fight is realistic, or the possibility of being subjugated and exploited palpable, Yuna is unfazed because she\'s both puissant and affluent. It\'s everyone\'s dream, to be in control of their own destiny and unworried about their access to basic necessities and financial security. That\'s one of the reasons that RPG games are so popular, — it\'s a form of escapism from harsh realities. And no one seems to flourish more doing so than Yuna. understand all the elements in this one immediately.

What the anime lacks in cerebral depth and novelty, it makes up in what I would call ""cuteness overload"" and other dimensions of loveliness, in addition to quality character designs, enjoyable character interactions, and competent animation, direction, dialogue, and sound production: all of the components you might expect as prerequisites in making an anime consummate. It\'s fun and adorable, and thusly by no means a bad anime; in fact, I\'d almost postulate that it\'s fairly above-average. Rarely do I rate an anime better than its MAL score, but I\'m confident that Kuma Kuma is fairly valued, or possibly underestimated by my calculations. Don\'t get me started on the IMDB scores.Those things being said, I\'d caution anyone to hold any expectations whatsoever, as it never seems to consist an overarching plotline; the episodes are largely unconnected and conflicts are inured to resolve in the same episode in which they come into being. If the episodes are held together by any fabric, that phenomenon must be driven by character connections as relationships form, develop, rather than by a well-structured tale. Things seem to flow sanguinely at the character level, if but a bit in a gallivant manner when considering the narrative as a whole instead. The most essential relationships that contribute to the series\' successes center around Yuna and her adoptive sisters, or when the story calls for it, Yuna and her business partners / the guild masters. The show revolves around these interactions.After all, Yuna\'s main selling point as a character is her authentic purity — despite a penchant toward a certain cynicism of the world and adults (particularly other wealthy individuals) which she bears with her from the real world to the game world. She isn\'t very corruptible, and that personal quality is central to the entire show\'s ethos. What better way to show it, than by situating Yuna in circumstances that allow her to befriend the otherwise helpless? The purity that I speak of manifests in the way she bonds with other characters, essentially assuming the role of a big sister and protectress. That isn\'t to say that she doesn\'t have her flaws; rather, she\'s quick to dismiss others\' concerns as not her problem unless she\'s already emotionally invested or in some way gains an advantage or comfort (such as food). In cases when she does, she\'s impressively magnanimous, as money in this world, like the real one, is no object to her, because she\'s enduring the harsh reality of endless pockets. Despite these couple unfortunate parts of her makeup, she is overwhelmingly just and good, and proves it by making a few selfless decisions and treating others with dignity.With such dedication poured into the protagonist and her friendships, and with such little concentration placed on plot-building, I can\'t help but focus on the fact that there\'s no true antagonist, nor really a central conflict at all. How would these factors have affected the anime if they had been included? Certainly, they would\'ve added some level of complicacy, but if fashioned badly could also have jeopardized the show\'s candid elegance and easiness with unnecessary convolution.The writers ultimately opted to strip it to a more bare-bones approach instead: a rich 15-year-old girl is trapped in an alternative universe, with magic and monsters, along with a bear costume that unlocks unreasonably broken skills, and a hoard of cash, to make friends and defeat the incidental enemy. And you know what? SHE LIKES IT. While for other characters the prospect of death from an illness or monster fight is realistic, or the possibility of being subjugated and exploited palpable, Yuna is unfazed because she\'s both puissant and affluent. It\'s everyone\'s dream, to be in control of their own destiny and unworried about their access to basic necessities and financial security. That\'s one of the reasons that RPG games are so popular, — it\'s a form of escapism from harsh realities. And no one seems to flourish more doing so than Yuna.', 'Anone, anone, chotto kiite~First, I underestimated this anime, and now I found this anime is enjoyable. From the title there\'s no gimmick in there, I mean Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear? What kind of weird title it is. But damn, I become attached to it.The reason is.. maybe at some point I can relate to this anime. Like how the MC just want to do whatever she like. Now days our action will be judge like by ""everyone"" and we try hard to keep up with everyone expectation. But saw Yuna do whatever she want and be happy, damn, maybe that\'s how you enjoy ur life....She build a place where she can be what she want to be. And at that moment she realised how important that place, and want to protect it. Ed song is just hit that spot, especially the last episode ed!Now how about the other aspect? Well let\'s see:Story: 7/10The story is not something new and remarkable one I think. It has decent chara development, it has decent setting and many more decent thing. The reason why is good maybe because sometime it add some ""moral"" story or something like ""chicken soup"" thing to it. But still.. it not as good comparable to story focusing that aspect.Art: 9/10Well.. It\'s so cuute~ yeah I know that typically not good for review. But it has a cute character design (Kuma!) and fill with cute other characters and with cute design of back ground. So it;s just cute.Sound: 9/10I really enjoy how cute the seiyuu is. First I a little bit sceptic about Yuna voice (in my imagination) cuz I dunno the seiyuu at all. But Yuna have a good voice tbh, not being to \'childish\' but still hit the spot. And other chara is payed out by famous seiyuu from your typical ""kawaii anime character"". OP/ED is sung by the caracter it self. And yes I love it.Character: 8/10Characters is lovely but some times it lack of development. Some character just past by and some character is.. well unpredictable I guess? Dunno why the character thing/act like that for some reason. A little bit disappointment for slice of life anime. And yes.. it almost all of it is girl. So.. iif u didn\'t like stuff full of girl, just don\'t watch it. And MC is girl too so..Enjoyment: 10/10As I said before, at some point I REALLY enjoy this anime. Maybe because I didn\'t expect to high for this anime(?) who knows. But I enjoy so much how MC doing cute stuff around. And yes how I can relate to this anime.Overall: 9/10I will recommend this anime to he/she who enjoy watching cute anime style. And maybe someone who love watch slice of life anime. This anime has some moral point some time and good for killing time without so much thinking. She build a place where she can be what she want to be.

It's really really not well made at all.The last one is...well, something not in the novel they are adapting from (according to what others told me). Which explain well why it felt badly written and...forced.Anyway, if you manage to get past the first episode, the second one do a good job at starting the story and it's easy to follow after that.Now, nearly all characters are very bland and the bad guys are comically obvious to guess but there is plenty of fluff for those it interest.The whole reason i watched until the end is Yuna, our girl protagonist and the only character fleshed out of the whole show.She is relatable and feel like she really is 15.

It\'s average, but it\'s certainly not bad at what it does, and it\'s a pretty good ""escapism"" show. I feel like a lot of people who are gonna review this show, are going to do so from a pretty biased stance since there is a pretty big hate-boner for anything slightly Isekai related.Kuma Bear story-wise is pretty bland, it\'s just your average girl sent to another world, there isn\'t some great evil to defeat, no Demon king to take down three episodes in....So if you wanted an anime that\'s lore deep, has a bunch of backstories and well-written characters...this isn\'t for you. But if you want an easy to digest, funny fantasy/Slice of Life type of show where the main character gets into wacky, silly hijinks with her cute friends, then it\'s perfect! A bland story does not a bad anime make, especially considering Kuma Bear makes it pretty darn clear from the get-go that it\'s not here to ""blow your mind"" or make you question life. It\'s just here to have a good time, and honestly, it does a good job at being an enjoyable watch.Kuma Bear\'s art style isn\'t anything to write home about, but I will give it points for being absolutely fucking adorable. All of the characters have this nice purplish-tint on their eyelashes that I really dig. The designs of the characters are all nice to look at, and our main protagonist\'s outfit just screams ""please cosplay me, I\'m so cute!"" Though one thing I will say is that some of the minor characters could stand to be a bit more uniquely designed. One could argue the whole point of the show is that Yuma, the MC, is supposed to be the oddball out so of course, she has the best design out of everyone. But the designs of some of the villagers Yuma meets are far too generic for me to remember them, especially if they\'re going to be appearing in later episodes.Kuma Bear\'s OST isn\'t awful, but it\'s also just pretty over the top cutesy for your standard Bishoujo title. Not a lot to say about the music or the sound design for that matter, everything is in its place, and nothing really sticks out. I certainly won\'t be putting the OP or ED in my playlist anytime soon, but at least it\'s not terrible.Kuma Bear\'s characters are its strongest suit, as no one here in the main cast is overtly annoying or too unbearable to watch. Yuma the MC is very likable and has great chemistry with the rest of the cast. She even seems to mesh well with characters we get introduced to in seconds on screen, like the hearty guild members from episode 3. One thing about new shows like this, especially in Isekai, is when a character seemingly is too annoying to want to watch. Nobody here is really all that ""Annoying"" or aggravating. Even the cute little Imouto character who sticks with Yuna isn\'t ""tear my hair out"" aggravating I actually kind of like her, and hope she sticks around.Kuma Bear does a great job of keeping you engaged in the fantasy world it\'s made up, not with lore but by having you watch Yuma explore it with her friends, and figure out how to do different things with her sick, but totally adorable, Bear costume. This anime is pure ""escapism"" fuel, and that\'s right up my alley, but I KNOW it\'s not for everyone. I can already hear people screeching about how this series sucks because there\'s no neat lore or no cool backstories, but trust me when I say that\'s just not what this show aims to do. And to its credit, it never promises to do that either.I haven\'t read the Light novel this anime is from, but from what LN readers tell me the pacing is a bit all over the place, and shot composition has confused many a viewer. While I was confused a bit about what was going on in one episode chronologically speaking, I was soon put back on track when some kind of user explained how they had seemingly fucked up the pacing of a scene from the books.

But it doesn't try to be one.It somehow starts to bait you into thinking that it might be a little dark, and maybe the Light Novels are darker - but the anime is not.While it baits you into thinking something sinister might happen multiple times, usually you can spot the evil guys right away. The twist here is: Yuna, the protagonist can't - because she's biased.Yuna lived a very boring life before getting isekaid. She was living alone and somehow earned money so she could send her parents on vacation so they wouldn't bother her. Maybe...she was a child prodigy, whatever - it doesn't really matter: She was a nerd playing Videogames all day long.And one day she gets isekaid into one of those games. And because it's an isekai she gets an op power, this time in form of a very silly looking Bear-Suit and some over the top bear powers.While the story stil is about some basic adventuring, the main plot is just her befriending multiple children and making their lives better.So yeah, if you want slice of life Fantasy isekai, this is a light hearted show for you.If you expected some action... it's not.For me it's a 6/10 - a second season is anounced so I guess I'll watch that when it's out. she was a child prodigy, whatever - it doesn't really matter: She was a nerd playing Videogames all day long.And one day she gets isekaid into one of those games.

The premise is refreshing for the Isekai genre, something that is much needed after years of SAO's plot being reused over and over again.Why I disliked it: It's the same boring story embellished with more focus on the SoL elements. The characters are bland with very little personality and watching it...is like watching a toddler friendly version of Konosuba. is like watching a toddler friendly version of Konosuba."", 'For those who don\'t want absolutely any spoilers, I would suggest watching this show before reading any reviews, but if you want a hint on what to expect and not expect, let me summarise:The story follows a gamer girl of the somewhat detached from life (and family) variety who ends up being isekai\'d into her gaming world - or a supposedly new version of it. There she is gifted with OP talents, which are limited only by her imagination... and occasionally the finite nature of mana, but you know. Stuck there, she does her best to make this new place a home, bringing the...delicacies of her old world into this new one, while building her reputation, making friends and allies and taking down monsters. What you won\'t be in for is fanservice, romance, love triangles, overly complicated plots, magic systems or anything of the sorts, but what you can expect is a kawaii and relaxed isekai adventure that I think is perfectly watchable even if it isn\'t the height of this or any other anime season.||【 Art & Animation - 8/10 】||So, to begin with, the art is gorgeous. I love the background art in countryside/nature scenes - especially the sky. Although in contrast, the buildings are rather plain, admittedly. The bears minions are pretty cute, much like most of the young characters in the show. But in contrast, older characters look rather plain and scraggly.In the very episode, the animation for the snake villain is real rough, but the design is cool.There isn\'t too much experimentation with the art style, but it does switch up a little in terms of linework/shapes, patterns... from time to time, especially to give reactions that extra flair. (In the early episodes and in one of the latter ones too.) It\'s always cool when the animators can switch between styles.And the quality of the art is consistent, fortunately, but sometimes the animation is replaced with a slideshow of cute but still images, so you know... that\'s a damn shame.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Sound - 8/10 】||I like the little game-like sound effects and faint music playing on in the background, as in a game of the genre our isekai\'d character finds themselves in, it\'s a nice detail. The soundtrack is pleasant, clear, but it doesn\'t overshadow the dialogue or inner monologues.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Story - 7/10 】||Pacing-wise I don\'t see many glaring issues. While the premise isn\'t all too unique, the decision to give the MC bear magic and make people doubtful of her because she looks strange and doesn\'t seem all that strong is interesting... oh, yeah and again, female MCs in this setting are uncommon and usually fit into a limited few categories from my experience. Usually it\'s the male swordfighting MC or standard magic using male MC. If it\'s a female they\'re normally a villainess or something.It\'s interesting to see her go from max level to level one and the confusion that follows. That said, her getting isekai\'d into a game in the way that MC is... is a bit difficult for me to wrap my head around. Oh, well, maybe it gets explained later on.""I didn\'t think they\'d take me seriously if I put my job class as ""bear""."" This world is definitely a strange one... but it responds to the character in an entertaining way.And sure, the plot overall is cliche. Sure, she gets isekai\'d into the world becoming overpowered and in her own way devleoping a platonic harem of girls. But I do say platonic; which makes it a little fresher than some isekai. While she prefers to remain at home, she\'s not really all that lazy or useless. She supports her family\'s vacationing in the real world. She\'s cynical sure, but she\'s not exactly mean-spirited or anything, isn\'t a perv and, granted, she plays things a little safe, but does offer just the tiniest bit of sass to ensure she\'s not the dullest thing ever.As the story progresses, our MC grows closer with those around her, even feeling like somewhat of an older sister, which is a nice shift, from the typical romance infested isekai (not that I mind romance, it\'s just not very well done usually).If you were looking for romance, spice and fanservice, sure, this anime isn\'t for you. If you were were looking for swordfights or super cool fights in general... there\'s really not much of that here, since our MC is a little too OP and it\'s not like her fighting style is conducive to anything too amazing... but that\'s not to say that our main character is not creative enough to make the fights interesting at all...And while the beasts are somewhat creative and distinctive, there are also creatures like orcs and other monsters which are honestly basic and cliche. So if you want something so avant-garde and original that it has no comparison in fiction... then this also isn\'t for you. But if you\'re willing to watch an adorable, amusing little isekai that isn\'t too dramatic with cute designs but fairly standard ideas... this anime isn\'t too long or too dull to do so, in my opinion.Another thing that is interesting and somewhat refreshing is that our character appears first on a mission in the new world, then we backtrack to how she got here. Now that\'s not completely unheard of, but it\'s slightly less common than the usual, chronological order of things in most shows. It\'s nice to see from time to time, just as a change of pace and since the shifts between times aren\'t too confusing.Also, when I say that this show doesn\'t really do fanservice I mean it. Like, they switched the maid costumes for typical japanese-styled maid cafes for bear onesies, that\'s how far they went with the low-to-no fanservice policy for this one! Weeeeeell... except for the adventurer\'s guild in the seaside town.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Characters - 7/10 】||The main character, despite being a young girl, is neither cheerful in squeaky nor too emo. She\'s a mixture of caring and kinda... sassy? She\'s reasonable, understanding and at times, mildly amusing (occasionally intimidating)... let\'s see how long that lasts. For now ""ew, gross"" amused me more than it should have. Granted, so far we just know she\'s OP... in that her powers are honestly just limited by her imagination. In a way that does imply there are limitations after all, but even so. This does take away much of the stakes and issues in the anime, and steals away from emotional moments that could be beneficial to the character\'s development. Also, sure it\'s nice that she does many things charge-free, but honestly? For most people they need to make money and there is only so much they can do to emulate the MC here... so her philosophy is a bit naive, I\'ll admit. But still, it has its charm.As the story goes on, she ends up being wrong about the lord she thought was some cruel jerk and feels guilty for it, and while being wrong acts very much her age - immature and rash. It could seem annoying but it makes her come off as human. It\'s nice to know our MC can actually mess up. Also, some people seem to write MC off as simply lazy, but this girl knows how to cook, so she\'s clearly cooked before. MC doesn\'t have grand dreams of changing the world. Her goals are focused on making the people she knows and already cares for happy and safe. I think that\'s a lot more relatable and realistic. She doesn\'t care for any kind of leading position, for clout or anything, she just... wants to have a good time with good people. (And she\'s not really fussed about home because really, since when did anyone at home bar grandparent 1 show any kind of concern for her?) Moreover, she doesn\'t always get ideas instantaneously. Against the Kraken she went through several logically flawed but at the same time interesting ideas before settling on something, which is always nice to see. There is a thought process that goes into these kinds of strategic problems, time and a good bit of inspiration. Inventors don\'t create new things over night and well, a Kraken is the final boss in this particular battle. Plus it was pretty entertaining to see. And in the end the solution is... an interesting one. Makes sense, but still.It\'s also apparent that she\'s being used by her parents, since she mentions to a grandparent of hers how she gave her parents more money to pay for their holiday and since then hasn\'t heard from them. Despite this, she is in awe of how strong the kids in the fantasy world of her game are, and is kind and understanding even to people who doubt her skill. She\'s not rude, or nasty, or disrespectful just because she\'s the rich girl. Also, the lord is actually quite generous and friendly, and he\'s dressed in something remotely resembling a historical outfit... for good characters to be fashionable by the standards of the time their world resembles is pleasant to see.That said... she does ditch school.The side characters are, thus far, just the typical game characters, although with a healthy dose of cynicism and the concerned grandparents. Most of them are designed in cute fashion, the nobles can sometimes be reasonable people - I get that it\'s kinda\' based off reality where it\'s often as though rich people live in separate world from us peasants, but it\'s definitely also a trope I\'m kinda\' tired of already -, and overall characters aren\'t just one isekai cliche after another, even though there are definitely some hotheads, along with a few other character types. But I don\'t see much in the way of tsunderes or anything like that, which is a nice change.God makes me chuckle a little, especially when she actually says ""heart emoji!"" aloud.Only thing that makes me wanna press x to doubt is the two little sisters. They fight far too little and get along way too well for it to be true.And the girl from the merchant guild - the one with the brown hair and glasses that I can never remember the name of sadly - has a very pretty get up.Moreover, the anime is not a complete stranger to subverting expectations. Ye drunk adventurer\'s guild member woman was actually drinking bitter tea to remain awake and had been busy the whole time. Honestly, I\'m surprised she had that much energy, but it was nice to know she wasn\'t just some drunk waifu.Sadly, as per usual the bad guys in the anime are older guys, so it\'s not all that unique, and when it comes to development and complex personalities... well, let\'s just say this anime prefers to keep it simple. To be fair though, there are only twelve episodes and in those twelve episodes the anime does try to build up a world, build up the MC\'s inventory and team and... yeah, no, they could have totally squeezed in just the slightest bit better writing, but still... I\'m somehow not too frustrated about that.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Enjoyment - 7/10 】||In truth, I feel like this might have been even more enjoyable to me as a kid. Some of the episodes do have some simple but nice messages suitable for children about not jumping to conclusions and being nice to people... that kind of thing, but with cutesy animals, beasts and adventures to the boot, so I\'m honestly not sure why it was rated PG-13... Nevertheless, I still found enjoyment in this, don\'t get me wrong. It had it\'s wholesome moments, cute moments, somewhat funny moments and I was never bored or falling asleep during this either. I also don\'t recall being frustrated over anything much. So yeah, this is a good anime as far as I can tell, and I may just watch the next season if and when it comes out. And it ends on a nice, wholesome note, no romantic ending or cliffhanger needed.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Overall - 7/10 】||Would I recommend this anime?Yes.But not necessarily to everyone.Those who seek particular tropes, or those crazy for action on the level of say JJK, gore, horror or deaths... probably won\'t get much from this show. Those who constantly need drama and tense moments to keep watching might not find this terribly appealing. Those who want something romantic full of love triangles and misunderstandings might not be satisfied with the very Gen story that this anime is.But for those who seek cutesy animation, a pretty fantasy world with foods, beasties and pretty people, might find something of value in this. Those who like family and friendship type anime might enjoy it. Those want a calm and sweet isekai adventure lead by a female character might just like it. Though, no guarantees. delicacies of her old world into this new one, while building her reputation, making friends and allies and taking down monsters. What you won\'t be in for is fanservice, romance, love triangles, overly complicated plots, magic systems or anything of the sorts, but what you can expect is a kawaii and relaxed isekai adventure that I think is perfectly watchable even if it isn\'t the height of this or any other anime season.||【 Art & Animation - 8/10 】||So, to begin with, the art is gorgeous. I love the background art in countryside/nature scenes - especially the sky. Although in contrast, the buildings are rather plain, admittedly. The bears minions are pretty cute, much like most of the young characters in the show. But in contrast, older characters look rather plain and scraggly.In the very episode, the animation for the snake villain is real rough, but the design is cool.There isn\'t too much experimentation with the art style, but it does switch up a little in terms of linework/shapes, patterns... from time to time, especially to give reactions that extra flair. (In the early episodes and in one of the latter ones too.) It\'s always cool when the animators can switch between styles.And the quality of the art is consistent, fortunately, but sometimes the animation is replaced with a slideshow of cute but still images, so you know... that\'s a damn shame.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Sound - 8/10 】||I like the little game-like sound effects and faint music playing on in the background, as in a game of the genre our isekai\'d character finds themselves in, it\'s a nice detail. The soundtrack is pleasant, clear, but it doesn\'t overshadow the dialogue or inner monologues.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Story - 7/10 】||Pacing-wise I don\'t see many glaring issues. While the premise isn\'t all too unique, the decision to give the MC bear magic and make people doubtful of her because she looks strange and doesn\'t seem all that strong is interesting... oh, yeah and again, female MCs in this setting are uncommon and usually fit into a limited few categories from my experience. Usually it\'s the male swordfighting MC or standard magic using male MC. If it\'s a female they\'re normally a villainess or something.It\'s interesting to see her go from max level to level one and the confusion that follows. That said, her getting isekai\'d into a game in the way that MC is... is a bit difficult for me to wrap my head around. Oh, well, maybe it gets explained later on.""I didn\'t think they\'d take me seriously if I put my job class as ""bear""."" This world is definitely a strange one... but it responds to the character in an entertaining way.And sure, the plot overall is cliche. Sure, she gets isekai\'d into the world becoming overpowered and in her own way devleoping a platonic harem of girls. But I do say platonic; which makes it a little fresher than some isekai. While she prefers to remain at home, she\'s not really all that lazy or useless. She supports her family\'s vacationing in the real world. She\'s cynical sure, but she\'s not exactly mean-spirited or anything, isn\'t a perv and, granted, she plays things a little safe, but does offer just the tiniest bit of sass to ensure she\'s not the dullest thing ever.As the story progresses, our MC grows closer with those around her, even feeling like somewhat of an older sister, which is a nice shift, from the typical romance infested isekai (not that I mind romance, it\'s just not very well done usually).If you were looking for romance, spice and fanservice, sure, this anime isn\'t for you. If you were were looking for swordfights or super cool fights in general... there\'s really not much of that here, since our MC is a little too OP and it\'s not like her fighting style is conducive to anything too amazing... but that\'s not to say that our main character is not creative enough to make the fights interesting at all...And while the beasts are somewhat creative and distinctive, there are also creatures like orcs and other monsters which are honestly basic and cliche. So if you want something so avant-garde and original that it has no comparison in fiction... then this also isn\'t for you. But if you\'re willing to watch an adorable, amusing little isekai that isn\'t too dramatic with cute designs but fairly standard ideas... this anime isn\'t too long or too dull to do so, in my opinion.Another thing that is interesting and somewhat refreshing is that our character appears first on a mission in the new world, then we backtrack to how she got here. Now that\'s not completely unheard of, but it\'s slightly less common than the usual, chronological order of things in most shows. It\'s nice to see from time to time, just as a change of pace and since the shifts between times aren\'t too confusing.Also, when I say that this show doesn\'t really do fanservice I mean it. Like, they switched the maid costumes for typical japanese-styled maid cafes for bear onesies, that\'s how far they went with the low-to-no fanservice policy for this one! Weeeeeell... except for the adventurer\'s guild in the seaside town.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Characters - 7/10 】||The main character, despite being a young girl, is neither cheerful in squeaky nor too emo. She\'s a mixture of caring and kinda... sassy? She\'s reasonable, understanding and at times, mildly amusing (occasionally intimidating)... let\'s see how long that lasts. For now ""ew, gross"" amused me more than it should have. Granted, so far we just know she\'s OP... in that her powers are honestly just limited by her imagination. In a way that does imply there are limitations after all, but even so. This does take away much of the stakes and issues in the anime, and steals away from emotional moments that could be beneficial to the character\'s development. Also, sure it\'s nice that she does many things charge-free, but honestly? For most people they need to make money and there is only so much they can do to emulate the MC here... so her philosophy is a bit naive, I\'ll admit. But still, it has its charm.As the story goes on, she ends up being wrong about the lord she thought was some cruel jerk and feels guilty for it, and while being wrong acts very much her age - immature and rash. It could seem annoying but it makes her come off as human. It\'s nice to know our MC can actually mess up. Also, some people seem to write MC off as simply lazy, but this girl knows how to cook, so she\'s clearly cooked before. MC doesn\'t have grand dreams of changing the world. Her goals are focused on making the people she knows and already cares for happy and safe. I think that\'s a lot more relatable and realistic. She doesn\'t care for any kind of leading position, for clout or anything, she just... wants to have a good time with good people. (And she\'s not really fussed about home because really, since when did anyone at home bar grandparent 1 show any kind of concern for her?) Moreover, she doesn\'t always get ideas instantaneously. Against the Kraken she went through several logically flawed but at the same time interesting ideas before settling on something, which is always nice to see. There is a thought process that goes into these kinds of strategic problems, time and a good bit of inspiration. Inventors don\'t create new things over night and well, a Kraken is the final boss in this particular battle. Plus it was pretty entertaining to see. And in the end the solution is... an interesting one. Makes sense, but still.It\'s also apparent that she\'s being used by her parents, since she mentions to a grandparent of hers how she gave her parents more money to pay for their holiday and since then hasn\'t heard from them. Despite this, she is in awe of how strong the kids in the fantasy world of her game are, and is kind and understanding even to people who doubt her skill. She\'s not rude, or nasty, or disrespectful just because she\'s the rich girl. Also, the lord is actually quite generous and friendly, and he\'s dressed in something remotely resembling a historical outfit... for good characters to be fashionable by the standards of the time their world resembles is pleasant to see.That said... she does ditch school.The side characters are, thus far, just the typical game characters, although with a healthy dose of cynicism and the concerned grandparents. Most of them are designed in cute fashion, the nobles can sometimes be reasonable people - I get that it\'s kinda\' based off reality where it\'s often as though rich people live in separate world from us peasants, but it\'s definitely also a trope I\'m kinda\' tired of already -, and overall characters aren\'t just one isekai cliche after another, even though there are definitely some hotheads, along with a few other character types. But I don\'t see much in the way of tsunderes or anything like that, which is a nice change.God makes me chuckle a little, especially when she actually says ""heart emoji!"" aloud.Only thing that makes me wanna press x to doubt is the two little sisters. They fight far too little and get along way too well for it to be true.And the girl from the merchant guild - the one with the brown hair and glasses that I can never remember the name of sadly - has a very pretty get up.Moreover, the anime is not a complete stranger to subverting expectations. Ye drunk adventurer\'s guild member woman was actually drinking bitter tea to remain awake and had been busy the whole time. Honestly, I\'m surprised she had that much energy, but it was nice to know she wasn\'t just some drunk waifu.Sadly, as per usual the bad guys in the anime are older guys, so it\'s not all that unique, and when it comes to development and complex personalities... well, let\'s just say this anime prefers to keep it simple. To be fair though, there are only twelve episodes and in those twelve episodes the anime does try to build up a world, build up the MC\'s inventory and team and... yeah, no, they could have totally squeezed in just the slightest bit better writing, but still... I\'m somehow not too frustrated about that.__________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Enjoyment - 7/10 】||In truth, I feel like this might have been even more enjoyable to me as a kid. Some of the episodes do have some simple but nice messages suitable for children about not jumping to conclusions and being nice to people... that kind of thing, but with cutesy animals, beasts and adventures to the boot, so I\'m honestly not sure why it was rated PG-13... Nevertheless, I still found enjoyment in this, don\'t get me wrong. It had it\'s wholesome moments, cute moments, somewhat funny moments and I was never bored or falling asleep during this either. I also don\'t recall being frustrated over anything much. So yeah, this is a good anime as far as I can tell, and I may just watch the next season if and when it comes out. And it ends on a nice, wholesome note, no romantic ending or cliffhanger needed.___________________________________________________________________________________________________________||【 Overall - 7/10 】||Would I recommend this anime?Yes.But not necessarily to everyone.Those who seek particular tropes, or those crazy for action on the level of say JJK, gore, horror or deaths... probably won\'t get much from this show. Those who constantly need drama and tense moments to keep watching might not find this terribly appealing. Those who want something romantic full of love triangles and misunderstandings might not be satisfied with the very Gen story that this anime is.But for those who seek cutesy animation, a pretty fantasy world with foods, beasties and pretty people, might find something of value in this. Those who like family and friendship type anime might enjoy it. Those want a calm and sweet isekai adventure lead by a female character might just like it.

This is nice because it is somewhat unique, to be honest.The soundtrack is nicely done, the sound of combat could have much more depth, something that seems to lack from many shows.Characters are all not bad, Yuna is great in how she grows up with her personality but then everyone she meets is either weak or so nice.As said Fina is a Yandere in the making and that development was not needed since it made the final episode not really stick.In terms of enjoying the show, for the most part, is fun and cute. You have odd situations like working hob cookers that no one questions or wants. You also get very cute things like bear slippers which were adorable.The show, in the end, is a 7/10 since it is good but tarnished.

It is kind of a wholesome anime where the main character is very overpowered and can do anything, which she uses to help others. It has not much depth or story. characters are very shallow and one dimensional. everything revolves around her bear powers. which kind of is annoying at times. especially the bears. i mean wtf are the voices of them? they are like pokemon and not actual bears.i can recommend it if you want to just watch it if you feel bored. if you expect any depth or story you can...pass this. its not a loss. pass this. its not a loss.', 'For a few years since release I did ignored this show purely for thinking bad about the cover and the title, but boy I coundn`t be more wrongKuma Kuma Kuma Bear goes with that silly and childish face, with bears, fun and cute little girls (as a good CGDCT should), but then smack the audience with the classics of isekai and noblity, conspirations and dirty business, poverty and hunger... all to be solved by a bear girl with a good bear punch!Looking for fun, enjoyment and that small true hapiness that can only be achieved by seeing cute girls doing cute things, but don`t...wanna to be bothered by an all sugar story where everyone is happy all the damn time?

It doesn't do anything innovative and the story is a little lackluster at times, but it's overall solid and the art style is very nice, and extremely effective for what the show is trying to be.

For Kuma Kuma, it\'s the uniqueness of the MC, or specifically her equipment. This serves fairly well at first, but indeed without variation becomes as monotonous as other similar isekais with as overpowered MC\'s.I rarely take note of voice acting, but this show really stood out in the variation and quality of the voices, which made it far more entertaining than it otherwise would have been. Unfortunately, other critical parts such as the...story or even animation, especially during action sequences, can only be considered subpar.I haven\'t read the LN, so as only a viewer, it felt that after the first few episodes the pacing really went wild. The first 5 episodes lacked the worldbuilding they deserved, and their content certainly could have filled 12 episodes.7 & 9, then 10 & 11 could have filled 6 episodes each, and 6 and 12 felt more like OVA\'s than main episodes.Lastly, the overpowered MC trope is difficult to pull off successfully without boring the viewer. Kuma Kuma initially succeeds, but after a certain point too many abilities and interactions are introduced without adequate explanation, and it becomes a sort of deus ex machina à la ""8th Son"", ""Misfit of Demon King Academy."" Just like another anime this season, ""Kami-tachi ni Hirowareta,"" the substitution of challenges or genuine antagonists with shallow MacGuffins really detracts from continued enjoyment. story or even animation, especially during action sequences, can only be considered subpar.I haven\'t read the LN, so as only a viewer, it felt that after the first few episodes the pacing really went wild.

It's characteristically different from normal ones, it's a lot cuter and feels more down to earth. The main character, Yuna, still has monsterous powers that surpass even the best adventurers of this world, but she's surprisingly satisfied with just living a normal life. It focuses on more human aspects, finding something to do with her time to explore and play around, finding food she likes back from her own world, playing big sister and connecting with her new little sister, and taking care of children. This down to earth approach is different...from other Isekai's where they're on a mission to save or conquer the world. Yuna still does big things like destroy powerful monsters and save villages, but she does it for very simple reasons like helping a friend or securing a supply of good food. It's very humbling and feels authentic of a show. It genuinely feels like she's just trying to live a good and happy life and isn't concerned with boosting her ego or securing power. In fact, despite doing big things, she adamantly pushes responsibility and the rewards onto ministers.That said, this show is very black and white. It can get childish as there seems to be no gray areas and everything is simple. You know exactly who the good and bad guys are. The only pursues everyone has in this world are simple and everyone is nice. In fact, everyone just gets along with each other and everyone is overly generous, although that can be understandable given that the main character improves their lives effortlessly and almost instantly after meeting them for no cost or strings attached. There isn't any behind the scenes plotting or any malicious intentions, except simple ones from people who are caught almost immediately after being introduced. It is the bubble of childhood, where everything is protected and everything gets filtered to be acceptable. That said, it was still fun to watch and reminded me of simpler times, minus all the bad stuff. from other Isekai's where they're on a mission to save or conquer the world.

It wasn\'t ""bad"" per say, but I never found myself wanting to see what happens next. The story really isn\'t that huge a point in the slice of life genre, so it doesn\'t surprise me to find it lacking in that area. It was pretty bland, 5/10.The art is fairly well drawn, by no means was it mine blowing or exceptionally dynamic, but given the genre it was more than acceptable. I enjoyed looking at the show, and was never offended by the animation. Overall I thought that for a slice of life the animation...was good. 7/10The sound is a bit hit or miss. The soundtrack was inoffensive and pleasant, I don\'t think I\'ll go out of my way to add it to my collection of anime soundtracks, but it lent itself well to the laid back atmosphere of the show. I watched the dub, and the voice acting was a bit rocky. I didn\'t find the older girl\'s and adult voices offensive in any way and thought that they were voiced well. I will say the delivery of some lines were stiff and awkward, but how much of that is the VA\'s fault I can\'t be sure. The little kids in this anime are really poorly voiced, I found them really grating and unpleasant. Overall the sound was fine, 6/10The character\'s were also kind of bland like the story. None of them were unpleasant, but they didn\'t really hold my attention. There is a lot of wasted potential in the main characters back story and how it relates to her experiences throughout the events of the show. Overall the characters are just alright. 5/10I found myself mildly entertained for the first and last few episodes, but the middle ~6 episodes I found myself bored and really wanted to stop watching. It\'s a super chill show, but to the point that is becomes bland and tedious. I didn\'t really enjoy it that much. 4/10, but my final score is not really based on this category.Overall it\'s a 6/10, none of the characters except the main two are interesting in the least, I did find the two main characters a little more interesting, but that was never capitalized on.

There are flaws Ive encountered while watching this.Story is……. ok I suppose. Although there was “some” storyline, it felt so random and just plain short. There weren’t any badass fighting besides the Giant Snake or Gruzam’s revenge, which they look cool, but lasted only a few minutes, likely around 3-6. It’s not like a long 9 - 12 minute fight nor it has some power to it.

There are some episodes that just wholesome like ep 9, and there are some that are meh like ep 3. I would prob give this a 5.Overall, I think this anime is great, but its so limited.

Unfortunately, I didn\'t feel like making an effort to like meant-to-be likeable characters of Fina, her little sis, and other Moe characters. At end of day, they\'re uninteresting moeblobs who might have forced me to clench my teeth at some overdramatic scenes that leads to mood whiplash because the overpowered protagonist has solved the...serious issue like it was no big deal. Sounds familiar to you, right?Sure it\'s always the main protagonist that we end up sticking throughout the series, but sadly enough, Yuna, the series\' protagonist who has made bears become popular in the new world, isn\'t any different from those OP male protagonists we see in those generic isekai harem series. I do appreciate that we get to see a female protagonist to be OP to the max and that there\'s no sight of direct/subtle gender stereotyping in this series;But with her backstory being disregarded nonchalantly, Yuna is obviously wirtten as a self-insert protagonist whose self-serving bias become so obvious that it\'s a bit grating to anyone who\'s unable to have loads of suspension of disbelief. Not to mention, Yuna\'s overall personality feels overfamiliar even towards any avid isekai fans; like I said, ""Sounds familiar, right?"".In my POV, Yuna really didn\'t get any proper character development for she\'s written under the common tropes related to isekai protagonist generally. Well except the lacklustre final episode where she realises what has changed within her whole self. Yes, the cliffhanger was meh to me because emotional impact is a very important element that needs to pull off with proper execution regardless of a season renewal.I don\'t know how many can give this series a high score, but I guess these reviewers love Isekai no matter how bland, predictable or run-of-the-mill the storytelling elements they\'ve. Maybe I\'m not gung-ho about CGDCT in Kuma Bear despite myself liking Super Cub at most of its runtime. Either way, I won\'t be watching the next season for I don\'t wanna force myself to watch something that makes me feel monotonous & slightly annoyed with it. I only give this score because I like how Yuna can be an OP hero regardless of her gender & that the animation quality is good enough to look at (a.k.a. be watchable). Plus, I\'ve just remembered I didn\'t drop this because of the bear familiars Yuna has been keeping inside her Bear Gloves.I only recommend this series if you\'re an avid isekai fan who could care less about the storytelling being typical/predictable, absence of character development, and the moeblobs being the same cardboard cutout personalities regardless of their character & costume design being different/distinctive. By all means, go ahead and enjoy this meant-to-be cute series while I rewatch Bofuri and forget about this forgettable series.

Actually, there's more and I will covers the show with relatable perspective that this show seems to offer, an OP Isekai. Seeing so many Isekai's Anime in this current year, lowers expectation of people. I assure you, this one is a perfect show to fill your boring life while Pandemic. Sure, MC was OP, nothing can beat them, eh? In fact, there is, the shows convey 'feeling' as part of Weaknesses of OP Character. The friends bounding, develop into more eager feeling towards each other. Seeing them worried for one another, is...cute.[ Graphics ]A subtle complement to 'cute' is the simple coloring. Each character, the environment, the nature was drawn beautiful and cutely. The subtle saturation and a supposedly color-like pastels? Really stands-out the Fantasy, really showing that this Anime is infact 'Fun'. Seeing them is kind of refreshing instead of boring life. This comes down in a cost, that this shows might not really offers you a detailed graphics, it's overlapped by it's simplicity. For example, you can't see a subtle dust in it's environment, the bruises is like a melted chocolate mess, the blur is not helping either. But I like it for it's simplicity, I don't mind it either. Cute and Simple.[ Story ]I always mention: 'boring life', what's the intention? Yuna as the MC, has subtle repetitivenes and to alter the 'boringness' is by playing the game. I guess, you could see where the story is heading. Nope, I don't want to spoil but as you might predicted, it's correct, generic Isekai Anime. Also the reason I mention it's simplicity is because you can't really expect an heavy lifting in the story. It's balanced fun. This might not suitable for some people, but I'm not bringing my personal like or not genre. It is what it is. The balanced part: While it is fun, it's also convoluted with some political issue, human behaviour, more bigger quest means more bigger challange it's required. The generic part comes when all of the shows spices are only happen to either the MC or it's close people. NPC are conveyed as 'Easy to beat' and 'Cliche Personality'. Nothing else, really. It's giving me cringe, especially when it involve MC inner circle, the parents. The cringe is so huge at that one scene that I just wish to die, atleast the trade off is by continue watching all of the episode episode as it goes back to normal. All is good.In paragraph 2, I will dive more into the story as we enough talk about the generic part, generic is generic. Yuna develop more bonding from literally the second episode till end towards her new girl friend. The bonding is so strong that the chain that resembles Yuri becomes clear at the end episode, It's not kind of that but it's definitely that. I can't say it's cute but other than that, it is cute. Kinda shocks me at the end realizing that. Well the bonding given at the story may good at best as it's only 12 episode and it's definitely short to resembles some Yuri bonding. Another spices of the story, the politics, it's really common problem that many Isekai genre gave to it's watchers, but the inheritance of being a simple story, destroying all the 'solution phase' of the spices. The politics being simply resolved by the villain getting arrested, even tho there's emotional emotion that got me in the middle (the starving part) the resolution makes me forget my emotion. It's like a holy water that exorcist all previous good emotion.[ Sounds ]The sounds aspect is okay at best, as there's inconsistencies that existed. The Yuna 'inside voice' is always crisp to hear, is it because of Yuna raucous voice? At some scene, that's not her 'inside voice' is talking, you can literally imagine Yuna being in a room, talking to a mic. The incosistencies are rather not noticable as it's only rare but for example: The Kai voice is unmatched after the town's party. So it's still resemble a 6-7 for the sound aspect. Gonna give a 10 to Yuna 'Inside Voice'.[ Conclusion ]Ranging in 6-9, reserved at 8 for overall rating. That's it. cute.[ Graphics ]A subtle complement to 'cute' is the simple coloring.

Natsu no Arashi!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5597/Natsu_no_Arashi,"[""It’s a crime that this series seems to be so unappreciated and under viewed when clichéd garbage such as Maria Holic gets overhyped and legions of fanboys.  I only bring up Maria Holic because it was made by the same studio, SHAFT, and I feel both have a kind of niche quality to them.  However where Maria falls on its face, Natsu no Arashi! emerges as one of the best shows of 2009.To sum up the storyline in a word it would be; quirky.  From the beginning of the first episode and from just looking at the promotional art you might think...this is just yet another school comedy romance.  That wouldn’t be a big surprise since the author of the source material is Jin Kobayashi who is probably best known for creating School Rumble.  However this notion of it being just a romance-comedy is quickly turned on its head as it takes a turn for the bizarre and supernatural.  Ghosts, time travel, comedy, and romance put together makes for one of the most unusual and original shows I’ve seen.Everything about Natsu no Arashi! feels fresh and new.  I have seen quite a few series now and that is not a feeling I get all that often anymore either.  Natsu is very funny, and that is one thing Jin Kobayashi understands well.  Though I am not a huge fan of his work, even though I find a lot of it funny it always eventually seems to annoy me.  It’s rare that I watch a comedy and don’t feel like I am watching the same joke told over and over.  It is even rarer still that a comedy manages to use echii humor and for it to come across as completely tasteful and non perverted.  I don't recall seeing any ones boobs or panties even once yet this series oozes sex appeal.Time travel is the most important element of the plot.  Many of the familiar paradoxes are brought up along with the consequences and ramifications of altering the past in regards to the future.  Some of the technobabble gobblygook is likely to give you a headache but several of the shows more funny gags are made possible with time travelling.  In particular Sayaka's believe that taking expired milk into the past before its expiration date will make it good to drink.The only real negative in terms of the plot is that it is a bit confusing and strange at time.  By the end it all makes sense but for the first half of the series your likely to be scratching your head a lot and wondering what on earth is going on.  Some people aren’t going to like this and the way the series is structured, starting at the end and then flashbacking to the beginning can be a bit hit or miss.  That’s the only thing I can really complain about.  That and it was too short!  Good news is that a second season is in the works!Hajime and Arashi are without a doubt one of my favorite lead character duos.  My first impression of Hajime was he looks just like Luffy from One Piece!  Beyond the physical resemblance there is nothing else in common with him.  He’s a likeable lead and makes a great narrator for the story.  There isn’t a lot of back story on him but see him grow up over the course of the series.  Arashi herself is just a great character.  Most of the shows sex appeal is because of her.  It goes to show that you can have sexy characters without gravity defying breasts and skirts so short they barely cover the hips.  We learn a lot about her past and she remains and interesting character until the very end.The rest of the supporting cast is also very good.  As Arashi's best friend, Kaya is basically the complete opposite of Arashi in personality.  She is very important to the main story and we get about as much character development from her as any of the other leads.  Jun is the one character I would have liked to have seen more screen time and back story for.  Perhaps I will get my wish in the next season.  Sayaka is quite funny as the con artist owner of the Ark in which most of the cast works.  The best of the shows running gags flows through her.  I could go on and on about the entire cast but I can’t find one that I didn’t really love, right down to the cafe customer who futilely asks for the salt during the entire series.The art and animation is absolutely gorgeous.  SHAFT always does a fine job in this area but in Natsu I think they really outdid themselves.  The backgrounds and settings are beautiful but it’s the character models which I really fell in love with.  As I mentioned the show has just this sexy and a bit erotic feel to it despite not feeling like its being exploitive.  I thought everything was just very tastefully done.  Especially when compared to the tacky way most anime series do things.Sound, music, acting is all tremendous.  Natsu has a great cast including some personal favorites such as Yui Horie.  The OP theme is really tremendous both musically and artistically with the animation.  It’s one of the sexiest OPs I think I have ever seen.  The incidental music and EN songs are all great as well.Natsu no Arashi! is truly a work of art and genius.  If you haven’t seen this yet then I have to ask, what are you waiting for?  I’m not sure where I would rank it in regards to everything else I have seen but it’s one of the few series I can find almost no major faults with.

I give it my highest possible recommendation."", ""Natsu no Arashi was a manga written by Kobayashi Jin, known for his work with School Rumble, and published by Square Enix. In 2009 it received a two series anime adaptation from Shaft. The same studio behind the Rec series and the sub-par Ef A Tale of Memories. But it's not all bad. They also did the work for Madoka and a bunch of stuff I've never seen and can't comment on. So, how does this one hold up? Let's look at the first series.Story:It's summer time and thirteen year old Yasaka Hajime is moving to a new area. When stopping by a small cafe...he meets Arashi, an attractive older girl. While working at the cafe, Arashi is accosted by a brutish looking man in sunglasses who claims that her family hired him to bring her back, a claim that leaves Arashi visibly confused. Hajime intervenes to help her and the two end up grasping hands and going back in time. Arashi tells Hajime that she's a ghost and they've just connected. She also asks him to travel back with her so that she can save people who would have died during bombing raids in the second World War. He's naturally skeptical at first, but he goes along with it because he finds her attractive. After going back in time and finding a sixty year old photograph in the present of Arashi where she looks exactly the same as she currently does, he believes her. They meet a second ghost named Kaja, who had been a good friend of Arashi's when they were both alive.Let's start with the problems with the series. The big one is that it's tonally bizarre. You have some episodes that focus primarily on zany time travel shenanigans and others that treat things a lot more seriously. Remember when the first series of Galaxy Angel randomly had a serious episode and it made no sense? Imagine if the series had been closer to half serious episodes and half zany comedic ones. It feels disjointed, like you're watching two different shows entirely. There's also a huge problem with the serious episodes. They try to establish tension and make you worry about the safety of the main characters, even faking you out about whether or not a couple of them will survive. But the first episode in the series takes place after all of this. Gee, I wonder who will make it out okay besides everyone? The comedy is pretty hit or miss too. Some of it works well. Some of it is basically repeating an earlier episode, even using the same payoff, but this time they're wearing ridiculous outfits, some of which are really fan-servicey, that shift from scene to scene. Then there are the jokes that really don't qualify as jokes. The big one being the scenes where Yayoi and Kanako talk about the book that Yayoi read but can't remember the title of. She then proceeds to describe it and the punchline is that it's something from pop culture. This conversation gets basically repeated with a different piece of pop culture in virtually every episode. Yeah, referencing pop culture isn't funny. Parodying pop culture can be funny. Snarkily pointing out various aspects of pop culture can be funny. Just pointing out that it exists through a general description and a catch phrase isn't funny.On a positive side, both sets of episodes are pretty decent, even when you factor in them not playing particularly well together. There are some pretty funny moments throughout the series and the more serious episodes do have some good touching moments, like the stuff between Yayoi and Kanako. I also appreciate that the series establishes rules for time travel early on and follows them throughout. The characters also have some pretty detailed discussions about time travel and they ask all of the major questions that you would expect concerning paradoxes and the ethical implications of changing the past. Which I do like, it has a certain realism that a lot of time travel narratives ignore. I also like that they use time travel for things that are actually important in addition to the petty shenanigans. Yeah, this half comedy does better on that front than the supposedly dramatic Girl Who Leapt Through Time.Characters:I will give the series credit, most of its characters are pretty well developed and have motivations that make sense. The big exceptions being “Shades” and the cafe owner, who follow their tropes pretty strictly. Sure, the characters do believe and do some stupid things, but they're mistakes that make sense and have verisimilitude. I do appreciate that Kobayashi took the trouble to flesh them out since a lot of zany comedies just stick to basic tropes. We probably owe them being fleshed out to the series being half serious which illustrates how the mix of the two elements could have been a really good thing if not for how awkward the execution was.Art:The art is a bit odd. The series likes to do strange things with perspective like putting in random overhead views or showing things from a slanted angle arbitrarily. It also likes to make things chaotic in scenes that are supposed to be more intense and it's not really in a good way. They're trying to convey that someone is remembering or seeing terrible things without actually showing anything intense. It does work in the sense that you get the idea behind it, but it also kind of hurts the impact. It's like those “sex scenes” you get in some media that show a train entering a tunnel or fireworks going off or something ridiculous like that. Scenes like that can be funny, but they don't really work in a context where they're supposed to be intense. The backgrounds are kind of lazy. I will give the series credit for having character designs that are pretty good, though. I'll also give the artists credit for doing the facial expressions really well. They're just incredibly emotive.Sound:The voice acting is decent enough. There really aren't any performances that are just amazing, (Horie Yui's probably comes the closest since she does have some strong emotional scenes) but all of them are well done. Not the best performances, but good ones. The music is pretty standard. There's nothing wrong with it but nothing that stands out about it either.Ho-yay:There's a bit. Yayoi and Kanako definitely come across as being more than friends. But they don't play a major role in that many episodes and the most they do is hold hands while looking lovingly into each others' eyes. So, the ho-yay factor is a 3/10 for those two.Final Thoughts:Natsu no Arashi has quite a few highly noticeable problems. Whether its two tones that don't so much mix as sit awkwardly beside each other, some strange art direction, jokes that just fall flat or moments that should be tense being ruined by the series spoiling the result. However, both the serious and zany episodes are pretty well handled and the series has a lot of good moments. Some funny, some touching. It also has well fleshed out characters and capable voice work and the art is pretty good in spite of its odd direction at times. My final rating for the series is going to be a 6/10. It's decent. I'll take a look at the second series some other time but for next week let's look at Gakuen Heaven. he meets Arashi, an attractive older girl. While working at the cafe, Arashi is accosted by a brutish looking man in sunglasses who claims that her family hired him to bring her back, a claim that leaves Arashi visibly confused. Hajime intervenes to help her and the two end up grasping hands and going back in time. Arashi tells Hajime that she's a ghost and they've just connected.

Some of it is basically repeating an earlier episode, even using the same payoff, but this time they're wearing ridiculous outfits, some of which are really fan-servicey, that shift from scene to scene. Then there are the jokes that really don't qualify as jokes. The big one being the scenes where Yayoi and Kanako talk about the book that Yayoi read but can't remember the title of. She then proceeds to describe it and the punchline is that it's something from pop culture. This conversation gets basically repeated with a different piece of pop culture in virtually every episode. Yeah, referencing pop culture isn't funny. Parodying pop culture can be funny. Snarkily pointing out various aspects of pop culture can be funny. Just pointing out that it exists through a general description and a catch phrase isn't funny.On a positive side, both sets of episodes are pretty decent, even when you factor in them not playing particularly well together. There are some pretty funny moments throughout the series and the more serious episodes do have some good touching moments, like the stuff between Yayoi and Kanako. I also appreciate that the series establishes rules for time travel early on and follows them throughout. The characters also have some pretty detailed discussions about time travel and they ask all of the major questions that you would expect concerning paradoxes and the ethical implications of changing the past. Which I do like, it has a certain realism that a lot of time travel narratives ignore. I also like that they use time travel for things that are actually important in addition to the petty shenanigans. Yeah, this half comedy does better on that front than the supposedly dramatic Girl Who Leapt Through Time.Characters:I will give the series credit, most of its characters are pretty well developed and have motivations that make sense. The big exceptions being “Shades” and the cafe owner, who follow their tropes pretty strictly. Sure, the characters do believe and do some stupid things, but they're mistakes that make sense and have verisimilitude. I do appreciate that Kobayashi took the trouble to flesh them out since a lot of zany comedies just stick to basic tropes. We probably owe them being fleshed out to the series being half serious which illustrates how the mix of the two elements could have been a really good thing if not for how awkward the execution was.Art:The art is a bit odd. The series likes to do strange things with perspective like putting in random overhead views or showing things from a slanted angle arbitrarily. It also likes to make things chaotic in scenes that are supposed to be more intense and it's not really in a good way. They're trying to convey that someone is remembering or seeing terrible things without actually showing anything intense. It does work in the sense that you get the idea behind it, but it also kind of hurts the impact. It's like those “sex scenes” you get in some media that show a train entering a tunnel or fireworks going off or something ridiculous like that. Scenes like that can be funny, but they don't really work in a context where they're supposed to be intense. The backgrounds are kind of lazy. I will give the series credit for having character designs that are pretty good, though. I'll also give the artists credit for doing the facial expressions really well. They're just incredibly emotive.Sound:The voice acting is decent enough. There really aren't any performances that are just amazing, (Horie Yui's probably comes the closest since she does have some strong emotional scenes) but all of them are well done. Not the best performances, but good ones. The music is pretty standard. There's nothing wrong with it but nothing that stands out about it either.Ho-yay:There's a bit. Yayoi and Kanako definitely come across as being more than friends. But they don't play a major role in that many episodes and the most they do is hold hands while looking lovingly into each others' eyes. So, the ho-yay factor is a 3/10 for those two.Final Thoughts:Natsu no Arashi has quite a few highly noticeable problems. Whether its two tones that don't so much mix as sit awkwardly beside each other, some strange art direction, jokes that just fall flat or moments that should be tense being ruined by the series spoiling the result. However, both the serious and zany episodes are pretty well handled and the series has a lot of good moments. Some funny, some touching. It also has well fleshed out characters and capable voice work and the art is pretty good in spite of its odd direction at times. My final rating for the series is going to be a 6/10. It's decent. I'll take a look at the second series some other time but for next week let's look at Gakuen Heaven."", 'Stories 9/10:Natsu no Arashi (summer storm) is not like your average drama/slice of life series.It started the series by some complicated things like time travel and no character introduction at all, somehow this will give 2 kind of impression for the viewer :1.

To be honest, I didn\'t know about Natsu no Arashi due to it\'s low popularity until I ran out of recent anime to watch! LOL. Of course, seeing how much I\'ve enjoyed from watching School Rumble, I thought Kobayashi\'s new series would not disappoint, despite the rather low ratings given. Turns out, I was right! As some people would say, ""don\'t judge a book by it\'s cover"", the same thing sorta applies here. Don\'t just look at its 7.something rating score, but actually try watching/reading the series, each series will have...different tastes for different people. Anyways, I\'m sure you\'re here for the review, not me blabbing about it.Story: 9Soz, when I first started watching this series, I was able to be absorbed in on the main plot, but I felt that the stories where more or less one shots per episode or 2. It\'s easy to tell that this style of story-planning belongs to Jin Kobayashi, but this one was easily more well-planned out than School Rumble was. I was amazed how absorbed by the plot and I stayed up till about 4 AM to finish the series. I also noticed how this type of genre/story only attracts a very specific group of viewers, but ignoring the obvious genre, I thought Natsu No Arashi was a pretty refreshing series to watch and the story was  definitely superb.Art: 10Art, is something that varies between people. Luckily for me and School Rumble buffs, the art has remained more or less the same. A major difference I noticed between School Rumble\'s art and Natsu no Arashi\'s art was that Jin Kobayashi drew the eyes of the characters a bit differently. Not that it affects the viewer\'s opinion a lot, just a little not. Outstanding art and graphics, nothing to complain about here :DSound: 8I actually found the OP and the EDs pretty good. I don\'t know if anyone noticed but they change the lyrics of the OP every episode. They say like ""on my 8th Summer"" to reference the 8th episode and that changes per episode Also, they say something different about the joys of summer every time in the OP. As for the ED, I found the dancing Arashi to be a great candidate for the next Ipod CM! ROFL. The ending\'s music wasn\'t too shabby and was in fact, quite catchy. The thing that bothered me the most about sound was the lack of OST present during the series. Either i was too absorbed by Arashi\'s looks or there just really wasn\'t much music?Character: 10As with School Rumble, the characters were pretty versatile and i found the Master/ Arashi / and Kaja have very  good personalities between the 3 of them, and it provides variety in the show. Also, Hajime and Jun had also very supplementary characteristics leading to hilarious clashes between the two. Overall, I thought the characters were much more appealing than most of the other shows i\'ve watched recently. Definitely a plus for this show.Enjoyment: 10Personally, as long as the art, character, and story is good, my enjoyment is almost always high. It\'s impossible to not enjoy such a great series as Natsu no Arashi. With many funny moments in the series, lots of crush-like romance, and several parodies of School Rumble such as Tenma Tsukamoto/ Eri Sawachika on a milk carton or Harima and Tenma spotted on a date or a character drawn very similar to Yakumo Tsukamoto. Personally, I thought because Jin Kobayashi realized Yakumo\'s success in School Rumble, he made Arashi\'s attributes very a like to Yakumo such as the hair and eyes.Overall: 10Well, if you could see my expression at the moment, you could tell it\'s an obvious ten. Natsu no Arashi is definitely one of the top anime that was released during it\'s time. I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen an anime with such genres been as appealing as Natsu no Arashi was. I certainly hope there will be a sequel to the Natsu no Arashi Akinaichuu, but I doubt it. Although so underrated, Natsu no Arashi will always be one of the very best show\'s I\'ve ever watched. Definitely will be rewatching some time soon! I hope you\'ll will enjoy it as much as I did! different tastes for different people.

I hope you\'ll will enjoy it as much as I did!', ""When I first started watching this, I was tempted to turn it off because the animation style was very unusual and it took me a little while to get used to. I'm very glad I stuck with it, as it turned out to be quite a good watch. It's about a young boys summer adventures with a ghost from WW2. Very different from anything you would expect, and I highly recommend it. "", ""Natsu no Arashi! is what you get when you take an anime like Working!! and fuse it with the science of time travel, WWII and 1970's nostalgia. Adapted from a manga by School Rumble's Jin Kobayashi, this series is directed by Akiyuki Shinbo and Shin Oonuma (both of SHAFT fame of course) and written by Arakawa Under the Bridge's Deko Akao and Takayama Katsuhiko who wrote Ga Rei Zero and Boku no Pico (No, seriously).It's about a boy named Yasaka Hajime (voiced by Yuuko Sanpei) who's having the summer of his life by working in a cafe during the summer with a ghost named Arashiyama...(voiced by Ryoko Shiraishi) who has the ability to time travel to the past. Both Arashiyama and Yasaka worked in the cafe with their boss Sayaka (voiced by Hitomi Nabatame), Yasaka's friend Jun (voiced by Chiaki Omigawa) along with other ghosts including a German girl named Kaja (voiced by Kaori Nazuka), and two of Arashiyama's school mates Kanako (voiced by Yui Horie) and Yayoi (voiced by Nonaka Ai). And frequenting the cafe is a detective named Hideo Murata (voiced by Hiroki Yasumoto) and several characters voiced by Tomokazu Sugita.The thing i love about this series is the music. The OP and ED for this anime is based on the groovy late 60s to mid 70's music that was popular in Asia. My parents were raised by the music of the 60's and 70's, and listening to the OPs and EDs of this anime brought me back to the days of my mom & dad listening to vinyl records of the 60's and 70's. And the that 60's/70's influenced sounds are littered throughout the series. it's even played during the scenes in the cafe, which makes you feel liek you are there.The visuals and art are okay. However, i do not think that Shinbo and Oonuma's directing is fit with the art of this series. There is something i felt missing whenever i look at the art and direction of Natsu no Arashi. I always think the designs of Jin Kobayashi's anime are more suited for straightforward directing like you see in Schol Rumble. But Shinbo and Oonuma does manage to make their direction work well sometimes and since this animne is less absurd and less weird than his other works, i think he along with Azuma Kouji, Watanabe Mayumi and Hibino Jin pulled it off really good.There are subplots in this anime, including a backstory on Arashiyama's past, along with backstories on other ghosts like Kaja, Yayoi and Kanako. There's even an episode discussing the ideas of time travel paradoxes, and it's hilarious. Seeing Sayaka and Kaja debating ontological paradox for an entire episode is just amusing to my sake.Now the characters to me are very good and likeable. Yasaka is a rare male character. He's enthusiastic, playful and he doesn't give a fuck.  You don't see guys like him being main characters nowadays. And what's better is that he works in a cafe full of female employees, and yet this series does it well in refusing to give a harem subplot for Yasaka. He doesn't go around and flirt with his female colleagues. He just wants to have fun working with a time travelling ghost in a cafe which is filled with female employees.This is very underrated. Infact, it's so underrated that you don't see this anime being discussed alot unlike other anime series by SHAFT. If you really love works by SHAFT, then i suggest you should go and watch this. It deserves more recognition and more DVD sales because while it has 2 seasons, i think a 3rd season would be great as well.Oh, and can you pass me some salt please?

It is interesting , yet a bit confusing.I really am worried though that time travel will become something done over and over to the point where it becomes unoriginal. You can make any story with a time travel element interesting as long as you don\'t buy the thing and expect  it to work on it\'s own. Like buying bagels, the bagel is the base and what you put on it is actually what shows yourself and talents .Why am...I talking about timetravel? Well this show is about timetravel and not only that but this is the one show that no one knew Akiyuki Shinbo actually directed. Sure he directed Monogatari and Madoka Magica but he did this one too sooo, Anyways.In Natsu no Arashi\'s case. This is just a regular plain bagel with a side of cream on the very end of the plate.Natsu no Arashi(Summer Storm) is about a boy and a girl who have the power to time travel, and instead of saving the world they use it for shenanigans like sabotaging food and using spoiled milk. They work iat this rural cafe living their lives and doing dumb things.The first episode is the most entertaining part of show because it\'s hilarious and intriguing at the same time. But then the show loses its humor  and still holds onto the intrigue during a bit of  middle part where they go back far in time and touch on the theme of changing something back then and making present things different. But that\'s only a portion of the mess thats goes on. This show is called Natsu no Arashi but to be honest, they should have been called""REPETITION"" that one word is the basis of every element in the show from structure all the way to animation.The first use of repetition is the guy who doesn\'t get salt and the second use of repetition is the ending of each episode where these two girls who don\'t get into the show till the end are telling about stories they\'ve read which is literally just references to other works.REPETITION. A good bit of entertainment comes when they actually break their repetition in the final episodes which is very clever.The story is good but only when its supposed to be and besides that everything else is just doing stuff. There is an actual story but the majority of the show does not progress the story.if that makes sense.The animation is decent, but that\'s an understatement. What I like about Shinbo and those kooks over at SHAFT is when they don\'t have the budget to make this show look good since they\'re working on Bakemonogatari they still make it refined. When characters don\'t move and just talk, there are crazy SHAFT and artsy fartsy shots and backgrounds, lots and lots of color  and some live action shots for good measure.This is where the REPETITION comes in;Every episode just about has the same aerial shots in certain spaces.  What I like about these shots is that it actually makes me feel immersed in this world. I feel like I am observing these people from a distance instead of looking like I am laying on the ground looking up someone\'s skirt. There are some disorienting moments though,  there is this time where the foreground and background like the building , trees and sky are moving in different positions like a powerpoint animation. It was a bit weird.Then there are always those shots that have some glowing gradient around the frame and that happens just about every shot. The character designs themselves especially for the female figure looked a bit odd for a SHAFT work.I took some time to get used to but some of the character designs looked very nostalgic in a way.Also the actually character moment can be smooth and subtle if they move at all.And it\'s not a SHAFT work without references . This is the case with the people who show up at the cafe and the op and ed sequence. From School Rumble to Touhou and even Earthbound for some reason. Also, the characters are featured on their own album covers that are actually references to other album covers. Repetition plays a part too because of the recycling of animation from the OP sequence which was nice.The ED uses sequences of live action shots. The one thing I wasn\'t a fan of was the second ED because it looked like they did four different versions of the second ed but decided to overlay all four of them together and ohh man it hurt my eyes.Despite the fact that the show focuses on time travel. the music itself divides from it. The tone for the music is very jazzy there are a lot of horns and trumpets , The first OP is pretty much a summary of the soundtrack. Then the music gets a bit weird when the plot actually goes on and I miss my horns and trumpets already.The first and second ED are no different with the horns but the vocalists for both are great.The characters is probably the weakest part of the show. The little boy(Hajime) at first was very annoying and I wasn\'t looking forward to him for the rest of the season, but the entire show doesn\'t focus on him so that annoyance was not seen .Then there\'s his partner(Arashi) who is actually the time traveling ghost, She is a very sweet person and she is not rude but thats it. She has more emotions but she doesn\'t really try to express them. The other ""boy"" is called Jun who is gynophobic apparently.She gets the most character development than anyone else so I don\'t see why (her oops I mean him is not on the posters and stuff. His/her partner is Kaja is a very formal person because of the traditions that women possessed back then but thats the only part of her character that is interesting . She is also good at singing.Then there\'s every one else. We got the two guys at the table who get less than 4 seconds of screen time every episode But they are IN every episode(This is where the REPETITION comes in),Then theres the two girls who don\'t really play a part until the final episodes.And finally that Police Detective guy ,Murata. who is constantly harassing Arashi and the others despite the fact that he is as broke as a door knob. And the cafe owner, Sayaka who is actually one of the more interesting characters. She is very cheap and sly but she\'s not stupid or annoying. She is kinda portrayed as the drunkard of the show and if anything she made me laugh a good bit of the time.These characters may be nothing special individually but the true magic comes when they interact with each other.If you are a Shinbo fanboy, if you were in a trival game guessing his works, I am pretty sure this show will be the one show you will have trouble with. It is good:not great but not bad. If you have any time on your hands to laugh or if time travel is your favorite element in anime then you should give this a go but don\'t expect the show to fully commit to either side.Overall-7Bagels do sound good plain though i\'ll admit, but you see my point. I talking about timetravel? Well this show is about timetravel and not only that but this is the one show that no one knew Akiyuki Shinbo actually directed. Sure he directed Monogatari and Madoka Magica but he did this one too sooo, Anyways.In Natsu no Arashi\'s case. This is just a regular plain bagel with a side of cream on the very end of the plate.Natsu no Arashi(Summer Storm) is about a boy and a girl who have the power to time travel, and instead of saving the world they use it for shenanigans like sabotaging food and using spoiled milk. They work iat this rural cafe living their lives and doing dumb things.The first episode is the most entertaining part of show because it\'s hilarious and intriguing at the same time. But then the show loses its humor  and still holds onto the intrigue during a bit of  middle part where they go back far in time and touch on the theme of changing something back then and making present things different. But that\'s only a portion of the mess thats goes on. This show is called Natsu no Arashi but to be honest, they should have been called""REPETITION"" that one word is the basis of every element in the show from structure all the way to animation.The first use of repetition is the guy who doesn\'t get salt and the second use of repetition is the ending of each episode where these two girls who don\'t get into the show till the end are telling about stories they\'ve read which is literally just references to other works.REPETITION. A good bit of entertainment comes when they actually break their repetition in the final episodes which is very clever.The story is good but only when its supposed to be and besides that everything else is just doing stuff. There is an actual story but the majority of the show does not progress the story.if that makes sense.The animation is decent, but that\'s an understatement. What I like about Shinbo and those kooks over at SHAFT is when they don\'t have the budget to make this show look good since they\'re working on Bakemonogatari they still make it refined. When characters don\'t move and just talk, there are crazy SHAFT and artsy fartsy shots and backgrounds, lots and lots of color  and some live action shots for good measure.This is where the REPETITION comes in;Every episode just about has the same aerial shots in certain spaces.  What I like about these shots is that it actually makes me feel immersed in this world. I feel like I am observing these people from a distance instead of looking like I am laying on the ground looking up someone\'s skirt. There are some disorienting moments though,  there is this time where the foreground and background like the building , trees and sky are moving in different positions like a powerpoint animation. It was a bit weird.Then there are always those shots that have some glowing gradient around the frame and that happens just about every shot. The character designs themselves especially for the female figure looked a bit odd for a SHAFT work.I took some time to get used to but some of the character designs looked very nostalgic in a way.Also the actually character moment can be smooth and subtle if they move at all.And it\'s not a SHAFT work without references . This is the case with the people who show up at the cafe and the op and ed sequence. From School Rumble to Touhou and even Earthbound for some reason. Also, the characters are featured on their own album covers that are actually references to other album covers. Repetition plays a part too because of the recycling of animation from the OP sequence which was nice.The ED uses sequences of live action shots. The one thing I wasn\'t a fan of was the second ED because it looked like they did four different versions of the second ed but decided to overlay all four of them together and ohh man it hurt my eyes.Despite the fact that the show focuses on time travel. the music itself divides from it. The tone for the music is very jazzy there are a lot of horns and trumpets , The first OP is pretty much a summary of the soundtrack. Then the music gets a bit weird when the plot actually goes on and I miss my horns and trumpets already.The first and second ED are no different with the horns but the vocalists for both are great.The characters is probably the weakest part of the show. The little boy(Hajime) at first was very annoying and I wasn\'t looking forward to him for the rest of the season, but the entire show doesn\'t focus on him so that annoyance was not seen .Then there\'s his partner(Arashi) who is actually the time traveling ghost, She is a very sweet person and she is not rude but thats it. She has more emotions but she doesn\'t really try to express them. The other ""boy"" is called Jun who is gynophobic apparently.She gets the most character development than anyone else so I don\'t see why (her oops I mean him is not on the posters and stuff. His/her partner is Kaja is a very formal person because of the traditions that women possessed back then but thats the only part of her character that is interesting . She is also good at singing.Then there\'s every one else. We got the two guys at the table who get less than 4 seconds of screen time every episode But they are IN every episode(This is where the REPETITION comes in),Then theres the two girls who don\'t really play a part until the final episodes.And finally that Police Detective guy ,Murata. who is constantly harassing Arashi and the others despite the fact that he is as broke as a door knob. And the cafe owner, Sayaka who is actually one of the more interesting characters. She is very cheap and sly but she\'s not stupid or annoying. She is kinda portrayed as the drunkard of the show and if anything she made me laugh a good bit of the time.These characters may be nothing special individually but the true magic comes when they interact with each other.If you are a Shinbo fanboy, if you were in a trival game guessing his works, I am pretty sure this show will be the one show you will have trouble with. It is good:not great but not bad. If you have any time on your hands to laugh or if time travel is your favorite element in anime then you should give this a go but don\'t expect the show to fully commit to either side.Overall-7Bagels do sound good plain though i\'ll admit, but you see my point.', 'Story 9/10This anime is not an average drama/slice of life/rom-com/sci-fi, this is a masterpiece for me. The story is very unique.The story is about a boy who meets a girl that dies in the world war and is able to travel back in time. At first, I was confused because there was no character introduction and I was shocked when they time travel for the first time. But I enjoy watching every episode of this anime.Art 8/10I love the old-style drawings of this anime. I like the animation it is more like the ""Monogatari Series"" style.Sound 8/10The sound effect, ost, background music, intro, and...outro, was great.Character 9/10The character cast was excellent.I love how they create the characters in this anime. The male protagonist is kind, hilarious, and has good decision-making, The female protagonist is a caring and friendly person.Overall 9/10Recommended anime!This is a great anime. The story is not generic. it covers some slice of life as a middle schooler, romance, comedy, and sci-fi about time traveling. I love the art and sound used in this anime. If you think this anime is boring because of 1st episode, please still try to continue watching this anime, I\'m 100% sure that you will find this anime interesting to watch. outro, was great.Character 9/10The character cast was excellent.I love how they create the characters in this anime.

I really enjoy the focus on a time and a place that this series looks back on because history is something everyone should learn from and the obvious lesson here is that no matter where in the world you are from pain is the way for your body to tell you something is wrong, it is not a good thing and there is no way to justify it from any angle.This series is very good at...setting moods and creating unique humor with its time travel and I very much enjoyed this show because of it. I also felt they explained time travel perfectly even creating multiple examples and I really enjoyed the logical thinking behind it because even if something as fantastic as time travel doesn't exist in our world there are still many complex ways of looking at it and problems that are very fun to try and solve.The story wasn't breathtaking but I could feel the passion and work put into the characters and that is something very important to me in any series.

The first few episodes give hints that the show has more to offer, but mostly feel juvenile and kind of generic.  However, there is more going on than might be apparent at first glance.  The story grows deeper and by the end I even appreciated the beginning for the set up that it was.  I wouldn't normally say it's worth watching bad episodes to get to the good part, but the later episodes gave me a different perspective on the early ones.  The last episode is a...fan service episode, but done right.  There are swimsuits, but the story is the real audience pleaser. fan service episode, but done right.

Maoyuu Maou Yuusha,https://myanimelist.net/anime/14833/Maoyuu_Maou_Yuusha,"['The problem with creating a historical anime is frequently similar to that of adapting a manga or video game: oftentimes, the author has to resort to filler or fan-service materials to clumsily meet the airing requirements for shows. However, an axiom that directors ought to familiarize themselves with is that quality is invariably better than quantity.Thankfully, this inference only applies to certain aspects of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, a recent adaptation of the original light novels under the same name.Set in a time period of gruesome wars to political corruptions, Maoyuu depicts a fantasy world where humans and devils are fighting for the ultimate authority, while...exploring the infrastructures involved in wars. Despite it falling under the fantasy genre, Maoyuu brings many historical references into play--from the great innovations of the Discovery age (such as the compass, movable type prints, etc.) to the spread of crops like potato and corn into the agriculture industry. Moreover, it is reminiscent of a certain series that many of us could\'ve never forgotten--Spice and Wolf.Better known for its formula of enchanting romance, Spice and Wolf consists of a very similar antique structure in the way that it handles its plot, drama, world-building, and specifically, the daily lives of merchants. While this may sound bland, Spice and Wolf manages to make it work with a recipe of individual arcs for concentrated purposes, and thus, the viewer can gain a fine viewing of diverse episodes with several delightful, piquant subjects at hand.If Spice and Wolf is a mix between curry and rice, then Maoyuu would surely be a mix between potatoes and candy bars; since, it is neither a smart combination nor a completely satisfying experience. Still, it\'s only in comparison that one is weaker than the other. The steady, episodic approach that Maoyuu employs very much stands out on its own.A scaffolding plot, after all, is better than none at all. The story of Maoyuu starts out with our protagonist Yuusha, a hero siding with the humans, not expecting the beautiful demon queen Maou, whose only wish was to negotiate with him, in the heart of the demons\' castle. After their fated meeting, Yuusha then embarks on a journey at Maou\'s will, and each episode continues with mini-stories about Yuusha\'s encounters and findings for a seemingly nonexistent reason.Whereas, it is fairly obvious from the start that Yuusha has difficulties conveying his true intentions for Maou, and oftentimes these misunderstandings are used for comedic purposes as well as entertainment. Although repetitive, the several quirks that Maou and Yuusha begin to form do add onto the character interaction, and definitely made certain arcs more interesting.However, side characters do abruptly intervene in the capital of romance arcs, usually with very few good reasons for doing so, and thus, some developments can turn out stagnantly without progression. Most side characters also have very little to offer, ranging from a delusive maid to female knights like Onna Kishi. At times, female characters would surround Yuusha in herds, and it becomes questionable whether or not pandering to the audiences was the purpose. And, although some characters were satisfyingly fleshed out with conclusive stories, other individuals had trouble deciphering their prominent role in the series. Such abstruse matters also bring up the lack of characterization or any predisposition to determine the presence of a solid personality for specific characters, since most of the cast only experience trite developments.Maou, for example, is best described by her acquaintance as ""useless meat"". Although Maou herself denies this, and claims at all costs the significant deeds that she has achieved and will, the fact of the matter remains that her role embodies a few inconsistent hiccups. At times, she continuously aims to resolve world peace, while the scenes which repeatedly follow her scholarly deliberations are abruptly placed daydreams of Yuusha. Such applies to the grander scale of Maoyuu as it deconstructs historical figures and side characters to bring concerns about the time period being depicted--the medieval ages. Contrarily, the portrayal of the church\'s public servants during prehistoric times may have exaggerated some of the exploitations, but Maoyuu does extensively illustrate the corruption which overtook officials of feudal societies. Additionally, a charming aspect of Maoyuu resides with how the characters were named after fantasy classes, which effortlessly resonated a lovely core. However, due its enormous cast, Maoyuu couldn’t engender insightful eccentricities for certain characters as it did for others.Likewise, the character aesthetics in the series stuck with genuinely dull decorations as exemplified by Yuusha, whose character design emits the appeals of a generic, immutable male lead. Similarly, Maou has her own pairs of inflatable balloon issues, which many will see as being hackneyed and unoriginal.However, the art directing, layouts for many of the map animations and arrangement of urban images are, in comparison, much better. Correspondingly, majority of the background frameworks and presentations also fulfill their duty in making a location look rural, metropolitan, or even appropriately hideous.Music is undoubtedly one of Maoyuu\'s greatest assets. The original soundtrack entrances viewers with its vibrant nature, and likewise, the use of many instrumental pieces evokes an indelible atmosphere. With a spirited opening and ending theme, Maoyuu further enlivens its vigor. Correlation between the animation and music also paints an impressionable feeling for the series overall, and the seiyuus all befit their roles perfectly.On the contrary, good narration doesn’t necessarily equal quality dialogue.While the conversations in the series do present interesting observations about macroeconomics, some expositions on the networks of commerce can come off as brusque. Not only so, Maoyuu emphatically focuses on the construction of its own fantasy world, rather than the chronological order of its historical references, so some of the mentioned inventions furnish idealized timelines over what\'s factually correct. This, in turn, produces temporarily engrossing world-building, but it can also repeatedly bore or confuse the viewer with arbitrary elaborations on ultimately flimsy subjects.From the tone of my writing, it may sound like the majority of Maoyuu is about monotonous history or economics; however, during the latter parts of the series character relationships take center stage, and action scenes transpire more often. As most climaxes do, the story delivers a closing end towards previously unresolved issues, and desolating sides of things take form in both dialogues as well as battles. This, in some ways, may dismay some audiences since the pacing relatively changes, but as a closure, many aspects of the show become a lot more tasteful and digestible even in spite of the several interrelated topics displayed.Moderately diverse, Maoyuu is a series that really tries to bring something to the table for everyone, and in its mixture of historical references with fantasy themes, some of its themes are marred by oversimplified explanations. Although the stale, generic personalities some characters exhibit are very definite flaws, the majority of Maoyuu can still offer insights on the economic and strategic aspects of war, which shifts towards a manner infrequently attempted in its medium. It is most unfortunate, then, that this unique concept lacks the excitement its influences (Spice & Wolf) had obtained so gracefully. Perhaps if given a second season, the lackluster aspects of Maoyuu can do itself more justice through more concise yet lively handling of its themes, and its character relationships may become even more captivating. If nothing else, this series provides a fascinating outlook on the protocols and systems of commercial economics, but sadly, is a hero crippled by his towering boldness of attempting too many feats.Despite its unfortunate flaws, Maoyuu can still compensate for its faults by further constructing its dynamic universe, but only if a sequel will be permitted to fully execute the conceptual values. exploring the infrastructures involved in wars.

Who\'d have thought a dialogue-heavy fantasy anime about economics on the surface but powered by the character chemistry underneath would sell, right? But sell it did, and some people must have extrapolated that there\'s a under-tapped market for such an anime, because the next thing you know, along comes ""Maoyu Maou Yusha"", a show so blatantly similar to ""Spice and Wolf"" (the fantasy settings, the economic lectures, moe heroine sporting ginger hair and unusual strength of character and intelligence, etc etc) that people immediately started labelling it ""Spice and Wolf with Tits""....If you\'re wondering where the ""tits"" part comes in, it\'s probably because some people also speculated that the ""Spice and Wolf"" formula could be improved upon by providing the heroine with a pair of giant knockers to shake around in front of the screen at every opportunity.But an improvement it ain\'t. And by sharing so many things with ""Spice and Wolf"" (including a big chunk of the staff),  ""Spice and Wolf with Tits"" - or just SaWT for short - naturally invites comparisons with the material that inspired it. Alas, it\'s a comparison which ultimately does SaWT no favours because it falls so far short. But perhaps I\'m being overly harsh on the show; it does deserve plaudits for putting some interesting twists into the age-old humans vs demons script.The show starts with humans and demons at war with each other, and the Hero - literally named ""Hero"" - storming the demon king\'s castle solo to try and end the war. The demon king (and guess what the demon king is called) surprisingly turned out to be an attractive girl with big bouncy breasts instead of a giant frothing monster with razor fangs. What also surprised Hero was her personality: she spoke a remarkable amount of sense, and, with a few well-chosen arguments, demolished the pre-conceptions the Hero had regarding humans, demons, and the nature of the war. Bewitched by Demon King\'s silver tongue and hypnotised by her jiggling assets, Hero agrees to co-operate with her mission to set the world to rights with wisdom rather than wars.SaWT started a little rough, but its concept got me interested enough to continue watching. Most of the first half helped maintain my interest, mostly with the way Demon King went about changing the world through her learning, introducing new technologies, new methods of doing things and new ways of thinking. And it\'s this, and not the interaction between the main leads that\'s the focus of SaWT. But that\'s not a bad thing, because while the nuanced interaction between the protagonists excels as one of the greatest strengths of ""Spice and Wolf"", that same aspect is one of greatest weaknesses of SaWT. I realise things are supposed to be a bit awkward between the ridiculously shy leads, but the insipid small-talk and overblown romance cliches is a combination cringe-worthy enough to embarrass a third-rate romance novelist.While showing some initial promise, the show soon started falling apart. SaWT has a major problem of being overly self-conscious of what it\'s trying to do, and thus very little of what it does feels natural. Speeches about the ways of the world is almost condescendingly delivered through long expositions that\'s aimed more at the viewer than the other characters. Then there are Demon King\'s inventions: she starts off introducing things like crop rotations methods, but soon began inventing one major technology after another, like some kind of Thomas Edison raised to the third power. What\'s more, her contributions span across ludicrously diverse fields, from agriculture to medical science to navigation, just to name a few; nearly every episode she conjures up something new. In one episode, someone other than her actually managed to invent something (namely, sparkling orange juice, aka Fanta), and, determined not to be outdone, Demon King invents not one but TWO things during that episode (and no, Coke isn\'t one of them). By the half way point of the series, I felt like I was watching a game like ""Civilization"" being played, with the Demon King way ahead of the other players in researching the tech tree comprising mankind\'s greatest ideas and inventions.If Demon King is guilty of over-performing in her role, Hero is guilty of the opposite: as one half of the central protagonist pair, he simply doesn\'t carry his weight. While Demon King busied herself with changing the world, Hero spends the first half just tagging along and doing very little beyond admiring her. Though later on he does goes off to distant lands and contribute to Demon King\'s plans there, we rarely see what he does because the story is still mostly focused on Demon King and her endless output of inventions. In fact, the imbalance issue extends to everyone else, too: the Demon King seems so intelligent that she makes the show kind of boring, and everyone else appear so dim that they can\'t do anything until Demon King bestows onto them her pearls of wisdom; you have to wonder how the human race managed to hold off extinction before the Demon King came along.SaWT also has pacing problems. I enjoyed the gentle strolling pace of world changing used for the first part of the series, but the global politics quickly escalated to the point where I struggled to follow. Everything began changing in all the nations, half of which the show failed to properly establish in the first place; I\'d also started getting lost in all the economic babble, perhaps owing to my own meagre knowledge. The show simply accelerates away during the later parts and finishes in unseemly haste, leaving one giant political mess, full of dangling plot strands and badly explained developments, in its wake.But there I go again, coming down quite hard on the show. I do have a degree of respect for what SaWT tried to do, but the problem is that it simply did not do a good job. While it captured my interest early on, I struggled to get through the series as it progressed. It may not be a show devoid of intelligence, but it needed to be more intelligently written; it may not be a bad show, but it\'s far from being good. I guess it\'s just too much to expect a show that sought to improve upon something noted for its writing by throwing in a pair of big tits to amount to anything beyond A Good Try. And A Good Try is all SaWT managed to be.Personal rating: -0.5 (mediocre) If you\'re wondering where the ""tits"" part comes in, it\'s probably because some people also speculated that the ""Spice and Wolf"" formula could be improved upon by providing the heroine with a pair of giant knockers to shake around in front of the screen at every opportunity.But an improvement it ain\'t.

The show simply accelerates away during the later parts and finishes in unseemly haste, leaving one giant political mess, full of dangling plot strands and badly explained developments, in its wake.But there I go again, coming down quite hard on the show. I do have a degree of respect for what SaWT tried to do, but the problem is that it simply did not do a good job. While it captured my interest early on, I struggled to get through the series as it progressed. It may not be a show devoid of intelligence, but it needed to be more intelligently written; it may not be a bad show, but it\'s far from being good. I guess it\'s just too much to expect a show that sought to improve upon something noted for its writing by throwing in a pair of big tits to amount to anything beyond A Good Try. And A Good Try is all SaWT managed to be.Personal rating: -0.5 (mediocre)', 'Fantasy isn\'t quite like it used to be nowadays, or at least it doesn\'t want to be. Tolkien-like stories of great heroes and their adventures in the world inspired by Medieval are considered old news; now fantasy likes to be dark, edgy and bitter, showing the ""true rough nature"" of the world. There are good examples of such ""mature"" fantasy, the Witcher, for example, much as I dislike its focus on angst over substance. Often, though, it just comes down to buckets of blood and a lot of sex scenes (yeah, so mature) with no depth to it.This anime\'s take on modern fantasy and overall...Medieval is different and much more appealing, to me, at least. Oh, it doesn\'t hesitate to show how rough it can be but it chooses to introduce economics into its world. The premise is that demons are at war with humans, and finally a hero with three sidekicks gets close to stopping the war (of course he does, it\'s the plot of any party-based RPG ever) and heads off to kill the Satan. Who turns out to hate war herself and, in turn, tells him she actually wants to stop the war. He agrees to help her, and the rest of the show more or less focuses on her plans and their consequences.Most of these plans revolve around reforming agriculture, economics and so on. In the beginning it felt similar to Spice and Wolf: there are two main characters falling in love, the female is going to introduce some clever schemes, the atmosphere is equally warm, even the two leads are played by the same actors. However, Maou\'s ideas are all pretty simple, the intrigue comes not from the plans themselves but from the effect they have on people and, ultimately, on the country. The plot is coherent but seems to be episodic at times, partially because of the inevitable time jumps, as such reforms require time to actually take effect.This one is difficult to talk about, for it\'s really hard to point out one single element that makes the anime good; it\'s mostly the little touches. For example, I really enjoyed watching the Hero for many reasons, one of them being that he asks an interesting question: what is there for a hero to do after the war has concluded? He won, awesome, so what\'s next? This character seeks peace to begin with, and his interactions with Maou only serve to keep him on this path, while he actually can only function in times of war. The question of what war means to different people is an interesting one, and it\'s explored from different angles throughout the show. There is no clear answer, though, which might irritate people; me, personally, I hate when such questions get a clear answer, ambiguity is what makes the topic interesting to begin with. Many issues are addressed, some in a rather unusual light; for example, merchants tend to place profit before everything else - is this bad? Not necessarily, as this series suggests, one character was turned from an obvious and boring ""heartless douche"" type almost into someone to root for without any real change whatsoever. I have actually thought of a thing to praise here: the writing.The characters are good when they are given enough time to shine, I\'d like to see more of the Mage with her split personality (for once, it\'s not a villain who has it), for example. Maou is interesting in that she\'s clearly wise and cunning but still childish and innocent, which overall makes her all the more appealing. Yuusha is pretty lighthearted and not that smart, though intelligent enough to understand his problems and limited usefulness; to his credit, he doesn\'t fall into angst, he always tries to help people. So, yeah, he\'s the Hero, no real surprise there. There obviously is a romance between these two (as usual with the characters voiced by these actors - Lelouch and Kallen, Lawrence and Horo), there is even a love triangle with the Knight lady, though this is the weakest part of the show. Don\'t get me wrong, the main couple\'s interactions are mostly nice but it leads to many unnecessary moments, like, say, discussions of boobs, which is always classy. It doesn\'t feature fanservice, though.The supporting cast consists of a variety of characters, some of which evolve throughout the series, others are interesting as they are. There are, of course, those who mostly serve as a throwaway joke or are ultimately pointless (the Old Man, the little servant girl, the Dragon Princess) but they almost always are there to complement someone else\'s personality, so it\'s not distracting. In the end, they do reflect the world they live in and present interesting possibilities for the writers to take advantage of. More than enough for me.The art and the score both serve to reinforce the aforementioned warm atmosphere and yeah, they work. It\'s not the sharp drawing style I usually enjoy but it\'s justified here. Everyone looks unique, particularly Maou, who is not drawn like your usual anime nice girl but instead opts for a more mild kind of beauty, which is refreshing in a female lead. The voice acting is awesome: practically all significant characters are voiced by someone whom I have heard and liked before (be it in Code Geass or Rozen Maiden), and they do a good job here too.Overall, I really enjoyed the show. Yeah, it doesn\'t really pay off in terms of the romance, and the story can feel somewhat unfinished, particularly with the ending being only semi-happy but I really like to see real world economics and serious issues like cultural diversity being brought into fantasy world. It makes for an intelligent plotline with believable outcomes for all actions and allows the creators to show how Medieval actually progressed. This is what I\'m going to think of now when I think ""Modern Fantasy"". A great anime. Medieval is different and much more appealing, to me, at least.

This is what I\'m going to think of now when I think ""Modern Fantasy"". A great anime.', ""So begins the journey...In any fantasy world, some beings just don't get along. Take for example, demons and humans. In order for two races to co-exist, they have to accept each others' values. Yet that dream is an overwhelming task to achieve because let's all face it, some things just don't mix well. It's been fifteen years since the war waged by the humans and demons have begun. After an awkward meeting and the revelation that the Demon King is in fact a female, the duo forms an alliance after some reluctant arguing. Hence, let the tale of a human male and demon female begin!Mayou...(Maoyu Maou Yusha, aka Archenemy and Hero) is an anime adapted series from a light novel that was originally “serialized” on 2ch. The series is written by Mamare Touno who is not well known but has recently made his debut. The LN has sold over 450,000 copies and here we are, the anime adaptation. As one of the first full length series to debut in 2013, it definitely needed to set the bar high. So without further ado, let's see if Maoyu lived up to the hype.Maoyu follows the story of a hero and queen of demons as they seemingly join forces to bring about a new world. They desire a world of peace, a world without conflict, and a world where values and ideas are accepted without violence. The series begins with a lot of promise as in the format of a preview as to what's to come. In fact, our two main characters (from the poster) takes up most of the tv time as they engage in humorous dialogues and discusses their ways of changing the world. It is actually quite fresh and entertaining as viewers can see that the demons and humans are not so different. For instance, the demons themselves has their own code of ethnics and politics. They have their own ideologies and ways of thinking. To top it off, they also don't have actual or maybe I should say..physical features in the way some people may originally see them as.To me, the series takes off with strange tropes and turns it into a rather refreshing series at first. I mean, we have an ordinary human and meets a not-so-ordinary demon king. Hero also gets a surprise from the fact that the Demon Queen is actually a female rather than what he originally expected. (a rather big breasted one if I may add...) The Demon Queen herself is shown to be not violent but rather trying to persuasive for her goals. It also sets up a state of prejudice at first between the races but as time goes on, it's shown that the duo can get along quite well. Even from the pilot episode, Hero seems convinced enough to join the Demon Queen despite her rather sophisticated dialogues. The dialogues themselves contains lengthy references to politics, economics, and a historical lesson rather than any violent backgrounds. In a entertaining way, it transforms the tale of struggle between humans and demons into a story of that almost seems to be educational at times. It's almost like watching the fantasy version of the Discovery Channel as the Demon Queen educates about trading and her ways of inventions.The series maintains as a small cast of characters. Obviously, we have the two main stars of the series, Maou and Yuusha. They often go by their titles, Demon Queen and Hero respectively. In fact, many of the supporting cast seems to follow this trend. We have Onna Kishi known as the Female Knight, Onna Mahoutsukai known as the Female Magician, etc. Their names matches their respective titles and defines the role they play in. But perhaps the most interesting relationship in the series is between Hero and the Demon Queen. This is because they are nearly nothing alike, even in terms of being the same race. Hero seems to be a guy of using action rather than words of persuasion. On the other hand, Demon Queen seems to play the role of a politician and uses her intelligence. Yet upon closer examination, they get along quite well and intimate at times. This brings a problem of their relationship being too rushed. As a matter of fact, there is strong hints of romance between the duo already after the initial episode. To add to this relationship is a strong dose of fan service. The term “useless meat” becomes a recurring joke for the Demon Queen as she takes on the role of an eye candy. With or without horns, she retains her stature as a female that seems to allure viewers. This shouldn't come too much as as surprise though as the production studio Arms handles the series. Arms is known for its rough and sketchy ways of presenting fan service such as in Elfen Lied, Ikkitousen, and Queen's Blade. Their stance of producing lascivious visuals has been a long standing trend. In this case, Maoyu isn't off their charts.As being labeled as an adventure genre, the series takes the fantasy theme well. There are the old medieval like architectures and maintains that feeling of being in a fantasy world. The way the characters are dressed reflects this theme of being in simple wear in the case of servants, modern in the case of the maids, and fancy in the case of high level authority figures. Hero's design sees him as a warrior and 'hero' as the title suggests him. On the other hand, there is Demon Queen who is dressed in an ornamental way that is elaborate and eye-catching. Unfortunately, some of her appearance is played as a joke like the “horns” on her hand and once again, the useless meat.Speaking of useless, I find the fan service of this series to be just that. Even with the light humor, romance, and sweet moments, I find the fan service part of the series to be in the way and preventing Maoyu to shine itself. It is distracting and seems manipulative in some of the sweet dialogues that moves away the balance.Other problems I've ran in to the series is the rather weak story based off the original premise. Some of the preceding episodes from the narrative prequel pilot almost seems like filler. It doesn't also help the fact that some of the jokes made throughout the series becomes a bit stale. Furthermore, Hero seems to attract other female characters of interest and creating some unfriendly rivalry for our Demon Queen. It falls under a track of insubstantial romance with a seemingly love triangle between her, Hero, and the Female Knight.Maoyu also seems to adapt many of the same themes as another popular title that debuted a few years back. Fans of Spice and Wolf may notice many similarities such as the adventure style storytelling, theme of economics, fantasy setting, and even the main female protagonist shares the same seiyuu. It can make an impression for viewers who once again desire a taste of economics and adventure rather than the typical “save the world with swords and magic”. It does have some of that though but the majority of the series focuses more on the politics, economics, and the interactions between the Hero/Demon Queen.In terms of artwork, the series did its job right. Despite some of the characters being serialized with the fan-service and presented in a gratuitous way, it maintains its background of the fantasy setting well. There is the elaborate landscapes, the majestic rivers, and plain rural backgrounds. The way the characters are dressed reflects off that old and classic feeling from the Dark Ages. It's the way that an adventure should be and maintains that theme well. At times though, it does look like the visual qualities of the show slows down. Yet, it maintain its fantasy posture well.For soundtrack, I found the series to be only mediocre. Toshiki Kameyama plays the role of the sound director and he seems to give that feeling of smoothness and melody of the medieval ages. However, it is hardly noticeable or distinguishing itself from other fantasy theme series. The OP and ED songs also presents a style of primitive artwork in the style of the old medieval ages. It is just too simple and not unique enough in my estimation.Ultimately, Maoyu is an adventure series that I have mixed feelings on. From one standpoint, it is a fun and entertaining series with our lovable duo. Their interactions and dialogues makes a first impression but that later becomes repetitive and stale. The way fan service is presented becomes a source of diversion rather than some comedic fun. It is comedic in some ways though but ultimately, it doesn't achieve its goal. However, there are instances where the series launches itself with its fresh way of adventure story. It is a story about a Hero, a Demon Queen, and the plan they hope to achieve in order to make the world a better place. I just hope they succeed and achieve glory for what they strive for.

Maoyuu draws you into its grand plot and characters however they really fail to develop primarily due to it only being a 12 episode anime.Set in a medieval fantasy world in which the human race and demon race are at war for territory and power, the story follows the human Hero and the female Demon King (They are simply referred to  by these titles) who team together to solve the underlying reasons the war;...economics.The Demon King can be seen as the brains of the operation and the Hero as a diplomat to some extent. Their idealistic belief to ending war by ending poverty, and advancing technology is quite a grand idea in that it takes time to really make such significant changes. The Demon Kings new ideas and technology such as new farming techniques and promoting education require lengthy periods of time before results are seen. The anime acknowledges this by numerous time skips, almost a year had past by the 4th episode and despite moving the plot forward it resulted in hardly any character development.The anime constantly alludes to this magical world where the Hero is off saving Fairy's and helping Dragon type Demons but never dwells into it. It also begins with an almost instant romance between the Hero and the Busty Demon King but again fails to develop it. The show seems to struggle in deciding what is wants to be. It addressees intellectual themes such as economics, religion and social intolerance. Then flirts around with a love triangle between the Hero, Demon King and the Blonde knight. And while they are enjoyable to watch in the end both themes feel rushed and it it fails to conclusively resolve either. I should also add that the fan service seemed out of place.One of the reasons this show is enjoyable is that it has likable characters. I liked the idealistic main characters The Hero and Demon King, they were powerful around others but so confused around each other, i would have liked to see development into their romance rather than just being forced into accepting it, that being said nothing really happened. The rest of the characters all had a purpose with different backgrounds and seemed to fit well into the Demon Kings plan. The majority of characters were human and it would've been great to see things from the Demon perspective.The artwork in this anime is mixed. There were times when the background was just great with detail and color, other times it was like looking at blobs of green and brown supposedly resembling a forest or farm. I found the character design to be pretty good, nothing that set it apart but good nonetheless. Overall its highly watchable since this is a dialogue heavy anime but really average in quality. The same can be said for the sound.Overall this anime was actually quite enjoyable but i can not recommend an anime that leaves its plot so incomplete.

After watching the first half of this anime i already know where it intends to go and i can see the increase and quality every episode.The Characters of this anime are all uniquely set in there role and Given names to reflect that. (Eg. Knight,Hero,Mage) I enjoy this method of naming cause it makes everyone really easy to remember and there role apparent from the start. It does away with a lot of formality by establishing the characters early. Then the show...continues to pepper in details and history's of the characters without having to take up large  gaps of time in flash backs. All the characters seem to fit and act correctly in the settings and keep me personally very entertained.The two Main characters are both transparent in there intentions and honest in expression. They convey feelings and thoughts to the viewer well with imagery and just body language alone. The Demon King/Crimson Scholar is by far the most showcased and deep character of the series with many ideologies and a innocent quality that does not leave you frustrated with the character. She maintains a well balanced innocence and maturity that keeps her from getting too preachy or too cold which makes you feel invested in her character more and more. The hero himself is not as much yet and you only are set up for more thing as the series progresses.Visually the anime is fantastic with nice rural and cityscapes. I also like how the demon realm is kept realistic and not fantastical which makes the settings more engrossing. Every character is well made and clearly a individual with nobody looking recycled or reused for lack of inspiration. Everything looks vibrant and really alive in the color tones and the general lighting of scenes. I wish more anime did what this one did when trying to portray a world instead of recycled walk cycle backgrounds.Sound quality is fine for this anime, the one thing id like to praise is the voice acting. There is not a single intolerable voice in this anime. Everyone sounds good and not abrasive or out of place. Even the little girl character who's supposed to be cute and adorable doesn't sound too over the top.The story of this anime is where it shines brightest, after this first episode you realize this anime does not waste your time with unnecessary back story or plot it cuts out all the generic fat and gets down to business. It gives a clear and precise objective and establishes the main characters well and then it peppers in the details about them organically episode to episode so you actually get to know the character instead of entire episodes dedicated to back story. This also creates interest in many minor and major characters cause your shown bits and pieces of them and you start eagerly wanting more.The story is actually pretty intelligent it uses fantasy elements in a almost realistic world only to enhance the story. It  uses these enhancements well too considering how much of the show is based on the politics,economics and public perception on war. Though it uses really mature plot points like that it isn't above normal understanding, the show keeps it easily understandable for anyone.  The show often surprises me with just how unexpected and original it can be with the progression and i am eager to see more of this series every week.I enjoy this anime thoroughly and while it may not be a masterpiece it surely is worth a watch if you want to see something new and intelligent instead of rehashed and recycled plots. It is a pity that it will only be 12 episodes long and i hope they develop a second season with just a strong a value as the first. continues to pepper in details and history's of the characters without having to take up large  gaps of time in flash backs. All the characters seem to fit and act correctly in the settings and keep me personally very entertained.The two Main characters are both transparent in there intentions and honest in expression. They convey feelings and thoughts to the viewer well with imagery and just body language alone. The Demon King/Crimson Scholar is by far the most showcased and deep character of the series with many ideologies and a innocent quality that does not leave you frustrated with the character. She maintains a well balanced innocence and maturity that keeps her from getting too preachy or too cold which makes you feel invested in her character more and more. The hero himself is not as much yet and you only are set up for more thing as the series progresses.Visually the anime is fantastic with nice rural and cityscapes. I also like how the demon realm is kept realistic and not fantastical which makes the settings more engrossing. Every character is well made and clearly a individual with nobody looking recycled or reused for lack of inspiration. Everything looks vibrant and really alive in the color tones and the general lighting of scenes. I wish more anime did what this one did when trying to portray a world instead of recycled walk cycle backgrounds.Sound quality is fine for this anime, the one thing id like to praise is the voice acting. There is not a single intolerable voice in this anime. Everyone sounds good and not abrasive or out of place. Even the little girl character who's supposed to be cute and adorable doesn't sound too over the top.The story of this anime is where it shines brightest, after this first episode you realize this anime does not waste your time with unnecessary back story or plot it cuts out all the generic fat and gets down to business. It gives a clear and precise objective and establishes the main characters well and then it peppers in the details about them organically episode to episode so you actually get to know the character instead of entire episodes dedicated to back story. This also creates interest in many minor and major characters cause your shown bits and pieces of them and you start eagerly wanting more.The story is actually pretty intelligent it uses fantasy elements in a almost realistic world only to enhance the story. It  uses these enhancements well too considering how much of the show is based on the politics,economics and public perception on war. Though it uses really mature plot points like that it isn't above normal understanding, the show keeps it easily understandable for anyone.

When announcement came through that a similar series, with similar staff members, was going to be released, fans were ecstatic. Unfortunately, it's not quite that simple to live up to the name of the predecessor, and it's even more difficult to satiate an entirely new crowd. Maoyū Maō Yūsha suffers from a variety of debilitating features that not only make it a shitty, half-assed 'successor', but...an awfully trite,mundane standalone.Maoyū Maō Yūsha doesn't have the world's most amazing storyline. In fact, it's relatively archetypal -- the king of demons and the hero of humanity wish to team up to ultimately better the world. Sounds relatively creative right? It's not. But it could have been. We're given two main characters, Maou, and Yuusha [translated to Devil and Hero]. Their names are titular of their roles. During each episode, humanity attains a new invention that may better life [e.g. new farming techniques, agriculture]; and during each episode, a mild time skip is applied [typically a few months]. What does this do? It advances the plot. But does it do anything more than that? Probably not. Is it bad because it's simple? Not necessarily. Is it bad if they advance the plot over developing the characters/mood/every other aspect of the show? Probably.A certain series revolving around a travelling merchant and a wolf goddess revolved around the characters -- every episode moved at a snail's pace, and the characters were developed accordingly; in Maoyū Maō Yūsha, it isn't uncommon for several months to move in one episode. The characters aren't developed. There's a romance between Maou and Yuusha. But the romance between the two are magnetic. They're only together for the storyline. A magnet doesn't need a reason to attract the opposite charge, neither does Maou to Yuusha, and Yuusha to Maou. They're together, but there's no semblance or inclination that would insinuate anything outside of being together for the storyline. Love? What's that. 12 episodes, or several years, resulted in a half-assed display of affection at the end. No discourse implying anything significant, and no actions outside the cursory depicted a sort of love outside of obligation.The art and animation in Maoyū Maō Yūsha was fantastic? You mean the art and animation during Maoyū Maō Yūsha's first episode was fantastic. Arms was tasked with animating the series -- Arms did a really nice job during the former half of the series. The latter half, they kinda just gave up on maintaining consistent quality. Surprisingly, Arms, a studio, known for their integration of ecchi into everything, didn't put that much ecchi into Maoyū Maō Yūsha. That's a bright side. How about the soundtrack? The soundtrack's probably one of the best, redeeming features of the series. The track titled 'Beyond the Hill' by Takeshi Hama [composer of the original Devil May Cry soundtrack]would on its own, bump the score up by at least a point. The series contained a fantastic soundtrack, albeit, it wasn't exactly applied that well. The general soundtrack is perhaps one of the few things that Maoyū Maō Yūsha does better than its related series. It may not have been used as well [the soundtrack in the former was heavily ambient, but that ambience was integral in developing the mood], but it's certainly noteworthy [the main theme really is good].So, we're given a series with generic characters that are seldom developed, the noble goal to save the world, time skips for plot, alongside a fantastic soundtrack, inconsistent animation, and a predictable, archetypal plot progression. Oh, and don't forget the romance. Everybody loves romance. So to sum it up, we're given a series that attempts to do too much within 12 episodes, that's understandable right? Well, it probably would be if it attempted to do something difficult. Every other development and concept explored in Maoyū Maō Yūsha isn't exactly novel, or avant-garde; it's not even a rendition of generic concepts. They're really just generic concepts without any sort of application. Economics? Spice and Wolf had more economics within a single episode than this did in 12. The notion that opposite sides often have a lot in common and that they probably shouldn't kill each other? That's clearly edgy and new.It's not as enjoyable as it could be to watch because the series tried to do too much. When you introduce a romance, actually develop it. When you attempt to mirror a similar series, at least compliment it. The series doesn't revolve around combat and the mechanics of the world? Then don't dedicate an entire episode to combat. There wasn't enough time to do what we wanted? Then don't do so much. an awfully trite,mundane standalone.Maoyū Maō Yūsha doesn't have the world's most amazing storyline.

The actions of the characters to the plot is well planned. Hiding from the high officials,...and starting new identities, slowly making bonds from different kinds of people(Merchants, Priests/Priestesses, Locals, Generals.). Yet, the story still finds a way to reveal the big problems although everything seemed like all went smoothly. This anime can be related to real life wars nowadays, real life economics.

A well-founded mythological world that reveals a very interesting concept and focus within it, but lacks that something to become something transcending”REVIEW FREE OF SPOILERS!-STORY: 7-To set this show as just a typical adventure/fantasy anime would be a shortsighted description of it; after all, this show has more potential than just that. “MAOYUU…” grasps into things –more complex- such as politics and economics –although they are observed from a very basic and simplistic point of view and nothing more complicated, probably for the sake of the aimed viewers -. But let’s not get carried away, this show isn’t a masterpiece...either, although it has potential to be bigger, by this I mean that the show doesn’t reach its fullest potential but let’s not forget it’s made into a 12 episode format show.Even though being an original show –mostly by the focus shown- the show falls sometimes into the typical dull and repetitive routine shown in many other shows. Although, the characters make you forget this stalemate and those repetitive moments don’t last long.-ART: 8-So to tell the truth, besides the fact that this is a fantasy anime something else caught my attention/interest too, and that “something” was the art. The art is neither the “state-of-the-art” nor something antiquated; it was pleasing to put it bluntly.Now, the fact that the art in the show is pleasing it doesn’t mean that it’s one of those arts that immerse into the show after all; the art in the show is a mixture of the old –shown mostly on the scenery- and the new –shown mostly on the character.The palette is amazing ranging from dark oriented colors to bright and beautiful.The ART team did a remarkable job.-SOUND: 7-One of the main goals of voice acting is to stimulate and transmit feelings through voice and sounds, sadly the voice acting in this show didn’t achieve such a thin., The voice acting isn’t bad, but it isn’t great, it isn’t transcending and thus it isn’t memorable.There is a quote by William Shakespeare that says: “If music be the food of love, play on”. The context in which the character –Duke Orsino- says this words is because he’s infatuated with Olivia, and she’s not interested in him, so he asks his musicians to play some music, so he can surpass -or “overdose”- his appetite and let such feeling –love- die.My point here is that there’s a reason within a soundtrack or the ambient shown in a show, and it isn’t having music for the sake of JUST having music within a show, it is because you want your audience/viewers to experience the feelings of the characters in an “enhanced” way, through music. Regretfully that’s a potential that they couldn’t fulfill, a potential that they couldn’t squeeze right.-CHARACTER: 6-There’s a thing that I dislike and find boring about short anime shows and it’s the fact that most of them lack something essential in a story –every story- and it’s the character development. Blame it on the lack of time; blame it on the writers or whatever… If you want a character to be memorable you need to make him or her transcend, and not just by giving him a cool sword or bad-ass armor, I mean by making him/her relate to us the viewers whether by making him mature through the show or change or have some new goals and most importantly by making them have a believe as their foundation, those are the character that are remembered in the hearts of people.Sadly this is the aspect in which the show fails –tremendously if I may add-.The characters are well done –yes- and some are cute but nothing else was achieved.-ENJOYMENT: 8 & OVERALL: 7-So to put things shortly.

You get...a massive disappointment.Warning Spoilers!!!Story: 5/10The human and demon worlds have been at war for 15 years, but the humans have gained the upper hand and an elite squad is sent deep into the demon world to assassinate the Demon King and end the war. However, for poorly explained reasons our main character, who is just named Hero, goes on ahead of his squad to undertake the assassination himself. When he arrives at the...Demon King\'s castle, he learns that the Demon ""King"" is actually a Queen...with G cup breasts. The busty queen doesn\'t fight back, but instead calmly explains that the war is actually a good thing and far more people would die during peace time from famine and plague as a result of the booming war economy coming to an end. This would be an interesting utilitarian argument similar to the Real Politik espoused by Otto Von Bismarck and Henry Kissinger...if it wasn\'t a piss poor oversimplification of the original argument that completely ignores reality.Warning! the following paragraph contains history!!! If you don\'t like history, skip ahead!In reality FAR, FAR more people die of hunger and plague during war time than peace time. The more backwards the setting (like the medieval setting of this series) the more true this is. During the Great African War fought between 7 African nations in the late 1990s, 6 million people died of hunger and disease in just a few years. Although this region has always had famine and plague, this death rate was far higher than ever before or since for that region. One of the worst peace time famines was the Soviet Famine of 1932 caused by forced collectivization and the wildly idiotic farming methods enforced by Joseph Stalin. 7 million people including 4 million Ukrainians, 2 million Kazakhs, and 1 million Russians died of hunger. However, even the brutality of Stalin wasn\'t as bad as the wartime Soviet famine of 1921. During that famine a shocking 10 million people died as a direct result of WW1 and the Russian Civil War. During a brutal war, all sides tend to use scorched Earth tactics and deliberately destroy farmland to starve the enemy. In addition, all armies involved stole HUGE amounts of crops from the farmers and peasants and gave them nothing in return. In an ass backward medieval setting like Maoyuu, the army would NOT be paying the farmers more money during war time. They would steal all the crops for themselves and give the farmers nothing. That is what always tends to happen when war comes to a non-industrialized country. Another HUGE cause of starvation and plague during war that makes it MUCH worse than peace time is blockade. Nearly the entire city of Athens died of plague and starvation after the Spartans blockaded the city during the Peloponnesian War. During World War 2, 500,000 Greeks, and no less than 5 million Soviets starved to death as a result of the blockade tactics employed by the Germans.The entire argument on which this story stands is complete bullshit! When Maoyuu isn\'t making an idiotic attempt to explain the life saving nature of war, it is talking non-stop about crop production and agricultural theory. This comes across as a completely random tangent that doesn\'t really add anything to the story. If I wanted farming theory tangents out of nowhere, I would go re-read Anna Karenina thank you very much! (I hope you all heard that last sentence in the ""Cinema Snob\'s"" sexy voice!) At least the Demon King has foresight and wishes to ultimately end the war when the military industrial complex has been dealt with and peace will be meaningful. She actually has a strategy that is far less divorced from history and logic than some other idiotic anime series I have seen. Can you imagine how stupid it would be if the Demon King thought she could end the war by taking over the Demon and Human worlds and getting everyone to hate her, then having Hero kill her and just assume that a massive power vacuum following the death of a hated tyrant would somehow cause world peace?! Now THAT would be stupid! Fortunately even Maoyuu is a better anime than that!Characters: 5/10Although the Demon King herself is a fairly interesting character, the main male lead ""Hero"" is as boring and generic as hell! What made Spice and Wolf work is that both Holo and Lawrence were complex, interesting characters. You can\'t have a great, memorable romance if one of the characters is about as interesting as watching paint dry! The other characters besides the main 2 are basically worthless and add nothing to the series. So essentially the entire series is carried on the back of one character: The Demon King. Unfortunately, she is not THAT strong a character and her silly outbursts and fanservice moments often undermine her alleged strategic and inventive genius. She is the world\'s greatest scientist and military strategist, but she randomly acts like an airhead at random intervals. This doesn\'t come across as a character quirk like a mad genius, but instead lazy writing that changes the character whenever the situation calls for a comedy moment. I realize what they were going for I guess. Holo was old and wise, but could act childish at times and it was funny. However, Spice and Wolf was a longer series with MUCH better developed characters, so with Holo it felt far more natural and less forced than when the Demon King would have a random comedy moment.Art: 5/10One thing you NEVER want to see on your anime is ""produced by Studio ARMS"". It is the unholy stamp of death similar to the LJN rainbow on old NES games. The only decent anime ever produced by ARMS was Elfen Lied back in 2004, and the only reason the Elfen Lied staff chose ARMS for the project was out of desperation after a dozen superior animation studios refused to work on it. Unlike Elfen Lied, Maoyuu is not a super risque anime that nearly every studio would refuse. Maoyuu COULD have chosen a vastly superior studio, but actually went with Studio ARMS. I am not a puritanical twat that goes ballistic whenever an anime features nudity or fanservice. However, I do have a basic sense of artistic aesthetics, and I appreciate female characters NOT having tits larger than their heads. I don\'t want to watch an anime version of a fucking Rob Liefeld comic!!! The director of Maoyuu should have hit the animators with a rolled up newspaper like a dog when he saw the character designs. ""NO!"" NOO!"" If Elfen Lied was made by ARMS and had realistic breast to body ratios, then we know it is possible if you hit the animators enough times.Overall: 5/10As much as I relentlessly ripped this series a new asshole, I actually don\'t think it is the worst series in the world. It is NOT a good series and it is a HORRIBLE spiritual successor to Spice and Wolf, but Maoyuu at least has some instances of decent dialogue and tries to tell an unconventional tale with unconventional morals and lessons. It was horribly executed, but I feel like this actually could have been good with less executive meddling and less fanservice bullshit! I see untapped potential here. The soundtrack is also decent and as much as I bagged on the art, it often isn\'t THAT bad. Overall, this series is very average and deserves an average to mediocre 5/10. Demon King\'s castle, he learns that the Demon ""King"" is actually a Queen...with G cup breasts. The busty queen doesn\'t fight back, but instead calmly explains that the war is actually a good thing and far more people would die during peace time from famine and plague as a result of the booming war economy coming to an end.

During World War 2, 500,000 Greeks, and no less than 5 million Soviets starved to death as a result of the blockade tactics employed by the Germans.The entire argument on which this story stands is complete bullshit! When Maoyuu isn\'t making an idiotic attempt to explain the life saving nature of war, it is talking non-stop about crop production and agricultural theory. This comes across as a completely random tangent that doesn\'t really add anything to the story. If I wanted farming theory tangents out of nowhere, I would go re-read Anna Karenina thank you very much! (I hope you all heard that last sentence in the ""Cinema Snob\'s"" sexy voice!) At least the Demon King has foresight and wishes to ultimately end the war when the military industrial complex has been dealt with and peace will be meaningful. She actually has a strategy that is far less divorced from history and logic than some other idiotic anime series I have seen. Can you imagine how stupid it would be if the Demon King thought she could end the war by taking over the Demon and Human worlds and getting everyone to hate her, then having Hero kill her and just assume that a massive power vacuum following the death of a hated tyrant would somehow cause world peace?! Now THAT would be stupid! Fortunately even Maoyuu is a better anime than that!Characters: 5/10Although the Demon King herself is a fairly interesting character, the main male lead ""Hero"" is as boring and generic as hell! What made Spice and Wolf work is that both Holo and Lawrence were complex, interesting characters. You can\'t have a great, memorable romance if one of the characters is about as interesting as watching paint dry! The other characters besides the main 2 are basically worthless and add nothing to the series. So essentially the entire series is carried on the back of one character: The Demon King. Unfortunately, she is not THAT strong a character and her silly outbursts and fanservice moments often undermine her alleged strategic and inventive genius. She is the world\'s greatest scientist and military strategist, but she randomly acts like an airhead at random intervals. This doesn\'t come across as a character quirk like a mad genius, but instead lazy writing that changes the character whenever the situation calls for a comedy moment. I realize what they were going for I guess. Holo was old and wise, but could act childish at times and it was funny. However, Spice and Wolf was a longer series with MUCH better developed characters, so with Holo it felt far more natural and less forced than when the Demon King would have a random comedy moment.Art: 5/10One thing you NEVER want to see on your anime is ""produced by Studio ARMS"". It is the unholy stamp of death similar to the LJN rainbow on old NES games. The only decent anime ever produced by ARMS was Elfen Lied back in 2004, and the only reason the Elfen Lied staff chose ARMS for the project was out of desperation after a dozen superior animation studios refused to work on it. Unlike Elfen Lied, Maoyuu is not a super risque anime that nearly every studio would refuse. Maoyuu COULD have chosen a vastly superior studio, but actually went with Studio ARMS. I am not a puritanical twat that goes ballistic whenever an anime features nudity or fanservice. However, I do have a basic sense of artistic aesthetics, and I appreciate female characters NOT having tits larger than their heads. I don\'t want to watch an anime version of a fucking Rob Liefeld comic!!! The director of Maoyuu should have hit the animators with a rolled up newspaper like a dog when he saw the character designs. ""NO!"" NOO!"" If Elfen Lied was made by ARMS and had realistic breast to body ratios, then we know it is possible if you hit the animators enough times.Overall: 5/10As much as I relentlessly ripped this series a new asshole, I actually don\'t think it is the worst series in the world. It is NOT a good series and it is a HORRIBLE spiritual successor to Spice and Wolf, but Maoyuu at least has some instances of decent dialogue and tries to tell an unconventional tale with unconventional morals and lessons. It was horribly executed, but I feel like this actually could have been good with less executive meddling and less fanservice bullshit! I see untapped potential here. The soundtrack is also decent and as much as I bagged on the art, it often isn\'t THAT bad. Overall, this series is very average and deserves an average to mediocre 5/10.', ""Maoyuu Maou YuushaMaoyuu was a great anime, at least the first episode and not because i didn't get the story, i got the story and i found it refreshing and really relatable to real life (Economy) but it's because this promise you that there will be romance but the romance only existed the first 3 or 4 episodes and it was a light romance, this anime was perfect to be romantic too but they wasted the oportunity and the story was rushed and it can be confusing for a lot of people when they talk about economy and how they use it and i was...entertained by that.StoryThe story was good, it's in fact a little complicated if you don't pay attention or else you will lose the idea of what the story is about; It's really about economy politics most of the time, mixed with war between heroes and demons or between countries and i found that combination very good the ending was an open ending where you can clearly see they wanted to make a 2nd season and leaves you with intrigue, and the romance, don't expect romance, not even in the end, that end was WTF happened that they don't act like if they love each other and that was annoying, so overall was good.Art & AnimationThe art style on this was beautiful and very good, it really felt like a fantasy world, with a palette of colors that matched the story and the theme, but there were some flaws that you clearly will see.SoundThe sound was just amazing the background music was great the OP and ED were amazing, they really fit the theme, the voice acting was very good but i expected more for some reason, overall very good art style.CharacterThe characters were ok, i liked the fact that they didn't have a name, their names were their range like Heroe or Demon King, Prince, etc. i really liked a lot Maou she was almost well developed, she was really smart, she is unique for me, Yuusha was ok, just didn't felt that he had a lot on screen time even being one of the two MC he wasn't there a lot and that bothered me, for just 1 season, they couldn't developed more than Maou but Maou was out for like 4 episodes just like Yuusha, this needed more episodes to be better, overall was good.EnjoymentI really enjoyed it, because of the animation and the music, they were great, i was expecting romance, but i was disappointed, the characters and the story were getting just ok because of the absence of both main characters that combined disappeared for 8 episodes of 12, and the ending got me mad. entertained by that.StoryThe story was good, it's in fact a little complicated if you don't pay attention or else you will lose the idea of what the story is about; It's really about economy politics most of the time, mixed with war between heroes and demons or between countries and i found that combination very good the ending was an open ending where you can clearly see they wanted to make a 2nd season and leaves you with intrigue, and the romance, don't expect romance, not even in the end, that end was WTF happened that they don't act like if they love each other and that was annoying, so overall was good.Art & AnimationThe art style on this was beautiful and very good, it really felt like a fantasy world, with a palette of colors that matched the story and the theme, but there were some flaws that you clearly will see.SoundThe sound was just amazing the background music was great the OP and ED were amazing, they really fit the theme, the voice acting was very good but i expected more for some reason, overall very good art style.CharacterThe characters were ok, i liked the fact that they didn't have a name, their names were their range like Heroe or Demon King, Prince, etc. i really liked a lot Maou she was almost well developed, she was really smart, she is unique for me, Yuusha was ok, just didn't felt that he had a lot on screen time even being one of the two MC he wasn't there a lot and that bothered me, for just 1 season, they couldn't developed more than Maou but Maou was out for like 4 episodes just like Yuusha, this needed more episodes to be better, overall was good.EnjoymentI really enjoyed it, because of the animation and the music, they were great, i was expecting romance, but i was disappointed, the characters and the story were getting just ok because of the absence of both main characters that combined disappeared for 8 episodes of 12, and the ending got me mad."", ""Here we are at the end of another historically based series that focuses mainly on the same problem as the real world at that time. So when you watch this series you are more likely to encounter economic dilemmas that intend to solve or ruin people's lives. Whats the point you ask? well for us maybe there is none or maybe they just wanted to show us how hard it was living back then.After this you have a nice romance story evolving on the background of a war that is not based on conquest but on survival. All these while adding various comedy scenes...to release some of the tension you've built up until then.It has always been a pleasure for me watching strategy based decision turn the tide of a war which seems to happen often, decisions possible only through the courage of many.Also seeing many people profit from the little or large schemes they've come up with also provides good amounts of amusement for me only to see them fail miserably or end up unable to enjoy the spoils.So if you have a thing for medieval warfare this series is a very good example.At certain points I disliked the artwork but perhaps I was asking too much, still I believe we can overlook some flaws for the sake of a good story. to release some of the tension you've built up until then.It has always been a pleasure for me watching strategy based decision turn the tide of a war which seems to happen often, decisions possible only through the courage of many.Also seeing many people profit from the little or large schemes they've come up with also provides good amounts of amusement for me only to see them fail miserably or end up unable to enjoy the spoils.So if you have a thing for medieval warfare this series is a very good example.At certain points I disliked the artwork but perhaps I was asking too much, still I believe we can overlook some flaws for the sake of a good story."", ""First of all, this is not your typical fantasy series.

The hero is the stereotypical fighter with a strong belief in justice and a kind heart. But you love him almost instantly because he's not brash, only a little reckless, and willing to learn whatever he doesn't know. The Demon Queen (the other protagonist) is intelligent, calculating, and strangely naive when it comes to men and relationships.

It takes a look at economic and social issues during a medieval themed period, and it focuses on the ""behind the scenes"" sort of events. Again, it\'s an interesting concept, and at times I really liked it a lot. The ending was very disappointing, and it dropped my opinion of it dramatically. I simply want to warn that this story really doesn\'t have an ending and will most likely leave you expecting more (notice I didn\'t say wanting, but expecting). I did like this story (I figured I should say that much). I did look forward to it...each week, and I was intrigued by the concept. I wonder if I was more intrigued by my speculation of where it was going as opposed to where the story actually went.Now for the basics. It looked good so I can\'t complain there. The music was ok, not very memorable, but it worked. The voice acting was good (probably one of it\'s strongest points). I did like all of the basic details, and I don\'t feel it really let me down in any of these areas. The problem is that it attempted to create a fantasy tale that wasn\'t a fantasy tale. There were demons, knights, mages, castles, kingdoms, and churches. There was a long standing war that was at the center of this story as well. Holy crusades are talked about during this story. Detach yourself from these facts immediately. They are simply background to what is actually taking place. What you get with Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is a love story between a superhuman and a demon that are attempting to end their war (long term mind you) by correcting the social, economic, and political issues of their time. The methods they choose are the story. It\'s not much of one, but that\'s it.Despite the lack of something substantial, this story is interesting. I enjoyed watching the demons introduce new ideas and technologies to a world full of dumbfounded sheep-like people. It had a lot of good moments, but the story was ultimately flawed. I made a lot of speculation during my viewing of the show that probably carried over into my opinion. This is not an extremely exciting nor a game changing anime series. It does have some good things to offer, but do beware that it is filled with a lot of plot holes and bad logic. The potential is there, but it is never fully realized, so I feel it should have been a lot better.Now for the best part of this show... the characters. So what if it\'s filled with stereotypical fantasy characters. I liked the characters in this series. I enjoyed the weird love story that was in there too. I wanted to see different events transpire, and I wanted to see a little more of the action, but we don\'t get too see too much of that. There\'s a lot of setup and not a lot of execution, but the characters are still fun to watch regardless.There\'s mild relationship humor and some interesting friendships are born throughout the journey. It\'s filled with character interaction and reaction. It\'s the reactionary behavior that I enjoyed the most. The self conscious main characters with low self esteem created a sort of fun awkwardness that I thought brightened the show. Without that, I don\'t think I would have enjoyed it as much.I know I have both rued and complimented this series, but my overall feelings are that this was interesting, yet it was very flawed. It is a 7 for me, even though I was left a little confused as to my reasoning. Sometimes liking something doesn\'t have to make perfect sense, and this series is an example of that for me. With only 12 episodes it\'s an easy watch, and I do recommend it.Though I think it\'s worth watching, it is hard to say who exactly will like it or hate it. Some people will like it because it\'s different, while others will hang on its many flaws. All in all, I suggest you try a couple of episodes to get a feel for the story, and if you don\'t like it after the first couple of episodes then you probably won\'t like it at all. Do expect a lot of dialogue, and do expect to watch more of the mundane than you may be used to. each week, and I was intrigued by the concept.

The story from this anime itself is kinda complex for some people. why? this anime was not about slash-and-kill or lovey-dovey things (its not like SAO), but its...more deep than that. You will see a lot of dialogue dan less action, so whats so good about this anime if an adventure is less action and more dialogue? for me, is the details for the concept to anime itself.[contains minor spoiler]The meaning of details that i said before is about explaining the whole things that happen in the anime itself, in this anime were focussing on HOW to bring the peace. i give a suppresion on HOW because many of the scene were focussing on this, like about how standard farming practice for boosting the food production can be useful to bring a peace (I am not gonna spoil it why it can like that), its not like any typical adventure action anime which battle is always the best way to bring the peace. If i can compare, then this anime was more like using ""soft"" way than coersive way to bring peace. Its make this anime more ""rich"" than any adventure anime. [end spoiler]The course of this story is more proggresing which means its more about the present and not to take many backflash or past of each character and more, the story goes fast (time-skips), and for me its really a good thinking, since it will take many times and hamper the storyline, after all, this anime was an adventure which focussing on ""how to achieve the goal"". But, of course there was a consequence for not bring the past, it will makes us (the viewer) hard to get attached with the main character (as we know, the first impression of the hero (Yuusha) is like a doll for achieving the demon king (Maou) goal, its make the Hero is not so appealing for us) and more,  we didnt really know who our main character is, which make us more harder to get attached.But despite of all that potentials, that there is something that makes this anime is become more ""cheapo"", beside of all that serious matters become useless with useless  jokes and unnecessary fanservice (bouncing, any kinds like that) but its forgiveable since as we know ARMS, known as the H-anime and Ecchi anime (Samurai girls and Himawari) and we cant ignore they make some good anime (like Elfen Lied). Its not like i hate fanservice but sometimes this anime was more prominent in Maou\'s boobs, honestly i more prefer something like Spice and Wolf which is same as like this anime (Maoyuu Maou Yuusha), they more focussing on storyline than fanservices.For the art and sound, there isnt something really amazing. Focus on the art first, pale coloring that they used in Maoyuu Maou Yuusha were really present the medieval era, it really blends well with the scenery and the background. But, at the sometimes, people who arent used in medieval setting will find it dull and boring. But for those who had watching something like this before (like Spice and wold) will find this were interesting. and for the sound section, the only one i aware was the opening song ""Yohko - Mukai Kaze"", its a good song and yet its quite attaching.Since this anime isnt finished airing until i write this review, i cant conclude yet if this anime were good or not, but as far i have seen until now (episode 5) , i find this anime is quite catchy yet i realize this anime was not-for-all-anime since some of people will find it boring since so many dialogues, but i recommend this one for  those who appreciate a good and deep story more deep than that.

I've gone into this show at first with great hopes. It was quite hyped and seemed the most original pick of the season. The very idea of a Demon King and a Hero signing an alliance to put an end to the reliance of the world's economy on eternal war was original and interesting. So what did go wrong?Basically, everything.The final result is a unique example of total blandness. This anime is, there's no other way to put it, boring. Horribly so. The characters are generic as they can be, starting with the Demon King, who's got bouncy boobs and is inexplicably...in love with the Hero since when he was a newborn, and continuing with the Hero himself (a walking Deus Ex Machina), the Head Maid, every single villain, and on, and on. The story is aimless: there's a bit of plot but it's all serviceable to the thesis of the show, consisting in demonstrating how feudalism is bound to lose its match against mercantilism/capitalism. This is basically the history of Europe in the 16th century, only much more boring, because every invention which changed our style of life springs in some way from the Demon King, who discovers potatoes, corn, the printing press and gunpowder without breaking a sweat. Things happen because they need to, not because it makes sense; whenever some miracle is needed, either the Hero or the Mage pull off some new convenient power, and overall there's never any sense of struggle. This could be excused if the anime was aiming at teaching some relevant economic concept or putting forward some original, compelling thesis. But it does neither, as the economy is trivial and the thesis is even less interesting. I had to watch this series in order to blog it and by the end I hated every moment of it.

So, wish me luck.I wasn't sure what to think of this anime upon starting it.  Even though the summary made it out to be pretty serious, there are splashes of comedy in many of the early episodes that some may think are out of place in regards to the overall tone, but I found these to be quite charming.I found that this anime painted a good image of the world they lived in.  It basically is the dark ages of Europe and it incorporates a lot of things from that time in...history.  Throughout the series, the world felt very alive.  I really liked how the world would change based on the decisions made by certain characters.  They would often explain what would be the expected result, but sometimes they didn't.  It is at these times when the series becomes very interesting.  Another influence on the world is the great war between humans and demons.  The great war, even though bad, has shown great improvements on the economy of both sides.The war is a sad truth that is difficult to change and the Hero and Demon Lord have a difficult task ahead of them.  They wish to change the world so that it doesn't need the sacrifice of lives to function.  The plans to change the world are very promising, but even a well laid plan won't go as expected.  This is where the show truly shines.If you are a fan of political intrigue/economics, you should feel right at home watching this.  A lot of time is spent on the happenings of the world and how it changes.  If you are looking for a good romance in a fantasy setting, you should look elsewhere.  It felt a little forced and merely more of a distraction than anything else.  You could almost consider it not a romance, but there is just enough of it to be defined as such.Overall, I really enjoyed watching this.  The world felt very real and the characters were enjoyable.

The story was interesting and made you think a little bit.  The romance was pretty weak, but it doesn't prevent you from enjoying it."", 'I really liked this anime. First thing I liked about this anime is the art. It has a different style making it stand out from the other animes this season. Second is it has a great combination of romance, action, magic and comedy. By having this great mix, it makes you fall deep into the story without making you bored. It also includes lessons about real life economics which are well integrated in the story, thus making you learn something from just watching anime.Another thing is it has great Seiyuus which makes it more interesting. ', ""This entire series is a giant deus ex machina. Yuusha seems to have every power that is required by the scenario or just cool for the moment, while Maou just pulls from thin air one convenient invention after another. And if that's not enough, Onna Mahoutsukai just shows up when she's needed (being lost the entire time and found apparently by accident) with exactly the required deus ex machinas (not that we learn anything about her i.e. why there are three of her).While the point of the story is that world can by changed without brute power, I cannot understand what stopped Yuusha from...ending the war single-handed (not to mention that he had a party) before before the series started. He certainly could from what we see.And to add insult to the injury, there's no real conclusion to the story. The last episode opens up more story arcs than it closes. ending the war single-handed (not to mention that he had a party) before before the series started.

I just feel like it wants to do too many things and if it would have dropped a subplot or two it would have done miracles. My choice would be to drop the economics take on things and just have the war and love story. Now when I say drop economics I don't mean completely. I mean just say what's essential about economics and that's it.Art-9-----------Wow this show is beautiful. Every frame is a work of art that could fill a museum.

Inferior to \'Spice and Wolf\' in every way, and not even decent on its own, I dropped this badly written wannabe like a hot potato. Stupid potato.\'Maoyuu Maou Yuusha\' can be legally steamed on Crunchyroll and the DVDs can be purchased from Sentai Filmworks.-Story-If medieval economics can create a cult hit, why not medieval agriculture? Well, first you have...to understand the basics of agriculture. The central plot is that humanity can\'t afford to have peace with the demon races, because if the war ended there would be mass starvation, so the Hero and the Demon King have to work together to improve agricultural output. Which might be a feasible premise if it weren\'t full of more BS than a fertilizer factory. Short version: war means fewer farmers (due to military conscription and recruitment), most of whom are not top-quality workers (because military forces naturally select the youngest and healthiest people), are working to feed more people (more soldiers means fewer farmers) while under constant threat of attack (raids were a central part of medieval warfare- admittedly MMY knows THAT much), and should such a raid come there would be large-scale destruction of supplies, stores, and livestock- leading to food shortages that would cause starvation and disease and FURTHER reduce agricultural output (you can\'t grow crops if you\'re too hungry to get out of bed or too sick to see straight). These problems are compounded when farming is as labor-intensive as it was until the 20th century. Go read about the Hundred Years War and see if France had an agricultural boom thanks to all the political chaos, English raids, and wandering bands of out-of-work mercenary bandits. The return of peace would mean the end of Demon attacks and the human soldiers could go back to farming- so how does this mean less food to go around?And even excusing MMY\'s badly flawed premise, the execution is dreadful as well. Most of the dialogue is shameless info-dumping (the first episode is nearly all one expository conversation), made worse by the fact that Maou (the Demon King) is telling Yuusha (the Human Hero) how the human world works- she goes so far as to describe the basic structure and functions of some of the largest religious and commercial organizations in the land to him (because apparently he never learned that the Church of the Light Spirit is the largest and most influential religious group in his homeland). There are 2 time-skips just in the first 3 episodes alone, creating a disjointed feeling as the show skips from plot point to plot point. And most of the dialogue that isn\'t expository is cheap jokes about Maou\'s exceedingly ample bosom (apparently demon culture doesn\'t consider large-chested women highly desirable, and the fact that human culture does seems to be the one thing about humans Maou conveniently doesn\'t know) or \'ship-tease\' scenarios where Maou and Yuusha almost kiss only to be interrupted by something (they\'re adults living alone together for MONTHS and Maou clearly wants Yuusha to take her all night long, so why exactly are they still acting like shy 8th-grade crushes?) And what little conflict does appear is almost instantly solved by Maou, so there isn\'t even meaningful struggle to get attached to. The story is a masterclass in how NOT to hook an audience- I ENJOY medieval history and economics and this plot still couldn\'t hook me, how bad must it be for the 99% percent who don\'t share that niche interest? If you absolutely need your medieval agriculture fix just read the 5th US volume of \'Vinland Saga\'.-Art & Sound-Thoroughly mediocre and they\'re still the high point of MMY. The aesthetic has no glaring faults simply because it settles for being so blandly average, with production values to match (for comparison, 2013 was the year MMY, Attack on Titan, and Psycho-Pass all aired- one of these is not like the others.) The sound is generic as well, the OP, ED, and OST are all standard fare with nothing to distinguish them. I can\'t complain about the voice actors, but given that this series is English sub only I have little means to judge them.-Characters-Take the most generic, bland, clueless, and aimless male anime character you can think of- he\'ll be Edward FREAKING Elric compared to Yuusha. He does little more than follow Maou around while she info-dumps on him, at one point even he realizes he has very little to do with what\'s going on. The story is hinting he\'ll start doing more things in upcoming episodes, but given his lack of development and motivation they don\'t promise to be more than empty action scenes to shake things up. His design could have been copy-pasted from any number of fantasy series as he lacks a single unique visual feature. Maou the Demon King isn\'t any better: a shameless blob of boob-joke fan-service who adores Yuusha for no clear reason, wants peace for no clear reason despite being from a culture that clearly favors continuing the war, and solves everything with an info-dump. The other cast members? Empty cliches. MMY relies on its main two and they stink.For comparison to the series MMY was clearly trying so hard to be, \'Spice and Wolf\' uses a near-identical set-up and pulls it off beautifully because its main 2 are handled exceptionally well. First off, S&W was balanced. Holo had charisma and special abilities Lawrence lacked (being able to tell when a person is lying is useful for a travelling merchant, and being able to turn into an unstoppable giant wolf has pretty obvious benefits), while Lawrence was far more worldly-wise and his rock-steady personality served as a counterbalance to Holo\'s negative character traits and mood swings. You saw that they truly needed each other. In MMY Yuusha is effectively useless as Maou has to guide him around his own world. Also, the S&W mains had distinct personalites. Holo would snark and tease as a way of dealing with her own loneliness and to hide her developing feelings for Lawrence- feelings her pride didn\'t want her to admit. Lawrence was more of a \'straight man\' to Holo\'s outlandish personality, he rarely tries to compete with her in snark-to-snark combat but does like to take the occasional shot just to keep her honest. He hides his own loneliness with silence and doesn\'t want to admit his developing attachment out fear as he assumes Holo will \'inevitably\' leave him. In MMY, Maou is cheap fan-service and Yuusha has even less personality than that. I want to clarify that I\'m not \'hating\' on the MMY cast, nor am I a S&W fanboy just bashing one show to make my personal favorite look good (I\'ve yet to finish S&W season 2 and am in no hurry to do so), I\'m criticizing it heavily because it makes numerous basic character writing mistakes and because there\'s a clear example of how to make practically the exact same cast dynamic under nearly identical conditions work beautifully.-Enjoyment-Back in Jr. High I had a brief desire to be a ventriloquist, so I bought a book on the subject. One of its tips was ""Open with your 2nd best joke"". A basic rule of good entertainment in any medium is to strike early with a good hook to get the audience interested quickly. All this to say that MMY doesn\'t open with a hook but with a train wreck. I almost never drop a series, I tend to get hooked fairly easily even if I know the series is objectively nothing special (I completed \'Samurai 7\' and \'Romeo X Juliet\' for Pete\'s sake). The fact that I dropped MMY should say plenty. I only stuck around for 3 episodes so that nobody would pull the \'3 episode rule\' on me, and even if it does somehow manage to get good later that still means MMY will have wasted at least the first 25% of its run time- that\'s not exactly a positive either.-Overall-A poor man\'s \'Spice and Wolf\'. A VERY poor man\'s. Story and characters are terribly written, and utterly mediocre production values can\'t distract from that for a minute. It\'s clear what MMY was trying to be and it\'s even more clear that it failed.

Skip it.', 'There\'s a somewhat infamous textbook that\'s used to teach Discrete Mathematics in some colleges called ""Discrete Mathematics With Ducks"". It sounds silly, but the premise is effective: if you pour raw information at a person it can bore or overwhelm them, but if you mask it in metaphor it can be a lot easier to understand.Maoyuu Maou Yuusha is the ""Discrete Mathematics With Ducks"" of anime. It explains the importance of some really boring historical innovations like the use of potatoes and dual currency economics by making them elements in an engaging story. If you were reading a history book on the importance of...potatoes for sustainable population growth you probably wouldn\'t care much, but if you\'re watching a show where the development of potato agriculture is of literal life or death importance for your favorite character(s) you\'re much more inclined to pay attention and the lesson sinks in better.Because the importance of this show is (at least in my opinion) the lessons being taught and not the story being told, the story itself doesn\'t do anything new; it uses the most generic plot imaginable (humans and demons locked in a fantasy war that could be taken straight out of any fantasy MMO made in the past 20 years) and even goes to the effort of making the characters and countries anonymous [fun fact, they don\'t say a single proper noun in the entire duration of this show, that I noticed]. The main character is named Hero not because the writers are lazy but to remind you that he as an individual doesn\'t matter, he could be any character in any setting and these lessons would still be relevant. If they made the characters and settings any more unique than they are you might lose track of the lessons being taught. In fact, this blatant simplicity of setting is the most unique part of the show! I don\'t think I\'ve ever seen a show intentionally make itself generic and it is a wonder to watch.Now all that talk about the setting and plot being generic might make you think this show is boring, so let me be clear. This show is NOT boring. It moves at a casual pace, but I became more attached to some of the support characters in this show than I have in any show I\'ve seen in years. In my opinion this show displayed more meaningful character growth in one season than Naruto has in its entire run. The few sword fights are gorgeous, the speeches are gripping, and the romance is heartwarming.Visually, they used a technique that I\'ve only ever seen before in Gankutsuou (though it is much more tasteful here) where they seem to have overlayed patterned texture filters on a lot of the objects, and a lot of the backgrounds are painted in a very interesting way... Sort of like thick watercolor, I guess. They kept with historically accurate drawing techniques for the scripture pages shown in the credits, in the maps, and in a few other places where they\'re applicable. It\'s not the most gorgeous anime I\'ve ever seen, but it gets a full 10/10 for originality. The voice-acting is at least on  par with other animes. Though it never really blew me away I\'m not exactly a connoisseur of Japanese voice-acting, so maybe it\'s wonderful and I just didn\'t notice.This show is educational, entertaining, and just a delight to watch.

This is without a doubt the case for Maoyuu Maou Yuusha. Instead of going into a long winded review I\'ll put together a quick highlight the pros and cons and who would enjoy this.Pros:Excellent Art - this is a good looking anime with unique character designs and set pieces.Excellent Sound - The soundtrack was diverse and solid. The voice actors were also spectacular (Akeno from Dxd\'s voice actress plays a minor role, to give you the kind of talent they got for this anime).Fantastic...story - There is romance, adventure, politics, trade, war, philosophy. It isn\'t as deep as something like Legend of the Legendary Heros; it tends to be fairly up beat.Interesting Philosophy - This anime is what I would consider extremely pro capitalism. You might not get that from the surface but digging in deep you see the Merchant as a strong central character who is using his ""greed"" to spread wealth and prosperity to the world. Only through this trade are most of the conflictssolvable.Cute love story - The Demon King and Hero have a really cute love story.Cons:Lack of resolution - The story stops kind of abruptly... clearly this was meant for a season 2 that never same.Haremish? - The Hero is loved by several female lead characters and even though they aren\'t annoying about it that angle kind of detracted for me. Should have been Demon King and Hero and the other female leads should have only been friends.Epic plot unfolding that got cut short - I guess I\'ll never really know who the Magician was or what she was all about. She seemed really interesting but you can tell she would be a major part of season 2 and now I\'ll never know. This is WAY worse in Legend of the Legendary Heros but the cut off story is annoying here as well.Who will like this:If you want a nice 1 season anime that deals with medieval times you can\'t go wrong with this one. Politics, romance, religion, fighting, demons/humans... it is an interesting premise. If it inspires you then read the light novel; there is an epic and fantastic story in here if you give it a chance.Story 9/10 / Art 9/10 Sound 8/10 Character 8/10 Enjoyment 8/10 Overall 8/10 story - There is romance, adventure, politics, trade, war, philosophy.

All past this is what was good or bad in detail. -This is very obviously based on Spice & Wolf, but lacks a slow romance that gets you connected with the characters in any meaningful way or the very interesting dynamics between characters that showed up. This is not what showed up in this show too much, although you can tell the writers tried. The buildup of the two main character love interest, really did not get expanded onto well enough which is the main feeling of the show failing at what it is trying to tell.The fantasy universe it is set in though is quite interesting, even though it has the very much cliche idea of ""Demons vs Humans"". The plot is really well done for everything besides the romance dynamic in the show, which is the most infuriating part, since they feel like they were very close to ""hitting the nail on the head"" as one might say, and that is the second most large major failure in the show, preceded by the filler episodes which could have fixed this issue.Other than that the show is really well done, the mixed feelings recommendation is mainly for the fact of what it could\'ve become, still really good but had a 100% chance to be a 10/10 with more effort on writing.Personal Rating: 8.4/10Critical Rating: 7.3/10if you want, then hit this with a reaction 💀.

Being a huge enthusiast of Code Geass I couldn\'t wait to see what sort of antics ""Lelouch"" and big breasted ""Kallen"" were going to get into here. Right from the first episode I was guaranteed to watch the next, and this anime does the good job of actually getting you to care.Story  - 8I find this anime to have...two sides of a plot, each catering to it\'s repetitive audiences. There\'s the part involved with politics, war, trade, and all that junk, and then there\'s the parts involving the more inner characters, dealing with their trails and tribulations, getting some light-hearted slice of life which is most enjoyable (in my opinion of course)It\'s really double sided. You may enjoy one over the other, but if you\'re good on both, than you\'ll get an even mix of flavor to make this watch and enjoyable one.The best part of the plot I would say is how the protagonist manages to attract his two best female interests in the most adorable way possible. That tingly feeling that you get watching these flirty scenes? You get plenty here.Art - 8I\'ve taken a good break, about a year, from anime before I came back into it, starting with this one and a few others. I still remember promising myself not to give too high of a score to the art category, because even though the standard animes now all have some aspect of amazing art I have to raise the bar.However, even with the bar raised, this managed to clear it magnificently. The art is gorgeous. The wheat fields dance and the grass blows in the wind. Background animations are particularly splendid. The character art goes without saying, making service the absolute bomb.You gotta draw those demon tits correctly. I\'m not a fan of tankers, but it\'s good are like this that makes it work for me.Sound - 7Most of you watching an anime for Jun Fukuyama\'s voice want to hear the deep sexy one he uses in Code Geass as Lelouch. Well, good for you because you\'ll get it here, along with the lighter voice that still sounds very much like Lelouch. Along with Kallen\'s voice actor, who joins him in dialogue.

Yes, this anime is very much acceptable for viewing.Overall - 8IT\'S STILL A DAMN SHAME THAT IT\'S ONLY 12 EPISODES two sides of a plot, each catering to it\'s repetitive audiences.

Firstly I noticed the character doesn't even have common name like your usual fantasy generic things, instead they're using title as a name (seems familiar with one controversial anime back in 18') after giving second and third episode I realize this anime doesn't do your typical anime stuff but rather they took world building as a theme.In any...common sense, if the story don't sold you then the character if not then the world building, by far I think the world building pretty make sense and legit make me want to Re-watch first three episode.About the character design, I don't know how to say it, the character felt lovable and likable but I can't say they're my favourite perse at least they're decent.Overall the story was interesting and as matter fact it's the only story I know since ages ago that trying to do world-building at that time before anyone else does this genre.8/10 common sense, if the story don't sold you then the character if not then the world building, by far I think the world building pretty make sense and legit make me want to Re-watch first three episode.About the character design, I don't know how to say it, the character felt lovable and likable but I can't say they're my favourite perse at least they're decent.Overall the story was interesting and as matter fact it's the only story I know since ages ago that trying to do world-building at that time before anyone else does this genre.8/10"", ""Inevitably, this anime will be compared to Spice and Wolf, given the choice of voice actor and the plot with economic themes. While there are some similarities, the two series couldn't be more different. S&W has a light plot(microeconomics) with more focus on the interaction(romance) of the two main characters. While Maoyuu have an ambitious plot(politics, liberation, macroeconomics, war), with less emphasis on the two protagonist.If you are watching Maoyuu with the expectation of S&W successor, then you'll be deeply disappointed. The romance in Maoyuu are presented in a Rom-Com fashion, which isn't any serious. Instead, Maoyuu's plot involves a reenactment of how catalyst that...rapidly changed our society today played out in a fantasy world where Demons and Humans co-exist. If you are watching Maoyuu with the plot as the focus, perhaps you'll find the series more enjoyable.Plot - 8The plot is insightful if you actually know what's going on, but the director skimmed over too many important details. The main story is the Hero wanting to end the War between the Demons and Humans. But there are many more hidden plots. Like the reasons for War(misunderstanding, discrimination, macroeconomics), oppression between nobles and serfs(slaves), how to end war(education, economy). Also the different degree of manipulations going on. From the Central government to the civilian/army/hero, or the merchant to the government, or religion to the civilians.The plot is ambitious, but poorly executed. The average audience would not understand the connections between each subplots and the main plot. If you haven't read the source material, like myself, you'll have to fill in the connections between each events yourself. That's not how an anime driven by plot should be presented. Sadly, if the series were a 2-course anime, it could have expanded upon many of the subplots, or even a deeper relationship development of the characters.Art/Sound - 7The Art is average for a fantasy anime, and the music fits. Some action scenes were nicely animated.Character - 6There are many characters but not enough character development. For example the Merchant had a major role to play in the series, but he wasn't developed enough that the audience could relate or understand his actions in the subplots. The Head Maid never had the development that justified her strong loyalty in the subplot. The Mage never had much screen time, most of her actions were of confusion to the audience.The only character with a properly developed subplot were the Maid Girl. As it was portrayed early she was born of a serf(slave), and don't have much confident in herself. But under the influence of the plot, she gave a great speech which deeply connected with the audience. If more time were taken to develop the characters, then the plot could also be better understood.Enjoyment - 7The plot was interesting as not many anime touches on the politics of War, revolution, and macroeconomics. But it shouldn't have rushed and assumed the audience could guess the minds of the characters when they weren't developed enough. The interaction between Maou and Hero is pretty enjoyable, though not as good as S&W.Overall - 7The series did not focus on it's strong point which is the plot, but instead tried to compete with S&W on character interaction/chemistry with a generic rom-com relationship. It could have stood out with it's ambitious plot if given more episodes to develop and more action/adventure scenes. Instead it tried to fit a massive plot into 12 episodes.

It was a twist on old stories with a different theme that really struck a chord in me, so having an anime was like the icing on the cake.Maoyuu starts with the usual the classic fantasy setting of the Hero on a journey to defeat Maou, whose realm is at war with mankind. It starts at the end as he reaches the castle and enters the final battle, he ended up founding himself in a university introductory class, listening...to Maou as she explains to him about the real state of world. In the end they enter into a contract (practically marriage) to find “the place behind the hill”, an alternate possibility to bring peace.And so we enter their journey as they help to bring about change in the human and demon world alike, using methods and invention that we, the viewers are no stranger to, education and technology.The series acts as in part as a deconstruction of the typical RPG Hero setting, but also breaking into the political, social and economic nature of warfare and development and how this reflects on our history. On both side, humans and demons, was there shown to be unhappiness , inequality and struggle for the denizens and on both side, there are ones who benefit from war and go out of their way to ensure its continuation, for their selfish reasons. It also shows the corrupting nature of hierarchies, as the powerful in the world controls the wealth and dines, while there are dying people who can’t even have a chance.The series itself composes of dialogue between the characters, showing the various plans and thoughts of everyone who is a stakeholder in the situation, so everyone, from the small servants to the leaders and how in a sense “the game is played” by the various factions who wants to achieve their goals. Maou’s plan is to introduce new technology and thinking into the human world in order to improve the lives of the people, this gets on the nerves of others, who sees this as a threat to their rule and invoke war.The characters themselves are interesting, as they are extremely stereotypical of characters of their kind, yet also somewhat aware of their limitations and they mostly act in ways to add to the story, not to explore themselves. Hero is nearly the a cut out from RPG game, being an idealistic loner who despite having comrades, decided to face Maou alone so that he can save everyone and so that no one has to get hurt. While he himself had noticed that there were discrepancies in the human world and to his role in defeating Maou, he never really thought about it until he meets Maou. Oddly enough, he ended up being quite pacifistic as he would rather reach peace through Maou’s way, rather than using the sword; despite being EXTREMLY OP!!!Maou herself is a scholar type character, who would probably out-rank modern day hikkis for the time she spent locked away in a room doing nothing but studying, with everything else cater for by the Head Maid, until she decided to become Maou to start her plan to meet Hero. She is extremely wise yet idealistic in her goals and is very serious in her task, she is shown to have a lighter, more humorous and childish side mostly when dealing with Hero.The other characters, from the Head Maid to the Winter King, are all part of the big story. The Head Maid is the all around helper to Maou that does everything that Maou, can’t, even leading the demon armies and also acts the counsellor to the other characters in the series. The Winter king is the idealistic leader and ally to Maou who realises the abuse of his country and people by foreign nations and sees that Maou can help his country to gain independence  through her knowledge. There are also Hero’s old companions, from the Old Man, Female Knight and Female Magician, each have their own role to play in the story, aid Maou and Hero in various way.Also, I think that the story touched upon the idea of humanity and different human relation.  This is show mostly through the various points in the series where we saw how demons and humans treat one another and themselves, from conflict to cooperation. It shows that every relationship requires acceptance from both sides and that no dominance or rule can be cast over people without their acceptance and so that’s why revolts start. This is exemplified by Maou and Hero, who belongs to one another, but neither one, is ruled or controlled by the other.The series overall acts as a summary of human development that occurred in Europe in the Medieval Age, that went through the Renaissance and even goes close to the Enlightenment, with ideas such as the rights of man, free market, meritocracy, the idea of popular government and even the rejection of universal control of belief by religion and various technological change.While that is all good, the biggest problem the anime has is pacing and explanation of the story, as they had to squeeze a lot of story in just 12 episodes and therefore a lot of parts were cut and made the story seem a bit idiosyncratic, also it may sound boring to tedious to many who don’t like political and economics talk. Also the way the series ends was disappointing to many, even me a bit, but this is due to the lack of source material sadly, which I hope means that the anime will continue if the novel continues, in a year or year I hope.Also, while for me there are a lot of similarities that can be drawn from this series and Spice and Wolf, I still don’t feel that the two are comparable. If one only focus on the fact that they both have a theme of economics, then that’s nothing more than breaking the ice of both series. Maoyuu is more of a parody and conversational piece or a sort of long legend rather than an observable story, as its drawing up many similar stories and themes that is time immemorial in human history.Overall, the series made it for me with how it made me feel, yes I know that is a bit bias, but this my opinion. The series made me felt the same way the manga did, a good concept that’s inspiring and motivated, as it speaks of the beautiful yet simple ideas of humanity, for love , peace and happiness and places emphasis on education and innovation, something we all usually takes for granted. It made me feel more hopeful of humanity( I was really depressed) as it shows the old spirit and belief we had in a better tomorrow, that we will work and live for it and we refused to be bound by old traditions and power to get to our goal. This reflects so much on our modern world, still sadly enough, even though the series is supposed to depict a world similar to our world few centuries ago.Thanks for listening to my rants, hope that it’s helpful. >(^_^)>. to Maou as she explains to him about the real state of world.

However, the Hero is made to realize that demons are just like humans and not all of them are bad. To see what is beyond the hill of conflict between humans and demons - that is the proposal that the Demon Lord has conveyed to the Hero. With that in mind, they formed a contract in order to end the war with neither victory nor defeat. And we see from this anime how their plan progressed as well as the challenges they encountered.Overall, it...was a good anime although it did not really stand out much... And that is what was bad about this anime!! It was an anime with a very good story and setting which could have made it a masterpiece. However, even with that, this anime ended up being an average series with nothing special really leaving your mind behind just because the story was not told well.I should not have expected anything grand from a company that mainly did hentai and ecchi anime. But this just shows how bad a story teller the director was. Even if you consider the higher-ups not having a care about this series and just giving limited budget to it (so it was just given 12 episodes) as if it was just a filler for a season, the director should not have pushed through on compressing the story into 12 episodes! Unlike some other novels/games/manga, Maoyuu is a series that has many dialogues and could have been good for one episode per chapter (or at least do not try compressing two whole chapters in one episode!).I felt like the director was conveying the story like ""This happend. That happened. This also happened. Then that happened... Okay, we go to the romantic scene!:D And now this happened next. Then that happened..."" Honestly, I was okay with them focusing on the romance between Hero and Demon Lord and it was good. But why discard (or rather, just spoonfeed) all the other good parts? Why not express them properly so the audience could appreciate them? Every series has its own pace and they should have followed that. This is one of the best examples of a series going bad because of fast pacing. People often complain about slow pacing but this is just as bad!As it stands as an anime itself, while the fast pacing is obvious, it is still a good series to watch. The art and music wasn\'t bad. It was just really the pacing that downgraded it from being a great anime it was supposed to be.As an adaptation, it fails miserably. While almost all adaptations are not as good as their original, this particular anime really took away its best parts. If anyone here only watched the anime, please spare some time to try out the novel or the manga. You will definitely appreciate it. was a good anime although it did not really stand out much...

Well, this one isn't that unoriginal considering the Demon King is a female and the story has medieval economics.Story: 6/10The story for me was basically that it started really good, but then dropped around the end. At first, I was going to rate the story around a 8, because I really liked it. The last 4 episodes bored me to the point that I would just go on my phone and scroll through Instagram or watch some other videos on my laptop. The negatives out of the way, even though the Demon King stories are kind of overused,...it still did OK, mainly because this story is also based really early, around the medieval times. Action scenes are mostly around the nameless Yuusha and sometimes it would either be really good or really boring. Even though there's romance in the anime, it isn't very strong as the relationship between Yuusha and Maou started out well, but even though either of them love each other, they still seem like friends from a stranger's point of view. There's harem in the anime, but I think it's 2 or 3 girls that like him. Yes, there's fan-service but that's mostly at the start and the middle. It doesn't affect the anime that much.Art: 8/10The art is pretty nice, detailed characters and nice animations for the spells and magic used in the anime. The colors look nice and the background had more of a medieval style to it.Sound: 7/10The OST fit each scene nicely, whether it is an emotional, funny or an action scene. The OP fits the anime nicely but personally, I really like it. The ED gives more of a mystical vibe, but doesn't fit well with the anime. It sounds eerie for an ending of an anime like this.Character: 9/10I've actually never seen an anime where the main character does not have a real name.Yuusha (Hero), is a very kind-hearted character, because even though the biggest enemy of humanity was in front of him, he still didn't kill him. He always suggested plans that wouldn't involve killing anyone, even his enemies.Maou (Demon King), is a very lovable character, as she also does not want to kill anyone, even if it was HER enemies. She's also very kind-hearted and funny. She reminds me of someone from a different anime, though I can't get her name in my head. Massive boobs and is very caring for Yuusha.Enjoyment: 7/10I liked this anime for a bit but when it started to progress, I stopped liking it. It got really boring for me, though that is my own opinion.Overall: 7/10Even though it was boring for me, you guys might like this anime.

There were moments that made me giggle, that made me think and analyze the ideas. However, looking deeper, this anime really isn't anything special. Like many others, it has potential, but ultimately failed to develop that.The main idea of the story is interesting. The Demon King, the Hero, along with other companions such as the Head Maid and the Female Knight, try to change the world, a world currently plagued with poverty, corruption, war, through education, inventions and schemes. However, much of it is rushed through...the anime, even the subplots as well. If the anime had been longer, for example 20 episodes, the story would have been properly developed. Not to mention that much of the story contains too many subplots, this whole story doesn't leave a lasting impression.Equally undeveloped as the story, the characters fail to show change. From the protagonists to the minor characters, they show us their personalities, but most of them are static characters. The Demon King is an intelligent woman who shows kindness to everyone. The Hero is an ultra powerful fighter who shows care towards his companions. For an unknown reason, they fall in love and have mini-love quarrels and small romantic moments. It is finished. Their characters don't change anymore. You would expect that the protagonists are the round characters, but instead the Elder Sister Maid, a supporting character, shows the most change throughout the series. Basically, the characters are by far the weakest point of this anime. That being said, similar to the story, the characters are affected by the fact that the anime itself was rushed through 12 episodes, and again, if the episodes were longer, many things would change for the better.Thinking about other factors, they weren't impressive, either. The art of the characters are acceptable, but the background occasionally feel like I'm watching a poorly done oil painting. The sound weren't good. I don't remember any music that I enjoyed or noticed, but the voice actors were pretty good. They did a good job for the Demon King, the Hero and many other characters.Overall, again, if the anime were made longer, instead of rushed through 12 episodes, I feel that it would be much better. There are a lot of weak points in this anime, but nonetheless I somewhat enjoyed it. Hardcore anime viewers, lower your expectation and watch it purely for enjoyment. Otherwise you won't like this anime too much. the anime, even the subplots as well. If the anime had been longer, for example 20 episodes, the story would have been properly developed.

I know, I was surprised too when I went back just to make sure, but yuusha-san is just a normal guy from a fantasy world and not a world-hopping Japanese high school dropout. Look what isekai has done to us, we can't watch any fantasy based on western aesthetics without assuming they're trapped in a video game world.Where the real world does manage to peek it's way in is through all of the modern agricultural and technological advances the demon...lord wants to bring to the world. I liked that spin on things where she brings up all the repercussions an end to the demon conflict would bring to human society, and plans to spark an industrial and social revolution in order to bring a new age of prosperity and unity between both humans and demons. Crazy good world-building, the level of some of my favorite western authors and not something you typically see from light novelists. Because light novels are serialized short form works, I think there's a lot less room for the kind of world building you see in Tolkienesque fantasy epics with thousands and thousands of pages. So when I see this level of care and detail put into crafting the world I'm impressed.Unfortunately the storytelling was pretty dull otherwise. A great setting alone doesn't make a story interesting, and the romance between the protagonist and the demon lady seems to be the focus anyway. It's something I've seen done better elsewhere and frankly it bored me. I still had a decent time watching this, but it's not going to stand the test of time as one of the great fantasy anime of our generation. 7/10 lord wants to bring to the world.

The unfortunate thing for this anime is that it is not nearly long enough.   What could have been spanned over 24 episodes is crushed down to 12, and because of this the stories development and flow suffers.There is a lot going on in this anime at any given time.  You’ll find that there is as many as three major plot lines going on at once.   Really felt like they tried to...cut up a good story to make it fit into the time frame of a single season.  Which is kind of disappointing considering there is major character development happening with several characters all at once over the course of a couple episodes.  You’re left wondering what the hell happened to certain characters and how they suddenly developed or what happened to them to cause them to change.That said, the art’s good, the sounds good and the overall enjoyment of the show is good.  However, because so much got packed down into 12 episodes it kind of ruins a good chunk of the anime.  There’s a lot of disappointment for me on how certain characters became the way they are at the end, what happened to cause certain events, and why the hell certain characters were played as important key notes in the anime only to get a few minutes of airtime and no answers to their story.  Meh - not a rewatchable anime, but a watchable one. cut up a good story to make it fit into the time frame of a single season.

It's really like Spice and Wolf so that's why I came here at first.The story is really interesting, and well-developed, like the characters. I would just like to say that sometimes i'ts getting difficult to follow their dialogues, and you feel like you're not intelligent enough to understand anything (might just be me though..)The art is wonderful, in HD it's just a pleasure to watch.I'm not really good to express my feelings in words, especially in English, but I feel that this anime is underrated in MAL and...that you should check it out.If you don't like the first 3 episodes, I would allow you to drop it, it's not meant for you. that you should check it out.If you don't like the first 3 episodes, I would allow you to drop it, it's not meant for you."", 'Maoyuu Mao Yuusha: An Economically Sound SeriesWhen I first heard about this series, I had mixed reactions. The first thing that caught me off-guard was that this series was being produced by Arms, an animation company profoundly known for their hentai and ecchi series. Although, I guess I shouldn\'t have considered that a turn-off considering a few of their non-ecchi/hentai series that they produced are Elfen Lied and Genshiken...and those two series turned out alright. The other thing that caught my attention was it was being directed by Takeo Takahashi. Takahashi is mostly known for producing hentai, but one of his most profound direction works...is the classic series Spice + Wolf. So I asked myself, would Maoyuu Maou Yuusha follow in the same footsteps as Spice + Wolf? Or would this series be just yet another typical ecchi that goes more the way of Words Worth than Spice + Wolf?The answer that first question is, yes and no. Maoyuu Maou Yuusha does follow the same structure of Spice + Wolf in regards to its economical and political views. In fact, a great deal of this series focuses heavily on the economics and political affairs of a medieval setting. Maou is similar to Holo in a lot of ways as she uses her wit and wisdom to try and create a more harmonically peaceful world, through means of creating new farming systems and practical inventions. However, where this series varies from a series like Spice + Wolf is it\'s character focus. Spice + Wolf had a very strong focus on it\'s two lead characters Holo and Lawrence, so much so that there is very little development with any of the supporting characters. Maoyuu Maou Yuusha on the other hand takes a much different approach. While Maou and Yuusha are the ""stars"" of the show, all of the supporting characters play an intricate role in the series. To understand this, we need to know what this series is about.Maoyuu Maou Yuusha takes place in a fictional medieval setting. There is a war going on between the humans and the demons, each of which is from a different realm. The Hero of the humans (Yuusha) goes to the demon realm to slay the Demon King (Maou), but becomes sidetracked when he encounters the Demon King. He discovers that the Demon King is actually a beautiful woman that doesn\'t want war and even offers to sacrifice her life if Yuusha is so determined to take it. Yuusha hesitates to do so and Maou explains to him what she plans to do in order to end the war between humans and demons, as well as a plan for making the human realm a better place. She asks Yuusha to join her and assist her with her endeavors. The two seem to share an attraction with each other and agree to assist each other in a grand scheme to better humanity through agricultural and economical growth. The series is quite remarkable on how it handles the issues of agriculture, economics, politics, religion, and war; especially with how intricate these factors are when it comes to the plot. I found it to be the strength of the series.I also found the animation to be quite good as well. This series is extremely similar to Spice + Wolf with its key animation and character design. Judging from the plot of Maoyuu Maou Yuusha, I found that to be an excellent decision considering it sets the mood for a medieval plot quite well. The music seemed to fit the theme of the series fairly well, and I\'ll have to admit I applaud Takeshi Hama\'s work on it, because he\'s not a very experienced composer when it comes to anime.The biggest weaknesses for Maoyuu Maou Yuusha had a few obvious snags. The first being Maou and Yuusha\'s relationship being somewhat forced. After the first episode, Yuusha\'s actions don\'t make a whole lot of sense, especially considering how Maou is forcing herself on him on a whim. The other being that their relationship seems to receive little explanation or development throughout the series. Going back to Spice + Wolf, it isn\'t like Holo and Lawrence where the two develop a relationship over time through their adventures. This seemed to be an immediate attraction. Another thing that stood out to me was the time skips. This series goes through A TON of time skips as it progresses. However, if you didn\'t pay much attention to the series, you wouldn\'t notice that. This series doesn\'t seem to label or display settings, so you could become a little lost as to where this series is at in its setting if you\'re not paying close enough attention. My third gripe is the pacing and focus of the plot seems a little confusing throughout the first half. It doesn\'t make itself very clear as to what sort of series we are going to be in for. With how this series advertises itself, I thought this was going to be like a Spice + Wolf that puts its focus on its two leads\' development as well as show the economic aspects of the series. The latter half becomes anything but as the two leads spend a lot of time separated from each other and it becomes more about political and religious corruption, war, and the role economics plays on it. To be honest, it seemed like this series suffered from a bit of an identity crisis.However, with that being said, I was actually okay with this not being a carbon copy of Spice + Wolf. I actually liked the overall focus being on the plot and the entire cast rather than just the two leads. I found the messages this series was trying to portray to be quite interesting and informative. While the messages behind this series were strong, I found the actual character development to be a bit on the weak side and the relationship development between the leads to be somewhat confusing. I have noticed a few people complain about the pacing, but I\'d disagree. The pacing is quite similar to Spice + Wolf, it\'s slow, but it\'s methodical and serves a purpose with its pace. To tell you the truth, I think where this series needed to improve was split up its focus. I found the series should\'ve done more to develop the two leads more early on and then get into the intricacies of the world and the supporting staff. Call me crazy, but I found the pacing of the actual plot to be too fast. It needed to put a little more focus on its characters and a little less on its plot. Although, it\'s hard to fault the series for that though, in my opinion, the plot is outstanding and the strongest part of this series.All-in-all, I found this to be a pretty good break back into actual series development for Arms. They hadn\'t produced a ""normal"" anime since 2004 so I felt this was a pretty decent break back into the anime industry. I was originally going to give this series a 7, but I found the series did a really good job of building its characters up throughout the last 1/3 of the series. It even got me to forgive the lack of development between Maou and Yuusha early on. I know I\'ve been beating the Spice + Wolf comparisons like a dead horse, but I\'d highly recommend this series if you liked Spice + Wolf. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s not a carbon copy...but it really has the same feel in a lot of ways. It\'s romance is weak by comparison, but if you look at the bigger picture of the series, it seems to fair well. I do hope we will see a continuation for this series in the future because it is well set for a second season and there is still a lot it can do with it\'s plot and character development. is the classic series Spice + Wolf.

However, I think that's all you really need to see and I don't want to watch the rest, not that it's bad, in fact it's quite the oppositeIt ended in a wave of possibility and explained the scenario pretty well, threw in a bit of fan service, some comedy, but remained generally captivating throughout. I liked the ending of the episode most of all because it left allot of...possibilities for where the show can go. I thought about the episode for a good 30 minutes thinking about different ways it could go and how the story could turnout and allot of them were really quite fantastic.

I\'m ashamed for saying so, but it was also why i left it to rest before even considering it a anime valuable to watch.Although the first episode is extremely.... Cheesy, it rolls into a story that\'s amazing to follow. Why? Well, simply because they make the story very, very believable due stable and realistic \'\'regulations\'\'.What i\'m trying to say? What i\'m trying to say is that almost every action anime is based on one or more protagonists which are not envolved with the politics and the situation globally over the country.In Maoyuu...maou Yuusha these problems are shown as it\'s in reality likewise to happen. not enough food for the people, beliefs which put down free will, differences in people and language, and ofcourse Merchandising.I didn\'t know a anime could be as much fun to watch as it\'s educational, with the swordplay added. Well done, Arms. It\'s unique due the fact that all characters do not own a specific name, but have their roles as their calling names.\'""Hero, Demonking, Knight, Mage, Mercanery, merchant\'\', and so on. The plot is very well written en thought out, And doesn\'t contain any scene that\'s not necessary to the story.In our nature, we always think we are the ones who are right. who are the \'\'good\'\' ones. but in war, no one is good or bad. it\'s just what side you\'re on.and in this anime, it\'s shown so formidable how wrong you can be. not only, it shows how a war really is helt. how the politics work in consideration of merchandise and the rolesof the people with belief in god. It contains life lessions, and it contains the lighthearted comedy and romance that makes most smile.It\'s good anime. it doesn\'t stand out in a theme, but more in it\'s more realistic explaination on matters. it doesn\'t skip the reasons or the work in the background.it\'s not standing out in action, in romance, comedy or drama, but in it\'s output on reality, even though the world is completely fiction.For some this might not be the anime as it will attract a smaller group of people, but just because of this dare it succeeded in it\'s goal.Art.The art, frankly, fits the theme just right. it\'s not oversketched but misses it\'s details just where they can be left out.Besides, it\'s alot better then their previous work, Elfenlied. It\'s a bit dissapointing though since they did perform really well in Hagure no yuusha estetica (especially with the female scenes).The backgrounds though, are amazing. they are true artforms in my opinion. besides those, the effects and lightplay are sparkling from the screen, which really makes me forget about the sometimesshallow eyes.8/10storyThe Story is so well constructed and told, i\'m really amazed about it. It switches well between it\'s lighthearted themes and knows the moments to get serious. What is so special about this, is that the protagonists really search for a bond with the other characters as they are needed for reaching that world peace. Unlike the random anime where they practically fall out of the air in the protagonist\'s life.There aren\'t any lame interruptions in the scenes and the story knows some pretty intense emotional-buildups. It\'s unique setting and relation to the real time world just gives the story an extra impact on the watcher,what makes the anime just so much more entertaining to watch.8/10soundlet\'s start with the opening: One of the best energetic opening theme\'s i\'ve heard in a long time.The music themes trough the anime just smoothly fit the story, with the themes slowly pulling you deeper into the plot.What i adore is the voice acting. it\'s very well performed, but what else would you expect from the voice actors of Code Geass and Jiraiya himself?The music effects are perfectly synched and do not lack or fall behind, what is really rewarding for the watcher.7/10charactersWhat i really, really like, is the fact that every character in the anime has a very important role in the plot AND change in personality quite a bit.To make such thing happen you need alot of background script and rewriting to actually get this done. There\'s been alot of effort in making this anime a good story, making a huge impact on the watcher who follows the whole story and understands the interactions and reasons of their acts.you do not get any background story at all, but that\'s good; if you get a background story, there would be personal grudges and the goal of the anime would fail. it\'s about a war which has to be stopped, not personal grudges that only causes a winner in the war.8/10enjoymentHard to admit; i really enjoyed this anime, especially because i\'ve learnt from a anime that was supposed to be a way to relax; and i did relax, while learning. It\'s got everything, really. Romance, education, comedy, little bit of ecchi, action, politics, drama and supernatural. Pick your favorite!But to keep it decent and short (so many **** complaints that they are too loooooooong -_-) if you have 4 hours of time, just watch this anime.it\'s worth it time and you\'ll learn something from it, too.10/10scores_________________________art: 8Story: 8Sound: 7Characters: 8Enjoyment: 10overall: 8_________________________Thank you for reading my review. i\'ll see you next time ;)- Zumorito maou Yuusha these problems are shown as it\'s in reality likewise to happen. not enough food for the people, beliefs which put down free will, differences in people and language, and ofcourse Merchandising.I didn\'t know a anime could be as much fun to watch as it\'s educational, with the swordplay added. Well done, Arms. It\'s unique due the fact that all characters do not own a specific name, but have their roles as their calling names.\'""Hero, Demonking, Knight, Mage, Mercanery, merchant\'\', and so on. The plot is very well written en thought out, And doesn\'t contain any scene that\'s not necessary to the story.In our nature, we always think we are the ones who are right. who are the \'\'good\'\' ones. but in war, no one is good or bad. it\'s just what side you\'re on.and in this anime, it\'s shown so formidable how wrong you can be. not only, it shows how a war really is helt. how the politics work in consideration of merchandise and the rolesof the people with belief in god. It contains life lessions, and it contains the lighthearted comedy and romance that makes most smile.It\'s good anime. it doesn\'t stand out in a theme, but more in it\'s more realistic explaination on matters. it doesn\'t skip the reasons or the work in the background.it\'s not standing out in action, in romance, comedy or drama, but in it\'s output on reality, even though the world is completely fiction.For some this might not be the anime as it will attract a smaller group of people, but just because of this dare it succeeded in it\'s goal.Art.The art, frankly, fits the theme just right. it\'s not oversketched but misses it\'s details just where they can be left out.Besides, it\'s alot better then their previous work, Elfenlied. It\'s a bit dissapointing though since they did perform really well in Hagure no yuusha estetica (especially with the female scenes).The backgrounds though, are amazing. they are true artforms in my opinion. besides those, the effects and lightplay are sparkling from the screen, which really makes me forget about the sometimesshallow eyes.8/10storyThe Story is so well constructed and told, i\'m really amazed about it. It switches well between it\'s lighthearted themes and knows the moments to get serious. What is so special about this, is that the protagonists really search for a bond with the other characters as they are needed for reaching that world peace. Unlike the random anime where they practically fall out of the air in the protagonist\'s life.There aren\'t any lame interruptions in the scenes and the story knows some pretty intense emotional-buildups. It\'s unique setting and relation to the real time world just gives the story an extra impact on the watcher,what makes the anime just so much more entertaining to watch.8/10soundlet\'s start with the opening: One of the best energetic opening theme\'s i\'ve heard in a long time.The music themes trough the anime just smoothly fit the story, with the themes slowly pulling you deeper into the plot.What i adore is the voice acting. it\'s very well performed, but what else would you expect from the voice actors of Code Geass and Jiraiya himself?The music effects are perfectly synched and do not lack or fall behind, what is really rewarding for the watcher.7/10charactersWhat i really, really like, is the fact that every character in the anime has a very important role in the plot AND change in personality quite a bit.To make such thing happen you need alot of background script and rewriting to actually get this done. There\'s been alot of effort in making this anime a good story, making a huge impact on the watcher who follows the whole story and understands the interactions and reasons of their acts.you do not get any background story at all, but that\'s good; if you get a background story, there would be personal grudges and the goal of the anime would fail. it\'s about a war which has to be stopped, not personal grudges that only causes a winner in the war.8/10enjoymentHard to admit; i really enjoyed this anime, especially because i\'ve learnt from a anime that was supposed to be a way to relax; and i did relax, while learning.

There's some magic and teleportation in the mix.Over all, biggest regret is how short it is...12 episodes is simply not enough for everything that happened there..they needed at least 26...some character backgrounds, prequels detailing war, action filled episodes... and most of all...this anime feels unfinished...I...hope they make a second season...Still, with all these huge imperfections, why did I give such a high ranking? Because this anime is very unique. It basically talks about humans vs demons fight, and bringing peace and equality to their realm, but not through Tengen Toppa, Guran Laggan, bolstering of badassery (although main protagonist could probably easily do that) but through careful usage of economics, politics, agriculture, medicine, education and negotiation tactics. In other words, here, reality is primary and magic and fantasy is secondary, the behind-the-scenes view of the war was the most important part here, and I felt like magic was completely unnecessary...and main protagonist's friends...just existed to patch sometimes broken storyliine...in other words...this anime had phenomenal potential to be the best thing ever...and if they continued the way it was for the first episode- it very well might have...kind of reminds me of outlaw star's disappointment after the first 2 episodes...meh... hope they make a second season...Still, with all these huge imperfections, why did I give such a high ranking?

It's a political intrigue centered on a helping a country stuck in a war machine improve it's condition, and not depend on war for it's economy. The show touches on agriculture and economy, so it is a bit educative.The main characters are not seen often, as they are working behind the scenes. I wish they expanded more on their motivations and history. The way they are referred to by nouns rather by names gives an idea how they are not the main focus.The two main characters are fairly quirky. The Hero is positively overpowered, but...doesn't think much of it and only uses his powers when appropriate. The Demon King is the leader of the demons, but contrary to expectations of the in-world characters, is selfless and deeply humanitarian.The main character duo have a heart-warming chemistry, i wish they had shown more of them together, the light-heartedness is what drawn me in at first but it was pretty lacking in all but the few first episodes as they went their separate ways for errands.The side-characters felt mostly forgettable. It's part of the narrative style of only touching superficially characters, as the focus is more on the story than the characters.The art & sound were adequate.I felt like there was a lack of information in some parts, and superfluous details in other places. So at times it was difficult to follow and stay engaged, especially when the main characters are so rarely seen. To be fair, some things are going to be left out when trying to fit a novel into 12 episodes, and it's a short enough anime to be watched for it's novelty. doesn't think much of it and only uses his powers when appropriate.

However, neither side had a clear advantage. ""Hero"", the greatest warrior of humans, leaves his comrades behind and storms the Demon King\'s castle alone. Determined to destroy the Demon King, the Hero sees a beautiful and attractive queen rather than a king. ""The Demon King"" offers to partner with the Hero instead of fighting because she also wants this war to end, but she thinks that the abrupt end of the war will do more harm to both sides. The hero finds the Demon King\'s words meaningful and accepts the partnership. Now, the common goal...of both is to bring prosperity and wealth to the country and to provide peace.The anime, which deals with the common cause of the Hero of the people and the King of the demons and their funny but romantic relationship with each other, actually manages to attract attention with its first episode, especially with its subject. In my eyes, the decline started in the second episode because the ""educational"" fiction started to replace the fantasy fiction of the anime. It would not be a lie to say that the anime kind of deceives you. After the first episode, you think you\'re going to watch a sometimes funny and sometimes romantic fantasy fiction that takes place in the Middle Ages and tells the war between humans and demons from the eyes of both sides. But instead you come across with a work that deals with the importance of trade, the life of the serfs, agricultural and political activities like growing crops and such. These are supported by plenty of social messages. This is not necessarily a bad thing. But speaking for myself, I have no problem seeing these kinds of topics in an anime, but I prefer that they are side stories rather than the main event. In other words, it is one thing to briefly talk about the importance of taxation during an event, it is another to make the importance of taxation the main event itself.I can\'t say it\'s boring because I still have the patience to endure a 12-episode anime, regardless of its content. But I don\'t think it\'s fun either. There were other aspects that kept me watching until the end. Despite its overwhelming scenario, the anime\'s drawings are pretty cool. Especially the background drawings in the watercolor style deserve an honorable mention. The music is just as good as the illustrations. I especially liked the opening and ending tracks. In addition, it is a different but nice detail that people are called by their titles (such as Yuusha for the Hero, Mao for the Demon King) and not by their names in the anime. Although this adds a fairy tale atmosphere in a way, the boring scenario and processing of the anime like I just mentioned causes it to remain nothing more than that.In summary, while I think there are some good things the anime does, they\'re not enough to save the day. If you are interested in the topics that this anime deals with, it will be much more beneficial for you to open a book or an article instead of watching this.

It was like expecting to come home to a nice, hot bath, only to discover that your house has been stolen.', ""There is a common problem, that old demon series shared: The battle through the countless pawns to get to the final boss, the demon king and defeat this evil monster. This concept is nowhere near interesting because the outcome can be predicted after the first episode. Instead of a 2D approach of this topic, this show decides to rather expand on the aspect, that demons have feelings and are an intelligent life form too.The series starts with a hero, who is supposed to be the strongest human, striving to defeat the demon king in order to end the war. Instead of finding an overpowered evil...being, that reeks of power, he finds a female demon king, who wants his help because she wants a peace, in which everybody can live. After she convinced him of her reasons, they join forces and travel to a town, where they settle down.While they are in this town, they make their first attempts to tackle the problems, that arise from war and peace. Because the demon king is a smart one, she is able to create several inventions and establish a stable trading. The townspeople look up to her and thus she takes some of them as students. Although they have a weak characterization, they contribute to the story later on and aren't tossed away, attributing to one of the strong points of the series. Several wars occur and become fiercer to the end with economy playing a central role. These aspects make up for a rather refreshing story.As for the characters, the story introduces a very low amount of them. We have our two protagonists, the Yuusha (other names aren't mentioned)[hero], who is the strongest one in history, but seems to be caring and very emotional as well, and Maou (neither another names mentioned) [demon king], who is very smart and strives for peace and a bearable life for both sides. While Maou gets a good deal of characterization because she is featured in most episodes and is the center of the economy aspect, which dominates the screen time, Yuusha seems to be forgotten over time and doesn't have a lot of screen time and characterization. He uses some spells here and there, but his character is mostly in the background and doesn't get a lot of attention.Another characters, who get a great deal of attention, are the Onna Kishi (no other names mentioned) and the maid, who is picked up in the first episodes. Their thoughts and struggles are shown in the series and are developed throughout the anime.Despite of all the positive aspects, the series has major problems, that aren't resolved. One is the relationship between Maou and Yuusha, which is really underdeveloped and dodged by Yuusha's travels for missions. Not only that, but their relationship seems to grow out of nowhere (especially from the side of Yuusha), skipping important points of it.Yuusha is another problem I have. I know that Maou is the center of the plot. But that isn't a reason to disregard Yuusha's character development and dismiss the strength he has. He seems to be capable to do everything and shows no kind of weakness in terms of strength. The series desperately tries to show certain thoughts of him, but fails nonetheless in the end and is like a machine in the end. Even the maid has more development.Another weakness is the pacing of the story and the end. It's fine to go into detail with several topics like economy, war, human traits, but if you don't conclude the story and its topic, you have failed. And this is what happened with this series. The major focus on many topics leads to an unsatisfying conclusion. The war between the demons and humans isn't over, the female mage isn't properly characterized even though she plays a role as well (we know next to nothing about her) and the conflict in the country is left open too. Dodging the central topic of the anime is a way to leave the story open and to not think about a proper way to deal with it. This problem contributes to a major degree as to why my score for story is really low even though it seems to be appealing.The presentation of the series is okay. The animation is not really noticeable and average, but the music made up some of my joy. It manipulates some scenes to be really good to watch and matches the topics of the anime. While it was not great, it contributed to a proper exposure of the story.Considering the points I made, I can give a recommendation with a warning. This anime has a very slow pace and can be pretty hard to swallow at times. The presentation, while being okay, is no big deal either. If you're fine with a mix of topics revolving about war and economy and don't want an end, where all questions and topics presented in the anime are resolved, then you should give it a try.

However, this anime compensates for this by bringing in new inventions that never existed before like soda or guns within a 12 episode frame.The story is great, with a somewhat original story and it includes some of my favourite genres, such as magic and fantasy, but I just felt a little bored by it...at the start. It doesn't have the right ending, either. You can't just stop the anime during a war without having a true ending yet. If you're going for that, then add another season!The art is amazing; not very colourful, but it will do. The 'brightness' of the anime fits pretty well for the setting of the story. However, it would be better if the magic abilities used were more brighter and colourful,  too.The music's fine, I guess. I wouldn't really say it's good or bad. However, the intro reminds me of the 2nd season of SAO (Sword Art Online). The way the song ends in the intro isn't how I would expect it to sound while listening to it.

It doesn't have the right ending, either. You can't just stop the anime during a war without having a true ending yet. If you're going for that, then add another season!The art is amazing; not very colourful, but it will do. The 'brightness' of the anime fits pretty well for the setting of the story. However, it would be better if the magic abilities used were more brighter and colourful,  too.The music's fine, I guess. I wouldn't really say it's good or bad. However, the intro reminds me of the 2nd season of SAO (Sword Art Online). The way the song ends in the intro isn't how I would expect it to sound while listening to it.

Well, that\'s exactly what Mayouu Maou Yuusha does. The main idea of Mayouu Maou Yuusha revolves around the war between the humans and demons; mainly, the economic and quality of life impact the war has on the individual, be it human or demon. In a world where poor countries rely soley on war funds to survive and the rich profit from the struggle of those forced to...fight, Mayouu Maou Yuusha is prepared with a full arsenal of original ideas, tackling the war idea in the most non-traditional anime way - through diplomacy, negotiations, economics, agriculture and education. Only through extensive research effort was it possible to make such an anime both credible / convincing and captivating.Art : 9/10The art style of Mayouu Maou Yuusha takes a pretty simplistic approach, this way, making sure the main focus remains its plot and characters, while at the same time, keeping it detailed enough to underline every important focus point. The purpose of the animation in this anime is simply to furtherly enchance ideas and to contour the context, as if reading a book which has illustrations.Sound : 10/10The music in this anime falls nothing short of impressive. With it\'s mesmerizing soundtracks, Mayouu Maou Yuusha needs less than a few seconds of your time to fully immerse you into it\'s fantasy world. While the anime does not feel like a high-budget work, it certainly is beautiful in other ways. Although most of the sound effects will give you a ""stock sound"" feeling, they are carefully chosen and planted along the episodes. Some of the sounds are easily identifiable, sound effects similar to those of Age of Empires 2 for example, which will kick in some heavy nostalgia.Characters : 10/10Alongside the story, the characters of Mayouu Maou Yuusha represent the main strength of the anime. If I were to describe the characters in one word, ""believeable"" would be the word i\'d chose. The anime\'s script cannot be described as anything other than gorgeous, giving every single character a very natural feel. While mostly dialogue oriented, the voice lines chosen here create a very strong harmony between the characters and the fantasy setting. If you happen to notice midway through the show that you do not remember any of the characters\' name, rest assured, for that\'s how the anime wants itself to be. No character in Mayouu Maou Yuusha has a name, thus, allowing each of them to be interpreted as a symbol ( for example, Maou can be seen as the symbol of science in the medieval times ). Unlike most animes, the fan-service and romance parts of Maou Mayouu Yuusha are nothing more than a bit of extra spice, like a sprinke of salt on your food, for those two aspects never go too far and manage to effortlessly blend in, making it one of the few cringe-free animes ever created.Enjoyment : 10/10At no point in time was I ever bored or dissapointed while watching this anime. From start to finish, it never failed to deliver what it wanted, sometimes even more than that.Overall : 10/10With so much care put into every single aspect of the show, this anime is one of the easiest 10/10 for me. Interesting plot which can be interpreted in a dozen ways, amazing believeable characters, beautiful captivating animation and immersive marvelous sound, that\'s the recipe for something amazing.Go ahead and watch this masterpiece if you like :- An immersive medieval anime;- An original , metaphoric plot;- Carefully managed worldbuilding;- A non-traditional approach of a traditional story;- Natural, well done character development;- If you ever wanted to see a fantasy isekai on history channel. fight, Mayouu Maou Yuusha is prepared with a full arsenal of original ideas, tackling the war idea in the most non-traditional anime way - through diplomacy, negotiations, economics, agriculture and education.

And after marathoning it in one sitting, I have to say that Maoyuu Maou Yuusha doesn\'t quite reach the standard that S&W had built for itself.That being said, this is certainly an enjoyable anime even though it is not quite as good as S&W, it does have the elements of what makes S&W great.Story:Basically...the summary, it may sound innovative but it feels very cliche as the protagonist simply agreeing to whatever the heroine has to say. Though they made up for it with turns of events after turns of events. However, it feels very rushed, as they only have 12 episodes, also the ending was unclear, it\'s kind of hinting at the idea of a season 2 but I don\'t think we\'ll be getting one anytime soon.Art:Simply visually appealing. It\'s as simple as that.Sound:It has great art, but the sound that runs in the background doesn\'t quite match what my eyes are looking at. It\'s not necessary that you have happy soundtrack during an intense moment or a sad scene, but more like, it doesn\'t really match up with the great art style it has. Also, both the opening song and the ending song doesn\'t compliment the anime at all (especially the ending).Character:What is generic is generic, we have an overpowered protagonist who is 90% muscle and 10% brain. Who somehow learns how to use that part of him half way through the series. And then we have our heroine, who is 100% brain and can seemingly do anything by herself except those of her daily necessities, of course, then falls in love at first sight with our ""hero"" and demand him to be hers.... come on, we can do better than that. More importantly, their relationship status doesn\'t seem to have changed in any ways, and I do not see any sort of character developments either. On top of that, there were also many background characters which we know nothing about, especially those from the hero\'s party (mage and old man). The only character with any real development is the Winterland\'s young king and the big sister maid. Also one more thing, lack of names for the characters....? Not a very smart idea.Overall:Not a bad anime, right concept and idea, acceptable execution and too little development for characters who are supposed to be the main cast.It\'s a pretty serious anime if anything, but it is quite enjoyable, not as good as S&W but if you are trying to learn some real time economics and politics, this is the right place. And of course, if you miss Lawrence and Holo, then maybe you can find some consolation as I had, just a little though. the summary, it may sound innovative but it feels very cliche as the protagonist simply agreeing to whatever the heroine has to say.

Firstly, it does not develop the relationship between the Hero and Demon King.When they separate there is no thought about them staying separated or any source of conflict to drive the story. You know they are going to be reunited and everything will go back to normal. Secondly, it is plagued by the beta male MC trope in a lot of shows that hinders character development. This show attempts to do something very similar that  Spice and Wolf does, but does not do it as well. The story, plot, and essentially...the show is driven by the Demon King. The Hero plays a very sideline role even though the story focuses on him. Their exchanges boil down to the Demon King proposing or doing something to which the Hero response by blushing, stammering, or generally avoiding the question.If it developed the relationship between the Demon King and Hero better while improving the exchanges by having the Hero respond seriously or with some sort of witty comment instead of blushing or stammering this show would easily improve at least a whole point on the average ranking. the show is driven by the Demon King.

This anime reminds me of that feeling. Although each of us has our own opinion that sometimes we tend to compare and criticize which one is best but we literally miss some important things like how did you relate and what lessons did you get from watching it. I believe, in my own opinion, weither if its good or bad it has something unique to offer for they are all not the same. Like us people each of...us have some different taste. A piece of advice coming from one conqueror to another id like to say don\'t force yourself to like an anime you\'ll just bleed and die.Maoyuu is somewhat similar to the anime i watched before ( i won\'t mention it to avoid spoilers) although same in someways but not quite similar, the PLOT is utterly different, that\'s why i enjoyed watching it. Its like watching harem animes though always the same stuff but you still enjoy watching it even if its utterly redundant (who\'s guilty here? Don\'t deny it! You F\'n pervert! Liars go to hell! Jk! XD). The plot of this anime goes like this; a Demon Queen made a contract or should i say they got married  (well not literally, but it feels like it) with her enemy ""The Hero"". What was the deal? Help her to cleanse the world from violence and corruption. Now, come to think of it whoah! A Demon proposing peace, quite interesting i must say but not like any other demon this demon has big oppais! Yes, the HERO has been tamed and has been tempted  by HUGE oppais oooppps spoiler xD). At first episode it got my attention because it is quite unique although vague but as i progress in each episode it began to shed some light as they tackle different struggles like political, war, poverty, education, discrimination, business, economics and ofcourse looooooveeeeeee with a lil bit of fan service (the fan service is actually cute and sexy as always but not extreme). This anime is quite heavy in terms of dialogue so it is not recommendable to those who don\'t like to listen in such long verbal discussions such as these, but if you like Monogatari Series then we\'re on the same boat. Given all that, by the end of the day what\'s important is what you\'ve learned from it and how it affects you personally.The characters; this anime has many characters with different backgrounds, but the most interesting characters are the maids due to their past lives as slaves and how they freed themsleves from such cruel reality their story is actually moving, watching them grow and learn from their new masters is quite lovely and now they have a true purpose. Come to think of it i they\'re the only ones who has a clear background. 🤔The art and animation; talk about quality all the way! Wow! Kodus to those who put all the effort and hardwork! Great job! This type of art animation is the bomb for me, i lolololove it! Love those big round eyes, i also love the colors (are those water colored backgrounds? GJ!) the characters and backgrounds looks so lovely.Music: wow! I have to compliment the ending song. Listening to it feels like i\'m in a trance! Quite mesmerising.Just so you know all of this is just my point of view, every one of us has some taste different to each other with different opinions. As for me i gave this Anime a 10/10 because in my book it is Excellent and hopefully i pray to Anime jesus through his divine mercy he deems it worthy enough to grant this a second season.

Ciao!', 'This is defiantly up there in my favorite fantasy stories that takes itself seriously maybe one of my favorite fantasy stories overall.The show is good but suffers from certain things. With one being a bigger problem. But the show does have genuinely have good episodes that have good writing and good characters. The premise of the story itself is pretty good in its own right.Gonna label the things wrong with this here. ""SPOILERS AHEAD"". The story itself is good. But the pacing tends to be to fast at times or to slow. Mostly the former. We have the hero just accepting becoming a...servant to the Demon King. Was explained why but at the end of the day i don\'t think one serving of tea is long enough for anyone to change the opinion on a sworn enemy that they\'ve been fighting.. This does have the issue of the character obviously being in love with each other but never actually admitting it or doing anything about it. Sure near the end there does seem to be a understanding of their feeling for each other. But for an audience member this tends to be some that will annoy me and i know some others. While thankfully they didn\'t have any weird sexual scenes right at the start of the show.. This is the only other issue i feel big enough to bring up and this is the biggest issue of them all. The story sets up all these other stories and gives you a hint of a bigger battle happening soon and characters that you don\'t get to see much but you want to see a lot more later on. Only issue is that this is a 12 episode Anime with no other Season coming out. This means that everything you\'ve seen isn\'t gonna be resolved and we\'re not gonna even see the main characters kiss, We haven\'t even seen them tell each others names. For the entire show everyone refer\'s to them as Hero, Demon King, Scholar. This is the biggest issue and is the only thing preventing me from giving it a higher score. If this was continued and the story came to an actual close this could be deserving of an 9 or 10. But unless that happens its gonna be sitting at a 8 for me.While i did mention those Three big issues don\'t think that is big enough that people shouldn\'t watch this. Sense i for the most part have already said why its a good Anime i\'m not gonna go into a list of why it\'s good. But i will leave one other fact.Side characters we are introduced too near the start that seem nothing more than throw away characters actually come back near the end and play a fairly big role for the ending too happen. servant to the Demon King.

I was swithering a bit between a 6 and a 7, but watching MMY was enjoyable on the whole, so I thought I'd be nice and round up.I give it a lot of credit for really delving into the politics and economics of a fantasy world in a way I don’t think I've seen in any other anime. Having a front row seat to a feudal/medieval fantasy society being dragged into the renaissance by an outside influence was extremely compelling.Unfortunately while the overall plot was interesting and the characters themselves were perfectly charming, there wasn’t a whole lot...of development going on in the latter department. The central romantic subplot is set up in a very interesting way in the first episode (actually I think the first episode in isolation might almost stand as a single shot OVA in its own right), but ends up feeling really half baked. The stereotypically anime ‘will they/won’t they’ thing it juggles for 12 episodes comes off as bizarrely juvenile considering the surprising maturity of the political stuff.In general with the characters, the fact nobody has a name and everyone is just referred to by their occupation or title… Eh, I think I see where the author of the original novels was going with that and maybe it works better there, but I think it just ends up putting a weird barrier between the characters and the audience. There's a reason almost every fish out of water robot/alien/mutant/AI/demon/whatever character gets at least a short scene or subplot about choosing or being given a human name. Proper names have significance for identity, not just for basic identification. of development going on in the latter department.

I think it\'s rather well done for the most part, but I feel a little let down.The story has a strong foundation. We start the show with a war between humans and demons. One man called Yuusha splits from the other in his party to take on the demon lord on his own. When he arrives he finds its a woman and she loves him and wants to bring an end to the war through improving the world. Many of the early episodes are the hero...and the demon lord getting to know one another and begin to influence the world at the very basic level. The scope of their schemes begins to grow larger as the show grows and it seemed like it would have come to a finish by the end of the show(it does not).The art is dated but great. The soundtrack is pretty good and the voice acting is top notch.The characters seemed like they would be more interesting. Maou is very intelligent and is trying to change the world through inventions and ideas being put forward. She has a girly side too, even having pillow with Yuusha on it. Yuusha is extremely over powered. He isn\'t very smart and is mostly a pack mule and convenience.There are several more supporting characters so I wont list them. The characters each get plenty of time and the world they try to build around them does seem to be interconnected. That being said it feels a little bland.I enjoyed this anime alright, like I said earlier I feel like I left empty handed. The story had a strong premise and I do believe it could have been really great if they were not constrained by 12 episodes. However it feels choppy, one moment its a fantasy show, the next we have politics, but we never dive into either realm deep enough to be interested. It feels like we are sitting between two foot pools just laying out feet in each and never exploring either more than that. The characters were also flat, nothing really sparked me as impressive or interesting. The dialogue that also happens that the show clearly wants you to feel attached to is also kinda fuzzy and roundabout. It\'s not hard to understand what they are saying, it just feels like ""sound and fury, signifying nothing"".TLDR: Not bad, not particularly great either. Kinda bland, doesn\'t explore either of its themes deep enough to be interesting. Dialogue is vague and feels to have little importance. and the demon lord getting to know one another and begin to influence the world at the very basic level.

Very funny and easy to see, I like political and economic plots here we can see a lot of that. There is also a bit of romance but too little. The only bad thing about the series would be that it only has 12 episodes. But well something bad had to have. The animation is very good, the soundtrack complies. The design of the characters is good but there is not much development of them, that means that I did not like it. I liked the expansion of the world where they live, but...that the protagonists have not even kissed each other seems like shit. It is good that at the beginning they justify it with the fact that the protagonist is a virgin and that, but there is an extreme. I liked it in general lines, I think that the worst of all is that they have not followed the story but taking that out is highly recommended.En español:Anime donde el rey demonio se enamora del heroe. Muy divertido y facil de ver, a mi que me gustan las tramas politicas y economicas aca podemos ver mucho de eso. Tambien hay un poco de romance pero demasiado poco. Lo unico malo de la serie seria que solo tiene 12 episodios. Pero bueno algo malo tenia que tener. La animacion es muy buena, la banda sonora cumple. El diseño de los personjes esta bueno pero que no hay mucho desarrollo de ellos, eso medio que no me gusto. La expacion del mundo donde viven me gusto, pero que los protagonista no se hayn dado ni un beso me parece una mierda. Esta bien que al comienzo lo justifican con que el protagonista es virgen y eso pero hay un extremo. Me gusto en lineas generales, creo que lo peor de todo es que no hayan seguido la historia pero sacando eso es muy recomendable. that the protagonists have not even kissed each other seems like shit. It is good that at the beginning they justify it with the fact that the protagonist is a virgin and that, but there is an extreme. I liked it in general lines, I think that the worst of all is that they have not followed the story but taking that out is highly recommended.En español:Anime donde el rey demonio se enamora del heroe. Muy divertido y facil de ver, a mi que me gustan las tramas politicas y economicas aca podemos ver mucho de eso. Tambien hay un poco de romance pero demasiado poco. Lo unico malo de la serie seria que solo tiene 12 episodios. Pero bueno algo malo tenia que tener. La animacion es muy buena, la banda sonora cumple. El diseño de los personjes esta bueno pero que no hay mucho desarrollo de ellos, eso medio que no me gusto. La expacion del mundo donde viven me gusto, pero que los protagonista no se hayn dado ni un beso me parece una mierda. Esta bien que al comienzo lo justifican con que el protagonista es virgen y eso pero hay un extremo. Me gusto en lineas generales, creo que lo peor de todo es que no hayan seguido la historia pero sacando eso es muy recomendable.', ""I wasn't a big fan of this anime the first time I watched it, but it grew on me.  It's more like Spice and Wolf on a larger scale.  It deals with economic and philosophical changes in a middle age style world.  The character names bother me because they are nothing more than job titles, people actually use these as names: Merchant, Hero, Soldier, Female Knight, Mage.The protagonist is an overpowered character who does his best not to use his powers.  He is also the annoying type of male character who is easily flustered by and scared of women.  There...is a bit of fan service, but nothing extreme or frequent.This show will not be enjoyed by everyone and it's a bit difficult to determine previous shows that might indicate someone would like this.  I say it's worth trying for two episodes if you are on the fence about it. is a bit of fan service, but nothing extreme or frequent.This show will not be enjoyed by everyone and it's a bit difficult to determine previous shows that might indicate someone would like this.

Before starting, I’d like to preface this by saying that I’ve never watched Spice and Wolf. I won’t be docking anything from this anime for similarities, as I feel that if a studio is good at writing a certain type of story based around certain ideas and themes, producing a good work in that area is superior to producing a satisfactory work in a new idea. I see the similarities between this and Log Horizon (which I also...enjoyed), however, again, similar ideas do not factor into my decision. But, it is understandable to say that having a different set of characters say the same things are unentertaining, and thus, this disclaimer. I will be reviewing this anime as a standalone work, ignoring all outside bias (formalism, I guess).Above all, a show has to be entertaining. If it can’t keep an audience engaged in one form or another, it’s failed. That’s where I think this show really shines. Every episode felt meaningful, with a good amount of actual progression. Whether a year or a month goes by in a single episode doesn’t matter; it’s what occurs that does, and I feel that this show really feels jam-packed with content. Although at times the pacing is a bit disconcerting (I’m looking at you, 1 year jump when Hero’s out exploring), the rapid pace is a great way to keep the audience engaged. It’s great that they avoided the pitfall many of even my favourite animes have fallen into (~Ahem~ Code Geass ~Ahem~) of the meandering, pointless middle section. I feel obliged to mention a few downsides, though. It may be hard to follow, given how fast it goes. I enjoyed it, but it’s certainly not for anyone, and I know for a fact I really enjoy fast paced anime: something many of you may disagree with. Secondly, it is very erratic, lending to a general feeling of what I call “bumper cars”. The story will blast through a year, then slow down for a week, and then immediately feature another month-long time skip. It’s somewhat jarring, and imperfect in many ways.The second way the show deliberately keeps me coming back for more, is by keeping its episodes self-contained stories. While several episodes end on cliffhangers, or midway through a story arc (not counting the stop the war story arc that permeates the entire story), most episodes are incredibly self-contained. This not only made it enjoyable to watch when it was airing, as this may be personal bias, but I’d have a satisfying ending over a cliffhanger for an episode any day.The third, is the cast of characters. Admittedly, this isn’t its strongest point, but the cast is indeed entertaining, if shallow. The titular Demon King is your smart girl with a body pillow, the MC is a bland OP character, and everyone around is fairly one note. The development of the sisters (only the older sister, really), is engaging, but really nothing to write home about. However, it is clear that these characters are only there to reflect the ideologies, and values this anime tries to push. Let’s be real here, the characters weren’t great, however, it allowed the conversation that pushed this anime forward. It demonstrated human nature, human innovation (or demon innovation, I should say), and human bias. By creating these blank, type-set characters, this anime allows the ideas that it tries to communicate, to become timeless, as you could just as easily see this entire plotline play out in Westeros, as you can in Edo Japan. Maybe I’m justifying cliche characters here, and giving the writers too much credit, but I did enjoy the characters, uninspired though they were.But honestly, when you boil it down to its routes, it’s an entertaining, unconventional tale of how two unlikely allies (and more, but the show WON’T SHOW US) end up using revolutionary means to change a world. The story isn’t too heavy, it’s fun, it’s funny in many places, and it was certainly a ride I want to take again, and again. It’s not for everyone, it has its issues with pacing and characters, but at the end of the day, the art is beautiful, the sounds and soundtrack deliver, and it’s an entertaining show I would definitely recommend.Of course, many would disagree. Much of this review is simply my personal opinion, and how I enjoy my anime. I happen to enjoy OP main characters, fast pacing, and a fantasy world, and so my opinion about this show is no doubt higher than the average viewers’ opinion, but I have to say, that for all the flack this show gets, it was a hell of an entertaining ride, and contributes to another reason why I want to be able to read Japanese; ALL THE LIGHT NOVELSSSSSS. enjoyed), however, again, similar ideas do not factor into my decision.

Like Spice and Wolf, Maoyu delves into complicated affairs on aspects to a medieval world and explores the chemistry between the male and female leads of the series. In the case of Hero and Demon King, both are trying to resolve the conflict between both demon and human kingdoms to prevent all-out war from breaking out and setting up a scenario where both sides would resolve their issues and benefit from it. While this premise would seem to spin on the idealistic side with what our two...leads are attempting to do, the show adds a refreshing twist to it in the fact that both characters know that their goal is a very difficult one to achieve thanks to how elements within the societies of both humans and demons play out thus they will have to carefully plan things out to make their ideal scenario a reality. This results in the two accomplishing differing goals to lay the foundation for their reality: Demon King becomes an adviser to the ruler of a kingdom and offers up various areas of knowledge such as educating commoners and cultivating methods while Hero tries minimizing conflict between the two races with his powerful abilities in magic and combat. The series also does fairly good in establishing its world as it explores the imperfections to both human and demon society with slavery, oppression and corruption among those in the wealthy and religious. Only issue on the plotting end is the lack of proper resolution for the series.Beyond the plot and world building, characterization is a bit of a mixed bag in Maoyu. Unlike the chemistry between Holo and Lawrence, there isn\'t as much prominent focus on building up Hero and Demon Lord\'s relationship as the plot gets more of the focus here thus the chemistry isn\'t anywhere as dynamic or interesting. The anime even tosses in a half-assed attempt at making humor off a love triangle with our leads and Female Knight at points within the show which is just as underwhelming as the show\'s efforts to convince you in buying Demon King and Hero\'s bond. Because the show spins their bond as being ""destined"" and we get no fleshing out of Female Knight\'s bond with Hero, the romantic implications aren\'t too convincing here. On the plus side, some of the supporting characters in the series get their fleshing out to show how the current society affected them and what eventually drives them to oppose their faction\'s way of doing things.Visually, the series is a high quality one with vivid scenery, detailed character designs and having nicely animated sequences with battles and showing off supernatural elements like magic and spirits. The music does its part to complement key scenes mixing light and tense tracks, but nothing in particular stuck out with it.Overall, Maoyu offers up an engaging plot and solid world-building in exploring the challenges Hero and Demon King face in trying to accomplish their goal to unify their sides. The so-so characterization and lack of a proper ending are minor bumps in what is otherwise a decent fantasy/ education/ action title. leads are attempting to do, the show adds a refreshing twist to it in the fact that both characters know that their goal is a very difficult one to achieve thanks to how elements within the societies of both humans and demons play out thus they will have to carefully plan things out to make their ideal scenario a reality.

Especially Maou, she is crazy analytical, she wants to end the demon-human war, but not by decisive battles, she wants it to come to a negotiated close. She doesn\'t necessarily want one victor over the other. It\'s quite clear, her intentions. Her character is amazing, she may be a woman who is very bouncy, but she\'s also very intelligent!...The character development of the ""Older Sister Maid\' was absolutely fantastic.

Each character is named what they are, like Hero (Yuusha), Demon King (Maou), Female Knight (Onna Kishi), Head Maid (Meido Cho), and so on. From what I understand, this is because the light novels on which the anime is based are written like a play. In any case, I really enjoyed this anime because there’s a lot of politics and economics and for some reason, stuff like that interests me. If you’re not a fan of those types of subjects, you might not like it much.The opening theme, “向かい風” (Mukaikaze) by YOHKO is pretty good, though her voice is a little high pitched for me, personally.

Ookiku Furikabutte: Kihon no Kihon,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3887/Ookiku_Furikabutte__Kihon_no_Kihon,"[""This episode is a side story about Haruna, who was a small supporting character in the regular season of Ookiku Furikabutte.  (I read somewhere that this story was actually written first.)  It can be watched alone without seeing the series and doesn't expect you to know anything about the rest of the show.  So... even if you haven't seen Oofuri, you can watch this!! ;DThis single episode tells the story of a really good high school rookie and the dynamic he creates on his new high school's baseball team; more specifically, how another pitcher reacts when faced with all the talent and...skill of this new pitcher.  So, again -- like in Oofuri, you can really see the insight and thoughtfulness the mangaka brings to the genre of sports anime generally and the mental aspect to preparation and execution in baseball specifically.The art is the same style as used in Oofuri, it's probably a little unusual for some people.  I like it now; it's grown on me considerably.  The colors are so rich and bright in a way that really makes me think of that time of year.  The faces are still somewhat problematic: I personally still think that some characters bear too much of a resemblance to others and I still find it somewhat confusing at times -- for instance, there's one background person in this dvd episode that, to me, looked a lot like one of the recurring characters from Oofuri, but it wasn't him.The voice actors here did a good job.  I liked everyone and no one was particularly annoying.  I'm still not a huge fan of the op/ed (which are from the regular season), but ...I guess you can't have everything at once. ;)The character is the really interesting part of this.  In the regular season, Haruna is introduced through the perspective of one of the main characters of the show (Abe) and the viewer doesn't get much of an opportunity (though there is some) to formulate an opinion about him outside of Abe's viewpoint.  The Haruna you meet here doesn't seem like the same person and part of the story's charm is that this is Haruna's chance to make a second impression.  At the same time, that tactic is such a great way to revisit one of the themes from the regular season, namely how people can can change in different environments and communities.I think Asa Higuchi is brilliant.  I have watched a lot of sports animes and I have watched a lot of shounens similar in style and plotline and I think that the level of insight and introspection and attention to the psychology of sport and of winning is extraordinary.  And in a genre that's (arguably by necessity) fascinated with brawn more often than brain, it is refreshing and entertaining to see a show that's interested in both the physical and mental readiness necessary to achieve a goal.Even if you refuse to watch 25 episodes of Oofuri, if you're at all interested (and you'd have to be to read this, right?) at least check this out.

It wasn't the art work or age that worried me (I saw it a year back or so) but the fact that each episode was completely independent and that meant that while some episodes will be mediocre, some will be amazing however regardless, there is no story to look forward to. But then again each episode has a fresh feel to it, and since their length varies from 4 mins to approx 20 mins, we are not wasting too much time experimenting. However these conflicted views were before watching the anime. For...Robot Carnival is a lucid experience that I would recommend to most people who don't have a stiff lip when it comes to different genres or old art work.As pointed out earlier each episode is a unique story however each has certain appeal for different viewers and I for one enjoyed almost all episodes. Some are simple single themed episodes with a not-so-deep yet appealing execution, others are deep, well expressed representations of humanity and its different aspects - others have both a side for normal viewers and thinkers alike (examples would be 2nd and 4th episode notably). The art is interesting - appealing in most instances though of course the fact that it is from 1987 should be kept in mind. We have various forms of character designs and sceneries. Different atmospheres can also be found through the series. The characters are like the story, some simple - others extremely complicated and some hard to judge. However that is the beauty of the series - its variety of themes and perspective. A unique aspect to this series is the fact that most of the episodes are silent - with music, but no dialogue but that actually adds to the experience.In a nutshell, I would recommend this to most people - yet I would specifically call out the older and more mature audience that can analyze various aspects of an anime.

Some are simple single themed episodes with a not-so-deep yet appealing execution, others are deep, well expressed representations of humanity and its different aspects - others have both a side for normal viewers and thinkers alike (examples would be 2nd and 4th episode notably). The art is interesting - appealing in most instances though of course the fact that it is from 1987 should be kept in mind. We have various forms of character designs and sceneries. Different atmospheres can also be found through the series. The characters are like the story, some simple - others extremely complicated and some hard to judge. However that is the beauty of the series - its variety of themes and perspective.

They are all well animated and have amazing visuals.  I personally found the first half more enjoyable than the second but this is largely subjective.  The individual narratives of the films are decent, but it's obvious that the main focus was on the animation.  Robot Carnival is unique.  It's hard to recommend to anyone who enjoys complex characters and stories.  But for anyone who just loves raw animation and visual talent this OVA is a no brainer.  If you're on the fence, Robot Carnival is definitely worth the watch...purely for the talent presented. purely for the talent presented."", 'I would recommend simply because of the animation. The animation is great and the music is sweet too, no doubt because it\'s done by Joe Hisaishi. Most of the episodes are weak in terms of storytelling, but make up for it in animation and style. The best stories, however, are definitely ""Presence"" and ""A Tale of Two Robots"" though, if you ask me. ""Presence"" is very interesting and unique, while ""A Tale of Two Robots"" is pretty funny. ""Cloud"" is perhaps the weirdest episode out of the bunch. I didn\'t get it, and while the visual style was unique, it felt pretty out of place...compared to the rest. Either way, it doesn\'t hurt to give Robot Carnival a watch if you love old school animation. compared to the rest.

You get several experimental pieces, some of which tell a story completely free of dialogue, which always amazes me.  It is an older collection but certainly classic, I'd compare...it to 80s and 90s titles where CG was not a thing yet.

Shaman King Specials,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3861/Shaman_King_Specials,"[""“Shaman King”, a title with enough resonance that can throw me down the nostalgic rabbit hole instantly. For two major time gaps, the first, way back in my childhood, I remember playing GTA VC on our family computer, all the while glancing sideways to catch glimpses of this show that was airing at the time, bit by bit, making up the general story as I go; until I decided to rewatch the thing properly around 3 to 4 years ago, and now, this marks the time of finally sealing my experience with this show as I finish the only related piece of animation it has,...(these special episodes).Featuring five varying in length episodes, composed of mostly recaps of the entire show, from different perspectives of the cast member, they retell the same things mostly, but some have other pieces that the rest is missing. It's one of those specials that I would have hated to sit through back when I had just finished watching the parent show, but 3 years later, I'm having a blast remembering every other twist that engulfed throughout the serialization of the show. I got to remember the characters I liked, the characters I hated, and the characters that I may have discarded as being doll and cheezy, but just realized how funny and likable they are. It's not a mandatory special bundle that one has to see in other to claim to have watched the entire series, but one that truly reminiscent with you, the further back you've finished watching the original series.

Kakegurui,https://myanimelist.net/anime/34933/Kakegurui,"[""“Part of it went on gambling, and part of it went on women. The rest I spent foolishly.” – George Raft.To those of you who have watched Kakegurui I ask: Why did you watch this anime? Were you intrigued by the aesthetic look of the show? Or maybe what drew you to Kakegurui was the concept; gambling! The latter was what caught my eye, as past experiences with gambling anime have proven that they hold some of the most entertaining and exhilarating moments I have ever seen. These shows have given me goose bumps from sheer awe and admiration while watching psychological battles of wits...and strategy between people willing to risk their very lives on even the simplest of games. Unfortunately, these kinds of anime are extremely rare to come by, as nearly all of them are practically unknown to most of the anime community and nearly impossible to watch any of them legally. So when I saw that Kakegurui was airing this season and also happened to be the most popular show of Summer 2017, I was pretty excited. I had heard good things about the manga and it was being produced by Studio MAPPA, a studio that I have high hopes for despite not being impressed with any of their previous works. All that was left for me to do was watch it, and this is where the hype for this show died for me. I was disappointed with Kakegurui from episode 1, because even after just one episode, it is obvious to see that Kakegurui is a terrible gambling anime.Kakegurui takes place in Hyakkaou Private Academy, a prestigious school where the student are the most wealthy and privileged students in all of Japan. I use the term school lightly because there seems to be no actual classes or learning happening, instead the school is more like a gambling den, where every student partakes in gambling. They bet their fortunes against one another regularly, and those who become in debt are practically slaves to the holders of their wealth. The show focuses of Yumeko Jabami, a new student who gambles for the fun of it and is really good at it; too good, in fact. Her actions end up disrupting the student hierarchy of Hyakkaou Academy, causing the Student Council to come up with ways to stop her. Throughout the show, Yumeko befriends beta cuck bitch-boy Ryouta Suzui and fellow gambling gal Meari Saotome who help her as she gambles to her heart’s content. Ironically, Yumeko’s first gamble at the academy is against Meari, and it is here where the first major problem of the show lies.The game Yumeko and Meari play is a card-game variation of rock-paper-scissors where the crowd of people watching them write the symbol of “rock”, “paper” or “scissors” on cards, where they are collected and put into a box for both players to draw three cards and play the game. Meari manipulates the majority of the class’ votes to her advantage, however Yumeko still wins decisively and reveals exactly how Meari cheated. Throughout the entire game, the audience is given no insight into what Yumeko is thinking or even a hint as to how she was able to figure out Meari’s scheme until it is given through exposition after she has already won. As such, viewers are forced to believe Yumeko was able to piece everything together without fault. Doing this is lazy of the writers as it solely relies on having to tell the audience what happened, rather than show it as it is happening. This problem is apparent in every gamble in the show and kills the opportunity for viewers to engage with the gambling games and the characters playing said games. The games themselves are also poorly constructed; some come off as unnecessarily complex, others are just too simple and easy to beat. Being marketed as a gambling anime makes the show look incredibly dumb and stupid, taking away the chance to get excited for how these games play out. And that leads to what I feel is the 2nd biggest issue with this anime: no thrills.As you watch Kakagurui, you begin to notice a couple patterns with each gamble: High-stakes are never fully realised, every female character is bat-shit insane and “Yumeko wins LOL”. Seriously, even when Yumeko loses like in episode 3, she has no repercussions from losing. Because the audience is always watching from the perspective of either a mere onlooker or one of Yumeko’s opponents, she always comes across as too good for every situation she is placed in. Because of this she rids the show of any tension it could have had. And when you figure out that most of the time Yumeko gambles, she barely even uses a complete strategy, relying on pure luck to win at random times, which feels like a slap in the face to anyone expecting consistency and/or intelligence from this show. The fact that there are no actual punishments fulfilled from losing a high-stakes gamble also hinders the joy and excitement viewers get from watching. Now while there are consequences for being in an extreme amount of debt (e.g. house pet, Meari’s “Life Schedule”), you never actually see the show go through with these consequences and even then, the punishment for losing rarely ever matches the reward for winning. And in Yumeko’s case, the money she wins never really matters to her at all. She is the kind of sadomasochist that would throw countless amounts of money away to feel satisfied with how high the risk of losing a gamble is. Yet the show never goes through with these risks. So I’m left here after watching each gamble asking myself “What’s the point?”. A lot of fans of the show have been saying that Kakegurui is not a gambling anime, but a great thriller, and I just cannot agree with that statement at all. It is a mediocre thriller at best and that is only if you turn your brain off.Speaking of which, this show stretches one’s suspension of disbelief so much that you would think this has the quality of fanfiction-level writing. Not just with the gambling aspect of it, but the entire setting is fucking stupid. From the very start I was always curious why there were so many students at Hyakkaou Academy and why they would all gamble. But as I continued watching, the curiosity turned into frustration because it became apparent that there is no proper reason why so many students would stay there or continue to engage in gambling than to make Yumeko even more perfect than what she already is. Yumeko exposes a lot of the games played in gambles as cheat ways to get other in debt, yet that never changes the amount of gambling that takes place within the academy, and that is because most of the students in the background are ignorant buffoons. I would also like to know why only one adult to my memory has appeared in the entire 12 episodes. ONE! I cannot imagine such a prestigious academy to only have one adult working at the academy, but it makes sense with the amount of betting that takes place so regularly. And how in the world are guns and kidnapping allowed? And why does being in extreme debt eventually lead to a life sentence that dictates you to a wealthy future? So many questions that are never explained because this show is not about logic. It tries to look smart but just comes off as a dumb piece of shit. Calling this show psychological is pure lunacy; if anything, it is psycho-sexual because any real sense of logic got thrown out the fucking window!Nearly every character in this show pissed me off. I have already stated how Yumeko is convoluted out her own ass and is like a vacuum sucking all the excitement away from the show, but she seems like God’s gift to this show when compared to every other character. Meari, who seemed like she had potential, starting off as a cocky bitch that is humbled by Yumeko before being humiliated by the student council. Sadly, she turned out to be a weaker clone of Yumeko by episode 4 and is only used as a way to explain other games Yumeko plays as the story goes on. Literal waste of potential. Ryouta is their other friend, but honestly he does nothing in this show. He just reacts to shit happening around him and nods in response and is a waste of space. Fuck him. The only other characters that matter are the one-note members of the student council that only matter for the one episode they are in before getting pushed to the side. Dishonourable mention to eyepatch-girl with the revolver fetish and a chronic masturbation habit, edgy bitch. And I would love to talk about the one guy whose sole purpose here is to sexually assault the protagonist, but I won't bother trying to match the show when it comes to edge. All you need to know is that these characters are terrible, both in their construction and as people, making the show even more of a pain while watching.Regarding the production, from a company like Studio MAPPA I was really disappointed. The art style is not impressive, most of the female character designs are generic, backgrounds are fairly basic and visual effect are for the most part impressive. The most controversial feature of the animation has to be the facial expressions and I have mixed feelings about them. On one hand, they showcase how broken and mentally unstable these characters get at times, but these faces just do not fit the visual look of the show and come off as cringe-inducing to me. The fan-service used is also off-putting to me, seemingly thrown in at random intervals in each episode. Yumeko pretending to be a cat was a definite low point for my enjoyment and did more to prove to me that it cares more about sex appeal than anything of substance. The music used was fine to me, with the OP being perhaps the best part of the entire show, which is not a hard feat. The ED however, was nice to listen to once but afterwards was always skipped, as I don’t see how Yumeko walking for 90 seconds as her breasts bounce constantly is worth seeing more than once. The voice acting was fine until characters went into their crazy stage and felt artificial and forced, but I suppose that fits the show unintentionally.In conclusion, Kakegurui was pretty awful, filled with formulaic, villain-of-the-week gambling matches that felt like a waste of time once it was all over. In the end it was only trying to entertaining on a superficial level; it was never attempting to have a real identity, besides being yuri fapbait. Now I have no problem with anyone who liked the show; you are free to like and enjoy whatever anime you want to, but if someone were to ask me if I enjoyed it? HELL NAW. Lemme put it this way: If you liked Mirai Nikki and Akame ga Kill, you’ll probably enjoy this. But if you are anything like myself and thought those two shows were terrible, Kakegurui ain’t gonna be worth your time. Now if you’ll excuse me, I’m off to watch something that is actually worth my time. and strategy between people willing to risk their very lives on even the simplest of games.

But the thing is, most of them or should I say ''Almost'' of the anime with a ''Game'' genre are about going into a video game itself and it's getting boring tbh. Summer 2017 season is going to end along with one of its unique ''Game'' anime which is very different to other animes this season because not only it excels to the ''Game'' genre with being different to other animes out there but...also it excels on the psychological part of it. Welcome to Kakegurui. A 12-episodes anime that offers both the craziness of gambling and mechanism of it.Story: 8/10Kakegurui brought as a simple story where a student (Jabami Yumeko) just wants to gamble even further, exceeding the expectations of a normal human being like her subordinate Suzui Ryouta.Gambling for her is like soft drinks which has a very good feeling to the body. Not only she's crazy but also she's competitive that from the beginning of the anime (Episode 1 - 3) she has taken an interest to gamble every member of the school's Student Council. The story focuses about competition and power through gambling. If one is a failure, he/she is automatically dropped on this anime's atmosphere. If one is successful, he/she will be consider as an elite on this school. Kakegurui is unique itself from its setup of the school. Normally, school animes are about high school life, romance and other stuffs, but here, competition is a must.That's what makes Kakegurui a worth-to-watch anime this season because of its characters focusing on one goal. To be the best. But of course Yumeko is an exception. She just loves gambling.Art: 9/10What makes this anime famous this season is the art of the anime. Mostly, it's about the facial expression of each characters whenever they are thinking, devastated, or confident on winning. Some actually see it as a disturbing one but on my opinion, it reflects the character's attitude and thats the reason it's excellent.Though it's not only the facial expression. The normal sketches of the anime is already good you know. Though sometimes you think that the normal face is lacking something but when the expression changes drastically, you are quite shocked.Sound: 9/10Do you ever get the feeling that something is going to happen when the sound changes? Or something feel ''uneasy'', well there are parts on Kakegurui that will offer you some a little bit of suspense. Just a little because if it goes high, well this will be a horror anime. Speaking of sound, the opening is excellent with the jazz and music on it. Then followed up by a change of music with the ending.Character: 8/10To be honest, from episode 1 - 12, we have seen all the character's traits and development because of the good plot that Kakegurui brought as, though some are lacking history while others are rich of it. As for the MC she's an exception though we can see her development pretty quickly along with some other characters as well.Enjoyment: 8/10My enjoyment for this anime is pretty simple. To see how the character's react, think and make decisions on every game and the anime did it on a splendid well. With gambling as the main core, they derived their strategies and make it simple for the audience to understand like us. I don't know any rules about any gambling games but I understand it a little because of this anime.Overall.. I rate this anime as 8.5/10 or 8/10 for the fact that it focuses on its genre more, character development and the craziness it offers to us this Summer 2017 season. also it excels on the psychological part of it.

Then followed up by a change of music with the ending.Character: 8/10To be honest, from episode 1 - 12, we have seen all the character's traits and development because of the good plot that Kakegurui brought as, though some are lacking history while others are rich of it. As for the MC she's an exception though we can see her development pretty quickly along with some other characters as well.Enjoyment: 8/10My enjoyment for this anime is pretty simple. To see how the character's react, think and make decisions on every game and the anime did it on a splendid well. With gambling as the main core, they derived their strategies and make it simple for the audience to understand like us. I don't know any rules about any gambling games but I understand it a little because of this anime.Overall.. I rate this anime as 8.5/10 or 8/10 for the fact that it focuses on its genre more, character development and the craziness it offers to us this Summer 2017 season."", 'I’m not a fan of using buzzwords but it’s hard to ignore the edginess when watching Kakegurui. Based on the manga of the same name, this adaptation translates to a gambling story. I can’t help but think of a wicked thriller when watching this show. It basically takes the idea of gambling and transform it into madness with its characters, setting, and ideas. However, does it live up its hype and worth watching? The answer is quite the opposite.Getting into this show for some people will likely not be easy. It’s not a recommendable show for anyone unless you really fancy a psychological thriller that...deals with a crazy cast of characters. The show itself takes place at Hyakkaou Academy. It’s a peculiar school that prepares students for proficiency related to strategizing, mental strength, and of course gambling. To survive, you have to outsmart your opponents and become part of the hierarchy. In other words, it’s survival of the fittest.The first episode definitely will get you into the mood as we meet Yumeko Jabami, the main protagonist and new transfer student. While Jabami may seem like an ordinary girl at first glance, it’s easy to notice how far she is from normal once she gets herself involved in gambling games. The show chronicles her school days as she takes on opponents with high risk. I mean, it’s gambling. There’s always risk but what’s peculiar about Jabami is that she gambles for the thrill of it rather than for fame or money. In addition, the show makes it clear that Jabami is intelligent as she quickly learns the inside and outside of the school’s gambling games. In fact, there are episodes where Jabami beats her opponents at their own game. However, I can’t firmly say that Jabami’s personality is one that people can appreciate. She is highly unpredictable and truly enjoys the thrill of gambling. From every episode, she has orgasmic reactions when she thinks about gambling. To a certain extent, the show truly wants us to accept Jabami for who she is but I find it difficult to do so. The reason she gambles is irrational and I can hardly find her relatable to anyone. Not to mention, this show doesn’t do an adequate job of getting viewers to understand her better. Her morality regarding gambling is absurd and really lacks reason. She just wants to gamble and treats it as the most exciting thing in the world. I also have to confess that Jabami’s character change from an elegant beauty to a psychotic freak to be difficult to watch at times. In retrospect, Jabami has a lot of flaws in her character and this show doesn’t do a decent job at repairing them.Beyond Jabami, the majority of the cast isn’t far off from their psychotic characteristics. Mary Saotome, the first gambling opponent of Jabami at the school shows her own crazy antics. The majority of the student council has various characters ranging from the mysterious president Kirari Momobami, the violent head of Beautification Committee Midari Ikishima, the calculating Kaede Manyuda, part-time idol Yumemi Yumemite, nail loving Itsuki Sumeragi, and among others. The show tries to make them appealing by injecting their personalities in the most devious way possible. What we get as a result are weak background stories, generic characteristics, and abominable morals. To me, these characters are pretty much all the same and serve as an obstacle to Jabami. The show has Jabami fighting against some of the key members of the student council but the result usually ends up being extremely predictable.  To be quite honest, the anime itself is nothing short but predictable from the start. Even though Jabami isn’t invulnerable to losing, it doesn’t make us feel anything about her situation when she does. Jabami herself doesn’t even seem to care and in many ways, the show tries to express offbeat ideas that come out as uninspiring.Character relationships in this anime is also very questionable. The most normal character at the school would probably be Ryouta Suzui, one of Jabami’s very few allies. He has a very lack-luster personality and I honestly feel like this show would be much better if he didn’t exist. His relationship with Jabami is easily forgettable as the two are very polar opposites. Others also make him look like a fool and to be quite honest, it’s pretty much what he is. That being said, the show makes it clear that the society has many fools. Thanks to the hierarchy that the student council president has made, there are those that are labeled as “house pets”. Essentially, house pets are those that sink into large debts and are mistreated by the public. Why? It’s the simplicity of social status. Unfortunately, we never really get a full understanding on why this system exists as the show focuses way too much on Jabami’s gambling adventures than anything else. It’s one of the major weakness of the show as everything seems to be about Jabami. The show is like a loop with the same formula. Jabami faces off against an opponent, plays against them at their own game, and gets the orgasmic thrills of it. It becomes tedious fast and lacks substance because of Jabami’s morals. I also don’t really find the games themselves to be thrilling as most are predictable. The games puts emphasis on psychology rather than strategy so don’t expect this show to be smart in any way. I mean, a good majority of the gamblers cheat, manipulate, and do anything to win. Then, there’s Jabami who just wants to enjoy the ecstasy of gambling. On the plus side, adaptation standards remain mostly faithful as the show captures the expressive faces of the characters. Each chapter is adapted carefully with panel by panel storytelling. However, it’s still an incomplete adaptation because manga itself is ongoing. A 1-cour adaptation like this really leaves open a lot of questions and doesn’t tie any loose ends in the end. There’s also original content added in for this adaptation.Adapted by Studio MAPPA, the producers apparently went all out to bring out the sheer entertainment value as much as possible. First, there’s the character expressions that really borderlines inhuman insanity. The art shift is pretty noticeable for almost every gambler in this anime. One minute, they look normal but as soon as gambling business picks up, they go full facial with highly stylized features. Jabami is the guiltiest of this with her psychotic eyes, intense blushing, and body language. The show decorates itself with fan service although this sometimes looks like a satire. Also, it seems this show can’t sometimes hold back on the violence so don’t be surprised if you see blood, vomiting, etc. It’s a crazy world after all.By technical elements, Kakegurui’s soundtrack, music, and voice acting is impressive. The theme songs are very stylistic with piano chords, eerie beats, and haunting lyrics. Both theme songs also have a clever tempo that matches the momentum of its creativity. Plus, it’s also hard to ignore the show’s OST during any gambling match when it’s at its highest point. Finally, I have to admit that a good amount of character personality comes from the voices. This could likely be Saori Hayami’s best role to date as Jabami. She had a lot of different voice acting roles in the past before but to me, her character in this show stood out the most. If there’s anything to take away from this anime, it’s to remember the talents of the voices.In the end, Kakegurui turned out to be a cheap cash grab that serves as a giant advertisement of the manga. It’s hard to forgive this show when the storytelling is so blend and the characters are brutally depressing to watch. The anime tried far too hard to sell whatever it intended to and ended up delivering a nakedly dumb adaptation. Some of the visual elements, music, and voice acting saved this show from total catastrophe. However, it still makes this show look like a crude joke. deals with a crazy cast of characters.

Although I\'ve only seen four episodes so far, I was more than excited to write a review about this, and can\'t wait to see more. Its premise is straightforward, but the execution is stunning. Its strengths lie in its dynamic facial expressions, fair storytelling, and high-quality artistry. The aesthetic expression, in all aspects, always manage to complement the mood and tone of the story. Small details, such as lighting, eyes, mouth, wrinkles, all contribute to the viewer\'s experience.The main protagonists Jabami and Suzui both act as archetypal foils to another. This juxtaposition allows...the viewer to further appreciate the mood, complexity, and humor of the show. The gambling matches reflect those of a videogame \'boss\' battle, each having its own unique characteristics, patterns, and spins. This keeps the show exciting and leaves the viewer wanting more.The result of the matches are hard to predict, and steps away from stereotypical \'cheap\' wins that similar anime fall into. The insanity and savvy of the Compulsive Gambler is highlighted by their philosophy, which isn\'t introduced through cheap narration, rather through gameplay and thoughtful dialogue.I highly recommend ""Kakegurui"" for those who enjoy psychological thrillers, nuanced expression, and those who appreciate visually pleasing shows. I really enjoyed this anime, and I\'m glad that I picked this up. the viewer to further appreciate the mood, complexity, and humor of the show.

I really enjoyed this anime, and I\'m glad that I picked this up.', ""Gambling is a fairly common topic in manga, though it is seldom adapted into an anime. There is good reason for this: there is little in the way of action that would benefit from adaptation, and exposition really drags on when it needs to be voiced rather than just read. And alongside these conceptual problems, there's the moral repugnancy that Kakegurui revels in, which should serve to further alienate any potential audience. But despite all of this, Kakegurui has somehow won against a stacked deck, and in this review, I'll take a look at how this oddball became a mainstream success.This anime covers the first...27 chapters of the manga, and then adds on an anime exclusive ending. These chapters essentially serve as an introduction to the world of Kakegurui, establishing the characters and the rules that the world follows. It’s really just setup for the much more interesting second arc, though considering the events of the new ending, I wouldn’t hold my breath for a second season.In gambling, there are always two games going on. There’s the game that the characters are playing on the table, but there’s also all of the mind games and cheating that are going on surrounding it. Pretty much all of the games played in Kakegurui are original, though simple and straightforward enough that the audience can quickly understand them. On the other hand, some of the tricks employed are poorly explained, which can be frustrating. But despite the occasional misstep, the gambles generally succeed in remaining tense throughout.In general, the cast of Kakegurui are terrible. And by that, I don’t mean that they’re terrible characters, but that they’re terrible people. They’re manipulative and sadistic, and with few redeeming traits. But while their actions are regularly cartoonishly evil, there is actually a bit of humanity behind them. For example, there’s a scene in episode eight where one of the villains talks about her ambitions of becoming an actress, and while it in no way justifies any of her behavior, it begins to make her understandable. This pays off when once-villains return as allies, which happens twice in the territory covered by the anime, and a lot more in the next arc. These are easily my favorite games in the series, because Yumeko isn’t actually a very interesting gambler. She can fix dice rolls and memorize things to an insane degree; she’s too good for there ever to be any worry of her losing, and she lacks motivations that the viewer can get behind. Luckily, the show seems to understand this, and often adopts the perspective of her opponents, which keeps tensions high.But while I may not particularly like Yumeko, her portrayal by Hayami Saori is easily the highlight of the series. She seamlessly transitions between ladylike calm, playful teasing, and manic edge, and I could not imagine any other seiyu being as perfect a fit for the character. Besides that, the rest of the cast also delivers nicely, but Yumeko is a step above. In regards to the music, it does an excellent job of setting the mood, both through its fantastic opening and the almost constant jazzy background music, and the only place it really stumbles is in the ending theme, which falls behind the standard set by the rest of the soundtrack.There’s been a lot of praise given to this anime for its faithfulness in recreating the wild facial expressions from the manga, and I’m not sure that I agree. These faces worked great as single frames, but when they need to be put into motion, they lose the sharpness that made them so iconic. In addition, by focusing so much on faces, other details can suffer. In particular, hands are regularly animated with 3dcg, which is really off-putting once you begin to notice it. But credit where it's due, the opening theme, directed by Yamamoto Sayo, is a real spectacle. Kakegurui is always visually ambitious, and when it works, it can be fantastic, but more often than not, it’s more than Studio MAPPA can handle.In the end, Kakegurui has its faults, but it has also demonstrated that it’s possible to make a gambling adaptation work. I would love to see more gambling shows in the future, and hopefully Kakegurui's success will pave the road for that to happen. 27 chapters of the manga, and then adds on an anime exclusive ending.

But, it will be interesting if we just watch ^^Then, why this series become interesting?Gambling? It\'s not just like that. It\'s satisfaction. When you play with your destiny, it will be fun because your nervousity become maximum.Why did they do that? Because in Hyakkaou private academy, it becomes culture. With so many students are successor of the company, it won\'t be that difficult to play with million yens.There are many cute girls like black haired Jabami Yumeko, but...becareful, once they\'re in game, their face will extremely change.Opening song is very nice i guess. Since Tia will make you imagine if you\'re in Kakegurui\'s world.So, in other name Kakegurui mean compulsive gambler. But in this series, I guess ""Madness on school"" are better. becareful, once they\'re in game, their face will extremely change.Opening song is very nice i guess. Since Tia will make you imagine if you\'re in Kakegurui\'s world.So, in other name Kakegurui mean compulsive gambler. But in this series, I guess ""Madness on school"" are better.', 'A word of caution before getting into this review: There will be minor spoilers.I thought that overall, Kakegurui was pretty damn fun and enjoyable. 6 may seem like a bad score, but I think it\'s fair. I scored it based on what it says by it, and it means ""Fine"". Perfectly how I would describe this when I look at this as objectively as possible in my review, and not out of pure enjoyment (else it\'d be a 7 or 8, to be honest). Now with that out of the way, into the review.CHARACTERSLet\'s start out with the characters. The majority of...the notable characters are female. I find this rather unique in a gambling anime since this very rarely happens. The majority of characters also show a crazy side, most of them being female since, as I\'ve said before, most of the notable characters are female. While this isn\'t anything new, it\'s understandable since this is gambling themed and gambling can make people go nuts, and this sort of side can add to the excitement or fun of the series, it can also understandably get either dull or ridiculous at times, more likely than not being ridiculous since it often displays most of the characters\' crazy side in an exaggerated fashion. There\'s also one who is just insane all-around, which is the one with the eye-patch, as you probably already would have expected when judging sorely on her appearance in the opening. With how she is, I sometimes wonder to myself why she is even allowed to attend the school. Even when this trait often comes in with the characters, there\'s quite a good number of characters who either have character development or depth. This even includes Ryouta Suzui, the male main character and one of the most ""normal"" notable characters of the series. Despite the fact that he mostly sits around and watch the games that the main character (Yumeko) participates in while asking and answering questions, even he will gain bits of a type of character development over the course of the series.However, there is one thing I noticed about the characters, and that all you pretty much ever see are teenagers. Not really any adults. That\'s not to say that there aren\'t any in the series, because there are, but with the exception of the one and only teacher you\'ll ever see that appeared for a very short time and practically the only time in the very first episode, the few that appear in flashbacks, and a few of them talking a little bit to a character in one episode,  there\'s practically no adults shown to be present. I find this very weird. Who is running the school? Is that person or are those group of people running it indirectly? If they are, do they even care much as to what is going on around the school, like what the student council president making such a system for every student in it to follow? We never know these answers.Now let\'s move onto the main character, Yumeko. She is your typical character in gambling series that is very good or intelligent that rarely loses. In fact, Yumeko is the usual ""mysterious transfer student that is surprising good at what is essential to this series"" general trope. She\'s also the usual crazy girl trope when it comes to gambling, having traits like being aroused in a few of them. So you can see that she\'s quite the typical character in numerous ways. Despite being crazy in gambles, she has likable qualities, the main thing being that she\'s very kind and actually cares about her friends. There are quite a number of things that I find about her that is more unique or enjoyable to me as the main character. One thing is the fact that she doesn\'t mainly gamble for the sake of others, because if she did, she would have aimed to defeat the student council in order to stop the sort of corrupted system and to put an end to the corrupted student council. As it usually goes with mysterious main characters, you will learn more about Yumeko as the series progresses and understand even more about her character. The series will unwrap more and more about her personality, which is what the ending theme of this series symbolizes. You will learn things like how she enjoys both herself and her opponent feeling the same pain while both having the chances of winning or losing, and since she likes to risk as much as she could, she\'ll make sure that her opponent does the same, which would bring great worry to them. The way she feels and witnesses pain in the gambles is full of pleasure. Pretty much a type of hedonist, in short. With these types of numerous aspects of her character, you will understand why many other characters who has a crazy side and are in such a crazy environment will even deem her as being insane, which includes the one who is pretty much completely insane all-around.However, you will only learn the mysteries of her personality. You will not learn much when it comes to her background. It\'ll unravel a little bit of it at one point in the series, but nothing more than that, and it doesn\'t look like we\'ll be able to get anymore than that in the anime series due to how the series ends with it\'s own, anime-original ending (so it looks like there won\'t be a second season, though I could be wrong on this). You\'ll have to go through the original source of it all, the manga of this series (which is still on-going by the time I\'ve made this review) if you want to possibly know more about her background.STORY AND SETTINGNext, I talk about the story and setting. The story is simple to follow and know what is going on. Nothing really complicated. The premise, the general setting\'s rules and what they need to do in order to survive around the school, and even the games themselves are easy to follow. As the anime progresses, you will learn more and more about the school and some things behind the main character. The pacing, for the most part, is also fine. The roller coaster keeps on going nonstop without anything feeling slow-paced, and, for most of what is going on, not rushed at all. Surprisingly, even though this series is filled with pretty looking high-school girls, there\'s not that much fanservice, or at least anything as strong as the ones in the opening and ending. That\'s pretty much the most you\'ll get when it comes to fanservice. There\'s quite a number of teases, and there are a few scenes like bouncing boobs and boob grabs, but they are very minor in numbers. In fact, as far as I remember, the manga of this has a lot more fanservice than this adaption of it.Despite all of this however, when you think about it, the story is pretty basic and average. Not really much special, even though there are some nice twists here and there, this in a gambling high school, and the main character doesn\'t gamble for justice. The usual mysterious transfer student who turns out to be good at what is essential to the series is gambling and defeating anyone standing in the main character\'s way while aiming to challenge the big-bad is what you can pretty much say about what is going on the whole time. There\'s also the fact that the setting is literally only in high school. There is almost nowhere else they go. Nearly everything that happens in this series happens only at that exact same school. So if you\'re expecting them to go literally anywhere else outside of the school grounds even a decent amount of times, then you\'ll be disappointed. In fact, you would very rarely even see them even going outside of school. You will never see any of the characters\' homes. It\'s pretty weird, as if it wasn\'t weird enough that you don\'t really see any adults.The tone of the series is quite dark, but not that serious, to be honest. It is marked as a drama series and definitely does have some serious moments, along with very dangerous and risky elements, but still not that serious overall. I would say that despite how dark it clearly is, it mainly portrays itself as being lively and fun, so if you are expecting this to be something pretty serious, you might be disappointed.As an adaption of the manga, it has done pretty well for the most part. It has been extremely faithful to the manga while doing a few things in it\'s own styles, although they did skip a notable amount of things, and the final episode went into it\'s own original direction to end things instead of continuing to being faithful to the manga, which is odd when this suddenly happened. To be honest, I find the way it decided to end things in the final episode to be disappointing, and that it just gave me even more of a feeling that this really should have had a couple more episodes in order to adapt the next event that would have been a worthy stopping point to the series in my opinion.GAMESI would now like to talk about the games. Pretty much all of them are simplistic, straightforward, and pretty much basic plays. This also includes most of the strategies being used. You\'ll probably quickly understand what\'s going on throughout. While these aren\'t necessarily bad things since there\'s actually not really anything wrong with the gambles themselves, apparently it makes certain others want more from the games, if not much more since it doesn\'t help that, much like other gambling anime/manga series, the pattern of how the games basically go as are pretty similar (and it\'s in a basic shounen way), the outcomes of the overall games are mostly very predictable, and that this series focuses a lot on cheaters. Despite all of this, I find that the games can still be enjoyable. Why? The characters themselves and how they exaggeratedly bring out their various emotions and personalities in the different situations of whatever games with the great or ridiculous looking art. This is probably the main aspects in what makes it fun for me to watch through. Seeing the ridiculous reactions from the characters never really gets old for me, but if you\'re expecting depth in the games from this series, then this will disappoint you.ART AND ANIMATIONSNow for the art and animations. I think MAPPA did pretty good in the art department. They make the cards and poker pieces look very well done at times, and there is a lot of impressive visual moments and effects in this series. While the character designs themselves mostly look pretty standard, the amount of details they put on certain aspects of the close-up faces impressive to me. This especially goes for their eyes. Not often do I see such beautiful looking eyes nearly everywhere in an anime series, with some of them having nice-looking visual effects. They also added little extra details on different parts on the faces at times, most noticeably on the insane faces, such as bits of wrinkles on the lips and making the nose drawn to look a bit more realistic. This is helpful for the type of faces since it helps give you that ridiculous, shocked, or cringing feeling to the viewers like most were purposely made and presented to be as, and it can even help add into the excitement and feeling of whatever is going on, but the insane faces are understandably not for everyone. Due to the amount of details they often put on them, they can look over-the-top, even when ti comes to  anime usually making things over-the-top. There have been a few to some faces that look absolutely hilarious to me, and I unfortunately mean that in a bad way since I\'m not talking about the ridiculous ones that were clearly made purposely to look funny, which are also hilarious looking. As for the animations, they\'re mostly standard and decent, but there have been a fair number of very good ones. The opening itself is just filled with great animations.SOUND AND VOICE ACTINGLast I will talk about is the music and voice acting. Starting with the opening and ending, it\'s honestly a couple of my most favorite songs of the whole season. They\'re very good and I find them perfectly emphasizing how energetic and upbeat the anime portrays itself as despite how dangerous and dark it is. The opening will take a bit of getting used to, but still great and very stylish. As for the overall soundtrack of the series, I would say it\'s decent to above average. There\'s a few weird and questionable tunes, but overall everything else has either been fine or enjoyable, and they fit well in the situations present. The crazier tunes help add to the fun and insanity of the situations the type of songs it\'s used in. There\'s not really much to comment on the voice acting to me, but I think they did fine. I think Saori did very well as the main character, Yumeko.And on that note, I think that wraps up the review. If I would have to score and summarize each aspect I\'ve talked about,Characters - 7/10. A lot of the characters are your typical anime characters, but a good number of notable characters have depth or character development.Story and Setting - 5/10. Not really anything special when you think about it, and nearly everything only happens in the school. Not to mention with the way they\'ve ended it at the final episode is pretty disappointing.Games - 5/10. Not really bad since it didn\'t do anything wrong, but will probably leave you wanting more from them.Art and animations - 6.5/10. Great details and sometimes visual effects on numerous things such as the items and certain parts of the faces, especially the eyes, but the insane looking ones are a major hit-or-miss.Sound and voice acting - 7/10. Fantastic opening and endings with a lot of decent to enjoyable tunes in the overall background music, but there are a few questionable or weird tunes. The voice acting is fine to me.Overall - 6/10. A very stylish and lively series overall, but it could leave much to be desired, since it\'s pretty basic when you think about it. As long as you don\'t expect too much or have very high standards, then I think you\'ll be fine. I highly suggest watching through the PVs first in order to know what you\'ll pretty much be getting into throughout if you\'re still interested. the notable characters are female. I find this rather unique in a gambling anime since this very rarely happens. The majority of characters also show a crazy side, most of them being female since, as I\'ve said before, most of the notable characters are female. While this isn\'t anything new, it\'s understandable since this is gambling themed and gambling can make people go nuts, and this sort of side can add to the excitement or fun of the series, it can also understandably get either dull or ridiculous at times, more likely than not being ridiculous since it often displays most of the characters\' crazy side in an exaggerated fashion. There\'s also one who is just insane all-around, which is the one with the eye-patch, as you probably already would have expected when judging sorely on her appearance in the opening. With how she is, I sometimes wonder to myself why she is even allowed to attend the school. Even when this trait often comes in with the characters, there\'s quite a good number of characters who either have character development or depth. This even includes Ryouta Suzui, the male main character and one of the most ""normal"" notable characters of the series. Despite the fact that he mostly sits around and watch the games that the main character (Yumeko) participates in while asking and answering questions, even he will gain bits of a type of character development over the course of the series.However, there is one thing I noticed about the characters, and that all you pretty much ever see are teenagers. Not really any adults. That\'s not to say that there aren\'t any in the series, because there are, but with the exception of the one and only teacher you\'ll ever see that appeared for a very short time and practically the only time in the very first episode, the few that appear in flashbacks, and a few of them talking a little bit to a character in one episode,  there\'s practically no adults shown to be present. I find this very weird. Who is running the school? Is that person or are those group of people running it indirectly? If they are, do they even care much as to what is going on around the school, like what the student council president making such a system for every student in it to follow? We never know these answers.Now let\'s move onto the main character, Yumeko. She is your typical character in gambling series that is very good or intelligent that rarely loses. In fact, Yumeko is the usual ""mysterious transfer student that is surprising good at what is essential to this series"" general trope. She\'s also the usual crazy girl trope when it comes to gambling, having traits like being aroused in a few of them. So you can see that she\'s quite the typical character in numerous ways. Despite being crazy in gambles, she has likable qualities, the main thing being that she\'s very kind and actually cares about her friends. There are quite a number of things that I find about her that is more unique or enjoyable to me as the main character. One thing is the fact that she doesn\'t mainly gamble for the sake of others, because if she did, she would have aimed to defeat the student council in order to stop the sort of corrupted system and to put an end to the corrupted student council. As it usually goes with mysterious main characters, you will learn more about Yumeko as the series progresses and understand even more about her character. The series will unwrap more and more about her personality, which is what the ending theme of this series symbolizes. You will learn things like how she enjoys both herself and her opponent feeling the same pain while both having the chances of winning or losing, and since she likes to risk as much as she could, she\'ll make sure that her opponent does the same, which would bring great worry to them. The way she feels and witnesses pain in the gambles is full of pleasure. Pretty much a type of hedonist, in short. With these types of numerous aspects of her character, you will understand why many other characters who has a crazy side and are in such a crazy environment will even deem her as being insane, which includes the one who is pretty much completely insane all-around.However, you will only learn the mysteries of her personality. You will not learn much when it comes to her background. It\'ll unravel a little bit of it at one point in the series, but nothing more than that, and it doesn\'t look like we\'ll be able to get anymore than that in the anime series due to how the series ends with it\'s own, anime-original ending (so it looks like there won\'t be a second season, though I could be wrong on this). You\'ll have to go through the original source of it all, the manga of this series (which is still on-going by the time I\'ve made this review) if you want to possibly know more about her background.STORY AND SETTINGNext, I talk about the story and setting. The story is simple to follow and know what is going on. Nothing really complicated. The premise, the general setting\'s rules and what they need to do in order to survive around the school, and even the games themselves are easy to follow. As the anime progresses, you will learn more and more about the school and some things behind the main character. The pacing, for the most part, is also fine. The roller coaster keeps on going nonstop without anything feeling slow-paced, and, for most of what is going on, not rushed at all. Surprisingly, even though this series is filled with pretty looking high-school girls, there\'s not that much fanservice, or at least anything as strong as the ones in the opening and ending. That\'s pretty much the most you\'ll get when it comes to fanservice. There\'s quite a number of teases, and there are a few scenes like bouncing boobs and boob grabs, but they are very minor in numbers. In fact, as far as I remember, the manga of this has a lot more fanservice than this adaption of it.Despite all of this however, when you think about it, the story is pretty basic and average. Not really much special, even though there are some nice twists here and there, this in a gambling high school, and the main character doesn\'t gamble for justice. The usual mysterious transfer student who turns out to be good at what is essential to the series is gambling and defeating anyone standing in the main character\'s way while aiming to challenge the big-bad is what you can pretty much say about what is going on the whole time. There\'s also the fact that the setting is literally only in high school. There is almost nowhere else they go. Nearly everything that happens in this series happens only at that exact same school. So if you\'re expecting them to go literally anywhere else outside of the school grounds even a decent amount of times, then you\'ll be disappointed. In fact, you would very rarely even see them even going outside of school. You will never see any of the characters\' homes. It\'s pretty weird, as if it wasn\'t weird enough that you don\'t really see any adults.The tone of the series is quite dark, but not that serious, to be honest. It is marked as a drama series and definitely does have some serious moments, along with very dangerous and risky elements, but still not that serious overall. I would say that despite how dark it clearly is, it mainly portrays itself as being lively and fun, so if you are expecting this to be something pretty serious, you might be disappointed.As an adaption of the manga, it has done pretty well for the most part. It has been extremely faithful to the manga while doing a few things in it\'s own styles, although they did skip a notable amount of things, and the final episode went into it\'s own original direction to end things instead of continuing to being faithful to the manga, which is odd when this suddenly happened. To be honest, I find the way it decided to end things in the final episode to be disappointing, and that it just gave me even more of a feeling that this really should have had a couple more episodes in order to adapt the next event that would have been a worthy stopping point to the series in my opinion.GAMESI would now like to talk about the games.

Cards, gathered up in one quick swoop, become the weapons of this match, as each fighter tries to gather their wits under the intense stress and tension at play. Pulse quickens, the heart accelerates, at the sight of their weapons, as each fighter stares at their enemy in silent anticipation, awaiting any indication into the contents of their hand. As time passes the air grows all the more incredibly heavy and thick, sweat adorning both of these brave warriors, as, suddenly, the signal to throw down their cards to determine the victor is called. Who...will receive Lady Luck\'s blessing this time?Gambling! High octane stakes and tension! Narratives surrounding the use of gambling are supposed to be exciting, tense, give us a sense of utmost euphoria, and, most of all, be entertaining  as hell! Kaiji is a series that excels in this department, and, while I haven\'t seen every episode of the show yet, the first eight episodes that I have seen have been everything I look for in a gambling-centric narrative. The stakes are high, being that each game involves the consequence of death if someone were to lose, it\'s easy to care for our main character after the huge debt that has been left to him and each game is insanely interesting since it becomes a huge psychological battle with players trying to deceive and outwit each with other, with the great animation and soundtrack enhancing each element. Watching the show is essentially like having one giant adrenaline rush, which makes you want to keep watching episode after episode, which is a sign of well-crafted and written thriller around the use gambling. However, Kakegurui (or, if you prefer, Bukkakegurui, which is what I\'ll be referring to the show as for the rest of the review) is one of the most downright boring shows I\'ve ever had the displeasure of watching, despite having similar ideas and premise to that of Kaiji. But, why is that? Why does Kaiji succeed where Bukkakegurui does not? Well, let\'s find out! Let\'s grab a chair, bet some insane amount of money, and remember to have about twenty orgasms as we play, since gambling, for some reason, gets us completely wet!Bukkakegurui\'s narrative is set inside a prestigious academy which is a tad bit different than conventional schools. While, during the day the school adopts the typical lessons that any student from any school undergoes, at night the school becomes a gambling den, where those who are seeking power and money go to gamble. The series sees our protagonist, Yumeko, an obsessive and insane gambler who experiences an orgasm every time she plays, gamble her way through the student council until the climatic game with the student council president at the very end of the series. In terms of narrative structure, the series is incredibly linear and straightforward, and adopts a ""monster of the week formula"", whereby Yumeko will play off against a new member of the student council of increasing difficulty before coming to the big finale. This structure of storytelling is not inherently bad, and since the focus of the show, and the appeal is based around the games itself, I don\'t mind the narrative being rather simple. However, there is one problem I have with this formulaic structure, and that is, that Yumeko never grows or learns throughout the duration of the series or in her matches. She never acquires any new tactics or skills during the games that could be applied in later scenarios, and she wins more so because the script tells her to win rather than putting any actual effort into her character winning through clever manipulation, strategy, or anything else that would be remotely interesting. For the sake of argument, let\'s compare Bukkakegurui to the 1995 series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, which also adopted a ""monster of the week"" formula for much of its duration. The reason why Evangelion succeeds is because during every Angel encounter and fight in the series, we are learning as an audience, both about the nature of the world, and of the characters, in their mental state and emotions. Shinji, Rei and Askua grow, not only in their physical abilities against the Angels, but also as people as well, as they begin to grow to like themselves as the series progresses, and work together as a team. By doing so, it grounds the characters in a more realistic way, and makes them feel far more like actual people, which Yumeko fails at completely, as she is more akin to an over powered Mary Sue who wins just because. While her personality suggests that she gambles so much for the thrill and excitement it brings, which is a fine motivation for her character, it also makes her feel rather boring and one dimensional as we never learn anything about her beyond what is presented at surface level. While there is a mini flashback that suggests that Yumeko is gambling in order to raise money for her sister\'s operation, or something along those lines, we\'re never given any more information regarding that aspect, and this idea should have been introduced at the very start of the show, to give Yumeko\'s matches some actual emotional weight and narrative stakes, but they didn\'t do that so each match feels incredibly inconsequential.  Speaking of narrative stakes, let\'s dive into that next!In Bukkakegurui, the school is divided into sub sections dependent on how much money you have, with those losing money and being in debt at the bottom, being treated as house pets, while those with money get to rule at the top. If, at some point, you get into enough debt while at the school, the student council will write you out a life plan which determines every element in your life in the future, all planned out for you, from who you will marry, how many children you will bear, among other things. So, there are elements that are at stake here, such as your entire life being ruined forever by this life plan or crippling debt, but the stakes presented in the matches don\'t work because the characters are all completely one dimensional and it\'s hard to care for anyone at all. Who cares if Yumeko becomes a house pet or gets a life plan written up for her, when she\'ll pay back her debts anyway through her gambling? Who cares that someone like Meari ends up with a life plan when she has been nothing but a horrible bitch throughout the show and gets what she deserves? WHO CARES? It\'s one thing to have narrative stakes, but another thing to have characters who we care about having those stakes inflicted upon them.In order to better convey what I mean, imagine a scenario in which I have two rocks. The first rock, rock A, represents the characters presented in Bukkakegurui; they\'re all horribly one dimensional, lack personality and are hard to care for in the slightest. We don\'t learn anything about them as actual people, despite the fact that they\'re all hungry for power or vast amounts of wealth, nor do we feel any connection to them on any personal level since there is no time devoted for fleshing them out. The other rock, Rock B, represents a character that we have had time to care for. They\'re here not, because they find thrill for gambling, but because they have no other choice. Perhaps they have a large debt to pay off, or have to gamble for money for an operation to save a love one or something, but what\'s important is that we learn about this character in order to feel some kind of connection, and the fact that they\'re an underdog will make the audience root for them more, and will make the games more exciting as the character will have to come up with new strategies constantly, driving more investment in the narrative. The audience should experience the world through this character\'s eyes, so not only do we become more attached to them as an actual person but also so that we can see how they grow and think. Now, with both rocks categorised, let\'s say I bring in a sledgehammer, thus introducing the concept of death and smash them both. Now, which rock do you care for? Obviously the rock with more of a personality, back-story, and have had time to care for. And this is why I find no excitement whilst watching the show and why I don\'t care about anything that is happening.Now, people may argue against me by suggesting I am taking the anime too seriously and should just shut my brain off and enjoy the series as a rule of cool, dumb show, since there are plenty of pretty silly elements, and the games in the anime are the reason why I should be watching it since that is the main appeal of the show. Now, this isn\'t necessarily a bad stance to take, and I want to clarify now that I don\'t begrudge anyone who has actually managed to derive entertainment from this show, but I can\'t see the show in this light since I found most of the elements to pretty boring, especially all the games, which, for a show that is focused completely around this idea, is a pretty bad sign on the quality of the work!Each game in Bukkakegurui is boring, lifeless and we don\'t learn anything during the match about either participant involved, other than, sometimes, very short back stories consisting of only thirty seconds or so. Most of the games are essentially just Yumeko winning by either complete luck, or figuring out how her opponent is cheating in some way and the way she determines this and discovers how they are doing so feels so contrived and stupid that I want to slam my face into a wall. Now, luck is a HUGE aspect of gambling, so therefore her wins through luck are not necessarily that bad (even though it really pushes it in plenty of places) but there\'s no attempt at creating anything interesting. Aside from the games being incredibly simple anyway, there is no psychological battles taking part, none of the characters are attempting to outwit one another and there is hardly anything present that made Kaiji\'s games interesting. You never really get that cathartic feeling when you witness an intense match go on for ages when a character outsmarts another in some creative way as you say to yourself, ""Ah! How clever!"" The few times they do try and throw a curveball into the games or when Yumeko tries to outwit her opponent it feel so weak and dry since the in-the-moment logic is incredibly shallow and the way the story tries to awkwardly implement in these elements is so insulting to the intelligence of the audience as the show thinks that by throwing some random curveball at the final moment is a plot-twist or a smart way to deceive the audience since they didn\'t see it coming, because it appeared out of thin air. The only time the anime ever comes close to being somewhat entertaining during a match is in episodes six and seven where Yumeko gambles against someone who, believe it or not, is even more insane than she is, by the name of Midari Ikishima, a girl who finds pleasure in harming herself through the use of gambling. During her match with Yumeko, they both decide to play Russian roulette, which raises the narrative stakes and tension since it introduces the consequence of death into the game, although it is hard to care for anything that is going on, because, as I\'ve said, the characters are dry and boring, and also because it\'s pretty obvious that nobody will actually die during the match anyway, but still the scene comes the closest out of any to actually entertain me, and, even then, the scene is still incredibly weak.The characters, as I\'ve previously mentioned, are all incredibly hard to care for, and are pretty much all absolutely insane! Most of the characters take the utmost pleasure in laughing hysterically at their enemies, smiling and looking down upon them during a game if it is going in their favour, which makes everyone feel like an unlikeable, one dimensional asshole. The show often utilises cheap victimisation in a pathetic attempt to manipulate us into feeling sorry for these cardboard cut-outs, and nowhere is this more evident than in episode nine, where, a student council member who also happens to be an idol with a huge following, has her secret revealed to all of them, in which, recorded on a tape, she proclaims that she finds all of her fans to be absolutely disgusting and she hates the fact that she has to even shake their hands since it makes her puke. Despite that already sounding incredibly horrible anyway, she as a person is a complete and utter twat, with no redeemable qualities, hiding behind the facade of being a wonderful idol. During the episode, when the secret is revealed, she breaks down crying, as she comes to the realization that her dream is now ruined. I expect that the creators of the show wanted the audience to sympathise with her, but how can we when she is such a horrible twat who got everything she deserved? And, if that\'s not already bad enough, the audience gets a direct kick to the nuts straight after when all of her fans forgive her! That\'s right! If you\'re a horrible person with no likeable traits who gets what they deserve, all is forgiven if you simply have a dream you want to uphold!I could go on more and more about each one of the other characters, but at that point I\'d be beating a dead horse since they all suffer from the exact same problems I\'ve talked about before. Perhaps the only character who doesn\'t fit into this mould is one of our main protagonists, who offers so little to the narrative that you could omit him from the plot entirely and it wouldn\'t make a single difference! Now THAT\'S a good main character! I suppose his main purpose is to act as the voice of reason and rationality in the story since he is the only sane character, and the one the audience can relate to the most, but if that\'s what they were attempting to do with his character, then they failed horribly since I honestly forget this guy is even here half the time. They try and make it out that he and Yumeko have this deep friendship, since she helped him recover from his debt in the beginning of the series, but their relationship feels superficial, as if the only reason they\'re even friends in the first place is just because the script dictates as such. His main purpose in the show is to deliver random expository dialogue and that\'s pretty much it.If there\'s one thing that Bukkakegurui gets right, then that\'s in the animation and art department. The show is very visually appealing, with pretty attractive and striking character designs, that blend well with the rather unique school uniform designs too. Not only that, but the show has plenty of super detailed close-up shots of character\'s faces to convey, not only the insanity of each one, but to also represent the sexual euphoria each character attains whilst in the games, and Bukkakegurui does a good job in that area. It\'s clear that the animators put a lot of work into making the show as visually interesting as they possibly could, but it\'s not without its inconsistencies however. CGI is sometimes used during close-up shots of the player\'s hands when dealing with cards, and it not only looks terrible, but is so jarring as well. Luckily CGI isn\'t used all too much aside from this one instance for some odd reason, so I can let it slide for the most part. The music is overall fine, and pretty forgettable, mostly consisting of free-from jazz that is way too suave and sophisticated for a show at this level of trashiness. The opening and ending tracks however are both damn great! The opening especially I love, with its use of stylish visuals and fantastic music, which almost tricks you into thinking that the actual show will carry the same energy and charisma. The voice actors as well all do a pretty stellar job in their respective roles, perfectly capturing the voice of someone who is insane!In conclusion, Bukkakegurui was a massive disappointment, and I think that\'s what makes the show ultimately more aggravating for me. While I dislike using the word to describe anything, I feel it is pretty appropriate when talking about this one, and that word is cringey! The show reeks of desperation, and tries way too hard to be edgy, and ends up just being embarrassing instead since many of the scenarios presented in the show, such as a scene in which Yumeko acts like a cat on all fours, feel as if they were written by a twelve-year-old. It fails as an intense thriller, it fails as a character study, it fails as a gambling show, but most importantly it fails at the most basic level to achieve any emotional connection with the audience. Bukkakegurui is a show more interested in over blown theatrics than it is in characters and the actual games itself, and the reason why this show is so bad. I can\'t even recommend this to be people on the grounds that it is ""so bad that it\'s good"". Just watch Kaiji instead...Bukkakegurui is a word trademarked by the great NFMaster! All credit goes to that sexy bastard! will receive Lady Luck\'s blessing this time?Gambling! High octane stakes and tension! Narratives surrounding the use of gambling are supposed to be exciting, tense, give us a sense of utmost euphoria, and, most of all, be entertaining  as hell! Kaiji is a series that excels in this department, and, while I haven\'t seen every episode of the show yet, the first eight episodes that I have seen have been everything I look for in a gambling-centric narrative. The stakes are high, being that each game involves the consequence of death if someone were to lose, it\'s easy to care for our main character after the huge debt that has been left to him and each game is insanely interesting since it becomes a huge psychological battle with players trying to deceive and outwit each with other, with the great animation and soundtrack enhancing each element. Watching the show is essentially like having one giant adrenaline rush, which makes you want to keep watching episode after episode, which is a sign of well-crafted and written thriller around the use gambling. However, Kakegurui (or, if you prefer, Bukkakegurui, which is what I\'ll be referring to the show as for the rest of the review) is one of the most downright boring shows I\'ve ever had the displeasure of watching, despite having similar ideas and premise to that of Kaiji. But, why is that? Why does Kaiji succeed where Bukkakegurui does not? Well, let\'s find out! Let\'s grab a chair, bet some insane amount of money, and remember to have about twenty orgasms as we play, since gambling, for some reason, gets us completely wet!Bukkakegurui\'s narrative is set inside a prestigious academy which is a tad bit different than conventional schools. While, during the day the school adopts the typical lessons that any student from any school undergoes, at night the school becomes a gambling den, where those who are seeking power and money go to gamble. The series sees our protagonist, Yumeko, an obsessive and insane gambler who experiences an orgasm every time she plays, gamble her way through the student council until the climatic game with the student council president at the very end of the series. In terms of narrative structure, the series is incredibly linear and straightforward, and adopts a ""monster of the week formula"", whereby Yumeko will play off against a new member of the student council of increasing difficulty before coming to the big finale. This structure of storytelling is not inherently bad, and since the focus of the show, and the appeal is based around the games itself, I don\'t mind the narrative being rather simple. However, there is one problem I have with this formulaic structure, and that is, that Yumeko never grows or learns throughout the duration of the series or in her matches. She never acquires any new tactics or skills during the games that could be applied in later scenarios, and she wins more so because the script tells her to win rather than putting any actual effort into her character winning through clever manipulation, strategy, or anything else that would be remotely interesting. For the sake of argument, let\'s compare Bukkakegurui to the 1995 series, Neon Genesis Evangelion, which also adopted a ""monster of the week"" formula for much of its duration. The reason why Evangelion succeeds is because during every Angel encounter and fight in the series, we are learning as an audience, both about the nature of the world, and of the characters, in their mental state and emotions. Shinji, Rei and Askua grow, not only in their physical abilities against the Angels, but also as people as well, as they begin to grow to like themselves as the series progresses, and work together as a team. By doing so, it grounds the characters in a more realistic way, and makes them feel far more like actual people, which Yumeko fails at completely, as she is more akin to an over powered Mary Sue who wins just because. While her personality suggests that she gambles so much for the thrill and excitement it brings, which is a fine motivation for her character, it also makes her feel rather boring and one dimensional as we never learn anything about her beyond what is presented at surface level. While there is a mini flashback that suggests that Yumeko is gambling in order to raise money for her sister\'s operation, or something along those lines, we\'re never given any more information regarding that aspect, and this idea should have been introduced at the very start of the show, to give Yumeko\'s matches some actual emotional weight and narrative stakes, but they didn\'t do that so each match feels incredibly inconsequential.  Speaking of narrative stakes, let\'s dive into that next!In Bukkakegurui, the school is divided into sub sections dependent on how much money you have, with those losing money and being in debt at the bottom, being treated as house pets, while those with money get to rule at the top. If, at some point, you get into enough debt while at the school, the student council will write you out a life plan which determines every element in your life in the future, all planned out for you, from who you will marry, how many children you will bear, among other things. So, there are elements that are at stake here, such as your entire life being ruined forever by this life plan or crippling debt, but the stakes presented in the matches don\'t work because the characters are all completely one dimensional and it\'s hard to care for anyone at all. Who cares if Yumeko becomes a house pet or gets a life plan written up for her, when she\'ll pay back her debts anyway through her gambling? Who cares that someone like Meari ends up with a life plan when she has been nothing but a horrible bitch throughout the show and gets what she deserves? WHO CARES? It\'s one thing to have narrative stakes, but another thing to have characters who we care about having those stakes inflicted upon them.In order to better convey what I mean, imagine a scenario in which I have two rocks. The first rock, rock A, represents the characters presented in Bukkakegurui; they\'re all horribly one dimensional, lack personality and are hard to care for in the slightest. We don\'t learn anything about them as actual people, despite the fact that they\'re all hungry for power or vast amounts of wealth, nor do we feel any connection to them on any personal level since there is no time devoted for fleshing them out. The other rock, Rock B, represents a character that we have had time to care for. They\'re here not, because they find thrill for gambling, but because they have no other choice. Perhaps they have a large debt to pay off, or have to gamble for money for an operation to save a love one or something, but what\'s important is that we learn about this character in order to feel some kind of connection, and the fact that they\'re an underdog will make the audience root for them more, and will make the games more exciting as the character will have to come up with new strategies constantly, driving more investment in the narrative. The audience should experience the world through this character\'s eyes, so not only do we become more attached to them as an actual person but also so that we can see how they grow and think. Now, with both rocks categorised, let\'s say I bring in a sledgehammer, thus introducing the concept of death and smash them both. Now, which rock do you care for? Obviously the rock with more of a personality, back-story, and have had time to care for. And this is why I find no excitement whilst watching the show and why I don\'t care about anything that is happening.Now, people may argue against me by suggesting I am taking the anime too seriously and should just shut my brain off and enjoy the series as a rule of cool, dumb show, since there are plenty of pretty silly elements, and the games in the anime are the reason why I should be watching it since that is the main appeal of the show. Now, this isn\'t necessarily a bad stance to take, and I want to clarify now that I don\'t begrudge anyone who has actually managed to derive entertainment from this show, but I can\'t see the show in this light since I found most of the elements to pretty boring, especially all the games, which, for a show that is focused completely around this idea, is a pretty bad sign on the quality of the work!Each game in Bukkakegurui is boring, lifeless and we don\'t learn anything during the match about either participant involved, other than, sometimes, very short back stories consisting of only thirty seconds or so. Most of the games are essentially just Yumeko winning by either complete luck, or figuring out how her opponent is cheating in some way and the way she determines this and discovers how they are doing so feels so contrived and stupid that I want to slam my face into a wall. Now, luck is a HUGE aspect of gambling, so therefore her wins through luck are not necessarily that bad (even though it really pushes it in plenty of places) but there\'s no attempt at creating anything interesting. Aside from the games being incredibly simple anyway, there is no psychological battles taking part, none of the characters are attempting to outwit one another and there is hardly anything present that made Kaiji\'s games interesting. You never really get that cathartic feeling when you witness an intense match go on for ages when a character outsmarts another in some creative way as you say to yourself, ""Ah! How clever!"" The few times they do try and throw a curveball into the games or when Yumeko tries to outwit her opponent it feel so weak and dry since the in-the-moment logic is incredibly shallow and the way the story tries to awkwardly implement in these elements is so insulting to the intelligence of the audience as the show thinks that by throwing some random curveball at the final moment is a plot-twist or a smart way to deceive the audience since they didn\'t see it coming, because it appeared out of thin air. The only time the anime ever comes close to being somewhat entertaining during a match is in episodes six and seven where Yumeko gambles against someone who, believe it or not, is even more insane than she is, by the name of Midari Ikishima, a girl who finds pleasure in harming herself through the use of gambling. During her match with Yumeko, they both decide to play Russian roulette, which raises the narrative stakes and tension since it introduces the consequence of death into the game, although it is hard to care for anything that is going on, because, as I\'ve said, the characters are dry and boring, and also because it\'s pretty obvious that nobody will actually die during the match anyway, but still the scene comes the closest out of any to actually entertain me, and, even then, the scene is still incredibly weak.The characters, as I\'ve previously mentioned, are all incredibly hard to care for, and are pretty much all absolutely insane! Most of the characters take the utmost pleasure in laughing hysterically at their enemies, smiling and looking down upon them during a game if it is going in their favour, which makes everyone feel like an unlikeable, one dimensional asshole. The show often utilises cheap victimisation in a pathetic attempt to manipulate us into feeling sorry for these cardboard cut-outs, and nowhere is this more evident than in episode nine, where, a student council member who also happens to be an idol with a huge following, has her secret revealed to all of them, in which, recorded on a tape, she proclaims that she finds all of her fans to be absolutely disgusting and she hates the fact that she has to even shake their hands since it makes her puke. Despite that already sounding incredibly horrible anyway, she as a person is a complete and utter twat, with no redeemable qualities, hiding behind the facade of being a wonderful idol. During the episode, when the secret is revealed, she breaks down crying, as she comes to the realization that her dream is now ruined. I expect that the creators of the show wanted the audience to sympathise with her, but how can we when she is such a horrible twat who got everything she deserved? And, if that\'s not already bad enough, the audience gets a direct kick to the nuts straight after when all of her fans forgive her! That\'s right! If you\'re a horrible person with no likeable traits who gets what they deserve, all is forgiven if you simply have a dream you want to uphold!I could go on more and more about each one of the other characters, but at that point I\'d be beating a dead horse since they all suffer from the exact same problems I\'ve talked about before. Perhaps the only character who doesn\'t fit into this mould is one of our main protagonists, who offers so little to the narrative that you could omit him from the plot entirely and it wouldn\'t make a single difference! Now THAT\'S a good main character! I suppose his main purpose is to act as the voice of reason and rationality in the story since he is the only sane character, and the one the audience can relate to the most, but if that\'s what they were attempting to do with his character, then they failed horribly since I honestly forget this guy is even here half the time. They try and make it out that he and Yumeko have this deep friendship, since she helped him recover from his debt in the beginning of the series, but their relationship feels superficial, as if the only reason they\'re even friends in the first place is just because the script dictates as such. His main purpose in the show is to deliver random expository dialogue and that\'s pretty much it.If there\'s one thing that Bukkakegurui gets right, then that\'s in the animation and art department. The show is very visually appealing, with pretty attractive and striking character designs, that blend well with the rather unique school uniform designs too. Not only that, but the show has plenty of super detailed close-up shots of character\'s faces to convey, not only the insanity of each one, but to also represent the sexual euphoria each character attains whilst in the games, and Bukkakegurui does a good job in that area. It\'s clear that the animators put a lot of work into making the show as visually interesting as they possibly could, but it\'s not without its inconsistencies however. CGI is sometimes used during close-up shots of the player\'s hands when dealing with cards, and it not only looks terrible, but is so jarring as well. Luckily CGI isn\'t used all too much aside from this one instance for some odd reason, so I can let it slide for the most part. The music is overall fine, and pretty forgettable, mostly consisting of free-from jazz that is way too suave and sophisticated for a show at this level of trashiness. The opening and ending tracks however are both damn great! The opening especially I love, with its use of stylish visuals and fantastic music, which almost tricks you into thinking that the actual show will carry the same energy and charisma. The voice actors as well all do a pretty stellar job in their respective roles, perfectly capturing the voice of someone who is insane!In conclusion, Bukkakegurui was a massive disappointment, and I think that\'s what makes the show ultimately more aggravating for me. While I dislike using the word to describe anything, I feel it is pretty appropriate when talking about this one, and that word is cringey! The show reeks of desperation, and tries way too hard to be edgy, and ends up just being embarrassing instead since many of the scenarios presented in the show, such as a scene in which Yumeko acts like a cat on all fours, feel as if they were written by a twelve-year-old. It fails as an intense thriller, it fails as a character study, it fails as a gambling show, but most importantly it fails at the most basic level to achieve any emotional connection with the audience. Bukkakegurui is a show more interested in over blown theatrics than it is in characters and the actual games itself, and the reason why this show is so bad. I can\'t even recommend this to be people on the grounds that it is ""so bad that it\'s good"". Just watch Kaiji instead...Bukkakegurui is a word trademarked by the great NFMaster! All credit goes to that sexy bastard!', 'It where two reasons that I started to watch Kakegurui (Compulsive Gambler) this season. The first where that I´m planning to read the manga, and was curious about it. And the second and more important one, is that Kakegurui is produced by studio MAPPA. Which happens to be one of my favourite studios after seen what magic they created with the “Shingeki no Bahamut”-series. Their animation quality is nothing but as close to flawless as you can get, and they do have a brilliant way of bringing forth the specific design of the show they produce – they surely know how to place the effects...for maximum output. And that applies to what they have done with Kakegurui as well. Stunning work indeed.But as we all know, that great animation quality is just a factor to the whole experience of an anime. Other factors such as how the story appeal to us, how it´s narrated, it´s pacing, and how coherent it is, are also very important to us viewers. For not to speak of the characters. They have to intrigue us, make us feel with them, and feel like real life like persons to capture our interests. But you aren´t reading this review for a philosophical discussion of what makes up a great anime, you are reading this because you want to know if Kakegurui is a show for you, and/or maybe to see what opinion I have on it. So, let´s get to the point.Do you like stunning art and animation? Do you find gambling interesting? Do you find an exclusive high school setting with an almighty student council interesting? Do you find slightly insane gamble addicts, that gets off on high stakes games as entertaining characters? Do you find it exciting to watch people outsmart each other in various games, by the means of reading their opponent? Do you find an almost female only cast appealing? And yes, it´s sexual innuendos between many of those said female characters, if you were wondering.If your answer is yes on most of those questions, you will probably love Kakegurui. Because that´s what´s it´s all about. Nothing more, nothing less – it´s very straight forward. But it´s done in a very fluent and fashionable way, Kakegurui oozes of class and quality. Everything from the characters body language, facial expression, to the conversations they have, fills out what otherwise is pretty flat story perfectly. Grinding teeth’s, sweat that trickles down the forehead, insane glowing eyes, and the thought process the gambler has is all details that are nicely highlighted.As mentioned before, the animation quality is excellent, studio MAPPPA have really out done themselves again, in their way of capture the core of the story and characters, and brilliantly bring them to life in their unique style. The psycho faces, cards or dices that are thrown in glee on the table, or the excited eyes of a gambler, they captured it all. The colours are strong and vivid, with a fancy for sinful red.The pacing of the story is very even, not to slow, and not to rushing. And even if Kakegurui has an episodic feeling to it, and that each episode is build up in the same pattern, it feels coherent, and not reparative or to predictable. Because just when you think you figured the whole show out, it does a double take and does something that you weren´t prepared for. But at the same time, it still follows the same episode pattern. Easily put, in each episode the new student Yumeko Jambai, faces new opponents in different games, and works her way towards the top by very conventional means. Our protagonist isn´t gambling for power, money or glory, just for the pure rush of the game. That characteristic makes her a very hard opponent to both read and predict, which she uses to climbs up the schools gambling latter.The voice actors are really doing a great job to portray their characters, so props to the cast. They all feel very well matched, except the vice president, but I guess that´s intentional. And when speaking of sounds, the sound effects are the little extra spice in the Kakegurui stew. The sound of grinding teeth´s, a pulse speeding up, or a sweat drop finding its path down someone’s face to splash on the gamble table, it´s all very effectual and pronounced. It´s gives the scene life and feeling, and combined with the great visuals the result it masterly done.Did I enjoy my time with Kakegurui? Sure, to a certain extent. The story itself isn´t one of my usual cup of tea, with such a narrow story line and lack of personal growth- and interacting of the characters. The choice to only focus on gambling was risky, either that will appeal to you or it won’t. I fall a bit to the second category, I can absolutely appreciate gambling, or competitions as an element in a story, but to have a whole show around it didn´t capture my full interest. Had they combined it with more elements, such as character development and relationships a bit more, the final product would´ve appealed to me much more. But the stunning animation with those little extra sound effects made this a visual feast for me, and the reason that I watched it to the end. The story and its characters I find mildly entertaining, absolutely not boring, just not deep-heart-and-soul-catching, which I highly appreciate in a show.So, to come to some sort of conclusion, I would recommend you to watch Kakegurui purely based on the amazing animation, if not the plot seems like your thing, it´s worth it. But if you indeed find this type of show appealing, then you are in for a treat. for maximum output. And that applies to what they have done with Kakegurui as well.

However, knowing that this is going to be a Netflix show made me pretty frustrated, but I went on to watch the show through other ways.What do I think about Kakegurui? It's very faithful to the original source material. Kudos to MAPPA for getting much of what made the manga great, with the art and character expressions being accurate. Though not as interesting and suspenseful like other gambling anime, the show still keeps it entertaining throughout. Characters add so much emotion to...the anime and basically carry it through predictably boring gambling scenes. This show is great gateway material and its good and exciting enough to hold up as one. Possibly the best OP of the season (and maybe the entire year),  Kakegurui's OP is fantastic. It has so much symbolism and connection to the manga that it contests any JJBA anime openings. BGM isn't really something to write home about, but it does well to build up the tension and atmosphere. The ED might seem like fanservice at first, but there's a sort of hidden symbolism in it, representing the change of Yumeko as a character.If you read the manga, you should definitely watch this. If you're coming in blind, I would recommend reading the manga first and watch it later (which you can actually do, since there's no legal way to watch it with english subs yet), since you won't be able to appreciate much of the what anime is doing right.

RATING WILL MOST LIKELY CHANGE TOWARDS THE END OF THE SHOW.)Having read the manga, it\'s needless to say that I was totally hyped when an anime for Kakegurui was announced to be in the works. I still remember getting so excited for episode 1 that I ended up waiting all night just to watch it. Of course, there were still doubts on the back of my mind. What if this adaptation turns out to be disappointing? But the thing was, I didn\'t even need to worry about that stuff, because this adaptation...didn\'t disappoint me at all.Story - 9This is basically a high school anime in which high school students are required to gamble each other for rank, status, and popularity. If a student finds himself in a huge debt, then it\'s anything but good since those who are in the bottom 100 are to be labelled as ""housepets"", the lowest of the low. This is the situation that one of our main characters, Ryouta Suzui, finds himself after losing in a gamble with another main character, Saotome Mary.It is said that if you find yourself in the housepet position, then it\'s impossible for you to get your status back. Suzui thought so too, that is, until a gambling maniac by the name of Jabami Yumeko suddenly transfers into the school.This anime mainly follows Yumeko as she gets involved in various gambles with a lot of people, with her goal being the cause of the gambling madness: the student council president.The pacing in this anime is good. It\'s not too fast, and it\'s not too slow. In my opinion, it\'s just right.Art - 10I absolutely adore how this is animated. It perfectly captures the atmosphere of certain scenes. For example, the anime is in a normal school life kind of part, the animation is more normal and calm, but when a gamble begins, then the whole feel of the show changes because of the way the animation slightly changes. The whole scene suddenly becomes more tense and gripping. This is most obvious in scenes where Yumeko becomes truly mad in gambling.Also, special mention the OP animation, I think it\'s just gorgeous and sets the tone for the show.Sound - 9I immediately fell in love with the OP and ED when I first heard them both. But I have to say that I like the OP more. How should I describe it, I wonder? Well, Kakegurui [i]is[/i] a show about gambling, and, this OP is, for lack of a better word, jazzy. A perfect match, if I do say so myself.I have no issues with the voice acting. Everything is exactly how I imagined it to be, especially with Yumeko and Mary. Yeah, Yukino, the always calm and collected high school girl from OreGairu, she\'s a gambling maniac now. Feel old yet?Character - 8Now, what I consider to be the weakest aspect of this series is the characters. Yes, all of them are interesting in their own little ways, but I find it difficult to point out characteristics thatmake them unique, and as a result, they\'re quite forgettable. Well, except for Yumeko, I guess. She has the ""going crazy in gambles"" thing going for her, so good for her. However, the other characters aren\'t as memorable. Especially Suzui (who is ironically a main character), he\'s kind of ""just there"" all the time so the viewers have someone to explain what\'s going on to them.Personal Enjoyment - 10What were you expecting? The Kakegurui manga is in my favorites, so I still would have given this a 10 based on personal enjoyment even if it did end up being a terrible adaptation. I\'ve been hooked since episode one, and I can\'t wait for all the future episodes.Overall - 8Honestly, I\'d give this a 10, but I think it\'s still too early to give this adaptation a final verdict. All I know is that I\'m really enjoying what the Kakegurui anime is offering us right now. (Will most probably change overall score as the show progresses.)Even if you haven\'t read the manga, or aren\'t into this kind of anime, I still recommend trying to at least watch the first episode. Who knows? You might just come to like it too.EDIT: I finished watching this a week ago. Don\'t believe everything I said here. The original ending turned this potential great anime into  a piece of shit. Go read the manga.

I\'ll try to work around spoilers and keep it short. And I assure you this review is completely unbiased (wink wink). That is to say I absolutely love it.Let me tell you this: it\'s hard to represent mania, and this anime has it on lock. It\'s rare to see a chaotic character represented in media that it\'s not psychopathic or lacking any emotion or empathy, in fact this is quite the opposite, the characters are so overwhelmingly filled with all kinds of emotions that they...keep exploding in this maniacal behavior.The story is fairly simple, the setting is not something incredibly innovative but the execution of the rest makes it completely believable and perfect.The art its absolutely amazing, it gets you excited, it makes you laugh, it\'s aesthetically coherent, it fits perfectly. It makes you scream ""YES!!! STEP ALL OVER THEM!!"" while making the same faces they do in the games. Even the CG is on point.The sound is impeccable. Sound effects in moments of pure caricature are just enough to get the crazy visuals over the edge, not to mention the soundtrack (that freakin\' opening).The characters are super-exaggerated humans, they aren\'t your typical Hollywood casino movies lot, they are absolutely insane and to say that is an understatement. They steamroll over their enemies while making insane expressions, while still being cold and calculating... most of the time.The content of this review must have revealed my enjoyment with this so far.Overall, I see amazing potential in the episodes to come and it got me hooked up, I will eventually update this review if my opinion changes over the course of the episodes. Let\'s hope it\'ll keep the current score. If you are looking for a fresh anime, this is sure to keep you entertained. keep exploding in this maniacal behavior.The story is fairly simple, the setting is not something incredibly innovative but the execution of the rest makes it completely believable and perfect.The art its absolutely amazing, it gets you excited, it makes you laugh, it\'s aesthetically coherent, it fits perfectly.

So lets hop on to the review right now!As most of the anime is centered around High school, this one is too. But this ain\'t no ordinary High school guys and gals.. The students, they all some rich gamblers dawg, whom laugh at your very own poor existence &gt;:D Muahahahah....!! (okay then I should kill myself now.)Each of the student\'s art style represents their personality very well. The colors are very well suited for this kind of set in anime. Visual representations are all well I\'d say.The OP is nicely done....Has a ""yeah! i\'m a rich bitch"" feel in it. Same i\'d say for the ED too. The soundtrack in the background makes you keep going on watching and makes stuff look more interesting.I\'m enjoying this show for myself now. I\'d recommend you watching it too if you have some free time. Welp it\'s summer dawg! so you muster up and start gambling! Has a ""yeah! i\'m a rich bitch"" feel in it. Same i\'d say for the ED too.

Your mouth is a desert, lips parched as you struggle to even swallow your own saliva. An irregular heart beat increases its oscillations, and your vision blurs as you attempt to read your own cards. You're a house pet, a term coined only for those drowning in the debt of the student council and this one hand of poker could either seal your fate for the rest of your life, or set you free of the shackles of your dues. Anger, guilt, nervousness...and tension well up inside your brain, clouding any sense of strategy once present in your arsenal. The remaining cards are dealt, each one like a subsequent dagger being driven into the heart. Your fingers dig into the cheap felt table lining and begin to burn from the friction. As the last card approaches, thousands of scenarios race through your mind, and your opponents stoic appearance does nothing to ease the pressure. Will you survive? Will your reputation and existence be dismantled, succumbing to the hands of the tyrannical council?The final card slams down with a thunderous echo…Gambling is a subject rare to take center stage in the realm of anime. Kaiji, Death Parade and Liar Game are some of the only examples I can think of in the medium, until studio MAPPA’s (Zankyou no Terror, Yuri!! On Ice) Kakegurui landed this season. From a viewer’s perspective, for the gambling to really have an impact on our senses the scenes must comprise a balance of suspense, mind games and creativity. Kaiji the Gambler, arguably the best example I can think of features a main character literally gambling for his life, in games that are either very intricate or require a large degree of mental fortitude to participate in. The result is white-knuckle tension that has your finger hovering over the skip button, ready to binge through the entire anime in one sitting. Kakegurui attempts to mimic Kaiji’s critical success with a different target audience by introducing better animation and a more familiar setting, high school. Because, you know, that makes sense.There is a “well visioned” setup, with taboo setting of school in which students engage in lavish betting and gambling once the last bell rings for the day. We witness firsthand the daunting effects of losing in this school: you're deemed a “house pet” and everyone treats you accordingly. This wouldn't be quite as ridiculous if it weren't for the fact that kids are ridiculed and treated like shit in high school to begin with. In essence, this significantly dilutes any ounce of realism with regards to the stakes these students are playing for, and ultimately the entire premise from the beginning. The “upside” is that IF you are successful at gambling and start raking in the dough, your family is already rich as fuck so…. none of this betting really even matters to begin with. See my point? From its inception, Kakegurui’s narrative is faulted. The whole premise of the anime seems pointless in that if you win, you'll be rich and if you lose, you'll still be rich but get treated like that awkward kid who frequently gets stuffed into lockers. The student council seeks to rule the school with an iron fist, but I'm not sure what they actually do; except cheat to win, fly in fancy helicopters and wear terrifying androgynous masks.Unassuming transfer student Yumeko Jabami looks to shake things up at this school by winning any and every gambling match she's in. Countless opponents fall victim to her innate ability to see through tricks and deftly play each person for a fool. This can be frustratingly similar to the No Game no Life effect, in which Sora and Shiro’s victory was assumed prior to them even starting the game. To top it off, Jabami seems to get off on the thought of risking “everything” on each of her matches. Each of her mental orgasms is brought to our attention in exhausting detail, as her eyes leer red and her legs tremble with excitement. The anime progresses almost episodically with a “rinse, repeat” effect. New characters are introduced, Jabami challenges them, a new game is played and Jabami emerges victorious yet again. This process repeats over and over and over again in a due loop merry-go-round. There’s no sense of doubt, no uncertainty built into the script. It’s a perpetual nightmare from a scripting perspective.With Jabami at the helm, we as viewers never really experience her thoughts about anything. Neither her strategy, intuition or objective ever becomes clear and the games themselves often end up narrated by her foes. Long, overthought monologues about what they “think” she is planning through each and every move, which began to take a toll on my attention span since I knew the eventual outcome prior to each match taking place. And since a majority of the anime is spent “in game” and we don’t catch a glimpse of what Jabami is thinking, her characterization is thrown out the window. The rare occurrence of a line of dialogue from our “heroine” is spent devilishly coercing another one of her pawns to help her with a bet in the game. The main protagonist in the anime doesn’t even have fucking character development… it’s embarrassing.Did I mention how edgy Kakegurui is? I was legitimately interested to see where the plot would unfold when I started the series, but my supposition quickly dissolved when I uncovered the anime’s true nature. It’s 2017, so I’m not sure what I expected, but the initial consensus was that I was at least intrigued. So a girl gets her jollies by gambling, who cares? But, when EVERY character acts as if they’re on the verge of insanity? Now we have an inherent problem. Not to mention the horrifically unattractive adrenaline slut who gets wet thinking about having her head blown off from a game of Russian Roulette. It’s a sex scene away from being a dumpster fire Sundance film about how fucking “raw and gritty” some teenager’s life is. Again, it’s the tactical diversion producers craft to steer the audience away from how dreadfully written a show can be, simply because it’s dark or shocking. I don’t always mind this level of scheming when the veil is at least entertaining. But in Kakegurui, you get the worst of both worlds: badly written and boring.It would be a disservice to anime fans everywhere if I didn’t at least attempt to address the comparisons between Kaiji and Kakegurui. Kaiji as a protagonist is someone you can really root for. His awful luck is inviting, in a sympathetic manner. He basically starts from nothing, and risks his actual life for a chance at redemption. Jabami comes from out of nowhere, with no clear motive and little to no relatability. Kaiji’s gambling games are fewer, but are better explained and have a more intricate explanation. Kakegurui falters, partially due to a shorter run time, and that the games are changed so quickly that less attention is given to their development. It feels like the writers are more focused on getting through everything vice making an impact on what they introduce. Kaiji is primarily a male cast, making it harder to attract female viewers but ideal for a seinen genre. Kakegurui has more females than you can shake a stick at: loli’s, tsunderes and yanderes to boot. Hence my opening statement in the review. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, most of Kakegurui’s dialogue comes from the opposition, creating a wall between the viewer and the character appearing to be the main protagonist (Jabami). In Kaiji, this internalizing is shared between he and his adversaries. It creates an equilibrium that helps the viewer rationalize either end of the gamble.I think it’d come off as redundant if I expounded any more about the characters in Kakegurui. Despite having significantly less screen time, Ryouta and Meari receive significantly more development than Jabami, inflating my unpopular opinion of her ten-fold. We do get some back story on a few minor characters, but nothing short of a plot device in order to propel the story forward. Possibly the most interesting character from the entire cast is Manyuda, who actually has a clearly defined motive, is cutthroat and calculating and doesn’t seem to break character as much to partake in edgy escapades. Oh yeah, and he’s the only member of the student council who actually gambled fairly, at least in his own game. If you’re looking for relatable or enticing characters, Kakegurui may not be the anime for you.If there’s anything I learned from watching Kakegurui, it’s that facial expressions are apparently everything. In an environment where maintaining a “poker face” is often sought after, the animators in this anime decided to do the exact opposite and emblazon a crazy face on almost every character in the cast. It’s brilliant in some respects because it helps distract the viewer from the rest of the anime’s inadequacies by giving them a fresh dose of ADHD, but is entirely unnecessary. It does helps manifest some false suspense, only it ends up making some of the scenes more irritating. The rest of the animation is quite good, and the overall tone it sets for the show works well for the subject matter. The character models are attractive and proportional, and the flashier scenes with dialogue-heavy moments please the eye. One major blemish on the art side would be the complete lack of animation with the Jabami idol karaoke scene. It came across as complete laziness, with the still image of Jabami fading out into the completion of her song. I’m not sure if this was intentional, but it was jarring to say the least. To help make up for it, they at least added a completely random duet between her and Yumemi to close the episode.I’ll be honest, I absolutely love the OP for the show. It’s a psychedelic, sexy acid trip with a risque’ jazz track narrating the visuals. If you look closely, it even tells a small story relating to the story progression of the anime itself. The ED on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired, sans the mystery of what’s underneath Jabami’s outer layer of clothing. The song isn’t even catchy, a quality I can at least cling to in an ED. The rest of the soundtrack existed to create false tension and accentuate the mood of its corresponding scenes, and I can’t recall it being necessarily bad. Voice acting in Kakegurui is one of its strong points, and I can only imagine how much fun the seiyuus had considering how edgy the series can be. The actors actually had a chance to break character and have a good time.From an entertainment perspective, Kakegurui hits all the wickets. It has hot girls, great animation and an almost avant-garde approach to storytelling that could be incredibly appealing to young, impressionable audiences (aka, most of the anime community). This being said, I can’t be baffled by how well the show was received, even if I didn’t agree with it. This is the main purpose of a reviewer or critic, to point out enjoyment as well as flaws. I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t enjoy Kakegurui. But is it a good gambling anime? Hardly. It suffers from a severe lack of character development/relatability and has an edgy stigma about it I can’t shake. The previous negatives coupled with the unrealistic premise can create some harsh criticisms and overall disappointment. I’d recommend this to fans of shows like Re:Zero, No Game No Life or any other similar series, due in part to it being edgy and appealing to a certain audience.

This can be frustratingly similar to the No Game no Life effect, in which Sora and Shiro’s victory was assumed prior to them even starting the game. To top it off, Jabami seems to get off on the thought of risking “everything” on each of her matches. Each of her mental orgasms is brought to our attention in exhausting detail, as her eyes leer red and her legs tremble with excitement. The anime progresses almost episodically with a “rinse, repeat” effect. New characters are introduced, Jabami challenges them, a new game is played and Jabami emerges victorious yet again. This process repeats over and over and over again in a due loop merry-go-round. There’s no sense of doubt, no uncertainty built into the script. It’s a perpetual nightmare from a scripting perspective.With Jabami at the helm, we as viewers never really experience her thoughts about anything. Neither her strategy, intuition or objective ever becomes clear and the games themselves often end up narrated by her foes. Long, overthought monologues about what they “think” she is planning through each and every move, which began to take a toll on my attention span since I knew the eventual outcome prior to each match taking place. And since a majority of the anime is spent “in game” and we don’t catch a glimpse of what Jabami is thinking, her characterization is thrown out the window. The rare occurrence of a line of dialogue from our “heroine” is spent devilishly coercing another one of her pawns to help her with a bet in the game. The main protagonist in the anime doesn’t even have fucking character development… it’s embarrassing.Did I mention how edgy Kakegurui is? I was legitimately interested to see where the plot would unfold when I started the series, but my supposition quickly dissolved when I uncovered the anime’s true nature. It’s 2017, so I’m not sure what I expected, but the initial consensus was that I was at least intrigued. So a girl gets her jollies by gambling, who cares? But, when EVERY character acts as if they’re on the verge of insanity? Now we have an inherent problem. Not to mention the horrifically unattractive adrenaline slut who gets wet thinking about having her head blown off from a game of Russian Roulette. It’s a sex scene away from being a dumpster fire Sundance film about how fucking “raw and gritty” some teenager’s life is. Again, it’s the tactical diversion producers craft to steer the audience away from how dreadfully written a show can be, simply because it’s dark or shocking. I don’t always mind this level of scheming when the veil is at least entertaining. But in Kakegurui, you get the worst of both worlds: badly written and boring.It would be a disservice to anime fans everywhere if I didn’t at least attempt to address the comparisons between Kaiji and Kakegurui. Kaiji as a protagonist is someone you can really root for. His awful luck is inviting, in a sympathetic manner. He basically starts from nothing, and risks his actual life for a chance at redemption. Jabami comes from out of nowhere, with no clear motive and little to no relatability. Kaiji’s gambling games are fewer, but are better explained and have a more intricate explanation. Kakegurui falters, partially due to a shorter run time, and that the games are changed so quickly that less attention is given to their development. It feels like the writers are more focused on getting through everything vice making an impact on what they introduce. Kaiji is primarily a male cast, making it harder to attract female viewers but ideal for a seinen genre. Kakegurui has more females than you can shake a stick at: loli’s, tsunderes and yanderes to boot. Hence my opening statement in the review. Lastly, as I mentioned previously, most of Kakegurui’s dialogue comes from the opposition, creating a wall between the viewer and the character appearing to be the main protagonist (Jabami). In Kaiji, this internalizing is shared between he and his adversaries. It creates an equilibrium that helps the viewer rationalize either end of the gamble.I think it’d come off as redundant if I expounded any more about the characters in Kakegurui. Despite having significantly less screen time, Ryouta and Meari receive significantly more development than Jabami, inflating my unpopular opinion of her ten-fold. We do get some back story on a few minor characters, but nothing short of a plot device in order to propel the story forward. Possibly the most interesting character from the entire cast is Manyuda, who actually has a clearly defined motive, is cutthroat and calculating and doesn’t seem to break character as much to partake in edgy escapades. Oh yeah, and he’s the only member of the student council who actually gambled fairly, at least in his own game. If you’re looking for relatable or enticing characters, Kakegurui may not be the anime for you.If there’s anything I learned from watching Kakegurui, it’s that facial expressions are apparently everything. In an environment where maintaining a “poker face” is often sought after, the animators in this anime decided to do the exact opposite and emblazon a crazy face on almost every character in the cast. It’s brilliant in some respects because it helps distract the viewer from the rest of the anime’s inadequacies by giving them a fresh dose of ADHD, but is entirely unnecessary. It does helps manifest some false suspense, only it ends up making some of the scenes more irritating. The rest of the animation is quite good, and the overall tone it sets for the show works well for the subject matter. The character models are attractive and proportional, and the flashier scenes with dialogue-heavy moments please the eye. One major blemish on the art side would be the complete lack of animation with the Jabami idol karaoke scene. It came across as complete laziness, with the still image of Jabami fading out into the completion of her song. I’m not sure if this was intentional, but it was jarring to say the least. To help make up for it, they at least added a completely random duet between her and Yumemi to close the episode.I’ll be honest, I absolutely love the OP for the show. It’s a psychedelic, sexy acid trip with a risque’ jazz track narrating the visuals. If you look closely, it even tells a small story relating to the story progression of the anime itself. The ED on the other hand, leaves a lot to be desired, sans the mystery of what’s underneath Jabami’s outer layer of clothing. The song isn’t even catchy, a quality I can at least cling to in an ED. The rest of the soundtrack existed to create false tension and accentuate the mood of its corresponding scenes, and I can’t recall it being necessarily bad. Voice acting in Kakegurui is one of its strong points, and I can only imagine how much fun the seiyuus had considering how edgy the series can be. The actors actually had a chance to break character and have a good time.From an entertainment perspective, Kakegurui hits all the wickets. It has hot girls, great animation and an almost avant-garde approach to storytelling that could be incredibly appealing to young, impressionable audiences (aka, most of the anime community). This being said, I can’t be baffled by how well the show was received, even if I didn’t agree with it. This is the main purpose of a reviewer or critic, to point out enjoyment as well as flaws. I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t enjoy Kakegurui. But is it a good gambling anime? Hardly. It suffers from a severe lack of character development/relatability and has an edgy stigma about it I can’t shake. The previous negatives coupled with the unrealistic premise can create some harsh criticisms and overall disappointment. I’d recommend this to fans of shows like Re:Zero, No Game No Life or any other similar series, due in part to it being edgy and appealing to a certain audience.

Do you like male mc’s who are completely inconsequential to the plot? Perhaps this is the right show for you? But not so much for me. Find out why after this commercial break.*Please go out and buy this product. You can hit the skip button after five seconds.*And we’re back.Kakegurui is a highly unconventional anime that happens to be set in a high school. The show begins with Ryouta ""Pochi"" Suzui, our unheroic protagonist who’s essentially relegated to background character by episode four. In the first episode we find that that...Ryouta has just lost a game against our first head case named Meari Saotome. As a result, he becomes a house pet, which is what happens when a student is unable to pay back the debt.Did I mention that gambling is the only thing that matters in this school? It’s explained early on this is a school for rich kids who are taught that in order to succeed as heirs to their parent’s stacks of cash they must learn how to be good gamblers. As outrageous as this sounds, it’s just fiction, so I’ll suspend my disbelief.Enter Yumeko Jabami, our main female protagonist and obligatory best girl. The show is named after her personality as a “kakegurui” which means someone who finds pleasure in taking risks (when I right clicked on the word kakegurui it suggested that I was misspelling fruitcake. True story.) And that term can’t be taken lightly. Gambling makes this girl wetter than Yuno in the pool with Yukki in episode 3 of Mirai Nikki. I all seriousness, I find her behavior awkward. She\'s far more interesting than Ryouta, and has some inkling of a heroic nature. Overall she seems to be the most emotionally strong character in the show.From here onward the story is mainly about Jabami gambling against other students, which include: Itsuki Sumeragi, yet another psychotic girl (seriously this school of full of them) who likes collecting the fingernails of those she defeats in gambling. Basically later in life this girl could be a likely successor to Elizabeth Bathory. Bet your nails on it (but seriously, don’t.) Jabami’s next opponent is  Yuriko Nishinotouin, a 3rd year student who looks like she should’ve graduated thirty years ago. Once again we find ourselves watching yet another obscure gambling game that has the suspense of waiting in line at McDonalds.There\'s also some obscure fan service, which has overall been pretty meh in this series. You don’t really see that much skin. The closest we get to that is watching Midari Ikishima briefly masturbate whilst playing Russian roulette with herself. Yeah, that’s a thing. This show can’t seem to go five minutes without one character acting as though they’ve just escaped a mental institution.That’s all I’ve watched up until this point. I’ll update my review accordingly.TL;DR: It’s strange, yet entertaining. The music is well done and adds well to the atmosphere. The animation is also fairly strong (it better be in the current year) but that’s about it on the positives. The story is so fixated on its gambling matches that it feels like I’ve barely gotten to see any other side to this world.  The characters all feel too similar to one another with the exception of our wooden plank of a male mc. Most of the characters of focus thus far have been females with varying degrees of crazy. The games are okay, but I don’t feel much suspense watching them. They’re slightly unpredictable, but I am starting to pick up on the formula being used.

So far it’s a 6/10 for me.', 'Kakegurui, an anime that solely revolves around the idea of social stature, as well as your life in general, all depend on your ability to gamble. Of course in some arbitrary wealthy high school.Before I start rating the anime, I want to first state that I intended on dropping this anime after the first episode. This was due to the fact that in the beginning, the way the characters acted came out as cringe and cliche to me. I will explain this further in the review.Story: 6/10: The story of this anime takes place at Hyakkaou Private Academy, and it starts off with your...classic and cliche hot transfer student, to which one of our protagonists was forced to show her around the school. I\'m sure there could have been plenty of other ways to approach this, but it was necessary in order to lead up to important dialogue which in turn strengthens the bond between these two characters. Throughout the story so far, our two main protagonists have been sticking with each other, one being useless, and the other being a complete genius. What really made me stay was the introduction of the student council. They were shown as bosses, and since the gambling battles that took place before their introduction were very intense, you could imagine how it would be going up against these ""bosses"". This is what kept me going. Well that and the insane plays and reads that took place.Art: 9/10: The art is absolutely fantastic. The reason I\'m not rating it a 10/10 is because sometimes it\'s a little too much for me. The artists did an amazing job reflecting the mood with certain facial expressions. But I wasn\'t ready for what was to come, even though I knew that this anime would be filled with horror and intensity, I still wasn\'t prepared. There isn\'t much to say about the art other than how crazy good it is.Sound 5/10: I\'m a little disappointed with the sounds, and how it couldn\'t complement the art as much as I wanted too. Especially in scenes where they go energetic and crazy, or when the opponent is suffering from a crises because they are losing, the soundtrack really isn\'t attention grabbing. In fact, I\'m paying more attention to the art without realizing that there is an OST playing in the background, because it\'s not fit for the occasion. Hopefully this will change in the future.Character 7/10: The characters in Kakegurui bring insanity to a whole new level. Even if they are introduced as kind or calm at one moment, the next they\'ll be engulfed by this eerie aura. It\'s surprising to say the least. The only problem that I have with this, is that they are trying too hard. When the characters have their occasional insanity tick, it feels like it\'s way to forced, and what would seem to be eerie and creepy just ends up being cringe. I would hope they include some development in the main protagonist rather than just keep him as some useless moral compass for our other protagonist.Enjoyment 9/10: Despite all these negatives, I\'ve been really enjoying this show. As said previously, I\'m a big fan of hard reads and insane plays, which is why this anime has got me hooked. Not only that, but I feel as if it has a lot of potential, especially with the development of character and the upcoming battles (I haven\'t read the manga).Overall 7/10: Overall, this is a good anime to watch. I\'m not too sure I would recommend this to anyone so far, but as the show progresses my opinions are prone to change, so right now a final conclusion would be meaningless. classic and cliche hot transfer student, to which one of our protagonists was forced to show her around the school.

I explain why not a 9 or 10 with the cons at the end of my review.Story 8/10: A school anime, how original huh ? Well but this school is different, isn\'t about the typical single classroom with the male MC and the typical cliche classmates.In this school everything is about gambling, gambling is life. The serie introduces you about what\'s going on since the episode 1 and keeps you asking for more after each episode.Also, isn\'t regular gambling, the games aren\'t the usual ones everybody knows like blackjack or roulette, they aren\'t also the...most complex games neither, the key is the gambling, betting ridiculous amounts of money and trying to win by cheating if possible.Art  9 & Sound 10 : The art is good, characters faces are something memorable. But the music is just outstanding, the opening is kinda unique and so is the music in it. The sound deserves a solid 10, it goes just too well with the anime theme.Characters 10/10: In this anime u will see some of the most mental broken girls you won\'t find in like 9/10 of series out there, starting by the female MC.

But during the gambling...itself, it gives no hints as to what is the strategy, leaving no room for the audience itself to make deductions. itself, it gives no hints as to what is the strategy, leaving no room for the audience itself to make deductions.', 'Kakegurui is an outstanding anime that I loved the moment I saw it. There isn\'t much I want to go too deep into, but this is what I thought of it:The story was pretty original in my point of view, as I haven\'t seen anything else related to gambling. I think what really topped Kakegurui off was it\'s capitalization of your skill at gambling being what determines your social status; it\'s truly, by definition—awesome. I really do look forward to seeing what the conclusion to this anime is, and I hope that the male lead, Suzui, get\'s more screen time then he already does, and...I also hope that he has more involvement with the plot, considering he is labeled as a ""main character."" I\'m not saying I dislike the fact that he\'s a main character, it\'s just that I\'ve seen characters from other anime being the same length in season, having them being put as ""support"" even though they\'ve received 10x the screen time. But, I guess it\'s just because how important his character is and all that. Blah blah.The artwork is truly outstanding. I adore the detailed close-ups of the character\'s faces during scenes of suspense, as it unbelievable boosts the level of enjoyment that I receive while watching it. Not only the artwork is what I think is good—the soundtrack is amusing as well.

Not for any particular reason; it was actually a pretty enjoyable episode but I felt that it was a natural end to a mini arc (which I consider to be one for each member of the student council) so it felt like an okay place to stop.The artwork is great - loved all the different facial expressions. Not just the crazy ones, but ones used for comedic purposes, or simply to highlight how beautiful some of the girls are. This, for me, was the highlight of the entire show - the music is pretty good but...nothing outstanding and the characters I find to be just above average.Leading in from that last point: the array of characters, on the surface, are pretty cool and diverse in both personality and design but I never felt it go anywhere. This show is pretty shallow on character development, save for perhaps Jabami and Mary, but even with them it felt like painfully slow baby steps watching them develop...Overall, my enjoyment was just slightly above middle of the road. I could have continued with the last 5 episodes left to air, but as I mentioned before, this felt like a comfortable places top stop. I can\'t see any kind of ""plot twist"" beyond this point that would shake up the show enough to keep my interest, and I feel like I can completely predict how the last 5 episodes are going to play out. I might be interested in picking this series back up in the future though, if I find out that the plot gets some kind of shake up down the road. If it\'s more of the same though I\'ll have to pass.I\'d say give this show a try if you\'ve already blown through all the great stuff because it\'s not TERRIBLE.

I can\'t see any kind of ""plot twist"" beyond this point that would shake up the show enough to keep my interest, and I feel like I can completely predict how the last 5 episodes are going to play out. I might be interested in picking this series back up in the future though, if I find out that the plot gets some kind of shake up down the road. If it\'s more of the same though I\'ll have to pass.I\'d say give this show a try if you\'ve already blown through all the great stuff because it\'s not TERRIBLE. But don\'t expect anything life changing either.', 'Welcome to Hyakkaou Private Academy, a gambling paradise where success is rewarded with wealth and prestige and those who fail are punished with massive debt and dehumanization. In this twisted establishment, taking big risks and cheating profusely are a commonality amongst the school\'s student body. While many may be turned off by these extreme conditions, protagonist Jabami Yumeko, a major gambling addict, finds herself right at home when she transfers to the academy. She doesn\'t have any elaborate plans or aspirations and only desires one thing; the ecstatic feeling she derives from gambling.WARNING: The plethora of psychotic lesbians in this anime may be too much...for the weak of heart to handle. Proceed with caution.The male protagonist in the show is Ryouta Suzui. He\'s basically your average guy and falls under the ""I\'m useless and have to rely on the heroine to do everything"" trope. His primary purpose is to serve as the juxtaposition to Yumeko\'s character so that her damaged psyche and general insanity is made more apparent. And not just her, but practically every other member of the cast as well, who all seem to add their own little bit of crazy to the show. Seriously, some of these characters make the infamous yandere Yuno Gasai look like a domesticated housewife in comparison.Kakegurui\'s plot is really quite simple. There\'s no intricate story at play and characters (with the exception of the twintailed  blonde Meari) don\'t receive much development. This anime instead focuses on a multitude of unique games played by the characters. Now these aren\'t fun family matches. They are games with high stakes played by demented yet intelligent characters, and it\'s just a thrill to watch.Of course, these games are incredibly exaggerated in order to engross the show\'s audience. The producers are even able to make a basic game of rock-paper-scissors intense. Now while I\'m sure this approach didn\'t work on everyone, it was enough to entertain me personally and keep me invested in the anime, so I\'d say that Kakegurui\'s presentation was a success. The highlight of these gambling matches was when Yumeko managed to turn the tables on her foes with her amazing analytical skills and luck. It was so fun watching her completely own her opponents.I just love the distorted faces made by the characters in this anime. Whenever they\'re experiencing a high or a low during a match, the characters always seem to have amazingly detailed and demented expressions. Their visages often made watching them gamble even more enjoyable and managed to make them seem crazier than they already were. The rest of the animation was often high in quality as well, and it assimilated with the soundtrack quite nicely.I was really tempted to give Kakegurui a lower score. The story is quite simplistic (bordering the nonexistent range) and there really isn\'t an explanation on why the school is so fixated on gambling. Also, I found myself constantly wondering things like where the heck are the teachers? I guess they were massacred by the student council. I wouldn\'t put it past that group of psychos. The fact that only one character had any marginal development while the rest remained generally stagnant was also a negative factor against Kakegurui. But the show is just so damn entertaining. It\'s honestly one of the most enjoyable seasonal anime that I\'ve seen in awhile. And while the characters aren\'t that developed, they make up for it with their eccentric personalities. Yumeko commanded my attention every time she appeared on screen, and the majority of her gambling matches were intense and fun to watch, even if they were over dramatized and often served no significant purpose.Kakegurui is clearly not for everyone. In fact, from a technical standpoint, the anime is actually quite poor. But unlike many other shows that I\'ve seen, Kakegurui was able to make me not completely focus on its shortcomings thanks to its its explosive cast and atmosphere. If you\'re into the game and/or physiological genre, then I\'d recommend giving Kakegurui a chance. And if you have a thing for crazy women, then you don\'t want to miss out on this anime.

Trust me.', 'THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSAs someone who has never read the manga, I came to this anime adaption with an open mind. Firstly, the idea of an anime based on gambling intrigued me, and from the various trailers online it was being sold as an anime based around ""battles of the wit"", where attempting to \'read\' your opponent, and skills such as risk taking, negotiating, and to a degree ""deception"" were crucial and thusly encouraged and honed in the students of Hyakkaou Private Academy.The main premise is that the richest and most powerful families of Japan, send their children to this academy which is designed...to create the NEXT ""future leaders"" of Japan. And what is the best way to create future leaders? Gambling. The whole school\'s curriculum centres on gambling, because the idea is that individuals who can thrive and rise to the top in such an environment will be fit to lead the country somehow (anyway).1) Character Development.So the first person we see is a guy called Ryouta Suzui, initially we expect him to be the protagonist of the anime but he\'s literally only important for the first minute or two. His character is summarised as ""cowardly and poor"". Throughout the 5 episodes that have been released so far of this anime, he has had no role, no development, no important dialogue, nothing. He literally just follows the main character around, warning her when she\'s about to gamble against a difficult opponent, then praising her when she wins. At the most, the anime sometimes let\'s us hear his voiced out thoughts while the main character gambles as a way of building suspense - His character is a textbook example of the ""pathetic male character"" trope. Don\'t expect him to do anything else, except ask questions about how the M.C. does a certain thing so that the viewer at home understands. This for me was a red flag when it came to analysing the quality of the writing itself. It\'s just lazy, and unacceptable for an anime today.Then you have the Main Character, Yumeko Jabami, a random girl who transfers into the school and on the first day challenges the mean girl, Meari Saotome who was bullying the pathetic, generic Ryouta Suzui. After experiencing gambling for the first time Jabami finds herself addicted, hence the title Kakegurui which translates to compulsive gambler. She\'s shown to be this extremely intelligent character who manages to figure out how her opponents are ""cheating"" and through a bit of mental logic manages to work out what bets have the best probability. Her personality is jarring, going from nice and pleasant then to sudden ""orgasm"" faces where she stares her scared opponent in the eyes and declares her victory over them. In fact a lot of these characters have these really stupid facial expressions, I guess as a way to intimidate one another? It would make sense if the situation warranted it, like the characters were getting riled up or backed into a corner, but they\'re literally just making these retarded expressions every time they gamble against each other...And this is nothing like how people actual gamble. The anime doesn\'t even try to suspend your disbelief.Speaking generally, the same applies to all other characters. Every one of them has some random quirk, and plays into that ""box"". Some characters are completely unbelievable. One of them being this eye-patch wearing psycho girl who runs around the school with a revolver, playing Russian Roulette, because gambling with her life turns her on, so much so that she rubs one off in the school toilets...Right. Much dramatic.2) Story.As mentioned earlier, the anime does nothing to try and stay grounded in any form of reality. Don\'t interpret this as me saying that every aspect of an anime has to be realistic, no, that is far from the truth. I\'m all for fictional liberty and pushing outside of the realm of reality, as long as the anime actually tries to make it believable. But it just fails at that.The story itself is lacklustre, every episode is about challenging a difficult enemy opponent who has their own gambling game that they like to play, and surprise, most of them are cheating. This anime doesn\'t teach you any real world wisdom about gambling, and there is no intellectual battle of wits, no mind games, no nothing. The M.C. will deduce her best chances of winning, and will expose the opponent for cheating, and then stare at them with another orgasm face. The story appears to be headed towards fighting against the members of the student council, who are presumably some of the best.What else? If you end up in debt, you become a ""human pet"", where you basically get treated as subhuman and told to clean up coffee spills, or to be a leg stool. Which really makes no sense...there are no adults in this school, no staff, no actual classes...Just a bunch of students who sit around gambling and then when someone ends up losing, they just treat them like shit, and vandalise their desk? And that\'s it. These are the future of leaders of Japan? Rich parents are sending off their children to throw their money around and gamble at this prestigious academy...which has no structure, just a group of stuck up misfits as the ""student council"" all with their unique, deep plot, quirks, one even wears a mask...OooohoOOoOOoo - How will she make an orgasm face? Who knows - Suspense. Imagine, Bill Gates or Warren Buffet...Or any rich person. Who in the right mind would send their kids here, and give them all this money. That\'s something ain\'t it?And if you can\'t repay your debt? This student council of ""special"" individuals will arrange a ""life plan"" for you. When the protagonist finds herself in a large amount of debt, she gets this pamphlet instructing her on her future, it\'s basically human trafficking - she\'s supposed to marry some random preselected guy and bear his children and live out the life specified by this student council of ""special"" kids...How do they enforce this? Through ""powerful political connections"" of course. Oh yeah, remember, there are no adults in this school, it\'s just this student council made up of ""cool"" students, some with masks, some like to play video games. And they somehow have the ability to arrange for a student to be trafficked.There\'s nothing rewarding about this anime, you don\'t get any new insight into the gambling world. It\'s just a lazy, trope-filled, piece of shit with no redeeming qualities, except hot girls with orgasm faces. I\'m going to end it here. The art and music is average, that\'s the only thing they really succeeded in. Is this anime memorable in any way? No. Are you going to want to watch it? Depends on who you are I guess, because there\'s clearly a demand for this anime. to create the NEXT ""future leaders"" of Japan. And what is the best way to create future leaders? Gambling.

The anime picks apart what makes gambling so fun for some but so frightening for others and really gives a refreshing take on what it means to put everything on the line. The fact that his high stakes gambling is the driver for the...social ladder that exists at the school is yet another plus to the whole story. It isn't something that is completely original but the execution is captivating. The sheer gravity this gambling system holds seems inhumane and brutal at times and it draws you deeper into the show.The characters and how they are personified is the other strong point for the show. These are really complex characters, across the board. The MC Jabami is an extreme wildcard and it is tantalizing watching her develop as the show carries on. She is truly enthralled with the ecstasy that comes from gambling, so much so that some would say she is mad. She comes off as someone who would just watch the world burn for the sake of it. Jabami is the motor that propels the show forward and the fuel that sparks a change in the characters that surround and come into contact with her. She is truly OP and a monster but since the basis for this show is gambling the outcomes can never be 100% assured. It's a real thriller that will have you on the edge of your seat as you watch the matchesJabami isn't the only complex one, the rest have their motivations and certain relationships with gambling and I think that this is the shows strongest point. For some they only care for the money that comes from gambling, others care for the joy of gambling itself, some care about the high that comes from the possibility of losing it all. These many characterizations of gambling are shown all over the characters. Sometimes it comes off as a little TOO fan service oriented, especially with the immense focus and prominence of female characters in the show. There's lots of sexualized behaviors stemming from the gambling as well, but it really sells how deep gambling can go. It's kinda of a step up from what you may be familiar with in Shokugeki no Souma.The run of the show focuses on Jabami, her introduction to the school, the development as she is shown to be quite the wildcard and her many battles with the ruling body at the school, the Student Council. It feels very much like the run of the mill boss battle in a way as she topples each rung on the pyramid for a chance to go 1v1 with the president of the student council. The student council is quite diverse and Jabami herself is Pandora's Box personified, we are still learning and have so much more to learn about her.The art is great, it looks quite nice all around. The highest praise has to be given to the facial expressions these characters are given as they gamble, it's true artistry. My one reservation is the use of CG to animate some of the more fluid moments that require a higher level of dynamic movement. These moments are few and far between thus far, but they do stick out like a sore thumb.So far the pacing has been great. The characters are unraveling and revealing in a well timed and interesting way.

The whole thing revolves around pushing the main waifu front and center for the purpose of selling the manga. This gets exaggerated with the anime because now she needs to sell the manga AND merch.Enter Yumeko Jabami, her character intro in the theme song AND the show is boobs first. I\'m not joking, We first get a shot of her bouncing chest with the theme song saying her name over and over THEN her face. That\'s not a good start.Because everything revolves around her the rest of the ""story"" and...plot suffers. The school is called Hyakkaou Academy. An elite school for the rich to.... ummmmm...

Jabami is a gambler so that\'s all there needs to be in this school.The sad part is, for how much they make this revolve around this one character, they failed at making her look good.

For me it is something unheard of in this area. Although I\'ve seen RPG series of games to fantastic fantasy worlds where life is based on games, Kakegurui [at least for me] has brought something unprecedented in proportion to the bets in a realistic way! I intend to be a bit truthful in my criticism, without overdoing it like some people who have entered the show and have often made revisions ahead of time, before they even have even...tried a few episodes. The psychological part of Kakegurui for me worked a little more towards the middle, however, it fell a little from the middle to the end. Even then, there were parts that even if they did not work, sometimes they could get some tension in others. You can count on the fingers the episodes that were psychologically strong and others that were somewhat weak.In this respect, we can get the director\'s attention. And while I keep in mind the number of episodes that I may consider psychologically ""weak,"" I will not do it here, as I believe people should check for themselves, and also spoiler. I also want to point out that there has been a lack of better [and deeper] development of some characters, which I believe is a deficiency of the adaptation itself and the number of volumes that have been adapted, not having to do with direction. And even though there is not a deep development of the main characters, [something I reiterate: it has to do with the volumes that were adapted, it is not the director\'s fault, but the arches being adapted] was at least interesting to see how some characters evolving , albeit infrequently, in order to become auxiliaries in the saga of the main protagonist. Kakegurui was an interesting journey through the betting world in a dress never seen before [by me at least], and I recommend it to anyone who likes the theme. Although this first adaptation did not bring a darker aspect of the elite bets --- as the play proposes --- I believe that for whoever finishes it the manga will be able to reserve great surprises. tried a few episodes.

What was interesting in the show was that gambling, for me, was really just a tool to deliver a message; because if we are to judge Kakegurui simply as a gambling show it would be plain awful. The setting is rather generic as the show occurs in a school, although to be fair it is a rather “special” school that is built on gambling. The hierarchy is constructed based on who has the most money, which the general rule of thumb anywhere, and who is the most competent gambler, meaning who is...the most adept in psychological warfare. Consequently, fortunes can be overturned since practically all students are engaged in gambling their assets away with hopes of securing their immediate and long-term futures; giving those who are financially disadvantaged a chance at a better life, or so it would seem. The first few episodes were very intriguing as we are introduced to how the organizational construct within the school functions. The school employs a system similar to the one demonstrated in Assassination Classroom, where a specific class (a social class in the case of Kakegurui) is designed for those at the bottom of the pile; who are naturally repressed, ridiculed, and discriminated against by their peers. Individuals who accumulate large amounts of debt sink into the lowest tier possible within the hierarchy, a social class known as “house pets” whose job is to basically be used to increase the morale of other students. The system would incentivize students to continuously enhance their gambling skills by showing them what would happen if they are to fail, a message conveyed by the misery that house pets usually suffer. On the other end of the spectrum, you would have the student council who sit on top of the food chain and basically dictate everything that goes on in the school and are the ones responsible for implementing and maintaining the contemporary structure.All was working just fine until our main character, Jabami Yumeko, arrives and turns the system on its head, as is expected. Now, this all sounds nice and interesting, but things start to turn south as the show progresses and the world building rather comes to a halt. Many things in the show seem illogical or perhaps unexplored, we were never shown what the role of instructors or even adults was in general, which is very odd since they are within a school. The show depicted the school as being an independent organization functioning with minimal interference from the principal or teachers, as the only ones who actually wielded any form of power and were in charge of basically everything were the student council. This becomes more apparent as the show progresses since members of the council seemed to have the ability to do anything including having interrogation rooms or even weaponry. We do not really know how the council came to hold so much power or who granted a student council so much authority. The show justifies the extensive jurisdiction of student council members by stating that they hail from prestigious families whom are highly influential and are the root cause for students have such vast authority. Furthermore, even if we are to overlook such elements the show grows to become rather repetitive and formulaic, unfortunately, as Jabami Yumeko battles a new villain each week in order to reach the top; defeating each opponent in rather similar and predictable means.Animations:The animations in the series were just fine meaning that they were not bad nor special, but rather represent the standard you would expect of a modern day anime. Although, I must say that two things stood out while watching; the facial expressions of students and the fanservice. I must admit, I was not a fan of either. The facial expressions that were displayed by many of the characters were rather disturbing, especially at the beginning of the show, though luckily they tuned things down towards the end. Meanwhile, the fanservice was rather distasteful to say the least; as characters would normally become increasing aroused as the stakes would go higher. Though their heightened “sensations” were depicted in a rather disconcerting manner as characters would exhibit suicidal tendencies rather than pleasurable emotions, which was a turn-off for me. Though on a positive note their uniforms looked really good.Music:The ending for the series was the one musical piece that stood out for me, I really enjoyed its rather “hip” style. I did not enjoy the opening so much, though I was interested in the images it was showcasing which displayed and foreshadowed some of the events in the anime. I do not recall paying much regard to the music that was playing during the show, as no single track attracted my attention through the anime; which rather means that it was neither bad nor good.Characters:I think this is the dimension that the series suffered the most. I honestly did not care for any of the characters, including Yumeko, Suzui, and Saotome, even though they are considered to be the main cast. In fact, asides from Yumeko whose name was brought up 100 times each episode, I had trouble memorizing the names of any of the characters. I felt disconnected from all of them, especially that the show did not explore their backgrounds, motives, and experiences;  despite the presence of adequate material to go on. A fine example of this would be not displaying the relationship of Yumeko and her sister, who is supposedly bedridden in a hospital. The show simply does not explore issues that are considered essential for the progress of a solid plotline. Another seemingly important issue that was not explored in-depth was what were the true motives for students who are apparently poor to join such a prestigious school, aside from money? Plus what prevents them from leaving immediately once they become house pets? Issues that could have easily been explored if the spotlight was given to Suzui for an episode or two. Moreover, I truly wished that the show had focused on the morality of having such an oppressive system, showing the life that house pets have to endure; something that, again, could have been focused upon if Saotome was given some screen time off the gambling table.Though on a more positive note I did enjoy the political game that was played between students, where alliances would constantly shift depending on who is in power and what certain situations require.Overall:Nonetheless, despite all the downsides of the show I still found it entertaining at the very the least. I came back to watch it every week even though I knew what the outcome was going to be, and that is where the show’s value lies, entertainment. It never really attempts to do anything more than being an episodic anime that gives its viewers an injection of adrenaline week in week out. Although, question marks will be raised as to whether the show will be given a chance to rectify its errors in a second season since the series received an anime exclusive ending. Either way, I can recommend the show for those who want a spike of adrenaline from a series that relies on the psychological aspects of stress in general, and gambling in particular, to thrill its audience.  Though be prepared for an anime that goes directly into its main themes, without giving much thought to any other sideline or underlying concepts.Thank you for reading the most adept in psychological warfare.

I can deal with some plot holes, for once (I mean, even the almighty FMA has 2 big ones at the end) as long as the work can properly contextualize them and not make me care. Members of the cast being inconsistent, though, make it tougher to stomach. I’m also not someone who asks for absolute realism, but simply verisimilitude and...consistency. Disregard all of those and the work starts to go sour for me. The worst offenses, though, are when the work becomes morally bankrupt, when it asks me to sympathize and side with people who are clearly contemptible. Kakegurui is one of those shows.Story and CharactersWell come to Hyakkao Academy, the land of insane teenage gambling, horrendous abuses of power and blatantly criminal acts of bodily harm. The school is supposed to be a place for the children of the filthy rich, but most definitely the filthy, where the future elite of Japan is meant to be prepared for a future where they’d lead the business of their families. In this institution, gambling is not simply a pass-time students can engage for their own enjoyment, but a core part of the social-structure of the school. Since the current student council president took over, she instituted a system where students who stack too much debt become “cattle”, considered second class among their classmates and have to remain subservient to the students with more money. Obviously, they also become primary target for bullying. For the viewer who shares that pesky desire to have the elements in the story making sense, this plot point will immediately raise a number of eyebrows, so let’s go bit by bit.First, how is this system even allowed existing? None of the students here are of legal age, so they should never be allowed to gamble outrageous amounts of money from their parents net worth. Is this a version or Japan where legal restrictions for underage gambling don’t exist? If that’s the case, what about the restrictions for underage driving, drinking and sex? None of these are even mentioned, so I suppose the gambling premise is entirely based on “don’t think about it, bro”. Now, you might at this point throw at me my previous statement about realism vs. verisimilitude, but let make it clear: that goes for simple stuff, like my tsunderes being a bit more violent than what the real world would tolerate or children being a bit more mature than normal, it doesn’t apply for a universe where an entire legal system seems to operate backwards.Following the fact that the existence of this scenario is a contradiction in itself, why would anyone enroll their children in a school like this one? These students are supposed to be future business leaders, people with enormous responsibilities in their hands, so a cast system that allows them to be bullied, humiliated and sometimes even physically harmed by their classmates goes completely opposite to the goal their education is supposed to provide, that of shaping them into capable, resolute and strong-willed adults. I’m not sure any parent would allow their children to frequent a place like this if such practices are not only allowed, but incentivized. Then there’s the money issue: the students make their bets with money from their families, which means that they are stocking up on massive debts their parents will have to pay. At long-term, this set up would make the cost of such education extremely expensive, making this school a lot more trouble than is worth. The list of absurdities doesn’t stop there, but let’s get to know the cast before we can dive head first into more nonsense!Jabami Yumeko is the main culprit of the story. She generally keeps a playful and polite demeanor, but shifts to intense obsession when it’s time to gamble. I’m pretty sure she is supposed to be a sociopath! Not a realistic depiction of a sociopath, though, but what fiction believes a sociopath to be like. Truth be told, Yumeko is no more than a Mary Sue. It may seem like a stretch to claim this, since general misconception is that this kind of character is also supposed to be virtuous (or at least framed as such by the narrative, even when the audience can clearly see that the opposite is truth), but she does have the basic traits of a Mary Sue:  she clearly has complete disregard for how much money she bets, the supply of money or her disposal is not even hinted at in the anime, so in how much danger she’s is unclear, at no point displays any signs of being the least bit worried, constantly displaying the face of someone who’s always on top, even though her behavior is so needlessly risky. Ironically, at one point she even drops this gem: “To realize one’s ambitions, risks must be taken”. Funny, since she seems to have no ambition besides having a gambling playground for herself.Besides being nice to the already shitty-characters from the main cast and keeping a constant sweety-kitty-diabetes façade when not gambling, is there any reason for Yumeko to be seem as an actual force for good in this narrative? When it comes to motivations and general personality, she’s no less psychotic, abusive, deceiving, manipulative and sadistic than the members of the student council (or any other scumbag in this school), so what are the guaranties that once her main source of entertainment in the school is gone, or at least significantly diminished, she’ll bring any positive change to the status quo? And even if she does, do any of these characters actually deserve it? They’re all simplistic, poorly realized figures and most often just despicable people, despite the laughable attempts from the show on making them sympathetic by introducing last minute backstory.Suzui Ryouta, the closest friend to Yumeko, is an inconsistent pussy. He strangely seems to have no problem talking to multiple attractive girls at school, but from the first moment Yumeko enters the scene, becomes strangely flustered when first interacting with her. Besides that, his role is essentially to tell the audience how risky her situation is when she makes a crazy bet and to be mesmerized when she pulls off a victory out of some strategy the audience has no knowledge off.Momobami Kirari is the student council president, or Seitokaichou in Japanese, responsible for the creation of the cast system in place in Hyakkao Academy. She sees her fellow schoolmates as pets she can control and play with, as well as manipulate to gain power, although the goals she wants to achieve with such power are not explained in the story. Through an outrageous ass-pull in episode 11 (not a Deus ex Machina, stop using this term wrong) she proves to also be willing to backstab her own fellow student council members, which leads me to question how would anyone ever trust and help this bitch again, when she can betray them on a whim.Other members of the student council that matter are:-          Ikishima Midari, who’s completely insane for life-threatening thrills and CARRIES A GUN TO THE SCHOOL! Seriously, how is this ever allowed? Why would anyone accept be put into a school that looks more like an asylum for demented shitbags?-          Yomozuki Runa, the loli dressed in a bunny hoodie who helps Seitokaichou on her schemes, gleefully plotting against the other members;-          Kaede Manyuda, the treasurer of the student council, very ambitious and arrogant, quick to dismiss the students he doesn’t consider worthy enough of battling him. By all accounts, he’s the least awful creature in the cast;-          Sumeragi Itsuki, another crazy bitch, who likes to collect nails from other students, which she rips off whenever they lose to her in gamble;So, besides allowing its students to be bullied and made into servants, potentially putting them in emotional distress that can severely affect their learning, this schools also allows bodily harm to be inflicted on them, as well as bets that involve possible death. Not crazy enough for you? The institution is also equipped with special sealed rooms, for when Ikishima feels the need to “arrest other students” for her games. Let me spell this out again: this crazy cunt KIDNAPS people and locks them into special cells where she can bet on deadly games with them, using a FIREARM! Do you see why this setting is so hard to buy into?As soon as Yumeko arrives at the institution, her one and only goal is to gamble with every strong opponent she can find, climbing the ladder until she can get the opportunity to challenge Seitokaichou, so the bulk of the narrative is focused on the multiple games she engages in with other members, occasionally crushing their spirit by revealing the manner they cheat, before beating them. Not always successful, though, as early on she manages to lose a serious bet, although it’s implied that was only possible through cheating, and becomes a pet. Interestingly enough, as soon as a previously successful character suddenly becomes a pet, it seems their winning record is instantly forgotten by the scumbag token extras, who immediately shift to bully mode. If you’re like me and has near zero suspension of disbelief for stories where everyone is an asshole, you’ll have a hard time with this one.As Yumeko uses her status as a pet to attract and challenge other student council members, she finally reaches the top members, challenging first Manyuda and ultimately the president. This is the point where the anime turns simply from rage-inducing bad to morally bankrupt filth! Through a seriously logically questionable trick played with the help of Sumeragi, who has an old grudge with Manyuda, they lead him into betting such a high amount of money, that the loss of that game would put him indefinitely subservient to the student council president and destroy his influence in the council, as well as potentially compromising his future and relationship with his father. Yes, it’s that serious! So, of course, he loses and the defeat is followed by Yumeko and Sumeragi gleefully explaining how they manage to reach their ridiculously contrived victory, with the final blow being delivered by the president, by telling him “You’re fired”, making him snap and pass out. In the follow up, Yumeko and Sumeragi discuss what just happens and the way their dialogue is frame tries to imply they had the moral high-ground, somehow. That last bit, to me, is the most infuriating part.Seriously, what exactly was Manyuda’s crime that was apparently so much more despicable in relation to the other students? Seitokaichou introduced a cast system that locks students into the role of cattle, where they remain subservient and bullied by other students, Sumeragi, who now we’re supposed to root for, used to rip people’s nails off, which basically amounts to torture, and Midari makes bets with people’s lives; Am I really supposed to believe that this guy is so much more deserving of having his livelihood and future sadistically crushed because he underestimates his fellow students? When did arrogance become the worst of crimes? I call this idea bullshit and this anime a hypocritical piece of toxic waste.By the way, the ending is a complete cop-out too.PresentationSo, do you like variety of facial expression for your characters to help flesh them out as credible, or at least likeable human beings? Tough luck, baby, here it’s ahegao up the ass for you!For those not aware of what I mean, “ahegao” is the term in Japanese for the orgasm face, which despite the definition is not relegated exclusively for porn, but also used in comedic fashion to convey when the character goes through emotional ecstasy. You might have noticed by now that Kakegurui is quite the fan of quantity over quality, and it’ll sure run that trope into the ground whenever it’s needed to convey that the fuck-sticks it passes for humans in the story are going through anything that might be classified as excitement. IT’L ALL THE BLOODY TIME! Whenever someone pull off some maneuver to outsmart or cheat their opponent in a gamble or even when it’s simply to explain the “genius” plan, they will pull off insane orgasm faces and laugh like maniacs. Of course, the biggest offender here has to be Yumeko, because someone up in Valhalla hates me.When it’s not ahegao, it’s contorted maniacal expressions every antagonist feels the need to break into when they feel superior and about to win on a game, or when they try to be threatening. It’s quite laughable, actually, when bunny-loli tries to pull one of these off, as if the show seriously thinks she is in any way the slightest bit scary. Seriously, any of the girls in the main cast can break her in half and this attempt from the show is just pathetic! Characters seem to break into such expressions almost to the same degree as the ahegao, as if to painfully remind you to not ever expect anyone here to have personality any deeper than a spit puddle, and that subtlety died and we buried its corpse when we allowed this disgrace to be written, published and animated. Along with the stupid story, the presentation here is another big problem for the anime, due exactly to the habits just mentioned.Is the voice acting of any help? Not really, although not as egregious as the horrendous faces, no character really demands anything more than two different modes of acting, so it’s nothing to write home either.Personal RamblingsIt genuinely felt like this anime was specifically crafted with the perfect combination of traits that can make my blood boil. From the sickening emphasis on the disgusting faces, to Yumeko’s insufferable “kind and innocent girl” demeanor, along with the inconsistent, impossible to buy into setting and the fact everyone here is a douchebag, this whole show was intensively infuriating to watch.I swear, I’m not really that hard of a person to please, and it’s not like I can’t enjoy a story where characters are also morally bankrupt or just outright evil. I mean, two of my favorites are Shiki and Black Lagoon, and I don’t think you can say the main characters in those shows are safely good people, what I ask is simply that the show frames that exactly as it is, not as if the horrible people on screen are supposed to be likeable or admired in any way. I am fascinated and genuinely find likability in well written morally ambiguous or evil characters, and I admire characters who display the responsibility and strength of morals I wish I had in my personality, but when the moral center of your story is a selfish, manipulative sociopath who can’t be trusted to have anyone’s well-being in mind, I say you got your priorities kind of backwards!Now, if you excuse me, I’ll look for something trashy to wash away this memory. consistency. Disregard all of those and the work starts to go sour for me. The worst offenses, though, are when the work becomes morally bankrupt, when it asks me to sympathize and side with people who are clearly contemptible. Kakegurui is one of those shows.Story and CharactersWell come to Hyakkao Academy, the land of insane teenage gambling, horrendous abuses of power and blatantly criminal acts of bodily harm.

In the follow up, Yumeko and Sumeragi discuss what just happens and the way their dialogue is frame tries to imply they had the moral high-ground, somehow. That last bit, to me, is the most infuriating part.Seriously, what exactly was Manyuda’s crime that was apparently so much more despicable in relation to the other students? Seitokaichou introduced a cast system that locks students into the role of cattle, where they remain subservient and bullied by other students, Sumeragi, who now we’re supposed to root for, used to rip people’s nails off, which basically amounts to torture, and Midari makes bets with people’s lives; Am I really supposed to believe that this guy is so much more deserving of having his livelihood and future sadistically crushed because he underestimates his fellow students? When did arrogance become the worst of crimes? I call this idea bullshit and this anime a hypocritical piece of toxic waste.By the way, the ending is a complete cop-out too.PresentationSo, do you like variety of facial expression for your characters to help flesh them out as credible, or at least likeable human beings? Tough luck, baby, here it’s ahegao up the ass for you!For those not aware of what I mean, “ahegao” is the term in Japanese for the orgasm face, which despite the definition is not relegated exclusively for porn, but also used in comedic fashion to convey when the character goes through emotional ecstasy. You might have noticed by now that Kakegurui is quite the fan of quantity over quality, and it’ll sure run that trope into the ground whenever it’s needed to convey that the fuck-sticks it passes for humans in the story are going through anything that might be classified as excitement. IT’L ALL THE BLOODY TIME! Whenever someone pull off some maneuver to outsmart or cheat their opponent in a gamble or even when it’s simply to explain the “genius” plan, they will pull off insane orgasm faces and laugh like maniacs. Of course, the biggest offender here has to be Yumeko, because someone up in Valhalla hates me.When it’s not ahegao, it’s contorted maniacal expressions every antagonist feels the need to break into when they feel superior and about to win on a game, or when they try to be threatening. It’s quite laughable, actually, when bunny-loli tries to pull one of these off, as if the show seriously thinks she is in any way the slightest bit scary. Seriously, any of the girls in the main cast can break her in half and this attempt from the show is just pathetic! Characters seem to break into such expressions almost to the same degree as the ahegao, as if to painfully remind you to not ever expect anyone here to have personality any deeper than a spit puddle, and that subtlety died and we buried its corpse when we allowed this disgrace to be written, published and animated. Along with the stupid story, the presentation here is another big problem for the anime, due exactly to the habits just mentioned.Is the voice acting of any help? Not really, although not as egregious as the horrendous faces, no character really demands anything more than two different modes of acting, so it’s nothing to write home either.Personal RamblingsIt genuinely felt like this anime was specifically crafted with the perfect combination of traits that can make my blood boil. From the sickening emphasis on the disgusting faces, to Yumeko’s insufferable “kind and innocent girl” demeanor, along with the inconsistent, impossible to buy into setting and the fact everyone here is a douchebag, this whole show was intensively infuriating to watch.I swear, I’m not really that hard of a person to please, and it’s not like I can’t enjoy a story where characters are also morally bankrupt or just outright evil. I mean, two of my favorites are Shiki and Black Lagoon, and I don’t think you can say the main characters in those shows are safely good people, what I ask is simply that the show frames that exactly as it is, not as if the horrible people on screen are supposed to be likeable or admired in any way. I am fascinated and genuinely find likability in well written morally ambiguous or evil characters, and I admire characters who display the responsibility and strength of morals I wish I had in my personality, but when the moral center of your story is a selfish, manipulative sociopath who can’t be trusted to have anyone’s well-being in mind, I say you got your priorities kind of backwards!Now, if you excuse me, I’ll look for something trashy to wash away this memory.', ""fuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint dry...this is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorrible this is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorriblefuck an actual review, this shit garbage, ass doo doo, don't watch it, id rather watch paint drythis is stankyhorrible"", ""I've never reviewed something that has yet to finish. Although I'm seeing a lot of premature high scores given by other users. I feel those reviews are based off enjoyment as there is no substance in Kakegurui. I'm going to explain why this anime is not worth any of your time.This is an in depth spoiler free (as much as I can be spoiler free) analysis of Kakegurui episodes 1-7.I wanna start off in a weird placeSound/Voice Acting: 4/10All of the voice actors feel amateurish and don't have that much flair. Characters like Yameko and Ryouta are passable but there are two...really bad voices for characters I want to address. I can tell Ms. Udono is trying but her voice for her character is just very unfitting and irritating. Now Udono doesn't have a lot of experience under her belt so I can't judge her too harshly but when making a big budget adaptation you should TRY not to get inexperienced voice actresses. Personally I blame the direction and irresponsibility of the studio over the low experienced actress.And one other voice that is just so fake and atrocious is borderline unbelievable. Like I was legitimately disappointed when I saw the voice actress for Midari Ikishima. It was none other than Mariya Ise herself. The VA for Stocking Anarchy and Killua in 2011's HxH. She is incapable of voicing this character. Her crazy voice is just as fake and poor as her crazy laugh. I find her performance in this work to be incredibly bad. Her tone and acting is so forced. Every scene hearing her is tedious. Now she's not working with a good script and the direction probably sucks but she's so much better than this.The music is good I guess. It's not perfect for every situation or memorable. The Op is good but it wouldn't find itself on any Top 100 openings. The low score on the sound is prominently due to the lack of solid actors.Story: 1/10They are in a school that allows gambling and that can decide your life for you if you get in too much debt. It's insane and there's been no good explanation. Midari is capable of carrying a weapon on campus and bullies try to rape other students in this high class school. The Student Body also are capable of inflicting bodily harm against the students without any repercussions. ( SPOILER example: Midari, who was threatened to have her eye taken out and took it out herself to prevent the shame and to get it over with. ) This show isn't like Prison School though. It wants us to take it seriously and adds no comic relief to the atmosphere. The author probably just didn't get the memo, that Prison School was a psychological comedy that didn't try to make you take its bizarre concept seriously but the dilemmas and punishments in Prison School gave a real sense of stakes and urgency. Prison School also had great characters, a lot of psychological elements, and was hilarious.Why it fails as a gambling anime:It stretches suspension of disbelief and doesn't give us insight on the reasoning behind the characters deductions. Yameko just tends to magically call out the cheating of her opponent with a contrived explanation that we never even get to see. Seeing Yameko's dissection of the cheat would actually add more depth to her character. Give you a sense of humanity and urgency in her. The thrills are also non existent. Every situation and stake is extremely low and since Yameko is the love child of a Gambling Mary Sue and Yuno Gasai (What an amazing combination) she will never lose that great of something. The most she'll lose is money but she throws that around so who cares? Even when she has a gun in her face we still know shes gonna be okay. She's perfect in every single way. Right? She never has really any human reaction. So we can't relate to her and put ourselves in her situation. Remember this.Every episode is VERY formulaic. Like same thing every time with almost no difference. This makes the thrills and stakes nonexistent. The show is extremely unentertaining unless you have underdeveloped taste or have turned your brain off. After thorough dissection there is nothing necessarily redeemable or well executed about this story. Which is extremely unfortunate because I like gambling and cute girls.Characters: 1/10Dear god. No character in this anime is anything more than one dimensional. Yameko is a perfect gambler who wins without even having to work for it. We don't feel any humanity in her. And because of this we cannot relate to her whatsoever. As she is completely emotionless until she starts shit talking. She has no depth or layers as a character. She is so perfect. She finds out the villains way of cheating without us even hearing or seeing it. And the anime isn't smart enough to where we are given the opportunity to figure it out ourselves. The opponent who is cheating gives a nonsensical, not-foreshadowed scheme in their head like any bland shounen villain. It's so convoluted. Yameko's only character traits are she's crazy but acts like she's not and she's a sore winner when she magically finds out how the opponent is cheating.A character I believed I would like's name was Meiri. As she is a cocky ass who contorts her face to bizarre, funny expressions in the first episode and acts like a boring shounen mustache twiddler until she is humbled by Yameko in that episode. I expected that by destroying Meiri in the first episode they were gonna build her character up through the entire season. Honestly, that's how you can make a cocky character like Meiri likable. Give them a taste of their own medicine. There is even a scene where Meiri is forced to clean up a mess, after being laughed at and left in the lunch room alone. I felt genuine sympathy because I felt like that would be a pivotal moment for her character. Then we see her accumulate EVEN MORE DEBT by the culture club representative and see that her pride is shattered and she is completely humiliated. But I clearly gave this show way too much credit. Now I thought this would lead to an arc where Meiri realizes she relies too much on cheating to gamble and gets too cocky before the cards are shown. And she'd blossom into this great, smart, analytic gambler. NOPE, SHES YAMEKO 2 BY EPISODE FUCKIN 4. She stays bland, stagnant and becomes another boring character.The final lead is Ryouta Suzui. He just... reacts and sometimes helps Yameko. Literally could be written out so easily. He's one dimensional too. He feels like a side character. I actually forget he's there sometimes.Everyone is one dimensional.All the antagonists and side characters are JUST crazy. Some are a lil crazier than the others. Like some will cum while playing. And I guess you're supposed to get intimated or aroused when the crazy girl cums when she's winning or thrilled. That's it. The insanity is so over saturated in the anime it stops being unique, entertaining, or unexpected.Which makes how everything plays out very boring and predictable.Art: 7/10The art is very reminiscent of Prison School but it doesn't go to the extent of Prison School or do it frequently enough. All the crude facial contortions happen on almost every character in the same situation with the same face so it's not well executed or unpredictable or entertaining or funny or intimidating, etc. The budget is very clear though and I can't say its not at least a 7/10 through aesthetic alone. As you kinda get the tone through the art even though the tone is super ridiculous in the story and scenario.Enjoyment: 1/10Now I don't mind anyone enjoying this but lets be real; this anime is horrible. Everyone is just enticed by the attractive character designs.And I tend to repeat myself but often the most serious criticism of a show is usually the kind you hear and throw around the most.It is a predictable, overly formulaic, shallow, boring, low thrills, poorly written, poorly executed, complete mess of an thriller anime with terrible characters who don't develop or evolve.Right now this is without a doubt one of the worst anime of 2017. Up there with Berserk and World End. I really did wish I could like this show but almost everything it tries and does fails miserably. really bad voices for characters I want to address.

Hell I’ve just been on this planet for a long time.Throughout that time I do not remember a situation where I was so fixated on one certain aspect that completely capitulated everything else.That is where I am with the faces in Kakugurui.These issues with obnoxious faces is nothing new for me and can be seen in my Daily Lives of High School Boys review as well as my opinions on Drifters.But Kakegurui has achieved a level of obnoxious faces into a territory that has not been explored that I shall deem as egregious...faces.The show’s art style is presented in a way that resembles sadistic hentai with these faces.I for one am not a masochist nor a sadist that will get enjoyment from an entertainment medium that way.I also am not a hentai fan so when add the sweat and the lips/drool helps take it to that egregious level.This shows theme is based on a school where gambling gets you to the top of the totem pole.I for one am someone who likes the game of poker. I watch the World Series of Poker every year. I even had a favorite poker player in Phil Hellmuth.So I was optimistic that at least like the action in Drifters I can find satisfaction in the gambling of the show.Unfortunately the gambling we got was a mix of redundant themes and girls over-powering on masochism.But even if the gambling was more satisfactory it is hard to enjoy any battle of strategy when your bombarded by egregious faces left and right.Now by this point I already had all these negative feelings towards Yumeko. This is more than just ""compulsive gambling"".So enter stage left a Yumeko on steroids named Midari Ikishima.During her dedicated episodes is where I just lost all hope for this show because when you put the theme of death into the show that changes everything.This isn’t about riding the economic train to the top of a gambling school.Your bringing in the theme that you can actually die in this school. That put that stake in the heart for the setting.Midari is apart of the student council that are the main villains of the show.They are a conglomerate of individuals that have come together to hold a monopoly on the school.The basis of the show is for Yumeko to take them down one by one.The entirety of the show continues to try and make the student council even more sadistic than Yumeko herself.They try to establish a higher-level sadism that is not accepted to make you not like these characters.But if you already have Yumeko pass that level the effect is just completely negated.When considering my rating for the show I need to remember that the bottom score is not a 0 but a 1.So to not give this show a 1 out of 10 are there enough aspects to push something up to a 2 and so forth.Basically every character was doing these gambling orgasms. It is the same issue the entire show.Even when they gave me an architype that I tend to enjoy in a villain in glasses.The enthusiasm dwindled away quite quickly thanks to once again from Yumeko’s gambling orgasms.So I can confidently say that the Characters, Enjoyment, and Art are all a 1 out of 10.I’ve already covered how the setting is disseminated. But we do have progression. There is an end game to the show.They do not waste much time with frivolous OVA content. That is something I can put up as a 2 out of 10.Now bringing it up to a 3 out of 10 is another story. There was a lot of empty transition from going to the next student council member.There also was never a proper hierarchy build out so I can understand the level of difficulty increasing.They don’t really have much time to build up to it though. Their goal seemed to be to have the main event match-up in this entry.I can settle on a borderline 3 out of 10 with the story.So what it comes down to is music. I tend not to deviate my music score much from the rest of the show.I tend not to value it that highly. The ending song is okay but I do have major issues with the performance from Tia in the OP.There was a real turn-off for me listening to this nasally running on voice she used in the song.I’ve skipped the OP every time since episode 2. So with that I’d have to give another 1 out of 10.I haven’t given a show a 1 out of 10 since 2015 and if I was going to pull the trigger to change that. Right now feels like the right time.I’ve never experienced something so off-putting in anime like Kakegurui and it is going to be a benchmark for me when it comes to off-putting themes.If anything is as off-putting as the egregious faces and gambling orgasms then it will be a contender for a 1 out of 10 on my rating scale.Some people are complaining about having an original ending but for me this was far gone before that. This is an abomination of the highest order! faces.The show’s art style is presented in a way that resembles sadistic hentai with these faces.I for one am not a masochist nor a sadist that will get enjoyment from an entertainment medium that way.I also am not a hentai fan so when add the sweat and the lips/drool helps take it to that egregious level.This shows theme is based on a school where gambling gets you to the top of the totem pole.I for one am someone who likes the game of poker.

This is an abomination of the highest order!', '(Introduction)A show about rich high school student, stupidly gambling there lives away for kicks but everything changes a little bit when compulsive Psycho Gambler with Red-Eyes Black Hair Jabami Yumeko enter the scene. To literally give the student council, who doesn’t do anything but sit around all day, an intense facial workout. Get ready to be amazed by Studio MAPPA\'s artistry, for almost every single character in this show have the ability to make ridiculously funny faces that will give Reddit some temporary memes to play with.Get mind-blown to the intensely good animated atmosphere of Kakegurui Gambling, which are the few things I found...respecting in this show. And If you ever get lost what the heck is going on during the middle of the gameplay, don’t worry, after every match, Jabami and the gang will explain everything in front of your face. So sit back and relax, don\'t think much. Which is kind of a shame because some games in the anime look original enough in my eyes that they seem like a very fun party game to crush your friends with.(Story/Plot/Writing) (4/10 Mediocre) (W/ Light Spoiler)When I read the anime synopsis for the first time, I found it kind of fresh. I barely see any high school anime that heavily focus on gambling and then after I finish it. I found it no different from any “Cliché Highschool” Tropes and I see it more stupid than your average high school anime. The show\'s main story in summary is about a new student that will rebel against the antagonistic “’ Student Council Hierarchy”. Our insanely daring protagonist will cross obstacles to reach the top to have a chance to rival the Big Fish of the school, this is not Kill La Kill Right?While actual School stuff is non-existent in this show. The majority of the time I only see students gambling around the school. And why would they even bother to study or do sport that will benefit their future if the school has a shitty ranking system that will only measure student performance base on their gambling skills? The school being a setting has lost its meaning. You can replace the school with a casino or a gambling den that requires its attendees to wear high school uniforms and you will not find any difference.The thing I found this anime stupid is the school is too dumb to exist. On all accounts, it’s a facility that raises scammers than potential elites that will benefit the country or the world. Yeah, you heard me right! 100 percent of the student who wins their gambling games cheat their way to win, just like in real life. A school that makes rich people lose their hard earn fortune because of their dumb spoil rich brats gambling away their money. Is that Legal? It\'s ridiculously funny and unreal. It made me remember an incident related to kids spending on their parents’ credit cards on microtransaction on videogames then eventually incurring massive debts in the process. This is literally what this pea brain student currently doing in the school. Lots of students get a quick buck sure but a lot of them lose a lot of money that they didn’t even own or earn by themselves.To me, if these students came from influential families or rich corporate bodies. Then in one way or another, the school gambling shenanigans can actually affect the economy. Imagine a large company supplying products, services, and jobs suddenly got bankrupt not because of natural economics but because their child accidentally bet 90 to 100 percent of the company stocks because why not! That will be hilarious to see.It also feels like a shounen anime where the protagonist gets friends along the way by savagely beating them up first. But in this anime instead of using brute force as a normal person will do to get what they want. Every conflict in this show is resolved by gambling. I can also say it’s similar to Yugioh but instead of stakes is getting vanish in the shadow realm when you lose. The person loses their dignity and tons of money. And sometimes block their freedom to choose what they want to do with their lives.If you are watching this show to learn how gambling works or to educate yourself on the pro and cons. Hoping to get the edge you needed to win big in your local casino or make a fortune in Las Vegas. I am sorry to tell you that’s not going to happen. The games they used in the gambling itself are not that even smart or impressively complex either in my opinion. I didn’t learn anything in this show because the game itself is so lazily written. The show has the balls to explain everything at the last minute just to say they didn’t magically win because the author showed them the script. I find it dull, boring, and uninteresting for the most part.(Characters Only Main to Talk About) (5/10 Average but Entertaining) (W/ Light Spoiler)Honestly, I don’t like any single character in this show. The only thing I find joy watching them, aside from the funny faces they make. Is the lunacy when they discover they did a lot of dumb things or realize they are incompetent people tend to: Overestimate their own skill levels, bunch idiots. A lot of people here have serious cases of the Dunner-Krueger Effect except for Jabami Yumeko, she is a mary sue in this show. She is never been wrong even though her behavior and motives are questionable on many levels.Side Characters on this show are more like archetypes in my eyes. They have personality but they don’t have any significant depth or identity of their own for me to care but they are entertaining to watch. Like for example, Jabami is the Marysue, Mary is a lesser Jabami, Ryouta is a walking mouthpiece, Midari is a bitch, Kirari is your typical Edgelord Student Council President, Runa is a Loli, Yume is a Pop Idol, Itsuki is a lesser bitch, and Kaede is your glasses guy. And to take account. What I said is not a pure spoiler by the way.If you watch the Opening of the show ""Deal with the devil"" by Tia or the very first episode. This will be definitely your first impression of them and if it is, congratulation they remain like that for the duration of 12 episodes. Don’t expect significant character development or changes. We do get some itsy-bitsy background story but that is what you have for putting some levels of depth on your characters. And Personally, that is not enough to make them memorable or stand out. It exposed how poorly written they are.(Technical Stuff) (Art & Animation 8/10 Very Good)( Music and Sound Design 6/10 It\'s Ok)I am going to compress all my opinion on the technical stuff here. My final verdict for the animation and music on this show is that it\'s good and very good in fact for a TV series. I think MAPPA did a good job in making the atmosphere of the gambling more enjoyable to watch and bonus points for the funny faces too. OP song is fun to watch but definitely not the music I want to listen to or kept in my music files. ED song is fine, fun to watch for 1 to 3 episodes and after that, I no longer care. Background music is also good in adding substances to the gambling vibes. And that’s the only positive I can say in the show if only the characters and scriptwriting were the same quality then it will be truly an enjoyable experience.(Enjoyment/ Bias Personal Opinion) (6/10 I still Enjoy even I have issues with it)I think I said everything why I found it enjoyable and annoyingly bad(Final Thoughts) (Overall 5.2/10 just an average flavor of the season type of show)I like anime when the stakes are high and the risk is very outrageous. Especially it is batshit insane at times. But in this anime, I really don’t see any heavy risk involve. It loves to use BIG NUMBERS! To show the audience how extreme the situation is but the problem, it really doesn’t properly demonstrate that you will take the situation seriously. It gives the illusion that a simple game has BIG consequences but in reality, it\'s not. It tries hard to become serious by hyper exaggerating a lot of stuff which ended up becoming funny than grim.Characters don’t serve as people in this world but are similar to crazy cartoon characters that are there to add aesthetic value to the show. Ever wonder why they look extremely slutty because that is their purpose in the first place. “Sex Appeal”.Ever wonder how casinos bait people into gambling even though people know in nature they might lose?Simple,” Money, Bright Light, and Colors and Sex”That is more than enough to hook a Man to GambleIn Kakegurui Case, that’s how it establishes its audience in the first placeOne of the oldest tricks in the book.And you got Scam! respecting in this show. And If you ever get lost what the heck is going on during the middle of the gameplay, don’t worry, after every match, Jabami and the gang will explain everything in front of your face. So sit back and relax, don\'t think much. Which is kind of a shame because some games in the anime look original enough in my eyes that they seem like a very fun party game to crush your friends with.(Story/Plot/Writing) (4/10 Mediocre) (W/ Light Spoiler)When I read the anime synopsis for the first time, I found it kind of fresh. I barely see any high school anime that heavily focus on gambling and then after I finish it. I found it no different from any “Cliché Highschool” Tropes and I see it more stupid than your average high school anime. The show\'s main story in summary is about a new student that will rebel against the antagonistic “’ Student Council Hierarchy”. Our insanely daring protagonist will cross obstacles to reach the top to have a chance to rival the Big Fish of the school, this is not Kill La Kill Right?While actual School stuff is non-existent in this show. The majority of the time I only see students gambling around the school. And why would they even bother to study or do sport that will benefit their future if the school has a shitty ranking system that will only measure student performance base on their gambling skills? The school being a setting has lost its meaning. You can replace the school with a casino or a gambling den that requires its attendees to wear high school uniforms and you will not find any difference.The thing I found this anime stupid is the school is too dumb to exist. On all accounts, it’s a facility that raises scammers than potential elites that will benefit the country or the world. Yeah, you heard me right! 100 percent of the student who wins their gambling games cheat their way to win, just like in real life. A school that makes rich people lose their hard earn fortune because of their dumb spoil rich brats gambling away their money. Is that Legal? It\'s ridiculously funny and unreal. It made me remember an incident related to kids spending on their parents’ credit cards on microtransaction on videogames then eventually incurring massive debts in the process. This is literally what this pea brain student currently doing in the school. Lots of students get a quick buck sure but a lot of them lose a lot of money that they didn’t even own or earn by themselves.To me, if these students came from influential families or rich corporate bodies. Then in one way or another, the school gambling shenanigans can actually affect the economy. Imagine a large company supplying products, services, and jobs suddenly got bankrupt not because of natural economics but because their child accidentally bet 90 to 100 percent of the company stocks because why not! That will be hilarious to see.It also feels like a shounen anime where the protagonist gets friends along the way by savagely beating them up first. But in this anime instead of using brute force as a normal person will do to get what they want. Every conflict in this show is resolved by gambling. I can also say it’s similar to Yugioh but instead of stakes is getting vanish in the shadow realm when you lose. The person loses their dignity and tons of money. And sometimes block their freedom to choose what they want to do with their lives.If you are watching this show to learn how gambling works or to educate yourself on the pro and cons. Hoping to get the edge you needed to win big in your local casino or make a fortune in Las Vegas. I am sorry to tell you that’s not going to happen. The games they used in the gambling itself are not that even smart or impressively complex either in my opinion. I didn’t learn anything in this show because the game itself is so lazily written. The show has the balls to explain everything at the last minute just to say they didn’t magically win because the author showed them the script.

Filled with eccentric and psychotic characters, one notable aspect is how the show sexualizes its characters, depicting them experiencing intense pleasure akin to orgasms during gambling moments. Even the show\'s outro doesn\'t shy away from this boldness, featuring closeups of the main character\'s ass and boobs, which seem to be for comedic effect. In essence, Kakegurui is more akin to Prison School\'s unrealistic premise than a gambling anime with high stakes.However, Kakegurui is nowhere near as funny as Prison School, and worse yet, its gambling aspects have zero stakes. The main character, Yumeko,...is overpowered and wins almost every gambling match, practically making the stakes zero. Yumeko only ever loses if they want to lose. Overpowered characters and winning with asspulls are entertaining in other anime, but in Kakegurui, it\'s lame because the story is too repetitive. They never add in slice-of-life, school, or romance-centered episodes. Every single episode is a gambling match. By the second season, the story starts getting too repetitive and predictable.Still, even with Kakegurui\'s flaws, I did enjoy the first season of Kakegurui - enough so - that I gave it an 8. I say it\'s worth checking out, but expect the story to get repetitive.

Now I take that back... My view changed from 6th episode and now after watching 11th episode, I thought I did a criminal act for belittling this anime as an atonement I am writing this review.I don't have much to say about it though. This anime gave me chills... Ahhh I get a chill through my spine when the characters clench their teeth and bet everything they have... literally everything. All emotions are illustrated in such a way that...you never feel bored. This is all about emotions... All about excitement.Thank you!! you never feel bored. This is all about emotions... All about excitement.Thank you!!"", '*No Spoiler Concise Review*TL;DR: If Kaiji and Shokugeki no Soma had a forbidden love child, you get Kakegurui: a show that throws all realism out of the window and the female MC orgasms every time she whispers ""Kakegurui"" or ""Let\'s Gamble.""[Story: 3/10 , Characters: 5/10, Art: 8/10, Sound: 6/10, Enjoyment: 5/10]What is Kakegurui? It\'s a psychological mystery anime where the MC, Jabami Yumeko, a transfer student, starts attending Hyakkaou Private Academy, a normal school by day & a gambling heaven/hell by night, whose sole purpose is to teach their rich spoiled brats in the art of dealing with money & manipulating people. This show throws...all realism out of the window and declares that the best gamblers are those who are addicted to gambling, not those who stay calm. This show is both sexy and risky. It\'s always fun to watch a naïve sexy self destructive intelligent gambler destroy and toy with the school government because she finds it fun and stimulating. Viewers will soon realize that the outcome will always be the same, yet it\'s the \'how\' that makes this show great. If you are into gambling and you love psychopaths yet cute characters then this anime is for you!The premise is very straightforward. It\'s your run-of-the-mill high-school anime where the MC wants to throw a wrench at the flawed school council system. This time the entire school council are epic/loaded Boss Gamblers. How do you get to the top? Through boss battles of course. Here\'s a fun fact, they are all cheaters, except the MC of course. She just wants to get her fix of orgasms through the thrill of gambling. The show revolves around Yumeko and Suzui, both archetypal foils of one another, trying to unearth the ""system"" and win the boss battles to reach the top, aka face the Student Council President. Although the start of the show was amazing, mid-way the story takes a huge nose dive of boredom and it barely comes back up with the anime having an original ending instead of staying true to the manga. Guess, MAPPA isn\'t fully sold on the success yet for second season despite going all out by bringing together director Hayashi Yuichiro (Garo: Divine Flame) alongside writer Kobayashi Yuichiro (Attack on Titan) and Akita Manabu (Fullmetal Alchemist\xa0) as character designer.Though the story is very predictable, aside from figuring out how each gambler is cheating, it\'s the characters that really fuels the fun in the show. The MC, Yumeko, is a naive beautiful kawaii girl on the outside but inside she\'s an intelligent yuri obsessed psychopath who needs to gamble to quench her compulsive gambling addiction. Juxtapose her with Suzui, her partner in crime, who is just there to make viewers feel smart because all the other characters in the show are psychopathic gambling geniuses. The members of the student council, despite being one-dimensional, are all unique from one another as seen through their gambling personality and the type of games they like to play. The epic Boss, President and Yumeko, if looked at closely, are just same psychotic characters on the inside except their outer characteristics are inverted from each other. Moreover, what really accentuates the characters in this show are the voice actors. The voice actor for Yumeko, played by Saori Hayami, just steals the show. Who knew the calm lady like seiyuu from AnoHana could portray the role of a horny psychopathic addict.Aside from its predictable story and one-dimensional characters, the show does a phenomenal job in the art, animation & sound department. Nothing short to be expected from studio MAPPA. The OP, Deal with the Devil, is actually a refreshing change from usual Jpop to classy jazz for that smooth chill vibe. The background score really heightens every tense mood in the anime and just overhypes every little reveals. The ED song is alright but not as good as the OP song. The character designs were toned down to reflect better on screen compared to the actual manga. However, the crazy psychopathic facial expression of each characters and the shrills that captures every thrills really hammers down the central slogan of ""Let\'s Gamble."" Hands down, the show has great camera working, much like Edgar Wright with its cut scenes that adds a lot to the plot. Moreover, the blended CGI animation with bold vibrant colours really brings out the inner psychopath that exists not only in the characters in this show but in our hearts.Overall, Kakegurui is just one of those crazy psychotic animes you want to watch because you love going on a thrill ride fully knowing the end destination. Though the anime will have an original ending the show is a faithful adaptation of the manga. If you love gambling and you love cute characters having earth-shattering pseudo orgasms while getting their gambling fix, give this show a watch. It\'s different yet same as other game related shows like Kaiji and NGNL. Anyways, give it a watch and tell me later how fast you caught on how the Boss Gamblers were cheating.P.S.

Thank you for reading. I hope you found this short and supaishi review helpful!', 'So, there’s this gambling den where people risk their future. Money is power in capitalism and the more you have the more powerful you become. Ok, it makes sense so far… And then it stops making sense because the gambling den is a freaking high school, where the only thing that is not going on in there is learning. Everybody is acting like a horny lunatic and the author wants us to believe the educational system is fine with letting its young people to become unstable gambling addicts.And yes, I know it’s not supposed to be a serious anime. It’s trash entertainment for immature people,...but I have seen many who tried to defend the show as a psychological thriller and a character study, by making it sound like it’s all about the effects of gambling on rich people, as well as how the whole thing is a social experiment aiming to create a new breed of super humans. All that are overshadowed by the constant ahegao faces everyone is making. It’s not a serious show, don’t believe the pretentious overthinkers. It’s a shitty ecchi series about people getting orgasms while gambling and the animation makes sure to point that out every 10 seconds. It’s sleazy fetishism with little to no substance, and those claiming it’s more than that, do it for the sole purpose of making it sound like the deviant crap they are watching are intellectual masterpieces.Back to the… plot if one can call it that, the status quo is broken by a transfer student. Of course. That is the only reason you need for having high schools in modern anime. Instead of having to be creative, you just let the plot write itself, by following the exact same formula, every single time.So, they gamble and the first game they play is a rehash from Kaiji. Only with no strategy since there is no way to know how many cards of each type there are. Which means it’s all random bullshit. They try to make it sound like there are tactics, but it comes down to dumb luck and how well someone is cheating at the games. Plus, the horny protagonist will always find a way to win, just because. As much as the theme tries to be an allegory for materialism, it fails to prove it by having it all coming down to a lucky draw. It’s not a smart show either.Furthermore, for a gambling series, there is no actual tension, since the only thing that is at stake is money. Fortunes come and go in every episode, and although that seems to be ruining the lives of those who become broke, we never see the effects of it, besides becoming errand boys for horny bitches in a high school. Woah, what a dreadful life it is to not have money, yet still going to a prestige school and doing a few chores for horny bitches, who are most likely having sex with you for the heck of it.If that wasn’t enough, the main girl in the show is so ridiculously rich to the point she doesn’t care how much money she wins or loses, therefore she is not really risking anything. Her objective has nothing to do with making money or making sure you are not going to lose them. The premise is betrayed almost immediately, since everybody gambles because they are addicted to gambling, and not because they risk everything for a better life, like in Kaiji.Down to it, the series is fairly one-note. There is no variety in personalities, since everybody is the same closet psychopath. The games differ but play out in the exact same way and don’t connect with one another, thus there is not much of a plot. There is not even much of a worthwhile objective. Every character is self-destructive, and has no long-term plans other than cumming in his underwear while gambling. It gets tiresome and cringy very fast. Rewatch Kaiji and don’t even bother with this one. but I have seen many who tried to defend the show as a psychological thriller and a character study, by making it sound like it’s all about the effects of gambling on rich people, as well as how the whole thing is a social experiment aiming to create a new breed of super humans.

Rewatch Kaiji and don’t even bother with this one.', ""Kakegurui is...really something. I can't think of too many series quite like it. It's not really my usual cup of tea, but a friend convinced me to check it out, and I'm glad I did. It's nice to branch out. To put it briefly, it's absolute madness from beginning to end, but that is what keeps it engaging.Kakegurui, is first and foremost about gambling. A bunch of the children of various rich shmucks all gathered together in a toxic cesspit of a school, where money and power are everything. After all, this school, as insane as it is, is only a tutorial for the manipulative...evil that the real world of the rich elite entails. In any case, this story differs from other gambling focused series in that it's not so much focused on the cerebral outsmarting of opponents, although there's plenty of that too. The main focal point is that literally EVERYONE IN THIS PLACE IS COMPLETELY INSANE! All of them should be in some sort of institution! Seriously, Suzui is probably the only sane person present, and I believe he's mainly there to offer some sort of reasonable perspective to all of this madness. Everyone else is some psychotic lesbian with a gambling addiction, narcissistic disorder, death wish or all of the above. This is the main driving force of the story and to me, it keeps it interesting and unpredictable till the very end.Everything is very over the top - visuals, sound, voice acting. All of this serves to depict the euphoric madness of the characters and their obsession with gambling. The overly detailed glowing eyes, the wacky flow of hair and clothes, the poses, the uncomfortably detailed animation on the mouths, all of it is very striking and serves the same goal. The characters are out of their mind, but they are all unique and very engaging. A lot of their backstories and character motivations are quite surface level, which is something that bothered me a bit, but their personalities shined bright enough for this not to matter too much. Another valid critique is that the central plotline is kind of weak, it's mostly just episodic chaos. Nonetheless, what is happening in each episode is intense and interesting enough to hold your attention. Granted though, sometimes there is so so so much dialogue in any scene, that it feels like characters just go on and on forever. But, I get it. There are a lot of unique games whose rules need to be explained, characters need to share their perspectives and motivations, it sort of comes with this type of story. Thankfully, the wild visuals and audio help move the dry patches of dialogue forward and the overexaggerated voice acting is a key factor to keeping it interesting too.Now, we have to also address the elephant in the room - the fanservice. There is a LOT of it here, so be prepared. There's a lot of lesbian tension between all the girls and a lot of suggestive poses, lots of touching, licking, kissing, sniffing, etc. There's plenty of eyecandy but I don't think it's too overbearing, especially compared to other lesser series. It at least also serves a plot purpose. It attempts to emulate the almost sexual pleasure that the girls derive from gambling, showing their extremely twisted and perverted perspective on life. It also fits that a lot of them don't view others as anything more than objects. Thankfully, the bulk of the horniness remains in the opening and ending, during the episodes themselves I think the sexualization is within reason and it serves a purpose.Overall, Kakegurui is a really unique series and that can be hard to do nowadays. I would say, although there are some flaws and some people might find the fanservice too much, it's a very interesting experience that showcases gambling in it's most insane and intense form, which I would say is much closer to how it really is for a lot of addicts. Definitely worth a watch! evil that the real world of the rich elite entails. In any case, this story differs from other gambling focused series in that it's not so much focused on the cerebral outsmarting of opponents, although there's plenty of that too. The main focal point is that literally EVERYONE IN THIS PLACE IS COMPLETELY INSANE! All of them should be in some sort of institution! Seriously, Suzui is probably the only sane person present, and I believe he's mainly there to offer some sort of reasonable perspective to all of this madness. Everyone else is some psychotic lesbian with a gambling addiction, narcissistic disorder, death wish or all of the above. This is the main driving force of the story and to me, it keeps it interesting and unpredictable till the very end.Everything is very over the top - visuals, sound, voice acting. All of this serves to depict the euphoric madness of the characters and their obsession with gambling. The overly detailed glowing eyes, the wacky flow of hair and clothes, the poses, the uncomfortably detailed animation on the mouths, all of it is very striking and serves the same goal. The characters are out of their mind, but they are all unique and very engaging. A lot of their backstories and character motivations are quite surface level, which is something that bothered me a bit, but their personalities shined bright enough for this not to matter too much. Another valid critique is that the central plotline is kind of weak, it's mostly just episodic chaos. Nonetheless, what is happening in each episode is intense and interesting enough to hold your attention. Granted though, sometimes there is so so so much dialogue in any scene, that it feels like characters just go on and on forever. But, I get it. There are a lot of unique games whose rules need to be explained, characters need to share their perspectives and motivations, it sort of comes with this type of story. Thankfully, the wild visuals and audio help move the dry patches of dialogue forward and the overexaggerated voice acting is a key factor to keeping it interesting too.Now, we have to also address the elephant in the room - the fanservice. There is a LOT of it here, so be prepared. There's a lot of lesbian tension between all the girls and a lot of suggestive poses, lots of touching, licking, kissing, sniffing, etc. There's plenty of eyecandy but I don't think it's too overbearing, especially compared to other lesser series. It at least also serves a plot purpose. It attempts to emulate the almost sexual pleasure that the girls derive from gambling, showing their extremely twisted and perverted perspective on life. It also fits that a lot of them don't view others as anything more than objects. Thankfully, the bulk of the horniness remains in the opening and ending, during the episodes themselves I think the sexualization is within reason and it serves a purpose.Overall, Kakegurui is a really unique series and that can be hard to do nowadays. I would say, although there are some flaws and some people might find the fanservice too much, it's a very interesting experience that showcases gambling in it's most insane and intense form, which I would say is much closer to how it really is for a lot of addicts. Definitely worth a watch!"", ""I've reviewed shows that have a bad reputation for their fanservice before, but Kakegurui is the first one of these that absolutely floored me. Its reputation should be completely ignored; not only is the fanservice not even that bad to begin with, but this series has so much going on under the surface that it's a non-issue. The show is consistently exciting (even if it's predictable at times, the presentation is top notch), the characters are captivating, and the animation is just... holy shit. They did not have to go in that hard on animating the facial expressions but by god do they make the...show. I can't think of anything else I've seen in anime that perfectly conveys the sheer weight of specific scenes as well as Kakeguri's animation, it is a PERFECT match.I had a strong feeling that Kakegurui would join my 10/10 club after the fourth episode, and 20 episodes later that viewpoint didn't change whatsoever.

This is one of the most boring anime series I\'ve watched, with the cast being filled with boring cliches and each episode following an extremely predictable path. The art is otherwise good but the overdone facial expressions (that have appeared multiple times in every single episode so far, rather than being saved for special occasions) really makes it look quite ugly at times.

Character design, animations and music has such a rousing style to it. It simply sucked me in as a viewer and the approach of Animation was almost perfect. I do absolutely adore character design though. It\'s beautiful and absolutely hot.Music is essentially ""stereotypical"" casino music, but did sound rather nice.

Please excuse me if I make a mistake or you don\'t understand a part, as English is not my first language. Thank you.Kakegurui is infinitely entertaining, but it has a flagrant flaw: the betsNetflix released Kakegurui today, an anime of the summer season and once completed, I understand perfectly why it was so popular. It is supremely fun.But that does not mean it\'s a perfect anime, far from it.As a gambling lover and quite familiar with the subgenre of manga and anime bets, I have to say that what Kakegurui gives us on entertainment takes...away from us when it comes to betting.There is the king of this subgenre Kaiji, but there are also other titles like Gambler Fish, Akagi that better handle the issue of betting. Not to mention Liar Game and One Outs, which although they are not specifically gambling, capture very well the feeling of risk after bets. But I will detail this point, first let\'s talk about this anime of 12 episodes with second season approved.Yumeko Jabami, Kakegurui\'s compulsive bettorSimplifying a little the plot of this anime, Kakegurui is the story of Yumeko Jabami, a girl who at first glance seems to be an elegant, educated and attractive young woman. A Yamato Nadeshiko. However, her true character is that of a compulsive player.By transferring to the private academy Hyakkaou, an institution that prides itself on preparing its students for the real world, promoting betting and gambling, Yumeko reaches its particular heaven. During the day it is a normal educational institution, but at the end of the classes the bets start and not only the money is at stake, so is life.But for Yumeko no matter win or lose, the important thing is the emotion of the bets, to gamble everything. The anime adapts the first 27 chapters of the manga and then adds an original ending that seems to give some closure to the story, but with a confirmed sequel we know it will not be like that.The first episodes are an introduction to the world of Kakegurui and its rules. In the school there are the ""humans"" and the ""pets"". Students who make financial contributions to the Student Council are considered human. Those who get into debt and are unable to do so, become pets. Men are called Fidos and women are Kitten, and are humiliated by their companions.As for Yumeko win or lose is irrelevant, falling to the status of Kitten is not important and in fact gives you more opportunities to bet everything at ease. On the way, she will make enemies and these will end up becoming her allies. The first one is Ryota Suzui, who is fascinated with her and her crazy way of betting.A story of bad people and Yumeko, the perfectAt the time of betting there are always two games, the one that is waged at the table and the mental game between the participants. In Kakegurui there is no shortage of cheating players and the complicated plans they make. However, the games themselves are easy enough to follow and understand. What is sometimes very superficial are the traps and especially the ways in which Yumeko disarms them. This becomes frustrating, because as a player our protagonist is too perfect and that is a problem.In a cast full of bad people, so bad that they come to look like caricatured villains, Yumeko is the one you can least identify with at times. This is because despite being the protagonist, the story is more narrated from the point of view of their rivals than from theirs. We never hear the voice in her head, we only know her plan when she reveals it before winning.Despite this problem, there is nothing to complain about the performance of her seiyuu, Hayami Saori, who manages to interpret the character perfectly. She goes from her role as a delicate lady to a seductive woman to a complete deranged woman. What really subtracts as a character is her lack of motivation beyond the game itself, and her infallibility as a bettor, thanks to her prodigious memory and observation skills.This is why characters that start looking cruel and abusive like Mary Saotome or Itsuki Sumeragi end up being more interesting than Yumeko. Midari Ikishima becomes really annoying and her behavior borders on the unbearable. However, she makes what is perhaps the only understandable emotional reaction of our protagonist: The anger of ruin the pleasure of a bet.MAPPA studios comes out wellAs for the technical section is where this anime shines. The direction was in charge of Yuuchirou Hayashi for Mappa, with character design by Manabu Akita. In this section there was a lot of fidelity with respect to the original art of Kawamoto Homura. The exaggerated and twisted reactions of the characters were very well captured, although their translation of the manga to animated format may be a bit excessive.The animation in general maintains a consistent level. There are few instances in which frame savings are abused. His bright and intense palette of colors goes perfectly with the design of the characters, far from the usual moe aesthetics of modern anime. The girls of Kakegurui do not look like girls, but women. It could be argued that they look like hentai exits, in fact.If there is any technical complaint, it was the use of 3D CGI in the animation of the hands, which could sometimes be annoying. However, the direction of the opening by Yamamoto Sayo is the true visual spectacle of this series. Added to the great song that is ""Deal with de Devil"" by TIA, we have the recipe for one of the best OP of 2017 (feel free to read my blog post on that).In fact, the music in general of this series, with its jazz vibes, is a strong point of this show. The ending is less attractive, but considering that it is precisely the final theme, it gives a little bit the same, we can skip it. Despite these complaints, we can say that the MAPPA studios comes out well in this adaptation with its failures, but of great quality.The problem betsReturning to the issue of betting, although Kakegurui has some fascinating psychological elements, with attractive characters and a little deranged -some perhaps too much- it is predictable on the bets.Even some may seem boring, if you remove the black humor and the caricatured evil of the characters. Along with the sexualization of betting, which also gives a touch of interest.Kakegurui tries to tell us that its bets are all or nothing, but it is a hoax. The value of what is the bet is not well defined, because Yumeko bets with such abandon that tension is felt only on occasions.If the risk is too great and the reward little, what is the purpose? It is true that Yumeko is a compulsive gambler, so these logical rules of betting do not apply to her, but it does not stop being wrong to exaggerately raise what is at stake.Also, being fair, Yumeko never loses. In her only losing bet she is in fact the moral winner and only lost effectively by the manipulation of someone outside the bet.For Yumeko what she bets does not matter at all. Being an addict, you can play life just for the excitement of doing it. Money does not matter to her, that they decide her life for her does not matter. Being humiliated does not matter. Basically lose does not matter and, being a millionaire, in the end the consequences for her are not such.An anime betting without consequences is not a good betting anime. But that does not mean that it is a bad anime, as I said, it is entertaining until rage. Perhaps the problem is that the real risk is not established, in large part because of how fast each bet is resolved. Even the confrontation with the President of the Council, Kirari Momobami, is solved in a very simple game and almost instantaneously, without consequences.Even so, I insist, it is so entertained by its twisted cast of characters and its subtext full of black humor, that I can not help but recommend it. Not for nothing I saw it in one sitting, it is ideal for marathons.SUMMARYKakegurui is easy to see in one sitting, this is testimony to how much fun it is. However, with a protagonist with whom it is difficult to empathize and with the total absence of risk in betting, it loses a little.Personal rating7.5/10 away from us when it comes to betting.There is the king of this subgenre Kaiji, but there are also other titles like Gambler Fish, Akagi that better handle the issue of betting.

Even though there could be a second season, because some of the things are still vague.Art: 9/10I don't have many ways of describing how beautiful they've made this anime, it has a LOT into it, I couldn't ask for better for an anime of mystery and drama !!!Sound: 9/10The music, the sounds all fit SO perfectly in the moments of suspense, and the opening is so well made that is one of my favourite ones now !!!Character: 8/10All the characters are so good the way they are until the end, you see from the start how they look like and it shows how they were not what you thought they were !! The only problem that I find about this anime is that it doesn't develop much about their past or their story, which is fine since it's only a 12 episode anime I won't ask to show all the past like Naruto.Enjoyment: 10/10I think I've enjoyed it way too much, if you are going to watch it, be prepared for the suspence that won't let you breathe !!Overall: 9/10Such unique anime, it is just like nothing you've seen before, all of it just fits so perfectly, the art, the story, the sound, are just amazing and again, I couldn't ask for more for an anime that has 12 episodes.I think I've found it really unique since this year we had a lot of animes that just look like ripoffs of some others, and I think if you watch it until the end you will enjoy it.I gave it 9/10 because of the character development is not perfect, season 2 would make sense and I would come back to change all this.Sorry if I repeated myself too much even thoough this is not an excuse, my mother tongue is not english, I've tried my best to express myself and I hopefully made you guys look forward to watch this one ! now find it fun cause you can put something on the line and be excited about it either you win or lose !!!Story: 10/10Oh boy oh boy, this one is what I consider a masterpiece, the plot is  amazing cause it's the first time I've seen an anime with gamble in it and found it exciting (I've watched No Game No Life and loved it BUT this one I consider more exciting because of the enviroment).Its all about a girl that wan't to gamble for her life and be excited about it as well as other characters !!!

The thrill of the game is what matters. She’s a compulsive gambler, after all.Hyakkaou Private Academy is a place that only the children of the richest can go. It’s an institution with a very peculiar curriculum: it isn’t based on the regular school matters, neither on athletic prowess of the students. Rather, it is based on making the rich richer. So, what ability is revered when it comes to business? Reading your adversary. That’s the pillar of stock market bets. Then, what...does Hyakkaou have that is so special it creates this competitive ambience of betting? They revolve around gambling.Blackjack, poker, roulette or even rock-paper-scissors, everything can be made profitable, everything can be made payable. Here, one starts drowning in debt before university – or swimming in money. In this academy, the winners and losers are very separated. If one loses a match, they got attached to the person who won, like a slave, having a chain collar with a plate written “loser” so everyone can see their condition. The Student Council isn’t better, in fact, it’s harsher on gambles, with more than the financial debt as a problem; they often put more consequences on the games, such as arranging marriages and forcing people to not live their lives as they want, everything according to their “Life Plan” designed to the students who lose by playing against them.But this oppressive system isn’t the only problem: many of the students -- and that includes the ones from the Council --, are what they call “corrupted”, or, in other words, a compulsive gambler. Some drown in debt by not thinking before playing, some are intelligent and get better, and some don’t care about money, life plans, or any other consequences at all -- including death --, and that is what makes Jabami Yumeko so special, because no one can manipulate her through games, making her a challenge to the current system – the only thing someone can trick her  into is to feel the frisson of the games.To counterbalance her impulsiveness, hesitant Suzui Ryōta becomes “the voice of reason” (or sanity) in this place filled with craziness. But, of course, he’s never listened to. And that’s what makes him an important character because he finds himself needing to work around difficult situations in which sanity or wisdom don’t help.To finish the main pack of characters, Saotome Meari is the not compulsive, but greedy gambler. Greedy in a way that she feeds off this system, loving the power that it offers to the winners. Living like a queen, she is the blueprint student of her academy, until important events make her reconsider how she plays in this jungle of cheaters, enablers, kings and slaves.The anime revolves around this trio, either combining them to make unthinkable plays or simply to put both extremes of taking risks and being afraid to test. The trio starts relating, not aware of that, but drawing the attention of other students, from common ones to higher-ups – including the head of the Student Council, Kirari Momobami --, but not without reason: Jabami Yumeko is a new animal in this jungle, bringing new habits and spreading havoc by her compulsive yet mastermind plays. And something about the plays must be said.On the beginning of a game, Yumeko is like an unarmed kitten, knowing nothing, but by the end of the day, the kitten has manipulated everyone to bring it food. That’s how Jabami sucks all that is near to her, as a hurricane of madness, to the point of completely changing her complexion, from her normal, round, dreamy eyes to slanted, cold calculating globes, turning them into igneous rubies, and her face into a crooked inhuman grimace, sending the signal of the definite presence of her madness and her control of any game that she’s in.Besides her eyes, another mark of the visuals of the anime is distorted facial expressions. They generally appear on people who are humiliating others, either by game or socially. The distorted complexions give a unique touch to Kakegurui, pinching the viewer’s and defining the atmosphere of the Academy, its hostility carved in the faces of the students.Furthermore, the things are not so black and white – although one can define “to gamble or not to gamble” as a dilemma --: the motives for gamble are varied, they can range from people trying to save their families’ debts to lunatics rebelling against the world for no reason, and this variety is shown on the multitude of characters. Each personality, each resolve, each way of playing, everything becomes a web of interests. Not without a main tone, however. The cast always strives to the most common desires of the human nature: power, status and, of course, money, everything as the underlying cause, and, evidently, under the Hyakkaou Academy ruthless structure.Kakegurui is a work of psychological thriller that uses gambling as a stage to play its overarching theme: human corruption and mind games, not in the superficial, petty sense, but in the grim, wicked and limitless ways that only money and power can create the drive for. The viewer might appreciate the “last straw”, “twist” moments in the anime, when the tables can (and will) be turned at right (or wrong) moments, rapidly, a mismatched look or a misplaced arrogance and maybe wishful thinking, but always with a daunting psychological strategy. The key here is to use the characters as wells and bring viscerally everything from them, pouring them on the table, on the games, showing all wickedness and desires that can only be shown when despair occurs. After all, the thrill of the game is all that matters. does Hyakkaou have that is so special it creates this competitive ambience of betting?

A suspenseful series about gambling is definitely not something that I\'ve seen before.  But does it pay off?Story: Kakegurui starts us our with Ryouta Suzui, who is currently so far in debt that he gains the title of a ""house pet"" - one so far it debt that the students must comply with those up the food chain.  He is eventually released from this title when a new student, Yumeko Jabami, enters the scene and...beats his ""captor"" in a gambling match.  Yumeko gives Ryouta enough of her winnings that he is no longer so far in debt to the student that he previous lost to.  This teases you with what to expect of the story the series.  It\'s certainly unique, but unfortunately, there\'s only so much you can do when your series is only about gambling.Kakegurui takes place at an academy, but the school elements are completely absent.  You don\'t really see any teachers, but instead, just the students.  The student council oversees academy operations - you have your typical positions like president and treasurer - and also play gambling games against other students.  Those on the council are expected to win.  Failure to do so results in losing out on your prestigious position.  One such problem is that the series doesn\'t really explain why those positions are so sought after.  It sort of just implies it comes with a lot of regulatory power.  I thought it was a little silly, and the series just makes those on the council come off as those that are willing to bet the biggest pot.So the question comes off - is this series really a thriller?  I would say it definitely tries, with mixed results.  During the course of the series, Yumeko challenges student after student to their own gambling game.  It\'s of their own creation and she mostly plays by their rules.  The nature of these matches almost makes it feel like a survival series, where if you don\'t win your next game, you could be ""out"".  Yumeko\'s tactics are far from perfect, but that adds another tense layer to the series.  Yes, she\'s not flawless.For all the hype, Kakegurui just didn\'t have enough high points for me.  The series tries really hard to make every scene seem meaningful, but there were definitely times where I went ""well this is getting just a little too silly"".  Midari\'s game was one that could have had a high to it, but completely flopped when all was said and done.  Yumemi\'s never felt like it could get going.  And then the final game felt entirely too predictable.  There\'s potential in all of them, but each episode simple does not deliver from a story aspect.  (6/10)Characters: Kakegurui\'s characters aren\'t the deepest for sure, but there are some winners that can be found.  Yumeko was one that I actually didn\'t mind.  She gets off on gambling so much that she starts to throb and make weird poses, but is extremely intelligent.  She observes the situation before her, and effortlessly finds the gap in her opponent\'s plans.  She\'s extremely unstable, but when not in a gambling environment, seems like a decent person in general.  Ryouta is basically the observer after the first few episodes, filling in gaps that the audience might not otherwise notice.  His role is very clear here and the fact that he didn\'t point out needless garbage prevents his role from really sinking.  I really enjoyed his inclusion here.  Mary Saotome hangs around Ryouta and Yumeko really early on, but I didn\'t really catch what her role was.  She seems like an okay character, but other than her predictable reactions to Yumeko, I didn\'t think she added enough.Kirari Momobami is the student president and we don\'t get a ton of insight into her.  The ultimate game is said to be had by facing her, but while she does seem intimidating, is there anything she does that the rest of the council doesn\'t?  This makes them all kind of meld together in your mind, as their objectives are all the same, and they go about their business in the same manner.  Sure, I thought as a group, they seemed threatening, but once you\'ve seen one, you\'ve really seen them all.  Sure, each council member had their own game, and clear strengths, but they were always just okay.  (5/10)Art: MAPPA, has a knack for creating amazing looking series and Kakegurui is no different.  This series looked really good, down to the darkest times that this series had to show.  The only thing I could live without were the weird character poses - especially from Yumeko.  (9/10)Sound: While Netflix series in general leaves more to be desired from a story standpoint, they really do tend to come through on the VO cast.  This series sports an incredible cast with big names up and down the list - and they were all amazing.  This is an extremely impressive performance by Erika Harlacher-Stone (Yumeko) and Sarah Williams (Midari).  They were easily the best here, and really bring it to the series.  Griffin Burns (Ryouta), Erica Mendez (Itsuki), Erica Lindbeck (Sayaka), Chris Niosi (Kaede) and Kira Buckland (Mary) are also very impressive.  Netflix series always have the top VOs, credit to the VO directors (John Swasey & Steve Staley), a reoccurring pattern with the former.  I didn\'t much care for either theme songs, but they fit into the series well enough that it wasn\'t an issue.  The music seemed fine with some standout tracks, but overall was just kind of there.  (9/10)Overall: Kakegurui is a very different series, but I just didn\'t think it had enough high points to it\'s colourful, though predictable, cast and settings.  It feels like the moments that it had should have been better than they were, and the shallow cast of characters didn\'t help it either.  Still, it had some okay moments that makes this series and okay watch if you really like seeing a thriller with a gambling theme to it.  (6/10) beats his ""captor"" in a gambling match.

(6/10)', ""Kakegurui is an anime with a simple, average plot we've seen quite a few times, with a theme of Gambling!School going on, rather typical execution of the said plot with few to no actual surprises, and a whole lot of absolutely bat*hit insane characters who coincidentally make the supreme reason why this anime is worth the watch. I'm sure we have all seen countless shitty plots in which school X is special because of the Y and that's where it ends, while the romance/harem/shounen plot goes on between empty, boring, BORING characters.Luckily for us, Kakegurui knows where its strong points lie and makes room for...cool games and insane bets (or was it the other way around?). While not the masterpiece of anything, really, Kakegurui manages to be both interesting with the truly cruel and engaging concept of gambling as presented in the anime and hilarious with it's questionably clinically insane characters, way too detailed animation and way too invested voice acting - all paying off as the quality over-the-top experience.It is very easy to invest yourself in it, enjoy it all to the max and yet realize it is truly not all that great - in a way, it's what makes it so good.  It's not trying to be the master of an art but is rather a jack-of-all-trades, using an old concept and working on everything around the old concept to bring a bit different, enjoyable experience to the table. cool games and insane bets (or was it the other way around?).

It's not trying to be the master of an art but is rather a jack-of-all-trades, using an old concept and working on everything around the old concept to bring a bit different, enjoyable experience to the table."", ""At first glance Kakegurui is an anime about a high school for rich students where they gain and lose status by gambling, and you can watch it as such, as the matches are intelligent and exciting. But it is quite obviously a satire, social criticism, about roles people get forced into, in working life, through gender roles etc., about oppression, humiliation, ostracism, psychological, physical and sexual abuse and, of course, money and power, tose who are born with them, those who cheat to gain them, those who gain them with pure recklessness and maliciousness, those who abuse them.You might probably have guessed by now, this...anime is not for the faint-hearted, there are a few cruel scenes.I seriously hope nobody gets all infuriated feeling the setting/premise is too unrealistic and implausible, just as with Gulliver's Travels (also a satire on human nature and society, well, the book at least) taking it too literal is not the point here. For once, the almighty Student Council is actually justified, as it is symbolic/figurative.I'm glad, Kakegurui's got a real female main protagonist, at first I thought the male protagonist would be the main, as with those anime with one or more female protagonists who advance the story, but a male narrator/main protagonist (e.g. Haruhi Suzumiya).From my point of view this series doesn't have any major shortcomings, I enjoyed it very much, the story is smart, most characters are interesting and you get to understand their motivations and thought processes very well. Characters tend to be a little one-dimensional, but that's a given in a satire. Music, voice acting and art is very good, too, and most importantly, very fitting reagrding the story and its mood.As you might have noticed there is a second season to be expected, thus you shouldn't expect an ending that ties up all loose ends, but it gets close enough. Definitely no cliffhanger in the middle of a game or something like that.I recommend Kakegurui to anyone who likes dark, shrewd, twisted, satirical stories, with characters that are even more twisted. anime is not for the faint-hearted, there are a few cruel scenes.I seriously hope nobody gets all infuriated feeling the setting/premise is too unrealistic and implausible, just as with Gulliver's Travels (also a satire on human nature and society, well, the book at least) taking it too literal is not the point here. For once, the almighty Student Council is actually justified, as it is symbolic/figurative.I'm glad, Kakegurui's got a real female main protagonist, at first I thought the male protagonist would be the main, as with those anime with one or more female protagonists who advance the story, but a male narrator/main protagonist (e.g. Haruhi Suzumiya).From my point of view this series doesn't have any major shortcomings, I enjoyed it very much, the story is smart, most characters are interesting and you get to understand their motivations and thought processes very well.

Whats not to love?Story:Suzui, one of the main characters, is shown getting his ass handed to him in the game where he becomes the dog of one of the other main characters, Saotome. Shortly after, the third and most prominent MC of the show appears, Jabami Yumeko. Yumeko then proceeds to destroy everyone's will to live as she continually beats person after person in intense gambling matches.Characters:Aside from Suzui, you could pretty much pin down every other characters personality to being absolutely insane. Sadism...and Masochism also play a large role as you can easily fit 99% of the characters in this show into one of those two categories. Other than that, their personalities stemmed from how they sated their weird gambling fetishes (Such as Sumeragi collecting humans nails, or Ikishima gambling to die).Art Style:Not too unique but not too genericl should aptly state what the art style looks like. But the art accommodates for the ultra edge that was this show, and it left for some pretty vile but very intriguing facial expressions which only made the show more enjoyable to watch.Enjoyment:I heavily enjoyed binging the whole series on an empty weekend, I think that this is one of those shows where you can only fully appreciate what the creators were trying to do if you watched it all at once.Final Verdict:9/10This show was hilarious at it's over the top moments and it always had me wondering how Yumeko was going to get out of yet another insane situation.

Amusement.I'm not saying that's a bad thing though, in fact, I enjoyed this anime a ton and if a second season were to come out I'd definitely watch that too. I'd suggest this anime to anyone who enjoys character based anime that revolve less around a plot and more around characters. I'd also suggest it to people who enjoy overdramatic scenes and high school anime with a twist.Now to go over each aspect...Story:The story is where this anime really lacked. It began with the...hints of a plot but in the end stuck to over dramatic scenes and showdowns every episode. That said an anime doesn't need to have a perfect plot to be fun to watch. The story wasn't good or bad, it just wasn't there. You could say the relationships the characters made was their story but even then it's a stretch. If you only watch anime for a good story this anime is not for you.Art:This anime's art style was enjoyable, to say the least. With producers like MAPPA who's more current anime have had art that's won awards (Best Animation of YoI in the Anime Awards) and very few anime that run short of eye candy. The character designs were interesting and not one character (besides the male MC) seemed to look boring. Besides character design the animation was smooth and the art was fun. The only downsides to the art were the unnecessary ecchi scenes and almost mediocre designs. Although I have nothing to complain about towards the art I also can't say it took my breath away.Sound:Well recorded, clear and fun. The voice actors were not boring and played their characters well. The sound was not muffled or distorted and the volume never felt like it was unbearable or blowing out your eardrum. Background music was fine but nothing special.Character:The characters were fun and quirky. Personally, I think the characters are the only reason the show can be rated above a five. The cast is colorful and the interactions between characters is really what makes the show. The only downside is that no characters really get much personality or dimension and several characters are used as stepping stones for the gain of characterization of other characters. Overall the characters really make this anime worth a watch.Enjoyment:I personally really enjoyed this anime. It didn't have much meat to the story but the characters and setting made it fun to watch. It's as simple as the interactions between the characters that made this anime fun for me and the premise of gambling brought in an unexplored topic in the world of anime. It was a creative anime that I'd suggest to people who can ignore a lacking plot and unneeded ecchi to enjoy fun characters and interesting dynamics. hints of a plot but in the end stuck to over dramatic scenes and showdowns every episode.

But hey, for them Japs anything in school uniform just looks better, so just like any anime, manga, light novel or game sim would never be complete without one, but then again for those who made a very long review of this anime only to gave it a 4, simply just don\'t have...to watch it if they think that this thing is garbage in the first place. In fact this in one anime where you can forget all that anachronism and just focus on the character and the game, so........Story, Good 7.Ok so the plot setting was in a school except it was more like as one reviewer put it a ""Gambling Den"" , where all bets are in as soon as you enrolled  and every student at one way or the other would have to play and bet anything and everything, and the student councils were more like the Mafia who runs it and enforces penalties to the losers . Which is where  Yumeko Jabami comes in, cu\'z here, she is the story plot and the student councils where the means to the end of this plot, which what makes this category good, since one would feel such delight of seeing the losers in their face when they face with Yumeko Jabami, SSSSAAAAAAA SHOULD I SAY MORE???????????Art, Good 7.when it come to fanservice , one can only see it in Mary when she cross her legs while sitting on Suzui in the opening theme and with Jabami in the closing theme. Ok so when the characters are in their poker faces and serious faces, one can simply just screw the fact that they were teenager and just focus on the facial expressions, and it was those facial expressions that gives this anime it\'s pizzazz, where one can almost feel what the characters felt when the outcome is near, be it for the losers or for Jambami herself.Sound, Very Good 8.It isn\'t the opening nor the closing that gives this anime it\'s pizzazz, rather it was the tone and the kind of enunciation of the characters voices that gives such enjoyment of this anime , whether it\'s the voice of despair or the excitement of the outcome, one can really feel the monologue of the characters voices as they speak with such emotions .But what I like was Midari\'s scene in episode 4 where it goes like this ""SHIT!"" (Thud) Punching the toilet door, ""FUCKING BASTARDS!!!!"" (Thud, Thud Thud) banging the toilet door repeatedly, (Heee, Heeee, Heeee) Breathing deeply an sitting down on the toilet sit, (Heeeeee) breathing slowly while looking at her gun, ""Once.....Let\'s just do once""placing the gun on her temple ""One in Six........a one and six chance"" saying over and over again (Click) pulling the trigger (HAAAAAAA, AHHHAAAAA, HAAAA) Breathing deeply and fast (Tick) pulled the trigger, no bullet, ""WHAAAAAAAA,HAAAAA, WHAAAAAA, EHEEEEE!!!!!!!"" Whaling loudly, ""THIS, THIS IT IT!!!!""""HERE RIGHT NOW, I\'M ALIVE!!!!!!!""  ""THIS SENSATION!"" (Lick) licking the gun\'s barrel (Sqik, Sqik, Sqik) playing her pussy, and enjoying it ""AMAZING!!!!"" (Sqik, Sqik,Sqik) still playing her pussy and moaning wildly and maybe inserting her gun into it after which she says ""Jabami Yumeko isn\'t it?"" then she went out of the toilet uttering the words ""I\'ll let you pay me back in full"", that is my favorite scene and the score was for that.Character, Great 9.Ok, so lets go over them characters:Jambami Yumeko- The MC, the compulsive gamble, to call her a ""compulsive gamble"" is a wrong statement, and I did say ""wrong"" cu\'z she isn\'t a compulsive gamble but a trill seeker who is in it for the trill, also she is a bit of a sadist cu\'z she also enjoys  seeing how her opponents react when she see thru their cheats,  their defeat and their anxiety. Basically if you\'ll look at the very definition of Compulsive Gambling in the dictionary, she simply doesn\'t fit the bill, instead she fits the bill of someone who derives sexual pleasure from standing out, so much so that whether she wins, deals or loses she was able to turn the tables around with such orgasmic proportions  which is pretty impressive for original creator Kawamoto Homura to conceptualize.Suzui Ryota - Ok so he\'s the quintessential nice guy, in fact too nice that at the start of the anime or manga, we see him being Mary\'s bitch and one can only sympathizes with him for all the mistreatment she get\'s from her and her lackeys. It wasn\'t when Yumeko arrives that he\'s finally free and now has become her bitch, though he does get better treatment from her than with Mary. Now the thing about him was that he really did play the role well as Yumeko\'s bitch, as a her bitch he basically serves as her conscience where he from time to time would try his best to keep Yumeko out of any situation but often it proves to be useless, so basically all he can do is just be in her side since he\'s a pussy who can only be an obstacle against anybody to Yumeko and that\'s what how his cookie crumbles.Mary Saotome- At first we would wanna see her get owned and get owned it did, big time, where we enjoyed seeing her being in Suzui\'s shoes, too bad he was just too nice to get back on her for all of the mistreatment, but one thing about her character, was the redemption, when we saw her getting out of being a pet and no longer taking shit from others, all thanks to Yumeko for partnering up with her. Though, she did become Yumeko\'s friend , she was more like a lackey than her friend, make that a lackey where one can\'t say if she is with her cu\'z she want\'s to see Yumeko kick the class president\'s ass or just something who was probably waiting on the sides.... for something.Sumeragi Itsuki- Her\'s was a different story from Mary, since after her defeat from Yumeko, she joins her posse cu\'z she got kicked outta the student council . Now, she was obviously an opportunist, cu\'z she knows she has a lot to gain from being with her instead of being Manyuda Knade\'s lackey, which she got when Manyuda got owned, seeing her being nervous to the point of wanting to pee, to the point of her contemplation and to the point of enjoying his defeat from Yumeko was somewhat her way of getting back at him for treating her like tool when she is no longer of used she get\'s thrown away. Frankly those final moment of  her climax really would dig in to us, as if we ourselves were in that moment.Yuriko Nishinotouin - She maybe an antagonist, were we hoped that Yumeko would get to owned her, but as it turned out, she\'s a good antagonist cu\'z she is keeping her lackeys from being pets at the cost of other students, now her, we can see her dilemma. Too bad, that\'s where Yumeko loses...or did she intentionally loses to save her and her lackeys, now I don\'t know, but it was good that the original creator didn\'t play safe with Yumeko\'s character.Igarashi Sayaka - As Momobami Kirika\'s lesbian bitch, she one to be hated, too bad we didn\'t get to see her master get owned , cu\'z seeing her cry would have been very very good.Ikishima Midari - Ohhhhhh, she one very dirty lusty bitch and a crazy one too, quite frankly, if this anime / manga has a hentai element she would fit right it. One thnig about her, was that she doesn\'t have to be naked to get our mojo jumping, just seeing her play her pussy and moaning would have been enough to give us a mojo high... let\'s see I wanna put her monologue scene from episode 4:"" SHIT SHIT!"" (Thud, thud) Punching the toilet door, ""FUCKING BASTARDS!!!!"" (Thud, Thud Thud) banging the toilet door repeatedly, (Heee, Heeee, Heeee) Breathing deeply an sitting down on the toilet sit, (Heeeeee) breathing slowly while looking at her gun, ""Once.....Let\'s just do once""placing the gun on her temple ""One in Six........a one and six chance"" saying over and over again (Click) pulling the trigger (HAAAAAAA, AHHHAAAAA, HAAAA) Breathing deeply and fast (Tick) pulled the trigger, no bullet, ""WHAAAAAAAA,HAAAAA, WHAAAAAA, EHEEEEE!!!!!!!""

(Lick) licking the gun\'s barrel (Sqik, Sqik, Sqik) playing her pussy, and enjoying it ""AMAZING!!!!"" (Sqik, Sqik,Sqik) still playing her pussy and moaning wildly and maybe inserting her gun into it after which she says ""Jabami Yumeko isn\'t it?"" then she went out of the toilet uttering the words ""I\'ll let you pay me back in full.""Kiwatari Jun- What I like about him, was how he git owned by a Mary and Yumeko tandem where he get\'s demoted to a much lower pet category of that of  Tsubomi whom he treats like shit.Yumemite Yumemi - She is a quintessential idol, whom I also hate, too bad she doesn\'t get to be buried in deeper shit when that voice recording was played.Yomozuki Runa - The quintessential loli, but not just any  loli, rather she one bad loli who no one would mess around, really. grown up scare  shit of a loli? Shit, I\'d wish Mary would have given her some spanking when she confronted the student council about her life plan.Manyunda Kaede - Shit , he\'s has to be the main course, either way, I like that way that he got lure into betting his life, and now Sumeragi owns his life , too bad he\'s in s coma, when will he wake up, I\'d say he\'s better off dead......btw, his face of shock was amazing, especially when he lost big time.......Momobami Kirari- Now her versus Yumeko, was a disappointment, cu\'z it end in a draw, I would have love to see her walk out of school in shame, that is if she would have lost to Yumeko, about her twin sister Ririka, damn, we did\'t even get to see some action with her.Enjoyment, Very Good 8.If you have an anime like this , where the climaxes were intense, one would enjoy this to the max, so.....Overall, Outstanding 10.You can forget all that anachronism and all minor details, cu\'z this anime is evil and cruel, but wtf it\'s outstanding........Season 2???? HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!!!! to watch it if they think that this thing is garbage in the first place.

HELL YEAH!!!!!!!!!!!', ""'Kakegurui' is the first anime I watched after reading the manga. It is a fantastic adaptation from its original form. When I started to watch it, I didn't thought that the story, the art, etc would fit in so well as it did in the manga.The story is really interesting, the way everything is put up together is simply amazing. Jabami, aparently naive and shy, turns out to be a 'psycho' girl who loves to gamble and enjoy it risking, many times, her own life. She give a new meaning to the word 'courage'.As for the art, besides being slightly worse than the manga, is...good and reaches perfection mixed with the sound and the characters themselves.I'm happy to say that I enjoyed very much watching this anime. I wish they would make a second season, to be honest, but I think the ending, not fateful to the manga, made a good end to the anime itself. I would recommend it to everyone who likes drama, psychological and games.Overall rating: 9 good and reaches perfection mixed with the sound and the characters themselves.I'm happy to say that I enjoyed very much watching this anime.

Adrenaline, excitement and many other feelings are what we should apparently feel while we play for money and for even more important things, according to this anime. However, this one absolutely fails to deliver these emotions to its viewers due to its numerous flaws and its terrible execution.One of the main problems resides in the setting in which the story takes place. What do we really know about it? Students are gambling in a school to be ready to enter the real world, described as a terrible...place made of money as well as ambitious, greedy and selfish people. Yeah, interesting, but how does it work? People will tell you: “Uh, they gamble a lot of money, and when they have no money left, they become “pets”, which means they have to do what other students tell them to do. Their future even gets planned by the council student when they are really dried up! Talking about it, the council student is reserved to the elite, its members are la crème de la crème of this school, that’s why they can decide on everything.” I don’t mind having a surrealistic setting, if it has a purpose and it is well established. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Everything, I mean, EVERYTHING is exaggerated: the sum of money the students are able to gamble, their reactions, their faces, and so on. The only goal it has, and, honestly, it is a goal the anime isn’t even able to achieve due to an important issue I will mention in the next paragraph, is to “shock” the viewer, such as jump scares in horror movies. It tries to make him care for what’s happening on the screen, to enforce him to feel what the characters are supposedly feeling themselves.It fails because the setting lacks of consistency. Indeed, watching Kakegurui is the same as watching only the action scenes from an action movie, what happens before and after the games is not exhibited. Then, how are we supposed to empathize with the characters if we don’t know what are the real consequences of their gambles? Here’s the main problem of the anime: there’s no information about the outside world, apart from the “pet” and “planned life” system. The show doesn’t answer an enormous quantity of questions, and there’s particularly one that would have been great to answer: What are the consequences? Apparently, you can lose tons of money and then win it back. It seems that, eventually, these gambles don’t really matter. This prevented me to get into the anime and to enjoy it, because I couldn’t feel what it wanted me to feel at first: the power of gambling. The only episodes I was partially able to enjoy were those in which the students wager something else (I won’t tell what it is to avoid spoilers), since the consequences of the “game” were straight. However, these episodes heavily rely on shock factor, and that’s why I won’t praise them as well.Moreover, this lack of concern I had for the show is also a result of the terrible characters it offers. Even Kirito from Sword Art Online is less generic than the male MC, Suzui Ryouta, whose only purpose is to introduce our dear Jabami Yumeko, the female lead, (obviously one-sided, as expected) who is here to turn on the traditional otaku. Don’t expect any development, her only character trait (except she is smart) is that she gets excited (sexually) while gambling. What? They all are excited by gambling? NEXT! There’s another main female that no one cares about: Saotome Meari, who is nearly as useless as Suzui. She is “Jabami number two”, their only difference (except the hair color and breast size, lol) is that she is selfish and greedy, while Jabami is “exemplar”. Shade doesn’t belong to this world as well.To be honest, some supporting characters get more development than the main ones. We learn a little bit about their past and their motivations, which makes the show a bit more enjoyable when Jabami encounters them. However, the supporting cast still is strongly unidimensional and is not particularly interesting. I won’t even tell you how omnipresent fanservice is and how much the characters serve it.Let’s give credit where credit is due. The OP is catchy, the ED is… uh… cancel that, let’s assume it doesn’t exist, the music and the voice acting are somehow fine, as well as the art and animation, even if their purpose is to exaggerate everything. Some of the games are engaging, despite the lack of characterization and worldbuilding.To make it short, Kakegurui is your typical bad seasonal anime. Overdose of fanservice, lack of characterization, terrible worldbuilding, but decent music and visuals. Although this show was the most popular of summer 2017, it won’t be remembered for a long time before disappearing in the pile of mediocrity which is delivered to the anime community each season. You should rather gamble in real life to feel adrenaline, it is certainly more entertaining and rewarding than watching this anime.

Yeah, interesting, but how does it work? People will tell you: “Uh, they gamble a lot of money, and when they have no money left, they become “pets”, which means they have to do what other students tell them to do. Their future even gets planned by the council student when they are really dried up! Talking about it, the council student is reserved to the elite, its members are la crème de la crème of this school, that’s why they can decide on everything.” I don’t mind having a surrealistic setting, if it has a purpose and it is well established. Unfortunately, that’s not the case. Everything, I mean, EVERYTHING is exaggerated: the sum of money the students are able to gamble, their reactions, their faces, and so on. The only goal it has, and, honestly, it is a goal the anime isn’t even able to achieve due to an important issue I will mention in the next paragraph, is to “shock” the viewer, such as jump scares in horror movies. It tries to make him care for what’s happening on the screen, to enforce him to feel what the characters are supposedly feeling themselves.It fails because the setting lacks of consistency. Indeed, watching Kakegurui is the same as watching only the action scenes from an action movie, what happens before and after the games is not exhibited. Then, how are we supposed to empathize with the characters if we don’t know what are the real consequences of their gambles? Here’s the main problem of the anime: there’s no information about the outside world, apart from the “pet” and “planned life” system. The show doesn’t answer an enormous quantity of questions, and there’s particularly one that would have been great to answer: What are the consequences? Apparently, you can lose tons of money and then win it back. It seems that, eventually, these gambles don’t really matter. This prevented me to get into the anime and to enjoy it, because I couldn’t feel what it wanted me to feel at first: the power of gambling. The only episodes I was partially able to enjoy were those in which the students wager something else (I won’t tell what it is to avoid spoilers), since the consequences of the “game” were straight. However, these episodes heavily rely on shock factor, and that’s why I won’t praise them as well.Moreover, this lack of concern I had for the show is also a result of the terrible characters it offers.

Not because they weren\'t gambling, but because the main character didn\'t mind loosing money or any other consequences that may cause.Story. There is this private school, where students gamble, and there are consequences if you lose and benefits if you win, simple. But everything moves in benefit of Yumeko, our main...character.

In fact, if you have not yet seen Kakegurui, I would recommend you to not think of it too much as a gambling anime at all when you do so. Otherwise you will most likely only end up reducing your enjoyment of the show in the process. I learned that lesson the hard way.As someone who absolutely loves anime about games, gambling, battle of wits and similar in general, I was really looking forward to Kakegurui, and I was hoping it could provide the same fix...as series like Kaiji, Akagi, Liar Game and One Outs for example did so well in the past. But as I quite quickly found out, Kakegurui is not really about gambling per se, but rather about gambling addiction and the people playing. However, even with that taken into account there are still numerous problems at work here, and as a result what was initially my most anticipated anime of the Summer season eventually ended up becoming one of its weaker shows instead.Kakegurui takes place in Hyakkaou Private Academy: a high school for ultra-rich students which has turned into a sort of gambling den after school hours where the students play each other in various games with huge amounts of money at stake, and whoever manages to manipulate the others the most and gain control of the most amount of money will quickly gain power within the society. This is where we find Jabami Yumeko: a complete nutcase addicted to the adrenaline rush of high-stakes gambles who enters the school and rapidly starts gaining recognition throughout it during the post-class activities. Kakegurui follows her blaze of glory across the academy.So why did I suggest that this is not a very good gambling anime then? Well if you've seen any of the shows I mentioned earlier then the differences should be rather noticeable, but I'll try to explain for those of you haven't. There are numerous reasons really. The first problem with the gambles in Kakegurui is the bets. Most of the time the stakes consist of nothing but enormous sums of money put on the line. However, it's pretty clear from the start that Yumeko doesn't really care about this at all. She's more than willing to put every single yen that she owns on the line just for the thrill, and even if she ends up losing it all, the only thing that will happen is that she'll go into debt and become a so-called house pet, in which case she can just win it back the next time. It basically feels like the outcome of the game barely even matters to her, and in that case why should it matter to us as the viewers either?Furthermore, during the rare occasions where some other bet is made, things aren't a whole lot better either, for example there's one game of Russian roulette where Yumeko and her opponent literally bets their lives, which is terrible from a writing standpoint because there's 0% chance of Yumeko getting killed since she's the protagonist and the story would just end if she did. Even if she were to lose the game, you already know the plot will somehow change the stakes at the end so that she would survive because the story demands it. In other words it's pointless to even have that kind of bet in the first place, because it utterly fails at creating the kind of tension which the author is looking for. That's probably the key word here: tension. Kakegurui lacks it entirely as the games always either feel predictable or unimportant. You never really have a reason to desire any particular outcome of a game without already knowing who will win. If you're going to have games where you always know who is going to win beforehand then the games themselves need to be so entertaining that you don't really care about the outcome regardless (best example of that is probably No Game No Life), but unfortunately Kakegurui doesn't have that either.This is because the second problem actually lies with the games themselves. In my opinion, part of what makes a gambling anime like Kaiji so good is how many additional layers of complexity it creates throughout its games when one side starts cheating somehow and the other side tries to find a way to one-up their opponent's cheat without them noticing, then the first side does the same in return, and the chain continues. What might seem like a simple game at first ends up becoming an incredible mental game of chess with tons of variables in play, and it's super interesting to watch. But the games in Kakegurui never really do this as they always remain very simple. Whereas Kaiji can dedicate a whole season to just one extraordinary game, Kakegurui never has more than 1-2 episodes per gamble, and as a result they never have the time or opportunity to go very far beyond their basic rules. In addition, there's also the problem that since Yumeko is such a gambling addict, she isn't actually trying to outsmart her opponent very much at all, because she's actually okay with just letting fate decide the winner as she desires the thrill that comes from taking risks. In other words instead of bending the rules and completely outthinking her opponent to achieve victory, sometimes she just relies on plain luck to decide the winner in the end. The problem is nothing is ever truly random in fiction, so letting a game be decided by RNG is really cheap writing to me, because in reality it basically just means that one side arbitrarily wins because the author said so; nothing more, nothing less. It's extremely unsatisfying to watch.There are also some occasions where I feel like it was left annoyingly vague whether or not something was decided by luck or skill, for example there's one episode where Yumeko has to roll a pair of dice where she effectively has a 1/100 chance of winning, and of course she gets the roll she needed. Now, if this is actually nothing but fortune then that's just ridiculous writing for the aforementioned reason, but if Yumeko actually knew how to rig die rolls—in other words how many times the die will roll on the ground by flicking your wrist properly to get the number you want—as has been showcased in other gambling anime like Shoubushi Densetsu Tetsuya in the past, then it'd be perfectly logical that she could win that bet without any dumb luck involved. But did she? I don't know; we never get to find out. Either way, I firmly believe that luck should never be a big factor in gambling anime, because the concept of randomness doesn't really work in the same way in fiction as it does in real life, but Kakegurui doesn't seem to understand this.Perhaps the worst of all is one of the games towards the end of the anime where Yumeko is playing a customized version of Poker with someone, where whoever bets the most money gets to decide if the player with the stronger hand or the weaker hand wins when the cards are revealed. In this game both sides just keep on throwing unbelievable amounts of money onto the table until Yumeko eventually can't raise the stakes anymore and her opponent who then has the largest bet gets to pick the victory condition. This is stupid for multiple reasons: first of all they try to somehow make the game feel more hype by adding more money into the mixture, but as I've already said Yumeko doesn't care about cash so it doesn't really increase the tension for the viewers at all, and the specific size of the stakes doesn't change how the game works in practicality either, all that matters is that someone bets more than the other. And then in the end it is still a game of imperfect information, in other words the author gets to arbitrarily decide the cards in the players' hands and thus choose the winner, regardless of which victory condition was picked. Oh and did I mention that on top of the money, Yumeko also put her life on the line here again here (albeit in a different sense) so that she basically had a 100% chance of winning regardless? I was honestly shocked to see so many things done so poorly in such a short amount of time for such a simple game.Thirdly, I also think the characters don't really fit the premise of a gambling anime at all. Almost every single character in Kakegurui is seemingly a psychopath to some extent. Yumeko herself is addicted to the adrenaline rush of gambling as mentioned, but she's far from the only crazy person in this school—for example there's a girl who's basically a suicidal freak who orgasms on screen from the thrill of perhaps getting killed in Russian roulette. Everyone seems to be an asshole with some sort of messed up ulterior motive for their actions, and the show seems to do everything it possibly can to help emphasize the girls' craziness with highly exaggerated close-up reaction faces, maniacal speeches and similar. Unfortunately, the mind games which gambling anime normally generates are supposed to be both quite serious and intellectual in nature, so when the girls are simultaneously getting drunk off their own insanity while playing... it's basically impossible to take the show seriously anymore. And that is why I say that you should not think of Kakegurui as a gambling anime: the emphasis is on how messed up all the girls are, not the games they play and how they do so. In other words despite the gambling premise, in reality Kakegurui is mostly an anime about crazy girls doing crazy things, plain and simple. And honestly I don't dislike the idea of crazy anime girls at all, in fact I'd say I rather like yanderes, yangires and just plain insane characters in general. Whether it's certain insane characters from Mirai Nikki, Higurashi no Naku Koro ni or Prison School we're talking about, they all have different types of craziness but I enjoyed them all (though there are certainly some insufferable cases such as Love-pon from Mayoiga too). However, in this case I just feel like they don't fit the setting of the show itself whatsoever. If the whole purpose was to show off crazy characters competing against each other for money or other bets, why even have this game-based academy premise in the first place? They could just as well have been playing football, fought each other, competed over grades or something. It's like the method of competition itself doesn't matter; only the fact that they are actually competing somehow and that there is a bet involved. Hell if all that's needed is a bet then they don't even need to participate directly; they might as well have been in the peanut gallery betting on horse racing instead and it wouldn't have made much of a difference. The only seemingly normal character in the whole anime is the male lead Suzui Ryouta, however in practice this guy adds absolutely nothing of value to the series at all as he's basically just a spectator to the gambles week in and week out. His sole purpose in the show is to be someone for Yumeko to show off to (kind of like Shoutarou in Sakurako-san), and I don't really think he can be considered a main character in the first place.So ultimately I can't help but find Kakegurui to be a rather unsatisfying series in general. If you're looking for a good gambling anime, there are way better alternatives. If you're looking for a good anime about crazy characters, there are *also* way better alternatives. Regardless of which side you decide to watch this anime for, it ends up feeling like something of fairly low priority either way. I guess the best way to watch Kakegurui is to just turn your brain off as they say and don't take it seriously at all. In that case the sheer stupidity of it all might be enough to transform into a sort of twisted comedy instead which you might be able to get some enjoyment value out of. Maybe if I had known about all of this from the start, that's what I would have done. I don't know. But either way, I personally found Kakegurui rather frustrating to watch more often than not, and while I don't hate the show I truly expected so much more from it than what I got, so I don't really think I can recommend it in the end. as series like Kaiji, Akagi, Liar Game and One Outs for example did so well in the past. But as I quite quickly found out, Kakegurui is not really about gambling per se, but rather about gambling addiction and the people playing.

Otherwise it\'s just going to come off as extremely pretentious.Kakegurui can be seen as many things. It can be...considered simply a story about privileged rich brats in a school that\'s more of a gambling den than an educational space. It can be seen as another commercial venture designed to keep viewers on the edge of their seats with the callousness, perverseness, violence, and sheer insanity many of the characters display. It can be seen as a meaningless chaotic cash-grab with a bunch of Ecchi thrown in for good measure. It can be seen as a cynical take on how capitalistic social hierarchies reward callousness and insanity. It can be seen as a drama of emotions with each individual player trying to cheat or bluff their way to the top of the school\'s hierarchy.  It can be seen as one crazy girl\'s attempts to take on a corrupt elite student council that is effectively maintaining a vile caste system within the institution. It can be seen as the story of a compulsive gambler with the money and smarts to indulge her addiction, decimating overinflated egos along the way.But one can also pluck each of these petals off and see that at its core, Kakegurui is a story about abandoning fear. It is about being crazy enough to simply take a chance.And it is very easy for a piece of media to become preachy, paternalistic, or childish in attempting to get this simple message across. Simple ideas are often deceptively hard to convey. A lot of Shounen shows, especially, which try to get this message across are guilty of exploiting plot-armor to indulge the common male fantasy of being an invincible hero, exuding machismo and dripping sex from every pore.The MC takes every chance they get and they win every single time because they\'re just the best because they believe it and that\'s that. Kakegurui has none of that.In terms of the writing, the pace is fast and many episodes end on cliffhangers that leave you desperate to know how things will turn out. But the plot is just one gambling match after another with minor intermissions for exposition, backstory, introducing new characters, or scheming. Classic Action Anime structure with one villain being replaced by another. The important difference is that the main character does not defeat every enemy or befriend all of them. She sometimes actively refuses to engage and even throws a game at one point. But she still emerges on top on some other metric in spite of losing the gambles themselves. That is the only protection her  Plot Armour provides her.We are not provided much background for the characters except bare bones descriptions that we hear from conversations. Same as with the plot, the show is pretty realistic and goes light on fleshing out the characters. The excellent voice acting, dialogues, and interactions between the characters make the backstories unnecessary to get invested. The back and forth chatter during games, and the internal monologues of ""should I, should I not; will she, won\'t she,"" are the main things that viewers will have to rely on to understand what goes on. There are very few flashbacks and monologues. For the most part, the writing adopts the same approach as the Student Council in the show adopts towards cheating during gambles: you snooze, you loose. But the show works damn hard to make sure you don\'t snooze.Another point to note is that there are not many elaborate strategies that the players use except when they\'re cheating. And even then, not much time is wasted on explanations of how things are done. For some tricks, the key explanatory scenes disappear within seconds. Anyone looking for monologues explaining tricks they can use at their next poker game will be sorely disappointed. A lot of the tension during the games comes from the inherently unpredictable nature of reality and human behavior itself. From a psychological perspective, there is actually a LOT that can be seen to be at play in this series, as long as the viewer is paying attention (and I say that as a person with a post-graduate degree in the subject). I also particularly like how almost every game is new and unique (according to my knowledge at least). There are many similarities to real life games but even the most normal ones have some novel twist added to them.The art, animation, and sound are by far the main strengths of this show, hands down. The Opening Theme is a chaotic kaleidoscope and it fits the nature of the show very well. I already commented about the visuals of the Ending Theme, but the music in it is much more appealing and noteworthy in my opinion. The art and animation team manages to convey a broad range of emotions and moods at various points throughout the show. Of particular note is how they depict Yumeko\'s gambling craze taking over. She looks crazy of course, and there is plenty of ahegao, but Yumeko\'s particular brand of craziness makes her look more like a self-indulgent Eldritch horror rather than Gasai Yuuno. I have no idea how exactly they managed that. Those moments in the show when she\'s on a gambling high of some sort or whispering into people\'s ears like a snake coz she wants to start stuff are particularly high on sakuga value. The sexualization does feel unnecessary and also grotesque at times, but I\'m not really fazed by those things anymore.Kakegurui\'s strength, in my opinion, lies in counter-balancing their priorities. They managed to keep the pace quick and the writing crisp by cutting out unnecessary exposition and backstory. They could only do that because they had excellent dialogues, voice acting, and also efficient visual direction. Individually, all of the basic components that make this show are not really the best.

The art style of this anime is very nice I enjoy seeing how all the characters look. I love this anime so much because t never feels like there's a filler episode. I love watching every single gamble and seeing one of the main cast (especially Yumeko) deal with the thrill of gambling. I would definitely NOT recommend...this to anyone under 12 or 13.

The visual and aesthetic content are very enticing and draw further interest into the story content of the anime. While there is a mix of art styles, they manage to transition well into each other. While some of the animations can be quite over the top, the unexpectedness and ridiculousness of these moments make them very enjoyable and it keeps the viewer interested as to what happens next. To add onto this, the soundtrack is extremely well done and...perfectly balances the need to match the visual and story content, while still managing to stand out.While the story takes many obvious inspirations based on existing tropes and stereotypes, it is done in creative and unanticipated ways. In fact, the manner in which the characters play into their tropes often adds to the enjoyment of the viewer.

Additionally, this causes the story to be quite unpredictable, keeping the viewer on the edge of their seat.Unfortunately, some characters work out better than others. This is mainly due to lack of background information or character development for some of the characters. To add onto this, a lot of characters end up hitting a plateau in character development, after which they solely become a device for either comedic relief or to move on the plot.

But after a few episodes, I already knew what I was in for.I feel like Kakegurui is just one of those shows that’s too predictable. Yumeko is the main focus of the show, and she is so good at gambling that all tension is lost. I guess watching to see how to manipulates and tricks her opponents is entertaining, but I never found myself at the edge of my seat. I knew from a mile away Yumeko was never going to fail anything. And if she did loose,...she’d find a way to rebound. And I felt like her “crazy” personality was pretty cliche. And that’s coming from someone who loves unhinged characters. She just doesn’t feel that compelling to me.There isn’t much plot since each episode just focuses on Yumeko and how she ranks up within the high school. So as every episode went on, I got more and more bored. I think the most entertaining character had to be Midari but she wasn’t good enough for me to like the show that much more.One of the best aspects of this show is definitely the artwork and animation. There are so many close-up scenes that are just disturbing - pulsating eyeballs, stretching mouths, distraught/lusty expressions. That at least made the show more bearable but yet again, it wasn’t enough.So overall I don’t think the show is trash. It’s just meh, imo. I don’t think it’s my thing, but that doesn’t mean others won’t like it either. Just don’t expect anything mind blowing. she’d find a way to rebound.

Spoilers ahead!)I like to gamble now and again.“Texas Hold ‘Em” is my card game of choice because I grew up playing it and watching it. And I’ll throw in ten dollars or so to get some easy picks for the mega lotteries if they get high enough to make it worth the risk. I don’t always win of course, but part of the fun comes from that thrill. The maybe-it-will-happen ideology and the there’s-always-a-chance buildup.Kakegurui takes this thrill-of-the-gamble concept to the absolute extreme, gambling with some of its own decisions that earn more wins than losses.STORYA...school structured around a gambling system where bets consist of millions of yen and the students most in debt become slaves with no rights. Most wouldn’t enter such a backwards place. Yumeko Jabami, however, is not like most people.That’s all the info required to setup Kakegurui. For, as this info hints at, the content contained in this anime has two goals in mind: gambling and absurdity. The former is easy to understand: students take part in games that revolve around gambling in some fashion. A variant of rock-paper-scissors, memorization, forced deception. The latter must be seen to be believed: the ridiculously ridiculous becomes the norm. Threats of rape and potential accidental suicide turn these games from simple bouts of fun into life-altering scenarios.Naturally, this anime is neither for the squeamish nor the sensitive. That’s even after the audience realizes that Yumeko will somehow come out victorious regardless of the absurdity (because there wouldn’t be a story to tell otherwise). As a result, the narrative does succumb to a repetitive format: Yumeko is challenged to a game of some kind, she starts to lose badly, she turns her luck around completely, and then she moves on to the next cycle.Kakegurui somewhat pigeonholes itself into this structure. While the show does explain the different games and their rules, it ultimately needs to showcase them in action for their full effect and their construction to take hold. Indeed, if Yumeko succeeded immediately, the buildup beforehand would be for nothing. So, to provide the full extent of each played game – showcasing the opponent as a big meanie head, letting the game itself do the talking, and highlighting Yumeko’s comeback – she almost always loses first before she wins as a massive payoff.This repetition does not do the show any favors, but it does achieve an important part of its direction regardless: tension. At the end of the day, Kakegurui wishes to entertain its audience not with complex themes or incredible plot points but rather with several instances of the baddies being put in their rightful place.An argument reinforced by the fact that these games often do not strictly follow gambling in the probabilistic sense. Instead, the various villains rig these matches in their favor with biased helpers, special marks, and magnetic grips. They attempt to cheat their way to a win. And so, when Yumeko inevitably crushes her opponents through wit, skill, and power, the positive outcome tastes all the sweeter.Despite the higher focus on the absurdity and the tension, the anime does try to infuse a semi-relevant subplot with Kirari and her behind-the-scenes machinations. Unfortunately, these events are never fully realized, so their inclusion is less an intriguing aside and more of a small distraction to the chips already in the pot.Also, Kakegurui tends to toss aside a lot of its characters once their moment in the spotlight concludes. Not mainstays like Mary and Itsuki, but sides like Nanami, Yuriko, Midari, and Yumemi either do not contribute much past their prime or oddly disappear altogether.These narrative troubles aside, the games and their ridiculousness allow the story to capitalize on entertainment first and foremost. And because the anime keeps this approach intact for all twelve episodes, it remains consistent in its purpose as well.ART & ANIMATIONFor Kakegurui, its visuals pride themselves most on the reactions that Yumeko and the other gamblers so regularly embrace.Orgasmic explosions, derisive stares, manic expressions, shocked looks, frightening faces. A set of glowing eyes here and a wagging tongue there give them an extra helping of craziness, too. No matter what their reaction may be, though, these over-the-top depictions push the characters’ physical emotions to the absolute limit, coinciding with the show’s extreme tendencies in its actual content.Such reactions are vital to the show because said content, at its core, isn’t the most involved. The games they play usually only entail them sitting at a table, flipping cards, or pushing chips around. So, to offset their inherently lackluster actions, Kakegurui relies on this insanity, achieving the desired effect of making these games much more fun to watch unfold as the audience awaits that next wacky reaction.Besides these reactions, the anime also puts a lot of care into the designs of its characters. Yumeko and Mary are attractive ladies who introduce yet another facet to follow on-screen, and Ryouta’s extreme normalcy blends him into the background where he wishes to belong. On the opposite end, the menacing student council seem like final bosses. Their masks, hoodies, stars, glasses, piercings, and ribbons create distinct, intimidating looks for the lot that reflect their status within the school without any trouble.The coolest detail, though, comes from their regular school outfits. Their black-and-red coloring coincides with the same color scheme of a common casino roulette wheel and table layout. Such colors not only tie the designs back to the gambling motif but also subconsciously keep the premise on the minds of the audience as the characters go about placing bets and reacting away.Concerning the rest of Kakegurui’s visuals, they do not impress as much as the reactions and the designs, but they remain in good standing regardless. Detailed lips and CG hands provide movement when necessary. Cool camera cuts and operations also add dynamism to the many games showcased.The setting itself does leave much to be desired, but, when everything else within the art and the animation covers what it can already, this missing element barely impacts the engaging presentation on display.CHARACTERSFor Kakegurui’s cast members, showmanship matters most.Remember, this anime is built around ridiculousness. So, in keeping in line with this idea, the anime highlights the eccentricity and the quirkiness of the different people that Yumeko squares off against in the gambles at hand. Someone like Yumemi is a cutesy, flirty idol on the surface but a complete dirtbag when the cameras stop rolling. Similarly, Midari not only isn’t afraid to walk around with a loaded gun but also proves, in flashback fashion, her unbelievable masochistic tendencies.Not to say that Yumeko’s enemies don’t have more going for them. For instance, Itsuki was little more than the daughter of a father who owned a prolific toy-and-playing-card company. She also happened to collect the fingernails of the victims she defeated. However, later in the series, the show shows her holding a relationship with Kaede due to their likeminded goals, and she turns her ambition into something tangible as well, ditching her own fingernails as a neat (albeit grotesque) progression to her character arc.Itsuki and the other characters encounter change of this nature thanks to Yumeko (either directly or indirectly). One by one, she dismantles their personas, forcing them to look inward on themselves. They contemplate their drive and their desires as she manipulates them with nothing besides smarter tactics. For some, she breaks completely. For others, she befriends them mostly. No matter the case, her arrival marks for a turning point in the school and its direction.Perhaps not so surprisingly, Yumeko herself is the most insane of them all. Indeed, she sort of must be given the environment and the undeniable influence she exerts on those she crosses. She’s the most insane for a single reason: she only cares about the gamble.Money. Status. Livelihood. Even just winning and losing do not enter her thoughts. Seriously, all she strives for is that insatiable rush. The druglike feeling as probability and luck dictate fate. As she puts it in episode nine, “The absurdity of being helpless to do anything of your own will. That right there is the essence of gambling, after all.”While Yumeko revels in chance, the characters around her sometimes ponder her mysterious arrival and her purpose for being here. Surely, there must be some other need, an ulterior motive for enrolling beyond gambling. Unfortunately, the anime never truly delves into it. Very small backstory items are alluded to, and she seems to have a fixation on going up against Kirari, the mastermind at the head of the student council. But her past sadly remains unexplored, leaving her character as the epitome of the showmanship that laces throughout this entire set of characters.Well, almost the entire set, for one character neither wishes nor wants to take part in any of the nearby ridiculousness: Ryouta. His presence in the anime hardly rises above mere existence since he almost never takes part in any of the gambles personally. Sometimes, he even disappears for large stretches of (episode) time. As such, he represents the audience’s lens with which to view Kakegurui as his normal, everyday self contrasts against the strange people and the odd games that take center stage.Ryouta also serves another important role. To Yumeko, he is the only constant chip on the table. His kindness, honesty, and innocence make him someone that she can trust with all her heart, giving their relationship a playful and supportive edge. He worries about her during every risk she takes, and she in turn relies on him for some minor-to-major moments that get him out of his comfort zone.Comfortable or not, the anime clearly emphasizes its characters’ aptitude for showmanship over their individual importance on a writing level. However, when the story also focuses on a similar direction, they find themselves not needing to do or be much else anyway.MUSIC & SOUNDKakegurui does not let its music and its sound go to waste.The opening track “Deal with the devil” has this energized tone that primes the audience for the games to come while also reveling in the mystique that Yumeko delivers. Dancing piano keys, a step-wise saxophone, and the distinct noise of a police radio at the beginning twist the song with erratic noises that also give its energy more of a frantic feel, following the tension contained in most of the anime.Furthermore, a groovy bassline and a prominent jazz band then add in a classy vibe that matches the anime’s own upscale premise. And the playful vocals throughout the piece bring on a last layer of charm to keep the song coasting along. A fun, catchy, and fitting OP, indeed.Where the OP catches the audience’s attention with its energy, the ending track “LAYon-theLINE” instead celebrates Yumeko in all her glory. The futuristic sounds that weave into and out of the song almost argue for Yumeko herself being the “future”. Multiple vocalists and the slight orchestral instrumentation raise the grandeur and the scale of the music, increasing her importance. And the six-time lyrical rhyme as the closer signs off this track in poetic fashion for this equally poetic lady.This ED makes for a wonderful addition to the sound work in the show as well, and Saori Hayami as Yumeko Jabami likewise does the same with her voice acting as the star gambler. Easily flipping between cute and psychotic, excited and arrogant, Ms. Hayami demonstrates once again why she is a household name at this point (for anime fans at any rate).Even the rest of the original soundtrack puts its money where its mouth is. While it does have the rarer slice-of-life tune, the music shines best when it channels the tension that runs rampant throughout the gambles. Blaring saxophone notes, wild piano keys, grating violin strings. These sounds slam the different scenes in Kakegurui with a horror-esque mood that aligns both with the creepy craziness and the Vegas vibe of the events therein.On top of the punchy sound-effects when revealing cards and the drowned-out noises when dread kicks in, the audio design for Kakegurui arguably stands as the show’s strongest collective offering.ENJOYMENTI had a lot of fun with this anime. For me, this joy comes from three factors: some of the characters, the nature of the content, and those games played.On the characters, I couldn’t not like Yumeko. Her moe and insane moments were simply a treat to watch. She didn’t carry the entire anime by her lonesome, but she certainly proved why she is the star. Mary was cool, too, if only because she moved away from acting like a stuck-up jerk and towards being a friend of Yumeko herself.On the nature of the content, watching the enemy lose almost always made for a cathartic experience. I knew that Yumeko’s unnatural calms would soon give way to yet another glorious beatdown, turning the anime into a jackpot of evil people receiving their comeuppance. Something that I for sure approve.On the games, I liked how they relied mostly on who could be cleverer. Sure, a couple of the exchanges were perhaps overly silly or maybe required too much of an explanation. But, seeing them seeped in tactics and manipulation (especially from Yumeko), these gambles turned into mind battles that were more interesting than a regular contest.I cannot say I adore everything in the anime. I do wish that Kirari was around more because her allure and her supposed excellence seemed too intriguing to pass up as much as the show did. It also would have been nice if the content went outside of the Yumeko-versus-opponent structure, letting her sit out on occasion to create new scenarios. And the games that involved money rather than some other commodity up for grabs (e.g., threats, life itself) lacked the same gravitas because, realistically speaking, money didn’t really matter in the grand scheme of things.Nevertheless, specific characters, the content’s nature, and all those clever gambles made for quite the enjoyable time. With the knowledge that a second season is also arriving sometime soon, this series may very well become a compulsive habit.Kakegurui reveals its hand with a ton of confidence. An entertaining set of story beats and individual characters create a weird yet inviting tale that does not let up for its full run. While these elements have small problems, the art and the music have next to zero, supporting the project through audiovisual awesomeness. Altogether, perhaps not the easiest bet to make in the world, but it’s worth the risk all the same.SUMMARYStory: Fine, gambling and absurdity reign supreme even as narrative integrity does notArt & Animation: Great, over-the-top reactions, cool character designs, and other stylistic choices for the visuals keep the artistry extra engagingCharacters: Fine, Yumeko manipulates everyone around her as they focus on showmanship, and Ryouta contrasts with the everyday crazinessMusic & Sound: Great, an energized OP, a celebratory ED, strong VA performances, and a creepy OST land on triple sevens at the audio slot machineEnjoyment: Good, Yumeko, catharsis, and mind battles swirl together as lots of undeniable funFinal Score: 7/10 school structured around a gambling system where bets consist of millions of yen and the students most in debt become slaves with no rights. Most wouldn’t enter such a backwards place. Yumeko Jabami, however, is not like most people.That’s all the info required to setup Kakegurui. For, as this info hints at, the content contained in this anime has two goals in mind: gambling and absurdity. The former is easy to understand: students take part in games that revolve around gambling in some fashion. A variant of rock-paper-scissors, memorization, forced deception. The latter must be seen to be believed: the ridiculously ridiculous becomes the norm. Threats of rape and potential accidental suicide turn these games from simple bouts of fun into life-altering scenarios.Naturally, this anime is neither for the squeamish nor the sensitive. That’s even after the audience realizes that Yumeko will somehow come out victorious regardless of the absurdity (because there wouldn’t be a story to tell otherwise). As a result, the narrative does succumb to a repetitive format: Yumeko is challenged to a game of some kind, she starts to lose badly, she turns her luck around completely, and then she moves on to the next cycle.Kakegurui somewhat pigeonholes itself into this structure. While the show does explain the different games and their rules, it ultimately needs to showcase them in action for their full effect and their construction to take hold. Indeed, if Yumeko succeeded immediately, the buildup beforehand would be for nothing. So, to provide the full extent of each played game – showcasing the opponent as a big meanie head, letting the game itself do the talking, and highlighting Yumeko’s comeback – she almost always loses first before she wins as a massive payoff.This repetition does not do the show any favors, but it does achieve an important part of its direction regardless: tension. At the end of the day, Kakegurui wishes to entertain its audience not with complex themes or incredible plot points but rather with several instances of the baddies being put in their rightful place.An argument reinforced by the fact that these games often do not strictly follow gambling in the probabilistic sense. Instead, the various villains rig these matches in their favor with biased helpers, special marks, and magnetic grips. They attempt to cheat their way to a win. And so, when Yumeko inevitably crushes her opponents through wit, skill, and power, the positive outcome tastes all the sweeter.Despite the higher focus on the absurdity and the tension, the anime does try to infuse a semi-relevant subplot with Kirari and her behind-the-scenes machinations. Unfortunately, these events are never fully realized, so their inclusion is less an intriguing aside and more of a small distraction to the chips already in the pot.Also, Kakegurui tends to toss aside a lot of its characters once their moment in the spotlight concludes. Not mainstays like Mary and Itsuki, but sides like Nanami, Yuriko, Midari, and Yumemi either do not contribute much past their prime or oddly disappear altogether.These narrative troubles aside, the games and their ridiculousness allow the story to capitalize on entertainment first and foremost. And because the anime keeps this approach intact for all twelve episodes, it remains consistent in its purpose as well.ART & ANIMATIONFor Kakegurui, its visuals pride themselves most on the reactions that Yumeko and the other gamblers so regularly embrace.Orgasmic explosions, derisive stares, manic expressions, shocked looks, frightening faces. A set of glowing eyes here and a wagging tongue there give them an extra helping of craziness, too. No matter what their reaction may be, though, these over-the-top depictions push the characters’ physical emotions to the absolute limit, coinciding with the show’s extreme tendencies in its actual content.Such reactions are vital to the show because said content, at its core, isn’t the most involved. The games they play usually only entail them sitting at a table, flipping cards, or pushing chips around. So, to offset their inherently lackluster actions, Kakegurui relies on this insanity, achieving the desired effect of making these games much more fun to watch unfold as the audience awaits that next wacky reaction.Besides these reactions, the anime also puts a lot of care into the designs of its characters. Yumeko and Mary are attractive ladies who introduce yet another facet to follow on-screen, and Ryouta’s extreme normalcy blends him into the background where he wishes to belong. On the opposite end, the menacing student council seem like final bosses. Their masks, hoodies, stars, glasses, piercings, and ribbons create distinct, intimidating looks for the lot that reflect their status within the school without any trouble.The coolest detail, though, comes from their regular school outfits. Their black-and-red coloring coincides with the same color scheme of a common casino roulette wheel and table layout. Such colors not only tie the designs back to the gambling motif but also subconsciously keep the premise on the minds of the audience as the characters go about placing bets and reacting away.Concerning the rest of Kakegurui’s visuals, they do not impress as much as the reactions and the designs, but they remain in good standing regardless. Detailed lips and CG hands provide movement when necessary. Cool camera cuts and operations also add dynamism to the many games showcased.The setting itself does leave much to be desired, but, when everything else within the art and the animation covers what it can already, this missing element barely impacts the engaging presentation on display.CHARACTERSFor Kakegurui’s cast members, showmanship matters most.Remember, this anime is built around ridiculousness. So, in keeping in line with this idea, the anime highlights the eccentricity and the quirkiness of the different people that Yumeko squares off against in the gambles at hand. Someone like Yumemi is a cutesy, flirty idol on the surface but a complete dirtbag when the cameras stop rolling. Similarly, Midari not only isn’t afraid to walk around with a loaded gun but also proves, in flashback fashion, her unbelievable masochistic tendencies.Not to say that Yumeko’s enemies don’t have more going for them. For instance, Itsuki was little more than the daughter of a father who owned a prolific toy-and-playing-card company. She also happened to collect the fingernails of the victims she defeated. However, later in the series, the show shows her holding a relationship with Kaede due to their likeminded goals, and she turns her ambition into something tangible as well, ditching her own fingernails as a neat (albeit grotesque) progression to her character arc.Itsuki and the other characters encounter change of this nature thanks to Yumeko (either directly or indirectly). One by one, she dismantles their personas, forcing them to look inward on themselves. They contemplate their drive and their desires as she manipulates them with nothing besides smarter tactics. For some, she breaks completely. For others, she befriends them mostly. No matter the case, her arrival marks for a turning point in the school and its direction.Perhaps not so surprisingly, Yumeko herself is the most insane of them all. Indeed, she sort of must be given the environment and the undeniable influence she exerts on those she crosses. She’s the most insane for a single reason: she only cares about the gamble.Money. Status. Livelihood. Even just winning and losing do not enter her thoughts. Seriously, all she strives for is that insatiable rush. The druglike feeling as probability and luck dictate fate. As she puts it in episode nine, “The absurdity of being helpless to do anything of your own will. That right there is the essence of gambling, after all.”While Yumeko revels in chance, the characters around her sometimes ponder her mysterious arrival and her purpose for being here. Surely, there must be some other need, an ulterior motive for enrolling beyond gambling. Unfortunately, the anime never truly delves into it. Very small backstory items are alluded to, and she seems to have a fixation on going up against Kirari, the mastermind at the head of the student council. But her past sadly remains unexplored, leaving her character as the epitome of the showmanship that laces throughout this entire set of characters.Well, almost the entire set, for one character neither wishes nor wants to take part in any of the nearby ridiculousness: Ryouta. His presence in the anime hardly rises above mere existence since he almost never takes part in any of the gambles personally. Sometimes, he even disappears for large stretches of (episode) time. As such, he represents the audience’s lens with which to view Kakegurui as his normal, everyday self contrasts against the strange people and the odd games that take center stage.Ryouta also serves another important role. To Yumeko, he is the only constant chip on the table. His kindness, honesty, and innocence make him someone that she can trust with all her heart, giving their relationship a playful and supportive edge. He worries about her during every risk she takes, and she in turn relies on him for some minor-to-major moments that get him out of his comfort zone.Comfortable or not, the anime clearly emphasizes its characters’ aptitude for showmanship over their individual importance on a writing level. However, when the story also focuses on a similar direction, they find themselves not needing to do or be much else anyway.MUSIC & SOUNDKakegurui does not let its music and its sound go to waste.The opening track “Deal with the devil” has this energized tone that primes the audience for the games to come while also reveling in the mystique that Yumeko delivers. Dancing piano keys, a step-wise saxophone, and the distinct noise of a police radio at the beginning twist the song with erratic noises that also give its energy more of a frantic feel, following the tension contained in most of the anime.Furthermore, a groovy bassline and a prominent jazz band then add in a classy vibe that matches the anime’s own upscale premise. And the playful vocals throughout the piece bring on a last layer of charm to keep the song coasting along. A fun, catchy, and fitting OP, indeed.Where the OP catches the audience’s attention with its energy, the ending track “LAYon-theLINE” instead celebrates Yumeko in all her glory. The futuristic sounds that weave into and out of the song almost argue for Yumeko herself being the “future”. Multiple vocalists and the slight orchestral instrumentation raise the grandeur and the scale of the music, increasing her importance. And the six-time lyrical rhyme as the closer signs off this track in poetic fashion for this equally poetic lady.This ED makes for a wonderful addition to the sound work in the show as well, and Saori Hayami as Yumeko Jabami likewise does the same with her voice acting as the star gambler. Easily flipping between cute and psychotic, excited and arrogant, Ms. Hayami demonstrates once again why she is a household name at this point (for anime fans at any rate).Even the rest of the original soundtrack puts its money where its mouth is. While it does have the rarer slice-of-life tune, the music shines best when it channels the tension that runs rampant throughout the gambles. Blaring saxophone notes, wild piano keys, grating violin strings. These sounds slam the different scenes in Kakegurui with a horror-esque mood that aligns both with the creepy craziness and the Vegas vibe of the events therein.On top of the punchy sound-effects when revealing cards and the drowned-out noises when dread kicks in, the audio design for Kakegurui arguably stands as the show’s strongest collective offering.ENJOYMENTI had a lot of fun with this anime.

Or at least, it doesn\'t focus on gambling as much as people want it to. Quite sad how most of the people who watched this show missed out on tense psychological battles and the degradation of mental states of characters during the games they played, because of focusing too much on the ""quality of the games"".Story: 5/10The plot in Kakegurui kinda takes a backseat and is only used to justify the events happening. This reveals the poor pacing of the show, since the show clearly should have been a 2 cour. We sadly do not get...to see neither the history of the academy, nor the backstory of Yumeko or the student council.Art: 8/10The art stays pretty loyal to the manga. It has a mature vibe to it which fits well with the show. The ""ugly/orgasmic"" faces also serve as visual representation of, yet again, the character\'s mental state.What lowers the mark are the CG scenes, which sucked.Sound: 10/10Amazing jazzy opening. Hayami Saori. Sawashiro Miyuki. Sugita Tomokazu. Need I say more?Character: 10/10This is where Kakegurui shines. Each little gamble introduces a new character, their motivation to gamble and the extent to which they will go achieve their goal. The variety of these ""reasons"" is what makes the show interesting. Some characters want to be treated as human beings, thus playing to achieve a higher status, some want to experience near death situations which makes them feel alive, some want to use the academy as a stepping stone to stardom or to a prestigious position of a politician, thus gambling in favor of their success.If the plot takes a back seat, the character interactions is what drives the show. Using the Midari arc as an example, we get to see a game between a person who gambles for fun, Yumeko, and a person who is crazy enough to gouge her own eye out just to demonstrate her willpower and who would put the lives of other people on the line just for her personal pleasure, which results in one of the best episodes in the anime, the outcome of which I won\'t spoil. Other than the Midari arc, the paroxysm of these interactions is shown in the Manyuda arc. With many cringing out of discomfort during the ""nail biting"" scene, the said scene demonstrates the determination of one of the characters to advance to their goal, discarding, or ""betting away"" what\'s personally important to them.Enjoyment: 9/10I started watching Kakegurui because I wanted to see people play poker in anime. In the end, I got a show that excels at being a psychological thriller. I didn\'t get what I expected, I got something much better.Overall: 8/10Rambling aside, look at how much I wrote about the various characters without focusing even a single bit on the games of Kakegurui.Is the show about gambling? Yes it is. Is it *only* about gambling? No. Does it focus on the games used in said gambling? No.If you\'re watching Kakegurui for the games, don\'t bother, you\'ll end up disappointed. However, if you want to watch ""crazy people do crazy things"" while risking their lives, go ahead, this show is for you.Sadly, with the anime original ending, the conclusion to the show is a bit lackluster.

Had the show been a 2 cour anime, which would fix the pacing, this would be one of my favourite shows of all time.', 'I\'m not one to write reviews. In fact this is my first one. It\'s just that I\'ve read some of the negative/critical reviews of this show and, while I totally agree with them, I felt the need to address the why of me liking this show.First, the required synopsis: Kakegurui follows the adventures of Yumeko Jabami, a transfer student at Hyakkaou Private Academy. This a school for the wealthy, where your rank in the social hierarchy is decided by high stakes (rich kids) gambling. This ""supposedly"" prepares the children of the wealthy and powerful to think strategically, deceive when needed and take controled risks. Yumeko,...however, is different: she is mysterious and she gambles for pleasure.SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD.In one word: it\'s so preposterous it works. IF you can suspend your desbelief, ignore all the red flags (like gambling addiction being portrayed in a positive light) and treat this as a battle shounen anime, which is what Kakegurui IS.It\'s difficult to reconcile, especially because there are no super-powered male self-inserts in this anime. I\'m not being critical of OP male self-inserts. Just stating a fact.Actually, in Kakegurui the OP/genius character is a woman, most competent ""villains"" are women and the male character takes the role of a minor addiction there to be the ""support"" of the main character. It\'s basically backwards from the usual shonen. Even Food Wars, while a different type of battle shounen, is more identifiable as that because of the male protagonist.Anyways, that said, the entire thing is complete hogwash. While responsible, very moderate gambling (or more specifically ""gaming"") can help with strategizing and taking controlled risks, the overall premise makes it look like the entire school is a den of gambling addicts. Every character is completely twisted, the system in place (that makes slaves of people in debt) is way too much even if you want to teach kids a lesson in real life consequences and Yumeko is not that brainy and not that brilliant of a strategist to begin with.Still, I enjoyed watching this immensely. It\'s vibrant, the character\'s madness is strangely appealing and the games were fun to watch. You just need to turn off your brain and let the show explain its gimmicks to you.Do not expect Liar Game and similar, these are basic battles with clear winners. There is little tension but everything in Kakegurui is made to appeal to the senses. It appealed to me, certainly, I thought it was funny and so over the top that it definitely doesn\'t take itself too seriously.So, if you\'re expecting complex puzzles and a well-rounded story, look elsewhere. This is brainless entertainment, pure battle shounen. And that is ok.7/10 however, is different: she is mysterious and she gambles for pleasure.SLIGHT SPOILERS AHEAD.In one word: it\'s so preposterous it works.

Make every character absolutely insane.This is the story (comedy?) of Kakegurui.The show started out with promise. The characters had a bit of a... uniqueness about them. The main heroine is completely crazy, as you'll find out in like episode 2, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing in itself. It's fine to have an unhinged character to shake up the story a bit.However, at some point a writer needs to realize when they've gone too far. There's a point where the story just becomes way too unrealistic and overly dramatic. The problem with Kakegurui,...is a typical problem you actually see in Shonen anime or whatnot. As the stories go on, battles need to get bigger and more dramatic. You go from fun, realistic battles, to battles where suddenly two characters have the powers of gods who just go at it and do all sorts of weird stuff.A similar situation comes up in this show. The bets become larger, and the insanity also becomes larger somehow. The writers feel a need to make the characters more and more insane as the series goes on, as if it's going to shock the viewer. And how do they convey a message of insanity? You have characters who touch they faces a lot. I'm pretty sure in every single episode someone's eyes have glowed up and their hands have molested their own faces.As if that wasn't enough, you also have the protagonist (?) (he doesn't really do much the whole story) whose only purpose is to make comments on how crazy everything is. He's always freaking out about the heroine and how crazy her bets are, too, which is funny because the main heroine has superhuman luck so I don't see why he'd ever be concerned.Oh, speaking of which, this show isn't really about strategy. Like, yeah, they act as if there's a strategy to it all, but really it comes down to the fact that a character was lucky enough to actually carry out that strategy in the first place.Everything is over-hyped in this show. At some point it kinda becomes funny. You got characters that masturbate over life or death situations, and characters that mutilate their own bodies for SEEMINGLY NO REASON (see episode 11). Also, people's hair changes color after bets now, apparently. I honestly have no idea what the writers are thinking. It's possible that, while trying to make their characters increasingly more unhinged, they have also become insane themselves. Prayers go out to them tonight, my friends.So yeah, this series is becoming worse and worse as it goes on. Don't let the promise of the first half of the series fool you. It's managed to accomplish in 13 episodes what it usually takes shounens hundreds of episodes to do - become completely ridiculous.Additional elements:Art: is goodSound: is okay (OP and ED are very fun)Character: worst part of the series. There is absolutely no character development or even personality besides 'insane' or 'freaked out' throughout the entire series.Story: bland and linear - absolutely unsurprising.enjoyment: ehhhh fair, it really just took the biggest dive in the final couple episodesoverall rating: 5/10 and that's MERCIFUL imo is a typical problem you actually see in Shonen anime or whatnot.

Compared to your standard tournament fighter anime, magical girl anime, ""cute girls doing cute things"" anime, or sports anime, the gambling genre has kind of been in the background. Some people have debated if Kakegurui is even primarily about gambling, but I\'d say that if the gambling anime looked like a family tree, I feel like it would be somewhere on there.You know how when movie trailers will edit a film to try and sell tickets? And when you...buy that ticket to see the movie, it turns out to be different from how the trailer showed it? That\'s kind of like Kakegurui. It\'ll keep advertising itself as a gambling anime. And while it does contain gambling, I\'d say the show is more about observing how people use (or misuse) power, or what exactly addiction can do to make people make the decisions they choose to make.Take our protagonist, Yumeko Jabami. She becomes physically aroused by the thought of intense gambling, something that terrifies her opponents. Also take note of the School President, who views the school as her own personal fish tank.

It\'s not a masterpiece by any means, but gosh dang I had fun watching it. It\'s entertaining to watch seemingly innocent looking characters make batshit insane faces and lose themselves into gambling, whether it be for money, social status, their aspirations, or their very own life.I would recommend it to people who want to easily sweep through 12 episodes of entertainment. But if you\'re looking for a hardcore gambling anime, this might be a pass for you. Personally, I thought it was fun. buy that ticket to see the movie, it turns out to be different from how the trailer showed it? That\'s kind of like Kakegurui. It\'ll keep advertising itself as a gambling anime. And while it does contain gambling, I\'d say the show is more about observing how people use (or misuse) power, or what exactly addiction can do to make people make the decisions they choose to make.Take our protagonist, Yumeko Jabami. She becomes physically aroused by the thought of intense gambling, something that terrifies her opponents. Also take note of the School President, who views the school as her own personal fish tank.

I won't say more because it would be a spoiler but you'll figure out why I'm saying this in a mere few episodes.Anyway it doesn't mean that this isn't a very enjoyable anime. The voice acting is wonderful, the graphics are beautiful and the themes and ambiances are pretty diverse. I started watching it for the gambling and stayed for lovable characters and plot twists that makes me think this anime can pull itself in my top 3 this year (so far).This said, I can fully understand why some people could...not like it. Most characters have intense personalities and like I said it isn't a good anime about gambling while being an anime mainly about gambling. But in the end I don't think that the plot matters once you start gambling into madness. not like it.

But in the end I don't think that the plot matters once you start gambling into madness."", 'Please note this review assumes that you have already finished watching Kakegurui and though care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may be spoilers within character analysis.What happens when a gambling addict manages to get into a special academy that instead of teaching you languages and maths instead teaches you how to gamble and read people and decides to win her way to the top of the school by challenging each and every member of the student council.Based off the manga of the same name Kakegurui is a school based anime that also feature elements of mystery...and psychological genre’s. The main premise of the series is that of this specific academy’s rather unique curriculum which rather than teaching you languages or social skills instead focuses on gambling and how to read people. By using the skills that you learn from these lessons you will be able to read people and allow you to outsmart your opponents and win big. Perhaps more than anywhere winning in this school counts more than anything as winning brings you money, prestige and allow you to ascend the ranks of the school hierarchy and maybe even gain entrance into the student council the most powerful students in the school.The overall plot of this series follows the life of Yumeko Jabami a transfer student that joins the strict but well known Hyakkaou Academy in the beginning of the series and in the process, turn the whole academy around with her amazing gambling skills and her unique take on what gambling is. The main themes that this anime has is gambling and its nature and the two-faced nature of people that gets revealed when they get pushed into a corner.YumekoYumeko Jabami voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Saori Hayami of Owari no seraph and Yamada Kun and the Seven Witches fame is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the show. A teenage girl and a freshman that at the beginning of the series joins the school as a freshman. Personality wise Yumeko is a kind, polite and well-mannered person that as a result of having little ego or pride in her personality is able to bond and make friends easily with her classmates which is helped greatly by the fact that she cares about each of her friends and allies deeply even though it would have been better to leave them which shows how kind of a person Yumeko actually is. Notably Yumeko is someone that can be rather persistent in trying to make friends with others with the best example of this being her friendship with Meari.  In Yumeko’s base personality its noted that even when pressed and abused by others Yumeko is someone that does not get angry at all and instead seems to prefer being submissive a trait that more than once scares her would be bullies away. Like every other character that appears on the show and in line with the shows main theme of two faced personalities Yumeko also has a different side to her personality that reveals itself when she’s gambling. In this new side to her personality that I like to call the ecstatic Yumeko on account of ecstasy that she loves to enter Yumeko’s personality changes quite a bit though she still retains her base personality traits. In this new personality of hers Yumeko becomes very serious but also very perceptive and cunning that shows that she is completely focused in the game that she has found herself to be in. It’s important to note that while Yumeko in this state can be rather rash with her decisions that each and every one is made when Yumeko is in a calm mindset which often clashes to what we see in the matches themselves. In this state, we can clearly see a glimpse of what Yumeko’s true personality and what she see’s gambling as which in this case means that she see’s gambling as a contest where you put everything on the table and use all of your skill and intelligence to out think your opponents and in doing so attain the ultimate victory of destroying your enemy utterly and totally. As a result of this Yumeko is someone that hates people that doesn’t take this sacred tenant of gambling seriously and instead tries to cheat their way through it.The most prominent trait of Yumeko’s is undoubtedly her skill at determining how each game type that her opponent uses works and using this to turn the tables on them and beat them using their own method. This trait of hers is often married with Yumeko’s alternate personality when she demands her opponent to get serious by betting what is most dear to them. Seeing Yumeko demolish her opponents by using their own advantages against them in a game that was designed to let them win overwhelmingly really was satisfying to see. As a character, I thought that Yumeko was an interesting one that showed that despite the odds arrayed against you and despite the fact that the enemy cheats to get an advantage against you that calmness, perception and skill and a little luck can still enable you to turn the tables around and allow you to attain a surprising victory against all odds. Saori Hayami I felt really did a fantastic job here in a role that is very unlike the ones that I usually see her in. It’s nice that Saori is starting to try her hand in roles that until now are unknown to her and I hope that she continues to surprise us with her skill and talent.MeariMeari voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tanaka of Schwarzesmarken fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yumeko’s main allies though this is something that she is loath to admit. A fellow student of Yumeko’s that also belongs in the same class as her Meari in her initial appearance was a manipulative, cruel and possessive person that seemed to have the hallmarks of being the queen bee of the class. In the beginning Meari’s most prominent traits was her overconfidence and her prideful nature which ensured that she had almost no actual friends within the class only lackeys that obeyed her because of the power and prestige that she had. In the beginning of the series Meari served as Yumeko’s first serious opponent and rival and their match showed just what things were like in this unique academy that both of them are in. After Meari’s humbling by Yumeko as a result of her defeat Meari’s personality changes significantly as the series progresses. Now no longer wielding the absolute power that she had wielded in the past Meari finds herself isolated and lonely and having to deal with the realization that she herself was now a normal person without power essentially a mike. However rather than giving into despair and hopelessness that many people would do in a situation like this Meari instead learns to become humble once more and also becomes more understanding of others. Despite having lost to Yumeko Meari though still disliking her becomes a reluctant ally to Yumeko and her plans and brings to the table a number of skills that she used in the past notably her intelligence, perception and skill at reading people. The fact that Yumeko and Meari actually become friends despite still hating each other I thought was an interesting move and reflected the fact that in this unique setting having one more ally is better than having one more enemy.As the series goes on it can be seen that Meari also developed personality traits that both define her and also show what her true personality is like. The first of these is Meari’s determination to live her own life that she wants it without worrying about what people think and say about her which I thought was admirable given the setting. The second trait which ties in with the first is that Meari is someone that doesn’t like being controlled by others which highlights her independent nature and moreover she dislikes being looked down upon and being underestimated by others which ensures that she will always be the one that will oppose the power and authority of the school’s student council. As a character, I felt that Meari was a rather interesting girl that showed some really good character growth and development as the series went on. While the queen bee in the beginning of the series her subsequent defeat and reversal of her position within the school and her subsequent development in personality as she clawed her way back up was something that I was impressed with. In terms of character I also felt that Meari served as a good contrast with Yumeko as well. Minami Tanaka is not someone that im familiar with since I only seen her in one role to date unlike Saori who’s my fourth favourite seiyuu on account of her many roles but I thought that she really did an excellent job portraying the character of Meari here.KirariKirari voiced by veteran seiyuu Miyuki Sawashiro of Sword art online and Granblue fantasy fame is one of the main support characters in the series and serves as one of the main villains in the series. A third-year student and the student council president of the school. Kirari who actually never gets referred to as such in the series is a very enigmatic person who is shown to be extremely perceptive, cunning and devious able to find out about all manner of things that happen in the school and elsewhere quite easily. On the surface Kirari is a calm, composed and intelligent person that is also shown to take her duties as student council president seriously. Indeed, this serious nature of hers manifests in her determination to ensure that each of the students that she represents will have a path that is laid out for them in the form of their life forms should they not show a determination and a willingness to excel in their studies which in this school means at gambling. Beneath her initial and her surface personality Kirari is someone that is shown to be extremely smart and is someone that understands quite well how faction politics work within the school but rather than coming down hard on people that overstep their bounds or get too ambitious she instead elects to observe events from afar and let things run their course while at the same time manipulating events from behind the scenes. Kirari’s devious nature also comes into play when she comes up with methods for the paying back of debts to the council some of which really is frightening. Throughout the series it can be seen that Kirari is someone that detests the old-style management that the world relies on which also helps foster he belief that the weak should always be ruled by the strong and that those without strength should aspire to do so.As a character Kirari has a number of personally traits that define her. The first of these is her rather unique belief that everyone that she sees is merely a tool that is to be used and not people which rather than stemming from her arrogance actually comes from her own beliefs. The second is that while she is a seeker of knowledge she does so only to use them to subdue others more efficiently and effectively. The last and most likely her most prominent trait is her unpredictability which ensures that you will never know what her plan is until she actually reveals it to you. As a character, I felt that Kirari was a very well-designed character that in addition to being very adept at gambling was also someone that was intelligence and cunning that made her such a powerful opponent and threat to Yumeko and her friends. Indeed, even when not directly facing Yumeko her hand and the actions that it performs behind the scenes is just as much of a threat as it is when she is physically present. I thought that Miyuki Sawashiro really did an excellent job of portraying the character of the intelligent and devious student council president of Kirari Momobami  and though a support role is still one of her best roles I seen.MidariMidari Ikshima voiced by veteran seiyuu Mariya Ise of Madan no Ou no vanadis and Masamune Kun’s revenge fame is one of the main support characters of the show and one of the main villains that Yumeko and co face in the series. A fellow student of Yumeko and also a member of the student council with her appointed position being the head of the beautification committee. Midari is someone where the word intense is probably too kind to her in terms of personality with the word of unhinged being a more appropriate term instead. A focused, determined and eccentric person Midari is someone that can be seen as a dark mirror to what Yumeko could become as like Yumeko Midari enjoys gambling but the risks that she takes is of a much higher level than Yumeko. All members of the student council and indeed all students that attend the academy will specialize in a specific form of gambling and in Midari’s case this takes the form of Russian Roulette. In looking at Midari’s behavior during the course of her arc it can be seen that Midari has a rather unhealthy obsession with Russian Roulette more specifically the thrill that one gets from tempting death which I suspect is also how she got her eye patch in the first place.In addition to her normal personality Midari also has a number of personality traits that only stand to define her even more so. As stated earlier Midari views gambling with the same reverence as Yumeko does but rather than approach it with the calmness that Yumeko would Midari approaches it with rather reckless abandon and even when things go her way displays elements that indicate that maybe her sound of mind in abnormal such as she mutters to herself. Midari is also noted to get angry quite easily which is something that I think matches her personality quite well. In the course of her encounter and subsequent battles with Yumeko Midari I note also developed an obsession with Yumeko that I actually found to be quite creepy and indeed I was glad that in the end Yumeko was able to put Midari behind her.  The character of Midari is felt was a hard character to portray due to her questionable mental capacity but I felt that she served as a great reminder to what could happen to Yumeko should she ever become unhinged. I felt that Mariya Ise really did a great job in portraying the character of Midari.ItsukiItsuki Sumeragi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yuki Wakai is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Yumeko and co’s allies in their struggle with the student council. A first-year student and thus a fellow freshman of Yumeko’s Itsuki differs somewhat from the rank and file students that form the majority of the student body in that she comes a well-known family that manages a large business. This unique origin also has a hand in shaping the personality and ambition that Itsuki actually has as well as in the way that she approaches things. Personality wise Itsuki is someone that resembles a first-year schoolgirl such as she would be expected to display being a confidant, happy and positive person that’s kind and sweet to everyone that she meets. On the surface, she also appears to be a hardworking and dutiful person and works hard to uphold her role as the junior member of the student council despite only being a first year. Like every other character that appears on the series Itsuki also has a two-faced personality in this case her other personality is far more sinister than her surface one. In this other personality of hers that contrasts greatly with her surface one Itsuki visibly looks down on her opponents and has a rather creepy way of humiliating her opponents by taking their nails as their punishment when they lose to her. Like Meari Itsuki after her defeat by Yumeko underwent a great change in her personality. Though still very proud of her being the heir to her family business her defeat to Yumeko not only eroded the self confidence that she had for herself but also in what the family had for her.This made Itsuki rather humble and more diplomatic when she reappeared in the story as she could not afford to mess up anymore. However, despite her change to a humble schoolgirl Itsuki still wrestles with her temper which also introduces one of her prominent personality traits that until the latter part of the series was unrevealed. As a result of perhaps being the daughter of a rich family that controls a large business Itsuki is someone that hates being looked down upon and underestimated and instead prefers to walk down the path that she herself has chosen thus showing one of the more prominent traits of her personality which is that of her independence. Itsuki I felt was an interesting character that showed a great deal of development as the series went on. In her initial appearance while very loyal to her family I felt that she was also weighed down by the responsibility of representing them by doing well in the school which also had the effect of doubling the shock that she experienced when she was defeated by Yumeko. Her subsequent appearance in the later stages of the anime I felt were more natural as here it can be seen that she was determined to walk her own path on her own free will and not dictated by anyone else. I felt that her seiyuu Yuki Wakai did a great job of portraying the character of Itsuki here.YumemiYumemi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yuu Serizawa of Twin stars exorcist fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Yumeko’s many opponents that she faces in her struggle against the student council. A second-year student and also a member of the student council where she has the position of being head of their PR division Yumemi is a positive, cheerful and upbeat person that uses her official persona of an idol to promote herself.  As an idol Yumemi is shown to be extremely popular within the academy where she has enough fans to actually form a relatively large fan club that supports her enthusiastically and passionately. Beneath the mask of hers however Yumemi is shown to have a rather different personality in which she seems to actually despise her fans and only think of them as stepping stones to further her career.  In her struggle with Yumeko it’s also shown that Yumemi is a person that while appearing carefree and relaxed on the surface with regards to matches and gambling is actually someone that is determined to win at all costs. Interestingly during such games Yumemi has an obvious problem in hiding her anger when things turn against her. Unlike the great majority of characters that are featured in this series Yumemi is someone that actually has a career that she aspires to join which in this case is becoming a recognized star in the entertainment world something that actually surprised me. Because Yumemi was featured rather late in the series I felt that she wasn’t given enough opportunity to actually change her personality as the other members of the council that Yumeko faced were given. Despite this I felt that Yuu Serizawa really did a great job of portraying the character of Yumemi.Arts and animationAnimation I felt was really well done especially the various gambling effects for each of the games. The slow mo. effect for them I felt was especially well done. The character designs for each of the characters I felt were well designed especially the members of the student council. In particular the effects that show when Yumeko enters her ecstasy mode as she gets serious in the games I felt was especially well designed and unique.Voice actingThe voice acting for the series I felt was pretty strong with particular praise going to Saori Hayami who voiced the main character Yumeko and Minami Tanaka who voiced the character of Meari. Also deserving of praise, I felt is Miyuki Sawashiro who voiced the student council president Kirari Momobami, Yuki Wakai who voiced Itsuki and Yuu Serizawa who voiced the character of Yumemi.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty well done with the opening theme being quite catchy. The visuals for the opening theme though confusing at first, I felt also reflected the nature of the school that serves as the series main setting. The individual scene music I felt was also well done.Overall conclusionIn overall Kakegurui was an anime that I really enjoyed from the onset and remained interesting until the very end which itself is an accomplishment. The main strong points that make Kakegurui such a strong and interesting anime I felt was its interesting premise, excellent story, interesting characters, the introduction of simple but unique game types and its unique take on the types of personality that gamblers may develop though its two-faced nature. The look into the effects that people that lose in such games was also something that I thought was interesting. The premise of the story of having a gambling addict enter a school that teaches you how to not just gamble but also read and manipulate people I felt was unique and was helped greatly by both Yumeko’s personality and motivation for choosing to attend the school. The school and the system that it makes use of to determine the status of its students and their position within the school I felt was interesting because unlike in normal schools where ranking was determined by grades here its determined by how much you have won in the games something that I felt was appropriate for the setting. The overall story for the series I felt was pretty interesting as Yumeko though a seemingly new and innocent transfer student will by her love of gambling and taking of risks be able to change the whole fabric and hierarchy of the society that the school has cultivated for so long and in doing so force the members of the student council fight her in games that they should have had the advantage in. Watching Yumeko demolish the council one by one as she determined their cheating methods and used it against them was really satisfying. Arguably one of the most interesting aspects of Kakegurui I felt was its interpretation of the two-faced nature that most gamblers exhibit after having gambled for some time. In the case of Kakegurui this was in the form of differing personalities where the personality that the characters wear on the surface is their mask while their true personality is what lies beneath. This contrast in personalities I felt was pretty interesting and served too give more depth for each of the characters with Itsuki and Yumemi being the best examples of this aspect.Overall Kakegurui had everything that I think a good anime should actually have namely an interesting premise, interesting story, well-designed characters and excellent voice acting and featured a number of unique aspects that make use of its unique setting pretty well. As a final score I would give Kakegurui a 10/10 a score that I think it easily deserves. and psychological genre’s. The main premise of the series is that of this specific academy’s rather unique curriculum which rather than teaching you languages or social skills instead focuses on gambling and how to read people. By using the skills that you learn from these lessons you will be able to read people and allow you to outsmart your opponents and win big. Perhaps more than anywhere winning in this school counts more than anything as winning brings you money, prestige and allow you to ascend the ranks of the school hierarchy and maybe even gain entrance into the student council the most powerful students in the school.The overall plot of this series follows the life of Yumeko Jabami a transfer student that joins the strict but well known Hyakkaou Academy in the beginning of the series and in the process, turn the whole academy around with her amazing gambling skills and her unique take on what gambling is.

Saori Hayami I felt really did a fantastic job here in a role that is very unlike the ones that I usually see her in. It’s nice that Saori is starting to try her hand in roles that until now are unknown to her and I hope that she continues to surprise us with her skill and talent.MeariMeari voiced by veteran seiyuu Minami Tanaka of Schwarzesmarken fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of Yumeko’s main allies though this is something that she is loath to admit.

In the course of her encounter and subsequent battles with Yumeko Midari I note also developed an obsession with Yumeko that I actually found to be quite creepy and indeed I was glad that in the end Yumeko was able to put Midari behind her.  The character of Midari is felt was a hard character to portray due to her questionable mental capacity but I felt that she served as a great reminder to what could happen to Yumeko should she ever become unhinged. I felt that Mariya Ise really did a great job in portraying the character of Midari.ItsukiItsuki Sumeragi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yuki Wakai is one of the main support characters of the show and is one of Yumeko and co’s allies in their struggle with the student council. A first-year student and thus a fellow freshman of Yumeko’s Itsuki differs somewhat from the rank and file students that form the majority of the student body in that she comes a well-known family that manages a large business. This unique origin also has a hand in shaping the personality and ambition that Itsuki actually has as well as in the way that she approaches things. Personality wise Itsuki is someone that resembles a first-year schoolgirl such as she would be expected to display being a confidant, happy and positive person that’s kind and sweet to everyone that she meets. On the surface, she also appears to be a hardworking and dutiful person and works hard to uphold her role as the junior member of the student council despite only being a first year. Like every other character that appears on the series Itsuki also has a two-faced personality in this case her other personality is far more sinister than her surface one. In this other personality of hers that contrasts greatly with her surface one Itsuki visibly looks down on her opponents and has a rather creepy way of humiliating her opponents by taking their nails as their punishment when they lose to her. Like Meari Itsuki after her defeat by Yumeko underwent a great change in her personality. Though still very proud of her being the heir to her family business her defeat to Yumeko not only eroded the self confidence that she had for herself but also in what the family had for her.This made Itsuki rather humble and more diplomatic when she reappeared in the story as she could not afford to mess up anymore. However, despite her change to a humble schoolgirl Itsuki still wrestles with her temper which also introduces one of her prominent personality traits that until the latter part of the series was unrevealed. As a result of perhaps being the daughter of a rich family that controls a large business Itsuki is someone that hates being looked down upon and underestimated and instead prefers to walk down the path that she herself has chosen thus showing one of the more prominent traits of her personality which is that of her independence. Itsuki I felt was an interesting character that showed a great deal of development as the series went on. In her initial appearance while very loyal to her family I felt that she was also weighed down by the responsibility of representing them by doing well in the school which also had the effect of doubling the shock that she experienced when she was defeated by Yumeko. Her subsequent appearance in the later stages of the anime I felt were more natural as here it can be seen that she was determined to walk her own path on her own free will and not dictated by anyone else. I felt that her seiyuu Yuki Wakai did a great job of portraying the character of Itsuki here.YumemiYumemi voiced by veteran seiyuu singer Yuu Serizawa of Twin stars exorcist fame is one of the main support characters of the series and one of Yumeko’s many opponents that she faces in her struggle against the student council. A second-year student and also a member of the student council where she has the position of being head of their PR division Yumemi is a positive, cheerful and upbeat person that uses her official persona of an idol to promote herself.  As an idol Yumemi is shown to be extremely popular within the academy where she has enough fans to actually form a relatively large fan club that supports her enthusiastically and passionately. Beneath the mask of hers however Yumemi is shown to have a rather different personality in which she seems to actually despise her fans and only think of them as stepping stones to further her career.  In her struggle with Yumeko it’s also shown that Yumemi is a person that while appearing carefree and relaxed on the surface with regards to matches and gambling is actually someone that is determined to win at all costs. Interestingly during such games Yumemi has an obvious problem in hiding her anger when things turn against her. Unlike the great majority of characters that are featured in this series Yumemi is someone that actually has a career that she aspires to join which in this case is becoming a recognized star in the entertainment world something that actually surprised me. Because Yumemi was featured rather late in the series I felt that she wasn’t given enough opportunity to actually change her personality as the other members of the council that Yumeko faced were given. Despite this I felt that Yuu Serizawa really did a great job of portraying the character of Yumemi.Arts and animationAnimation I felt was really well done especially the various gambling effects for each of the games. The slow mo. effect for them I felt was especially well done. The character designs for each of the characters I felt were well designed especially the members of the student council. In particular the effects that show when Yumeko enters her ecstasy mode as she gets serious in the games I felt was especially well designed and unique.Voice actingThe voice acting for the series I felt was pretty strong with particular praise going to Saori Hayami who voiced the main character Yumeko and Minami Tanaka who voiced the character of Meari. Also deserving of praise, I felt is Miyuki Sawashiro who voiced the student council president Kirari Momobami, Yuki Wakai who voiced Itsuki and Yuu Serizawa who voiced the character of Yumemi.MusicThe music for the series I felt was pretty well done with the opening theme being quite catchy. The visuals for the opening theme though confusing at first, I felt also reflected the nature of the school that serves as the series main setting. The individual scene music I felt was also well done.Overall conclusionIn overall Kakegurui was an anime that I really enjoyed from the onset and remained interesting until the very end which itself is an accomplishment. The main strong points that make Kakegurui such a strong and interesting anime I felt was its interesting premise, excellent story, interesting characters, the introduction of simple but unique game types and its unique take on the types of personality that gamblers may develop though its two-faced nature. The look into the effects that people that lose in such games was also something that I thought was interesting. The premise of the story of having a gambling addict enter a school that teaches you how to not just gamble but also read and manipulate people I felt was unique and was helped greatly by both Yumeko’s personality and motivation for choosing to attend the school. The school and the system that it makes use of to determine the status of its students and their position within the school I felt was interesting because unlike in normal schools where ranking was determined by grades here its determined by how much you have won in the games something that I felt was appropriate for the setting. The overall story for the series I felt was pretty interesting as Yumeko though a seemingly new and innocent transfer student will by her love of gambling and taking of risks be able to change the whole fabric and hierarchy of the society that the school has cultivated for so long and in doing so force the members of the student council fight her in games that they should have had the advantage in. Watching Yumeko demolish the council one by one as she determined their cheating methods and used it against them was really satisfying. Arguably one of the most interesting aspects of Kakegurui I felt was its interpretation of the two-faced nature that most gamblers exhibit after having gambled for some time. In the case of Kakegurui this was in the form of differing personalities where the personality that the characters wear on the surface is their mask while their true personality is what lies beneath. This contrast in personalities I felt was pretty interesting and served too give more depth for each of the characters with Itsuki and Yumemi being the best examples of this aspect.Overall Kakegurui had everything that I think a good anime should actually have namely an interesting premise, interesting story, well-designed characters and excellent voice acting and featured a number of unique aspects that make use of its unique setting pretty well. As a final score I would give Kakegurui a 10/10 a score that I think it easily deserves.', 'ENG-I don\'t know if we can really talk about the scenario, because there isn\'t really any.

That’s what this is. Kakegurui isn’t a masterpiece or even a great anime, yet it’s an anime I had great fun watching. It reminds me of a video game that has a mediocre story but you play it because the gameplay is fun to you. Regardless of flaws, you enjoy most aspects because it’s fun, not because it’s soooo innovative and touching.Kakegurui has an art style that honestly I found so appealing. The color palette, the crispness of the art in certain places and the camera angles helped this feel like a treat for my...eyes. Art styles are subjective and your mileage may vary. The music was good. Seemed kind of fitting for manic gambling matches which is really what the audio should be aiming for.The story is solid in my opinion but nothing that will perplex you or will hit you hard. It’s again, enjoyable and fun. The premise is as absurd as the fan service yet it didn’t feel as ridiculous as I first imagined. I enjoyed seeing the new games, new characters and how they would choose to play out these games. The formula to winning or loosing didn’t seem as complex as they always made it out to be. That being said some of the kind games and trickery was more well thought out than other led me to believe.Now my favorite aspect of the show. The characters. Some people will have trouble relating to most of the characters. In fact a lot are either unlike able or seem a bit mediocre at first. I think a lot of this stems from the fact that most of the upper end gamblers are a bit of a manic gambling addict. That being said they all have different motivations, ideas on how to win or accomplish their goals and have decent back stories. Relating to a character in a crazy setting that’s filthy rich gambling millions is pretty hard to relate to, so it’s not surprising if a lot of people don’t find characters they enjoy that much but if you really look, a lot of these characters have some very flavorful personalities. The characters here are way more flawed than your probably used to seeing in anime and have some pretty dark sides. Yet if you enjoy characters that aren’t always black and white you can often enjoy many of these psychopaths. Again mileage may vary.So my recommendation is to try at least two episodes. If you don’t enjoy the first one or two matches you likely won’t enjoy the rest of the show. If your not into women orgasming over getting their fix through risky gambles, you probably won’t like the fan service parts.

This anime although set in a Gambling World with it as it\'s Premise is certainly less about Gambling and more about The psychological aspects behind it. What sets this anime apart from the rest in my opinion is the wide variety of diverse/unique/and eccentric characters. As you\'ll come to find out almost every character in this anime is mentally unstable and Psychotic, not always in a bad way but rather an entertaining way. Each episode reveals new characters...for the Main Character Jabami Yumeko to face off against in winner take all Gamble, with each Gamble having higher stakes and being more deadly than the last. For me that is what keeps this anime interesting, the ever changing Gambles as we root for our Psychotic MC to make her way to the Top of the Student Council. Unlike you\'re typical anime with School Settings this one offers a fresh new outlook on the genre shedding light into the more psychological aspects of a Gamble.Art:9/10- i love the unique predominately Red/Reddish color Palette which also offers warm yellows and Harsh Blues to set the mood depending on the situation/gamble.Characters:8/10 Not all of the Characters are impressive however we get such a wide range of them and an inside look on what makes them tick so it never gets dull. Theres so many unique characters with various personalities that every episode feels Fresh.Story: 7/10 Unique in it\'s premise but a tad bid Generic in it\'s delivery as its essentially a Battle Royal of Gambling your way to the top of the School. Nothing Crazy about it but it is Different and for me ""Different"" was good although that may not be the case for everyone.Art: 8/10 The Art is Good it\'s not in my Top 10 or anything but does have a distinct Style that will burn itself into your memory in a good way. When you see the Characters Facial expressions you\'ll know what i mean :)Voice Acting:8/10 The Voice Acting in this played a big role in my enjoyment of this anime and to be honest i think it\'s criminally underrated in that aspect. Every Voice is distinctly different and discernible and the voice actors really give it their all in the Climax of the Gambling scenes.All in all i gave this anime a 9/10 for staying very true to the Manga Source Material for the most part as well as being an overall enjoyable ride.

But does it capitalize on the what’s good about the show’s that influenced it? Back to that in a second, let’s talk about what the show does well first. The first episode starts off strong with gorgeous looking expressive and detailed character designs with thoughtful animation flourishes. Yuri on Ice’s Saya Yamamoto animated the OP with sex appeal, style and is one of the best this season and much of that style translates into the show...proper. The studio seems to understand the source material well, being very unsubtle about how insane and twisted this show is; preferring to highlight and accentuate this insanity as opposed to pretending it doesn’t exist. There is a lot of sexuality bubbling beneath the surface, unflinchingly proud to have its fan service and unlike Food Wars the fan service is a bit more thematically warranted.Let’s get back to some of those other similarities because it’s hard to think of other shows like Kaiji and No Game No Life while watching this and I can’t help but enjoy those shows more for a few simple reasons. First is the protagonist or in Kakegurui’s case the “protagonist?”. You see, these kinds of shows really benefit from an unexpected hero with new smart ideas that will revolutionize their world and help change the corrupted status quo. As high schools go, Hyakkaou Private Academy is a nightmare where actual professors both were allowed to and thought it was a good idea to make gambling the curriculum of the school. I mean there are still regular classes but that barely matters when your success is determined by how much money you make through being a corrupt lying cheating jackass. Yumeko seemed to discover about this school’s gambling scene by accident so it’s understood that other students wouldn’t have come to this school because of the gambling which begs the question “why would they stay after realizing how messed up everything is?”.Teachers have no presence in the show and everything is just run by a student council, which is not uncommon (in fantasy high school anime) but they probably couldn’t figure out a way to make any of this work while having teachers at this school and not have a logical reason why everyone couldn’t be arrested. Students practically become slaves (“livestock” as they call it in the show) to the whims of the elite. If we ever saw what society outside this school would look like, I would expect to see desolation and despair on the same scale as Dangan Ronpa. Even if that were the next level twist everything else is far too normal for that argument to have any legs.Compare that to Tootsuki, an elite high school where cooking is everything and also integrated into school grades and school life in a way that makes sense. People are super strict about cooking in a way that’s unfair but can be argued as “tough love” and part of the system’s rigorous curriculum to make sure the best of the best can only remain in the school. A bit ridiculous but not distracting from the reality of the show’s own situation. Or when Kill La Kill drove it’s clear “fascist school” idea home, it’s hyperbole reflected the tone, imagery, and story on every level, helped by it feeling far more fictional and otherworldly. Kakegurui is planted too far in reality to make that play as effectively.In many a show about psychological warfare, there’s this thing called the Xanatos Gambit that’s used as a sort of tool to ensure that the main hero can never lose because they can’t for the narrative of the story to work (plot armor so to speak). Light from Death Note uses it, Lelouch from Code Geass uses it, and Sora from No Game No Life uses it constantly. This Gambit so to speak ensures that the main character has secured a plan for victory every step of the way. Even if he/she loses he/she still wins because of something that has been planned for every foreseeable calculated probability. This takes some of the tension out of moments where it is all but ensured the audience knows the main character will succeed. All these characters find some exciting way to deceive the audience into how successful they will really be. In Light and Lelouch’s case, it’s never guaranteed that their plans have to go their way because they’re not true heroes. There are chinks in the plot armor and not everything has to go their way to keep things interesting. Then there’s Sora who always stakes his victory on absolutely everything so if he were to fail then the story would be over (at least in the anime I haven’t read the light novels). Now it’s no longer a matter of if they win but how.As far as Yumeko’s concerned, the how and why is effective the first time but on repeating matches feels like the same clever trick over and over again just with a different coat of paint. It wasn’t until the fifth episode that everything from the introduction of the villain to the formula of the match to the match’s aftermath felt no longer felt predictable and the episode ended feeling like I saw something new. By the time cheating is common and all parties that are involved are assumed to be cheating the game of bluffs becomes more interesting. In addition to the normal rules, one must predict how their opponent may break them. Unfortunately, these tricks only work by blindsiding the viewer. The set ups for the bluffs happen off screen and you never get to feel involved.Going back, remember when I was talking about the main character needing to revolutionize their world and help change the corrupted status quo was important to this kind of story? In the case of heroic characters, they are taught by reasonable down to earth people or knowing what it’s like to be the best but still have respect for the little guy they are relatable and easy to root for despite their character flaws. These shows capitalize on the feeling of dragging scum of the earth characters down from their high horse and having the protagonist impart a crucial lesson about what makes them the better person and deserving of such victory. Yumeko has none of this. She is as sadistic as the rest of her opponents and shows absolutely zero sympathy towards the down trodden, failing to separate her from the evils she’s up against. At first she’s shown with this cute innocent façade that crumbles as soon as it’s revealed she’s a hard core gambler. After her first and second match, it’s clear as day that Yumeko is untethered to sanity.When she goes into her savage mode this is supposed to be satisfying to the audience. It is in a way that her opponent’s own savagery was merely boastful and largely ineffective compared to her own. This is effective for a hot second but her wild demon-eyed craziness overstays this feeling and makes her out to be as demonic as her enemies. She makes her ambition clear from the start how she wants to rule over the school and reign supreme. She doesn’t want to tear down the student council, she wants to replace it with the same thing but with her at the top. In a way, Yumeko gets to be slightly more modest in her deviant tendencies over the villains by not trotting upon the less powerful and sometimes even granting others liberation. Her way of doing so isn’t so much by rescuing them from the evils they’re bond to but rather convincing them to break away from their chains and embrace self-aggrandizement themselves. It borders on manipulation but in the end their life is better off at the expense of those less deserving so that is something. The gap between hero and villain is widened by virtue of comparing a lesser evil to a greater one but the line is often too blurred to tell the difference.After her third match and first loss her resolve remains unshaken despite the actual danger she’s in seemingly absent of any emotional weakness. Although by reveling in the humiliation she manages to take away her victor’s power over her which is only satisfying because of how simple and cartoonish I found that power-hold to be in the first place. This demonstrates the commitment to downplay perceived danger in order to create more grandiose stakes later down the line. Still this isn’t the most relatable approach and I can’t find it in myself to want to route for this kind of person. I’m not sure if the show sees her as a hero like Kaiji or Sora or an anti-hero like Light and Lelouch. For some reason, whenever she’s not gambling the show likes to treat her like the cute innocent girl she was from the beginning even though the audience clearly knows she’s not. None of her emotions can ever be trusted as genuine, which is disconcerting for surrounding characters that continue to interact with her as if she might be normal.One such character is Ryouta, a fellow classmate and clear audience surrogate. His surprise and utter disbelief at Yumeko’s actions accurately summates the audience’s initial reaction. Much like myself, he wants to be the voice of reason in her clearly unstable gambling-complex lifestyle. However, after each match (incidentally the point where Yumeko’s personality gets reset at the beginning of each episode) he becomes friendly with her in a way that makes it seem like Yumeko’s personality disorder didn’t exist the day prior. I don’t think Ryouta ever learned about sociopathic tendencies or schizophrenics. All this may very well change as I’m sure manga readers would be aware. But as far as Yumeko’s story arc so far, it goes nowhere fast. Ryouta is more likely to become a more independent individual in the future and should the story focus more on him and his growth as a competent member of the team the more interested I’ll be.Also, after the first episode, the audience instantly knows the type of stake-raising competition anime this is going to be. Ryouta didn’t get the memo and acts all surprised when Yumeko unsurprisingly resumes her role as local crazy gambling lady challenging her next victim, which if it wasn’t obvious yet she destroys her because of course she does. Despite her opponent being on the student council, we’re two episodes in and she’s yet to be challenged. She loses the next match in the third episode because of dumb luck but not before realizing her opponents trick and utterly winning the psychological warfare portion of the match. The fact that she can win the “game” but lose the match because of this luck factor doesn’t instill much confidence. How will they continue to handle these losses while continuing to make the victories feel deserved; something Kaiji and No Game No Life has no problem doing because luck is either of little importance or a variable that can be magically manipulated. She takes her loss in stride because when you’re the protagonist of this type of story what do you have to fear? I guess her and I are on the same wavelength in that regard, it would be worse if the show pretended she was actually in trouble. Also, did I mention she’s a sociopath?Something that appears copiously in Kakegurui is what I’d prescribe as “ugly face” because “ahegao” just isn’t descriptive enough. This is where an unlikeable character’s face is drawn contorted and warped with a curled upper lip, twisted nose, and overly wrinkled eyes. All in order to really draw home how much pleasure they gain in their domineering behavior. This is used constantly in the show to great effect often highlighting their sexual deviance but I just don’t think I’m a fan of the effect and it’s used a bit too often. For this to work, a character acts and is drawn in a way that is cute and pleasant, but then it is revealed to merely be a façade by the animators/illustrators showing the character’s “true” face as perverse and twisted and how extreme the gap serves to accentuate the depth of said façade. This is merely a groan-able offense, as I said earlier I think this attitude fits the style and tone of the show… BUT, when every character in the school has merely the same façade this visual stunt feels exhausting and with each overuse, the effect is more ineffective than the last.I want to note that while I write about these issues, the length that I discuss them isn’t equivalent to the amount trouble they cause. They’re more or less bumps in the road to an otherwise good show, I just have a lot to say about it. Using gambling as an outlet to explore sexuality is concerning but also darkly humorous. I find the show's commitment to its insanity somewhat admirable even if I wish it went a bit further in its efforts or didn’t use it in substitute for better character writing. However, these characters are far from having no appeal. Each villain’s quirk is a tragic vice that flirts with power fantasies: control, fear, humiliation, adrenaline all ways to domineer themselves over their subjects and fuel their senses of sick superiority. The concept of self-destruction to gain self-gratification goes on in full force, which is both a great allusion to gambling as it is lust.In the end, I don’t feel like the show will take much of my nuisances into account and alter course towards something I’d be a bit happier with. However, there are still enough enjoyable moments to keep me attached. Studio Mappa’s animation style has a lot of visual hooks as well as interesting shot composition and editing. The excellent jazzy OP, rich in detail and meaning, made me want to come back to the show once a week despite my gripes but may just have been the shows strongest aspect anyway. proper. The studio seems to understand the source material well, being very unsubtle about how insane and twisted this show is; preferring to highlight and accentuate this insanity as opposed to pretending it doesn’t exist. There is a lot of sexuality bubbling beneath the surface, unflinchingly proud to have its fan service and unlike Food Wars the fan service is a bit more thematically warranted.Let’s get back to some of those other similarities because it’s hard to think of other shows like Kaiji and No Game No Life while watching this and I can’t help but enjoy those shows more for a few simple reasons. First is the protagonist or in Kakegurui’s case the “protagonist?”. You see, these kinds of shows really benefit from an unexpected hero with new smart ideas that will revolutionize their world and help change the corrupted status quo. As high schools go, Hyakkaou Private Academy is a nightmare where actual professors both were allowed to and thought it was a good idea to make gambling the curriculum of the school. I mean there are still regular classes but that barely matters when your success is determined by how much money you make through being a corrupt lying cheating jackass. Yumeko seemed to discover about this school’s gambling scene by accident so it’s understood that other students wouldn’t have come to this school because of the gambling which begs the question “why would they stay after realizing how messed up everything is?”.Teachers have no presence in the show and everything is just run by a student council, which is not uncommon (in fantasy high school anime) but they probably couldn’t figure out a way to make any of this work while having teachers at this school and not have a logical reason why everyone couldn’t be arrested. Students practically become slaves (“livestock” as they call it in the show) to the whims of the elite. If we ever saw what society outside this school would look like, I would expect to see desolation and despair on the same scale as Dangan Ronpa. Even if that were the next level twist everything else is far too normal for that argument to have any legs.Compare that to Tootsuki, an elite high school where cooking is everything and also integrated into school grades and school life in a way that makes sense. People are super strict about cooking in a way that’s unfair but can be argued as “tough love” and part of the system’s rigorous curriculum to make sure the best of the best can only remain in the school. A bit ridiculous but not distracting from the reality of the show’s own situation. Or when Kill La Kill drove it’s clear “fascist school” idea home, it’s hyperbole reflected the tone, imagery, and story on every level, helped by it feeling far more fictional and otherworldly. Kakegurui is planted too far in reality to make that play as effectively.In many a show about psychological warfare, there’s this thing called the Xanatos Gambit that’s used as a sort of tool to ensure that the main hero can never lose because they can’t for the narrative of the story to work (plot armor so to speak). Light from Death Note uses it, Lelouch from Code Geass uses it, and Sora from No Game No Life uses it constantly. This Gambit so to speak ensures that the main character has secured a plan for victory every step of the way. Even if he/she loses he/she still wins because of something that has been planned for every foreseeable calculated probability. This takes some of the tension out of moments where it is all but ensured the audience knows the main character will succeed. All these characters find some exciting way to deceive the audience into how successful they will really be. In Light and Lelouch’s case, it’s never guaranteed that their plans have to go their way because they’re not true heroes. There are chinks in the plot armor and not everything has to go their way to keep things interesting. Then there’s Sora who always stakes his victory on absolutely everything so if he were to fail then the story would be over (at least in the anime I haven’t read the light novels). Now it’s no longer a matter of if they win but how.As far as Yumeko’s concerned, the how and why is effective the first time but on repeating matches feels like the same clever trick over and over again just with a different coat of paint. It wasn’t until the fifth episode that everything from the introduction of the villain to the formula of the match to the match’s aftermath felt no longer felt predictable and the episode ended feeling like I saw something new. By the time cheating is common and all parties that are involved are assumed to be cheating the game of bluffs becomes more interesting. In addition to the normal rules, one must predict how their opponent may break them. Unfortunately, these tricks only work by blindsiding the viewer. The set ups for the bluffs happen off screen and you never get to feel involved.Going back, remember when I was talking about the main character needing to revolutionize their world and help change the corrupted status quo was important to this kind of story? In the case of heroic characters, they are taught by reasonable down to earth people or knowing what it’s like to be the best but still have respect for the little guy they are relatable and easy to root for despite their character flaws. These shows capitalize on the feeling of dragging scum of the earth characters down from their high horse and having the protagonist impart a crucial lesson about what makes them the better person and deserving of such victory. Yumeko has none of this. She is as sadistic as the rest of her opponents and shows absolutely zero sympathy towards the down trodden, failing to separate her from the evils she’s up against. At first she’s shown with this cute innocent façade that crumbles as soon as it’s revealed she’s a hard core gambler. After her first and second match, it’s clear as day that Yumeko is untethered to sanity.When she goes into her savage mode this is supposed to be satisfying to the audience. It is in a way that her opponent’s own savagery was merely boastful and largely ineffective compared to her own. This is effective for a hot second but her wild demon-eyed craziness overstays this feeling and makes her out to be as demonic as her enemies. She makes her ambition clear from the start how she wants to rule over the school and reign supreme. She doesn’t want to tear down the student council, she wants to replace it with the same thing but with her at the top. In a way, Yumeko gets to be slightly more modest in her deviant tendencies over the villains by not trotting upon the less powerful and sometimes even granting others liberation. Her way of doing so isn’t so much by rescuing them from the evils they’re bond to but rather convincing them to break away from their chains and embrace self-aggrandizement themselves. It borders on manipulation but in the end their life is better off at the expense of those less deserving so that is something. The gap between hero and villain is widened by virtue of comparing a lesser evil to a greater one but the line is often too blurred to tell the difference.After her third match and first loss her resolve remains unshaken despite the actual danger she’s in seemingly absent of any emotional weakness. Although by reveling in the humiliation she manages to take away her victor’s power over her which is only satisfying because of how simple and cartoonish I found that power-hold to be in the first place. This demonstrates the commitment to downplay perceived danger in order to create more grandiose stakes later down the line. Still this isn’t the most relatable approach and I can’t find it in myself to want to route for this kind of person. I’m not sure if the show sees her as a hero like Kaiji or Sora or an anti-hero like Light and Lelouch. For some reason, whenever she’s not gambling the show likes to treat her like the cute innocent girl she was from the beginning even though the audience clearly knows she’s not. None of her emotions can ever be trusted as genuine, which is disconcerting for surrounding characters that continue to interact with her as if she might be normal.One such character is Ryouta, a fellow classmate and clear audience surrogate. His surprise and utter disbelief at Yumeko’s actions accurately summates the audience’s initial reaction. Much like myself, he wants to be the voice of reason in her clearly unstable gambling-complex lifestyle. However, after each match (incidentally the point where Yumeko’s personality gets reset at the beginning of each episode) he becomes friendly with her in a way that makes it seem like Yumeko’s personality disorder didn’t exist the day prior. I don’t think Ryouta ever learned about sociopathic tendencies or schizophrenics. All this may very well change as I’m sure manga readers would be aware. But as far as Yumeko’s story arc so far, it goes nowhere fast. Ryouta is more likely to become a more independent individual in the future and should the story focus more on him and his growth as a competent member of the team the more interested I’ll be.Also, after the first episode, the audience instantly knows the type of stake-raising competition anime this is going to be. Ryouta didn’t get the memo and acts all surprised when Yumeko unsurprisingly resumes her role as local crazy gambling lady challenging her next victim, which if it wasn’t obvious yet she destroys her because of course she does. Despite her opponent being on the student council, we’re two episodes in and she’s yet to be challenged. She loses the next match in the third episode because of dumb luck but not before realizing her opponents trick and utterly winning the psychological warfare portion of the match. The fact that she can win the “game” but lose the match because of this luck factor doesn’t instill much confidence. How will they continue to handle these losses while continuing to make the victories feel deserved; something Kaiji and No Game No Life has no problem doing because luck is either of little importance or a variable that can be magically manipulated. She takes her loss in stride because when you’re the protagonist of this type of story what do you have to fear? I guess her and I are on the same wavelength in that regard, it would be worse if the show pretended she was actually in trouble. Also, did I mention she’s a sociopath?Something that appears copiously in Kakegurui is what I’d prescribe as “ugly face” because “ahegao” just isn’t descriptive enough. This is where an unlikeable character’s face is drawn contorted and warped with a curled upper lip, twisted nose, and overly wrinkled eyes. All in order to really draw home how much pleasure they gain in their domineering behavior. This is used constantly in the show to great effect often highlighting their sexual deviance but I just don’t think I’m a fan of the effect and it’s used a bit too often. For this to work, a character acts and is drawn in a way that is cute and pleasant, but then it is revealed to merely be a façade by the animators/illustrators showing the character’s “true” face as perverse and twisted and how extreme the gap serves to accentuate the depth of said façade. This is merely a groan-able offense, as I said earlier I think this attitude fits the style and tone of the show… BUT, when every character in the school has merely the same façade this visual stunt feels exhausting and with each overuse, the effect is more ineffective than the last.I want to note that while I write about these issues, the length that I discuss them isn’t equivalent to the amount trouble they cause. They’re more or less bumps in the road to an otherwise good show, I just have a lot to say about it. Using gambling as an outlet to explore sexuality is concerning but also darkly humorous. I find the show's commitment to its insanity somewhat admirable even if I wish it went a bit further in its efforts or didn’t use it in substitute for better character writing. However, these characters are far from having no appeal. Each villain’s quirk is a tragic vice that flirts with power fantasies: control, fear, humiliation, adrenaline all ways to domineer themselves over their subjects and fuel their senses of sick superiority.

Let's see.. Gambling.. Is that what drew me into watching this anime? Or is it only because of the setting that seemed interesting? Maybe.. the art style? To be honest..

A little improvement and it might be enjoyable and worthy of time."", 'As someone who""s been playing poker since he was older enough to count but too small to hold all his cards, I should have asked a long time ago why there wasn\'t more anime about gambling. That was until I watched Studio MAPPA\'s ""Kakegurui"". A show that takes the psychology of gambling and uses it as the soul of one of the more dark and twisted shows I have seen in a very long time.Taking place in the prestigious (YES a high school) Hyakkaou Private Academy, the rather cliched school where the richer and more powerful you are, the higher your standing socially is, and...the student council rules with an iron hand, the twist of having the entire place revolve around gambling and the social skills it teaches you is added in. This creates a unique atmosphere where the high tensity moments of each game of chance echo what other shows might achieve by having the students fight with fists rather than wits. ""Violence is strictly prohibited,"" we are told by one student council member, who has a hand taser to brandish in case someone does raise a fist in anger, but then to add a real hellish angle to this whole system is what happens to those who are debt- they are reduced to ""house pets"". Their humanity is stripped, they are relegated to second class citizens, and have to go through extremely high stakes to attempt to wipe away their debt and restore themselves.Now that I\'ve set up the environment, we are then introduced to our protagonist- Yumeko Jabami. A bubbly, buxom, compulsive gambler whose motivations are not quite known but it is quickly established that she loves the thrill of living on the edge of each rich bet and has very little concern for the consequences. Her eyes glowing red in the heat of it. She quickly causes quite a stir in the halls of the school and gets the attention of the sinister student council. The student council is an odd collection of characters with many a hackneyed premise filling their ranks. They make a unique crew of villains for our leading lady to oppose, but lack enough depth to interest the viewer beyond wanting to see them suffer for their wickedness.The meat of the show is in the showdowns provided with many different games of chance. I hadn\'t heard of many of these games before and they look like a lot of fun to play in real life. In the show however, they\'re treated as life or death duels where the loser will be relegated to the death of becoming a house pet- or perhaps even death itself. These tense moments are well choreographed the way other shows might do so with fighting or mech battles, but here it\'s the placing of chips, the draw of a card, the glance of a player, each scene so rich in color and lighting that it almost seems overdone for what amounts to a simple game of chance. Not that chance is what decides these battles, per se. As with most gambling institutions, cheating is rampant and it often comes down not to who plays the best, but who cheats the best. Like ""Ocean\'s 11"" or ""The Sting"" you\'re often wondering what the con is, the game behind the game, and each reveal provides a refreshing twist at the end of each tense episode.I enjoyed many things about this show, especially since it has one of the catchiest opening themes I\'ve heard in a long time ""Deal With The Devil"" by Tia, a fun Jazz piece reminiscent of something from ""Cowboy Bebop"" or ""Baccano!"". The ending themes are fairly basic decent pieces, but none that stuck to memory. The voice acting itself shows a real credit to the Japanese cast, they really brought their A game to this series and it shows with each individual performance and the crazy dialogue that they had to deliver. The English cast does it\'s best to keep up and while they put in a good showing, it doesn\'t match up with their Japanese counterparts with the exception of Sarah Williams as the demented roulette enthusiast Midari, her performance and voice fit the character so well, she was probably the best of either cast.So, what keeps this show from being good not great? It\'s one dimensional approach.The show\'s strength is also it\'s weakness. In a world of so many twisted characters with enough problems to fill up a mental hospital, it\'s very hard to find any of them likeable. Even our protagonist is a little too out there to get behind and the guy we\'re supposed to identify with and feel sorry for, Ryouta, is such a panicky wimp that he\'s more annoying and pathetic than sympathetic. You add all those nuts to an atmosphere that throws on the tension and then doesn\'t allow a real moment of pause for contrast or levity or even for the viewer just to catch their breath and you have what is an uncomfortable experience. Even moments of odd fan service where some of the ladies are shown to be sexually aroused and some lesbian innuendo thrown in just make the characters seem even MORE off their rockers rather than attractive.I can\'t in good conscience give this show anymore than a solid 6.5/10, a show that is exciting and fun at times, but can be so repulsive as well. That\'s also a good description of how gambling is, too. So, I\'ll offer the same advice for watching this show as I do those who want to gamble: it\'s fun, but not for the faint of heart.

Cheers!', ""Warning possible SpoilersFor a good while until Made in Abyss gained much deserved popularity, Kakegurui was the most popular anime of the summer period and honestly out of all the summer anime's I've seen, it was just alright which was a little disappointing to me.Story (7/10)The story mainly concentrates on Yumeko Jabami, who came to Hyakkaou Private Academy looking to see it can fill her gambling addiction and slowly over time, her reputation begins to grow.Now the story felt very similar to how Death Parade did things, both have the characters playing games, but are different every episode or so, except Kakegurui decided to make...a bunch of these matches last a couple of episodes and it got a little tiring waiting for the outcome of these matches at a certain point.However the show did a good job of making the matches suspenseful and coming up with ways of Yumeko defeating her opponents.A big problem however is that the show mainly focuses on these gambling matches and hardly anything else, so the pacing felt off to me because most of the episodes were either, building up to the match or actually having the match so if you're here looking for character development then you've come to the wrong place since only one character gets any development whatsoever.Whats even worse, is that the show was building up to this big climax with Yumeko taking on the student council president, but that final battle felt very unsatisfying and pretty much opens it way for a season 2, which after watching this I'm not looking forward to really.Character (7/10)There was really only 2 or 3 characters that were really worthy of taking note of in this series and even then only one character was actually great, all the rest are pretty damn forgettable.Yumeko Jabami is the female MC and boy oh boy was she the star of the show, on the outside she may look like a pretty girl who act's all sweet and innocent, but really on the inside she is a manipulative, sadistic and addictive girl who just gambles for the thrill of it. She was a really interesting character and probably one of the best female characters I've seen this year (well the bucket list is pretty big though) mainly because of her personality, but she is really the only character who has something going for her in this show.Ryouta Suzui is the male MC and ends up being saved from a bad situation thanks to Yumeko, honestly though he is a pretty useless character since most of the time he whines about how risky the situation is and that's pretty much it, oh apart from this one time where he helps in the final match, but this is really the extent his character is taken.Meari Saotome is the girl that was causing Ryouta trouble until Yumeko came along, honestly I didn't care for the girl at all, she was just the usual Tsundere trying to make things go her way and that was it, I literally gave no sh*t's for her.Yes there is a bunch more characters like the people Yumeko goes up against, but the only thing about them which stands out, is their insanity and that's it nothing else is remotely memorable about them.Art (8/10)This was pretty much the best part of the whole show, because the detailing on the characters faces was brilliant and hilarious at the same time, I'm serious every character made such a ridiculous face that they would be in you're nightmare's for all eternity or until you forget about the anime which is most likely to happen.I want to say the setup's for the matches looked pretty good, but even they looked bland, well apart from the magical Idol singer stage thing that happened at some point.Sound (6/10)The op and ed were pretty damn poor for an anime like this, I was expecting something good and didn't enjoy either of them, hell I skipped the op every episode after episode 1 because I just couldn't get into it.The soundtrack however did save the show a little, it fitted very well with making the matches suspenseful and had me going till the very end of the matches.Extra's:If there is one thing this show did absolutely brilliantly, it is the psychological aspect because each character you see who isn't Ryouta are fu*king insane for either power, money or just pure addiction and the best examples have to go to Yumeko and especially Midari who was so set on killing herself until Yumeko became her orgasm material, so yeah this show is full of messed up individuals.As someone who doesn't gamble whatsoever, I still thought the games involved were still interesting and were at least different every time so there was a nice amount of variety for the games involved in the show.I don't know why the mystery genre is there, other than the outcome of the match there is much for this genre being there to be honest.Enjoyment (7/10)Overall (7/10)Overall this was a alright anime, but disappointed me in certain areas. It made me feel like this was trying to be the next Death Parade, but failed in most aspects, it had the intense feeling the characters have during the matches, however it fails to recreate everything else.I'm honestly surprised less popular anime's like Aho-Girl, Koi to Uso, Restaurant to another world and even Centaur Worries managed to entertain me more.So if you're looking for a very enjoyable show this isn't exactly the right place to be looking, unless you're a hardcore gambler. a bunch of these matches last a couple of episodes and it got a little tiring waiting for the outcome of these matches at a certain point.However the show did a good job of making the matches suspenseful and coming up with ways of Yumeko defeating her opponents.A big problem however is that the show mainly focuses on these gambling matches and hardly anything else, so the pacing felt off to me because most of the episodes were either, building up to the match or actually having the match so if you're here looking for character development then you've come to the wrong place since only one character gets any development whatsoever.Whats even worse, is that the show was building up to this big climax with Yumeko taking on the student council president, but that final battle felt very unsatisfying and pretty much opens it way for a season 2, which after watching this I'm not looking forward to really.Character (7/10)There was really only 2 or 3 characters that were really worthy of taking note of in this series and even then only one character was actually great, all the rest are pretty damn forgettable.Yumeko Jabami is the female MC and boy oh boy was she the star of the show, on the outside she may look like a pretty girl who act's all sweet and innocent, but really on the inside she is a manipulative, sadistic and addictive girl who just gambles for the thrill of it.

For me, at a glance, it is obvious that it enters the category of ""good anime"".  This is as opposed to the formulaic, predictable, money grabbing, low effort run of the mill shit that we\'ve been getting the last decade.  Here we have a series which has a clear aim to rise above the typical moeblob garbage, at least in terms of production quality and originality.At the same time i can see why a lot of people wouldn\'t like it.  The viewers who prefer to have stories more grounded in reality...and relatable will surely not be able to enjoy the bombastic, over the top stupidity of Kakegurui.  The premise is nonsense, the characters are weird and outlandish, the setting is completely out there.  You have to accept that this show is a lame-azing, fun trainwreck and allow yourself to simply enjoy it.  But you can\'t turn your brain off!  After all, games and gambling are the focus of this story, so it\'s wasteful not to try and play along inside your mind.So Kakegurui is ridiculous, but it\'s ridiculous in all the right ways.  First of all, the variety of fan service is very fresh.  In this case it\'s not crappy accidental panty shots, it\'s girls getting aroused from gambling or other bizarre ""fetishes"".  No pure maidens here, just real self-aware sluts.  It\'s very different and much more effective.  You also get a lot of yuri bait out of nowhere, but the tone is depravity, no hand-holding crap, so i can dig it.The games themselves serve as a bit of intellectual stimulation, though they are not nearly as interesting as, for example, the ones in Liar Game.  The real satisfaction comes from tables turning, and the strong crushing the weak.  The exaggerated emotions, the despair, the sadistic satisfaction of the winners; it\'s very tantalizing.  Don\'t expect a story-writing masterpiece here, this rapidly becomes predictable.  Both the game\'s outcomes and the method.  You know how you can predict the plot twist, just because you know they HAVE to try to make everything a plot twist?  Characters just being consistently too-smart?  Yeah it\'s that kind of thing but whatever.The main contributor to the enjoyment of this anime is the very high production value.  The characters are meticulously drawn with a very high level of detail, down to individual tooth shapes, lip shapes and reflections, iris textures, etc.  Their facial expressions are vivid and complex, though almost higurashi levels of exaggerated sometimes.  Still, I\'ll take this any day over bland sameface A1 Pictures pieces of shit.  There are also moments of top quality animation, such as a character\'s lips properly mouthing a word rather than simply opening and closing.  The sound also leaves nothing to be desired, with a top tier cast of voice actors, and here also a high level of attention to detail.  You even have tooth grinding sounds when people get too frustrated!Overall, Kakegurui is a very fun, exciting piece of work which just has to be watched for what it is.  Yeah, it\'s not Shakespeare, but that\'s not what i watch anime for, and if you do, you\'re going to be disappointed pretty often.  Watch this, and then watch Liar Game. and relatable will surely not be able to enjoy the bombastic, over the top stupidity of Kakegurui.

Not bad for a casual watch that was enough to keep me interested but not really invested.Story seemed interesting enough at first, sorta classic high-school tropes but GAMBLING, at least that should be interesting...eh not too bad.Art style was unique, the psychological-ish scenes were nice and freaky.Sound was fine, I have no complainents about that.Characters were so bland, the main girl seemed interesting enough for a protagonist that you know is oops gonna be really good at gambling but they never explained anything about her or her motivations other then she...loves the thrill of gambling...so nothing had any stakes, like the amounts of money they were gambling kept increasing and it literally felt how superhero films where they now have to fight to save the universe becasue just saving the earth would be too boring.The main dude was a plain Gary Stu, he was literally there to say ""yOU CANT DO THAT IT\'S TOO DANGEROUS-"" oops she\'s doing it anyways aaaaand she either wins or loses but she doesn\'t seem to care either way so does it matter?All of the ""villians""/student council members were literal gimmicks, or they just never explained anything, guess it can\'t be helped about a short series like this.Enjoyment was okay, I wanted to watch an okay gamblng anime, it was good enough for me but nothing stellar.Overall it was just fine, nothing great but not that bad, nothing offensively  bad anyways. so nothing had any stakes, like the amounts of money they were gambling kept increasing and it literally felt how superhero films where they now have to fight to save the universe becasue just saving the earth would be too boring.The main dude was a plain Gary Stu, he was literally there to say ""yOU CANT DO THAT IT\'S TOO DANGEROUS-"" oops she\'s doing it anyways aaaaand she either wins or loses but she doesn\'t seem to care either way so does it matter?All of the ""villians""/student council members were literal gimmicks, or they just never explained anything, guess it can\'t be helped about a short series like this.Enjoyment was okay, I wanted to watch an okay gamblng anime, it was good enough for me but nothing stellar.Overall it was just fine, nothing great but not that bad, nothing offensively  bad anyways.', ""I have honestly never seen a singular piece of media which is more unabashed, more unashamed, and more unafraid of the female orgasm is my life, and I loved every minute of this.I honestly cannot remember how the hell I came to discover this anime, I almost never get into anime as it's been released and I almost always wait until months after the hype has died down, but somehow, perhaps by fate, I stumbled across Kakegurui and I've never once looked back. From episode one, I was hooked and addicted to this anime, it grabbed me and dragged me along on its wild, deranged...ride and I was grinning like a little devil the entire time. It's definitely one of the most unique and smartly-written animes I've ever come across, reminding me both of Death Note and Sherlock Holmes in its approach to the unraveling of the characters and their hidden machinations as well as the way their moments of sheer malicious joy are beautifully illustrated along with a massive dose of free-wheel, unhinged, insane glee mixed in. Yes, it may have its flaws and it may not be for everyone, but I'm become addicted to this anime and, whatever flaws it may have, I do not care one single iota.

During the day, it is just similar to normal school educating people in most academic subjects however when the sun goes down, it becomes a gambling den where people are...educating with money and playing with highest stakes. When you win, you\'ll live like a king and queen of this school but if you lose, you\'ll have debt to deal with and become a house pet where the other students will treat you as animals and sometimes gets a beatdown from bullies. In this series, Ryota Suzui is the part of the problem where he recently lost to Mary Saotome. Everything changed, when a transfer student named Yumeko Jabami came into the school. Yumeko may look like a normal and beautiful girl but when she gambles she\'s like on fire enjoying the thrill of the gamble.Art and Animation: Studio MAPPA, the studio that brings you Yuri on Ice!!, provides the animation of the series and the art shift between the character\'s expressions especially when they\'re going crazy or frightened when they lose are awesome as it can make you say ""YES YES YESSSS!!! I\'LL MAKE THOSE GUYS SCREAM SO HARD WHEN THEY LOSE!!! WAHAHAHAHA!!!!"". The anime\'s animation is using film noir aesthetics since gambling is the central plot of the series that totally fits the gambling atmosphere every episode.Sound and Music: The series\' sound and music are great such as suspenseful sounds during the game which give the feeling of thrill of watching the series. The series opening music, ""Deal with the Devil"", is a mixture of jazz and pop music which totally suits the theme itself giving the feeling of playing gambling games in the casino.Voice Acting: Their performance is super awesome and they express their emotions superbly especially when they\'re getting crazy playing the game. In the Japanese version, Yumeko\'s seiyuu, Saori Hayami, notable for voicing good-natured, prim and proper lady characters, is taking it into a different level where she becomes a crazy girl during gambling. The English voice actor for Yumeko, Erika Harlacher, just like Hayamin (Saori Hayami\'s fan nickame), who is also notable for voicing rich girls like Claudia Enfield of Asterisk War, prim and proper characters like Violet Evergarden and princess-y characters like Princess Asseylum of Aldnoah.Zero, is no joke because she delivers it very well whenever Yumeko is getting crazy.Enjoyment: The series is very addictive and awesome which I\'m getting excited to see the next season because it is very enjoyable to watch. educating with money and playing with highest stakes.

It was good, actually, but I guess I wasn't super attached to the story nor the characters. First episodes were good, then it just felt like the same thing going on over and over. I was expecting something big to happen towards the end but it never happened.Now, enough with the negative stuff. I liked the main character, Yumeko. She is the typical 'neither good, nor bad' character that I love watching. She knows what she wants and...she's confident. The blonde girl (forgot her name) was also an interesting character, I like how she hated Yumeko but then they become kind of close. Nothing to say about the main male, he was just there.  I mean, of course, this anime is girl x girl fanservice and guys aren't relevant to the story, but still it would have been better if the writers did something else with him.7/10. I will watch the second season. Also, I'm curious about the J-drama as well, maybe I'll check it out and see if it's different from the anime. she's confident.

I found kakegurui to be amazing. Its thrilling and clever and it brings up a completely different side of gambling. The story is nice and the characters are intriguing.And even thought you know that Yumeko is going to outsmart everyone, each time you are amazed by the way she does it.I really enjoyed the whole series which is really close to the manga itself except from the ending which baffled a little but even so i still enjoyed it very much!!!For anyone who likes psychological series i really recommend you to watch it!!!!

You don't come to this anime for things to make sense, you don't come to this anime expecting down to earth, realistic gambling matches.No.You come to this anime to witness a spectacle.

Mix in some strong sexual overtones, fantastic animation, and some of the craziest facial expressions you'll see anywhere and you'll have one good time.I'm not here to criticizing the finer...details of gambling in this show.

It's not bad per se and it fits the show really well, but I would prefer something a little bit different. For an example I felt like similar facial expressions were done perfectly on Grand Blue as in this show they just want me to close my eyes.Initially I watched the 1 episode about a year ago and left it at that. Now then, I decided to try it once more and I actually liked it a bit. The reason is that it's so...refreshing to see this kind of show, which has unique characters and plot, or basically everything is that much different to what I'm used to seeing. Outside of the insanely thicc mc girl.Also I should probably mention this is my first gambling anime and also my 200th anime. So I could maybe recommend this to someone who is kind of bored to anime and wants to experience something a bit different. It's not the best but it's at least somewhat entertaining. In contrast I wouldn't bring this up to someone who just recently started watching anime because it wasn't that amazing, but still good. refreshing to see this kind of show, which has unique characters and plot, or basically everything is that much different to what I'm used to seeing.

I can't decide if the author wanted to make a gambling story more appealing by sexing it up a bit, or if he wanted to make he BDSM torture fetish porn more palatable by adding the pretense that it was a gambling anime. Probably the latter.The crazy rich school with a class system based on your performance isn't a unique idea in anime. It's the logical conclusion to exaggerating how stressful and demanding some prestigious Japanese schools...can be. What's unique is how it's all tied to gambling, and how crazy sadistic everyone at this school is. I don't know if there's supposed to be some commentary in being rich somehow leading people to only be able to find enjoyment in the misery of those less fortunate than themselves. Doesn't matter, because there's one student who gets off on the danger, and seems to find losing just as exhilarating as winning. Imagine being so messed up that you make the sadist class who was trying to bully you a minute ago too disgusted to continue.The actual gambling in this show is not very high stakes at all, despite them trying so hard to portray it as such. Everyone is just cheating, and you learn pretty early on that Yumeki is just going to win every time by cheating better, or getting lucky. The games are usually needlessly complex for the sake of making it more anime, and to make cheating it easier I guess. What's respectable about the main character is that they actually lose a couple times, but it ultimately doesn't matter because the only way to really beat her is not to play.

Even if that's all you're here for you'll probably still have a good time. 8/10 can be. What's unique is how it's all tied to gambling, and how crazy sadistic everyone at this school is. I don't know if there's supposed to be some commentary in being rich somehow leading people to only be able to find enjoyment in the misery of those less fortunate than themselves. Doesn't matter, because there's one student who gets off on the danger, and seems to find losing just as exhilarating as winning. Imagine being so messed up that you make the sadist class who was trying to bully you a minute ago too disgusted to continue.The actual gambling in this show is not very high stakes at all, despite them trying so hard to portray it as such. Everyone is just cheating, and you learn pretty early on that Yumeki is just going to win every time by cheating better, or getting lucky. The games are usually needlessly complex for the sake of making it more anime, and to make cheating it easier I guess. What's respectable about the main character is that they actually lose a couple times, but it ultimately doesn't matter because the only way to really beat her is not to play.

Although the anime starts off focusing on some dumb guy, the real MC/Protag is a girl who literally and figuratively gets off on gambling. That being said, this is not a show about sex. This is a show about gambling, where everything in the high school the main characters reside in is decided by gambling. Episodes consist of gambling, unique reactions to gambling, and the MC figuring out how people are cheating, ignoring their cheating, and beating them anyway (most of the...time).The gambling games are pretty great for the most part, not in the merit of the games themselves but more in terms of what is done with the games. The characters are all relatable but a tiny bit shallow. It is strange that such crazy characters are relatable, but since they all have a relatively reasonable basis for their goals (i.e. I like gambling, I like being powerful, etc) it allows you to feel as though you are the one gambling a little which is kind of neat. The bits with sex honestly just feel out of place, as they are really just there to enunciate just how extreme the gambling is, but personally I\'d rather they didn\'t.

This review covers some bits of s2 too (without giving out much about it)A “compulsive” anime standing up to its name.I had to watch a “psychological – ecchi” anime(I have no idea why this anime has no ecchi tag on MAL). So I gambled and choose Kakegurui over Monotagari. Well that explains how my first gamble went down the ditch.I personally enjoyed Kakegurui because I like psychological and mind games. But this is a complete absurd anime. There are so many things wrong and so few things right; and so many questions unanswered. I completed s1 and...s2. And s2 is more weird than s1.As most anime do, even this defies logic. I’m sure most of us would have thought, “Which parent can be so irresponsible as to send their kids to a school where they spend money like water for gambling?” And that is just the beginning of the bizarre questions I got from watching this anime.Time to break the anime down.OP:I like how the aquarium imagery was used in s1\'s OP. About why it is used, we’ll know in the later episodes of s1. The song is okay-ish but actually suits the anime. So that is a plus.I liked s2\'s OP more than s1’s OP. It was really good.ED:The video of s1\'s ed creeped me out, ngl. I don’t like ecchi, but I can tolerate it. This ed made me question myself. WHY THE HELL DID I NOT SKIP IT????(I did skip after watching it twice-thrice)And EP 9 has a special ED - ""Koi no Russian Roulette"". That was cute to watch. I wished it were permanent ed xdRest of the OST:They were good. Though the music around the ahegao expressions were just too much for me to handle, I think anyone who watched ecchi will have no trouble with it.Animation:Since the studio is MAPPA, the animation is on par with their standards. But, Ahegao expressions disturbed me a lot. Like A LOT.But what I did like are the male lead’s expressions. What happens when a normie is lost between crazies?Our Male MC happens.Characters:The anime starts with Saotome Mary and Suzui Ryouta. We get to see a crazy right off the bat. Each character is more crazier, more weirder and more disgusting that the other. None of the characters are actually either lovable imo or relatable. Some may like Yumeko Jabami for Yandere reasons, but there is actually no development. Each character is a gamble addict. Some smart, some dumb, some stupid and some just disgusting. There is actually nothing more to say. They are just gamble addicts with some goals, but each is more repulsive than the other.When it comes to s2, we see some development into the “Bami” family. We get new characters that are again as eerie as those in s1, if not more.Overall, this anime doesn’t have a proper character development so highly not recommended for people who want to see character development.Voice Actors:We are very familiar with Saori Hayami. And I am not particularly aware of other VAs, but I think everyone has really done their job great.And Finally,The so-called “Plot”:Yes, it is so-called because I barely find anything in it.A school where people receive their social standing through gambling. Well many want to be on top of the social circle, so we see power-hungry, money-hungry crazies making their go for it.I said that the anime is pretty “compulsive” like its name. Why? Because it is. The entire anime depends on Yumeko’s irresistible urge to gamble and social hierarchy being decided on gambling. That’s it. Nothing else. There is nothing else driving this anime. And the more I watch, the more questions cross my head which shows just how ridiculous this anime is.I won’t state all my questions as they’ll be spoilers. But I’ll share some of them:1.\tHow can Ikishima carry a gun in a school?2.\tGambling as hobby is fine. But they are ruining lives and bullying people. What is management doing about it?3.\tWhich parents send their children to a school where they spend money without any responsibility?And the rest fall under spoilers. But I’m sure many of you must have thought about them too.Entertainment:As someone who likes psychological, I’ll say this anime has some perks here and there that impressed me. I even enjoyed some of the gambles. But overall, it wasn’t interesting to me. Entertaining, but not interesting.Final Opinion:An anime good for psychology-thriller lovers, who wouldn’t mind absurdity.

How much plot armour can you use in a single story before the viewers started to get annoyed? Apparently, the answer is a lot. As you can see from the MAL score, people seem to love this anime. It\'s crazy characters and intense drama was able to create a fanbase that loved every single part of Kakegurui. However, with every show, especially the popular ones, comes a significant number of people that just weren\'t able to enjoy what this show had to offer,...and I guess I fall into the latter of Kakegurui\'s watchers.Looking at the cast of Kakegurui, most of the characters are pretty messed up in the head. We have one that collects human nails, another that loves playing Russian Roulette with herself and our main Yumeko Jabami, who literally gets off by taking risks in gambles. In fact, the only one without an eccentric personality is Ryouta Suzui, although he\'s only really there to occasionally comment on how the game\'s going and serves no other purpose but to worry over Yumeko as she throws herself into another gamble. Back to the nutcases, it\'s perfectly fine to have insane characters to spice up your cast, but when you have this many to this extent, you start to forget they\'re supposed to be actual people within their world. Their personalities are so exaggerated that it\'s hard to take any of them seriously, and when you factor in the anime\'s formula of moving from one big game to another, most of the characters just become another crazy face for Yumeko to defeat, only popping back up a few more times to remind us that they still exist within this school.Now the other important side of Kakegurui is the drama. Each gamble usually has the same set of steps, Yumeko faces off against someone, the opponent makes it look like they have the upper hand with either a cheating method or their intellectual superiority, but Yumeko soon turns the tables on them and mind breaks them harder than a hentai heroine. Now for the first few games, it might have been entertaining to watch, but after a while, you start to get tired of seeing it happen over and over. A number of issues also pop up, further bringing down my enjoyment of the show.First of all, plot armour and convenience. Yumeko will never lose an important match, the story won\'t allow her. With stakes like massive debt, slavery and sometimes even death, it would be problematic if Yumeko lost too many times as she would no longer be able to participate as our main character. So the obvious solution is to make her incredibly lucky. Sure you could try to make each game a battle of wits, allowing our MC to come up with ingenious strategies while crushing her opponent\'s plans in the process, but who wants to see something like that? Mind games are boring, I\'d rather just watch Yumeko shine her shinigami eyes and win over and over. Games that hold no dramatical impact are much better than an intense showdown between two people, ain\'t that right everyone?Secondly, shock factor. No, I\'m not talking about the twisted and contorted faces each character makes, I\'m fine how messed up each cast member looks during the show. I\'m more focused on the actions that some of the characters make during an episode. For example, Yumeko asks Itsuki Sumeragi for a loan so that she could defeat Kaede Manyuda, but Manyuda taunts Sumeragi by saying she has no chance of reaching the top. In an act to show off how determined she is to become the best of the best, Sumeragi bites down on her nails and rips them out with her teeth. Now, why the fuck would you do that? Just give Yumeko the money and make a speech about how you do have the guts to take a risk, you didn\'t need to physically injure yourself. There is only one reason why you\'d do this, and it\'s to create shock factor. The show wants to make you feel squeamish, so they pull off these ridiculous scenes to make you squeal while covering your eyes in fear. It doesn\'t work that way, guys. You need a reason behind gore and other messed up scenes, just mindlessly showing off stuff like this all the time causes it to feel forced and lessen the amount of impact the scene would have originally had.Thirdly and finally, plot developments that make no sense. Now granted, this doesn\'t happen as often as the first two issues I mentioned, but it\'s something that needs to be addressed. In episode 7 where Yumeko is facing off against Midari Ikishima, playing a game called ESP Roulette. Someone in a separate room creates a pattern by placing a set of cards face down, each marked with different symbols, and a live feed is broadcasted to the room where the players are. The two opponents must then place their cards face down, each with the same set of symbols to try and guess the order. Of course, once all the cards are revealed, the person who guesses the most wins that round, and the chance to shoot their opponent with a revolver filled with a varied amount of bullets, hence the roulette part of ESP Roulette. (Again shock factor and plot armour wow so intense) Now, Yumeko figures out that Midari is cheating by occasionally inverting the video feed, changing the order shown on the screen. However, this provides neither an advantage or disadvantage for any of the players. Midari still has no idea what order the cards are set up until they\'re revealed, and her partners on the other side have no idea how well Midari guessed the cards, she\'s just changing the order up for no reason. It makes no sense to have her do this when it makes no difference to whether she has a better chance of winning or losing.Kakegurui has nothing to offer to us but its characters and drama, but these two factors end up feeling more bland then exciting. There were still times where I thought the show did things well, as I consider the debt replacement game in episodes 4 and 5 to be the only good gamble in the anime, but overall I just feel like taking my chances with another gambling anime and see how much better that fairs. I hear Kaiji is really good, should probably watch that.Thanks for Reading, Send Feeback if You Have Any! and I guess I fall into the latter of Kakegurui\'s watchers.Looking at the cast of Kakegurui, most of the characters are pretty messed up in the head.

I hear Kaiji is really good, should probably watch that.Thanks for Reading, Send Feeback if You Have Any!', 'If I had to describe Kakegurui in simple worlds, I would say it is an monotone anime that loops constantly with the next features: Yumeko wants to gamble + she makes crazy faces + she starts to gamble + she makes crazy faces + she somehow always knows that her opponent is cheating + she makes crazy faces + she drives her opponent crazy + she either win or lose but will surely make a crazy face = repeatTL;DR: Overall SectionIts a shame that Kakegurui became so monotone and boring withing time, it had a nice potential because In my opinion was a pretty unique...setting that I haven\'t seen before (I\'m watching Kaiji at the moment and its pretty good so far) But leaving all that aside... What IS Kagegurui, and what it has to offer?The story is way too simple to begin with, there is no depth and it is full of plot conveniences. There is a high school that allows students to gamble huge amounts of money that they get off from their asses. If one of the students lose and then, get itself into a large debt, it will become a ""pet"" or maybe an slave. When you are a pet, everyone will make crazy faces against you and will treat you like shit, also if you can\'t repay your debt you may be forced to have a ""life plan"" that includes marrying someone and have kids. About how is such a school possible and how the heck did the parents approve such a behavior that may end ruining the life and reputation of their children is unknown. That\'s pretty much what I can tell you about Kakegurui\'s plot, there is no world building, there isn\'t a significant plot that add details to the story, the main thing that this show has to offer is fanservice of Yumeko and the detailed monotone looping that I stated before. 3/10The art is a very interesting addition that helps the show to have that ""dark"" atmosphere that also works well with the several crazy faces that the characters constantly do. From my POV this is a plot convenience to keep the viewer hooked while they get them to drink their low-tier milk, it might taste bad depending on how hooked you are into this anime. The character designs are quite generic, some of them look all right, some of them look pretty dull and soulless, and some of them look uninteresting. On the other hand, the crazy faces are very detailed on a very disturbing way, its possibly the best feature of this anime. I admit, that I were attracted to this faces at first, but after the constantly monotone looping this show fell on, it feels pretty boring, uninteresting and even disgusting (I\'m watching you, crazy finger nail girl) 7/10The sound department does a decent job portraying the insane personalities of the characters while they are lost in gambling, the voice acting feels nice at first, it adds tension alongside the animation when it comes to settle a gamble, but after a while you may find better to turn off the sound... I certainly wouldn\'t want to hear 6 hours straight of random noises, insane noises or even a girl that mentally (and also physically) masturbates while having the most intense session of death on her mind.The Soundtrack also fits well when it comes to add tension and the OP is fancy and catchy. 7/10Now, alongside with the poor story, comes the poor characters that this show has. They are not only uninteresting, they are also 1 dimensional and will probably never develop. The male ""main character"" only serves as a plot device to describe what the gambles are about, otherwise his presence wouldn\'t even matter. Yumeko\'s role (*cough cough* plot armor *cough cough*) is basically breaking the mind of her opponents while doing crazy faces. Aside of the main duo and the insane suicide girl that has mental boners each time she has a ""chance"" to kill herself, there is nothing else from the character cast that is interesting or meaningful. 3/10Now, as for enjoyment, if you like to see some crazy faces and bitches getting owned for 12 episodes, you will probably like this show. Otherwise you will probably find it boring and repetitive 5/10Overall 5/10: Crazy faces, monotone and looping story line, uninteresting characters, plot holes, plot devices, plot conveniences, plot armors, 1 dimensional characters for a premise that could have worked better if there were an actual sense of danger from the gambles and a proper development and buildup for the characters. setting that I haven\'t seen before (I\'m watching Kaiji at the moment and its pretty good so far) But leaving all that aside...

In this academy, gambling controls everything, whether it is your school or your personal life.Jabami Yumeko, a new transfer student, transferred mysteriously into this elite academy one day. And that is...when all hell broke loose. Winning each game with the highest stakes and defeating many student council members in their own forte, she soon makes a name for herself. Like being possessed by gambling Yumeko is someone who gets on by risking it all, someone who loses herself to the very essence of gambling and only sees gambling as the main motive of her life. While others gamble to win and rake in money, she does it solely for the pleasure of risking it all, she gambles because she enjoys the very essence of gaming. Like a junkie who has lost herself to these games, she becomes the new target of the student council, someone they must get rid of to protect their own status and dignity.

I loved it. It has been one of the wildest, strange, and unique animes I've seen in quite some time. I am incredibly picky about anime, I always have been and still will be. With that, here is my review. This anime is the first gambling one I have watched. I had no idea what to expect; I thought it was going to be a pure academy, gambling, social anime. I was blown away by what I watched.STORYThe story is solid for what the anime is. Now, to me, it is more than...just a gambling anime. It is about the addiction, and thrill, and the absolute sin of it all. How far will a person go, how crazy can a person be? Without giving spoilers, I love how Suzui develops at the end. I think there is more to Yumeko as well; then again maybe it is just art style; will have to wait and see what happens in season 2.SOUNDThe soundtrack is lovely, smooth and sexy jazz with dark and light tones all blended into one great ost. The intro song and outro song are freaking amazing.ARTThe art is gorgeous, dark colors, with hints of vibrancy. The character designs are pretty good as well. The outlandish facial expressions are freaking wild, and sometimes super creepy, but that adds to the whole insane gambling charm.CLOSINGI enjoyed this anime, and It made me feel all kinds of emotions. From creeped entirely out to sad, and even happy.  If you can get past the sexual gambling undertones, I highly recommend watching it. It is a unique form of art and entertainment. just a gambling anime. It is about the addiction, and thrill, and the absolute sin of it all. How far will a person go, how crazy can a person be?

If you like gambling and like Death parade ( which I am one of those fans ) then you will absolutely love Kakegurui.The plot is ok with a transfer student kicking peoples asses in a gambling match in a school so yeah it's kind of good. The detail that I really love with this anime is the art style which shows many reactions with the characters of what does nasty or pitiful faces look like not to mention when...they gamble is outstanding. The theme song and themes you hear in the background are quite good to listen to some's a bit jazzy others are just interesting to listen to so I wouldn't quite be into the music if I were you. All the characters you see are outstanding since none of them are dull or boring they all have weird fetishes. (besides Kaede he has no fetish) They are all pretty amazing characters that have their own evil personality. I mostly enjoyed this anime since of all the suspense you can put on this anime is spectacular to watch and really adapts to the manga as well ( go read the manga too if you would like )I really recommend that you should watch Kakegurui since it is really is a good adaptation with the manga. Don't believe me then I suggest you go to Akidearest's channel on YouTube since she made an entire video on Kakegurui. they gamble is outstanding.

But, it failed miserably, because it also tried to be another Shokugeki No Souma.  And by trying to mix these two incompatible anime together, it failed to live up to either one of them, and became a disjointed and poorly executed letdown.   One moment you\'re watching Jabami playing an insane version of Russian Roulette in a dingy basement with a complete psychopath, the next moment, she\'s singing pop songs on stage as an idol contestant.  The anime completely lacked congruence and kept vacillating between mature and childish.The biggest problem...with the anime is that it wanted to be so much like Kaiji, but placed the story in a school, which is the worst possible setting.  Kaiji is one of the all time great animes because Kaiji was dealing with the Mafia and real life or death stakes.  Kakegurui couldn\'t realistically achieve those stakes in a school with a bunch of children.  So, it had them gambling with ridiculous sums of money that parents would never even make available to their children no matter how rich they were. No parent is going to let their kid gamble with billions of yen.  When they tried to up the ante to ""Betting your life"" it was the ridiculous notion that the Student Council could direct your entire life from start to finish at their whim.  It was just silly.  As silly as the idea that the financial and political leaders of Japan would let their children sit around school gambling all day with their money, and not ever actually attend a single class to learn anything.The second major flaw with this anime was the characters.  Jabami was the only likeable one.  Every single character was completely warped and sociopathic (including Jabami) with the exception of Suzui, who was so weak as a character, you might as well classify him as Jabami\'s personal eunuch.   It was very difficult to get behind the cast, because all of them were pretty much disreputable psychos, none of which were actually good gamblers.  And even though Jubami was a likeable character and interesting, she had no depth to her.  She was pretty much just a very perceptive girl with a crippling gambling addiction.  They spent literally no more than 7-8 lines of dialog explaining anything about her past before arriving to the school.  That\'s not an exaggeration.And the worst part of it all, is that the ending was completely inconclusive, but I won\'t say more than that so as not to spoil it for those who decide to waste their time with this, anyway.The only thing I can really walk away from saying positive about this anime is that the art and soundtrack was outstanding.  The facial expressions on the characters were great, especially when they felt they had someone cornered.  The intro and outro for the episodes were also fantastic.  The soundtrack was very good.  But, good animation and a soundtrack can\'t save a poorly constructed anime.  At the end of the day this was nothing more than a B-rated ""Shokugeki No Kaiji"".If you haven\'t seen Kaiji, I would highly recommend you skip this anime and go watch that instead.  It is truly one of the best anime ever made, and this one is wholly forgettable.  I will probably not even remember anything about it by this time next year.Story: 3Art: 10Sound: 10Character: 4Enjoyment: 5Overall: 4 with the anime is that it wanted to be so much like Kaiji, but placed the story in a school, which is the worst possible setting.

The animation style is quite interesting, switching from a smooth, elegant style similar to dolls, to something much more detailed, hyper-realistic, and grotesque for the sake of disturbing the viewers. It reminds me a bit of Attack on Titan, in that way.Yumeko is a very, very strange character and I adored her for it. The way she understands gambling, the way she plays with others, all of it is really interesting and well done. Furthermore, the supporting characters and world-building, as minimal as it was, was also very well-done.I will admit I was surprised...at how... sexually charged a lot of it was, but I did enjoy it!And, you know, that opening song is really, really catchy. at how... sexually charged a lot of it was, but I did enjoy it!And, you know, that opening song is really, really catchy.', 'Kakegurui is a show that definitely follows a ""style over substance"" rule when it comes to storytelling. The show has some interesting themes and ideas that are largely overshadowed by some excellent visuals and intense battle scenes.The show is set in a school for rich students, all the sons and daughters of society\'s elite. The performance of these students is not based on their academic ability, but their ability to gamble - demonstrating their skills in manipulation and risk-taking, the qualities necessary to succeed in the upper echelons of society. Money is power in the world of Kakegurui, the high-rollers sit at the top of...school\'s food chain while frequent losers are treated like third-class citizens. Money isn\'t the only thing that can be put on the line though as Jabami Yumeko, our protagonist, will demonstrate.Yumeko is a compulsive gambler, the fact that she comes from a wealthy family and has a seemingly endless amount of money at her disposal is largely irrelevant. Yumeko gambles solely for the thrill of it, often willingly putting herself into contests that she knows will be rigged against her. Our protagonist doesn\'t care as long as she gets the adrenaline rush that only comes from putting everything on the line.Sadly, the interesting plot setting is underutilised in Kakegurui. The class system that exists at the school and the politicking of the student council is rarely at the forefront of the show. Instead, we focus on Yumeko going from one gaming showdown to the next in order to get her next fix. Yumeko\'s hapless sidekick, Suzui Ryouta, would possibly make for a more interesting protagonist as a student who\'s barely staying afloat in a shark tank of a school.That being said, Yumeko is still a fairly interesting character. Her opponents quickly realise that conventional logic goes out of the window when gambling against her, making her a dangerous foe. The contests always feel like they have real stakes and the viewer is often left in the dark as to Yumeko\'s plans and intentions. Is she bluffing? Is she intentionally trying to lose games? Is she just throwing caution to the wind? You\'re never completely sure until the chips are down and people are forced to show their hands. It makes for intense and dramatic viewing, even without the intrigue beyond the various card games.Where Kakegurui really shines is in the art and animation of the show, which is simply gorgeous. A great deal of focus is put into the faces of characters, who more often than not have psychotic grins on their faces. Characters are often drawn with large mouths, giving them the look of a predatory animal as they try to maneuver their way to victory. The art really does a fantastic job of conveying the emotion of the characters, from the ecstasy of victory to the agony of defeat.This is backed by some excellent sound, with Hayami Saori delivering an excellent voice acting performance as the enthusiastic and sensual Yumeko. The opening theme music captures the mood of the show perfectly, with erratic and upbeat jazz conveying the unpredictable world of gambling. There are lots of little flourishes with the sound design that also enhance the experience, such as the uncomfortable sound of grinding teeth to add more tension a high-stakes wager.Kakegurui\'s wider cast of characters are an entertaining bunch of oddballs. Suzui Ryouta and Saotome Meari make good foils for Yumeko, but the antagonists of Kakegurui are definitely the more interesting characters. The standout is the masochistic Ikishima Midari, who is definitely the character who has the most in common with Yumeko. Then there\'s the cunning council president, Momobami Kirari, who exudes an aura of menace and authority whenever she\'s on screen.There are many more antagonists, each with their own unique design and characteristics. None of the characters in Kakegurui are especially deep, but they are still entertaining.On the whole, I enjoyed Kakegurui despite its flaws. The show is carried by some brilliant animation, great sound design and a fun cast of characters. The story felt a bit rushed and the ending leaves plenty of doors open for a second season, so I\'m hoping that these will be addressed if and when a follow-up is released. school\'s food chain while frequent losers are treated like third-class citizens.

But I did feel the ending was a bit frustrating and would've preferred to have a more fleshed out conclusion. I think they could've wrapped up the story within a season, with a couple more episodes. Personally, I don't see the point of a second season, but that's Netflix for you. I do think they could've explored more dimensions to each of the characters outside of gambling rather than quick summaries with flashbacks. But, overall I must say that anime did a great job of having a slick and...intoxicating aesthetic that matches the gambling theme. intoxicating aesthetic that matches the gambling theme."", ""I thought I would right this review well it is still fresh in my mind I am writing this before hand since all of mal features are not up yet so I cant post the review right now but lets begin the review when I was reading the reviews for this anime I mostly saw 2 camps of people people ether loved it 8-10 or people that hated it 1-4 I found myself enjoying this anime giving it a 6/10 but this anime can be sum up into the word Ok it wasn't bad but it wasn't good I think you will enjoy this anime...if you have your expectations in order if your expecting something great your going to be very disappointed in this anime but if you expect something average or something a little above average and just casual watching it I think you will enjoy this anime. the story sounds interesting but its not really great the story follows this school that is known for gambling the rich and elite of society goes to this school one of the things I enjoy in this anime is the characters there not great but a little above average then why is the characters one of my favorite things about this anime they are all extremely crazy and I like that. next is the predictable of this anime and for me this anime was so predicable I already guessed what was going to happen at the end of the anime from the first episode and I got it right. and I really wouldn't consider this a gambling anime I know there is gambling in it but this anime is more of taking down the student council and bumping down a few pegs so to speak so if your looking for a gambling anime do not watch this you will be disappointed  the main characters seemed to be in no danger when gambling when I was watching that being said it was still enjoyable to see the main characters bump them down a peg or 2 the art and sound were good so overall I think you will enjoy this anime as long as your expecting something a little above average and not great I think you will enjoy it. if you have your expectations in order if your expecting something great your going to be very disappointed in this anime but if you expect something average or something a little above average and just casual watching it I think you will enjoy this anime. the story sounds interesting but its not really great the story follows this school that is known for gambling the rich and elite of society goes to this school one of the things I enjoy in this anime is the characters there not great but a little above average then why is the characters one of my favorite things about this anime they are all extremely crazy and I like that. next is the predictable of this anime and for me this anime was so predicable I already guessed what was going to happen at the end of the anime from the first episode and I got it right. and I really wouldn't consider this a gambling anime I know there is gambling in it but this anime is more of taking down the student council and bumping down a few pegs so to speak so if your looking for a gambling anime do not watch this you will be disappointed  the main characters seemed to be in no danger when gambling when I was watching that being said it was still enjoyable to see the main characters bump them down a peg or 2 the art and sound were good so overall I think you will enjoy this anime as long as your expecting something a little above average and not great I think you will enjoy it."", 'Very interesting anime. (Minor spoilers)Obviously, the first episode completely shocked me by the vast difference of disgusting features on a once average anime girl\'s face. Each episode left me astounded by the unique variety of hand motions, animations, and different expressions the girls would make.I\'m sure the artists were trying to make a statement; as to say that gambling, or any form of addiction, can lead to insanity. The person would perhaps hide it behind a kind and warm smile, until you lose the match and their once soft expression changes to an evil grin.However, after the first two episodes, it became obvious to me...that Yumeko was the main character, yes.. but she would also never lose. If she lost, then the TV show wouldn\'t have put 12 episodes.Another thing I didn\'t quite understand was how the police didn\'t find out about this. I mean, the amount of money they put in to one game could range from 30,000 yen to at least 300 million yen. Perhaps even more, depending on how much a player bet.The story/plot was very unique. I have actually never watched a gambling anime, and probably will never see one like this. Kakegurui sets the mood for the symptoms of addiction and what it can mentally do to your mind. The fact that someone can OWN another just by winning a gambling match is incredible, yet horrible.Story: 7/10The art was amazing and so interesting. I like to have a bit of spook in anime, especially when you least expect it. And where would you least expect it? In a high school-themed anime.Art: 10/10The sound was good as well. The English dub and Japanese dub had much of a difference, and there were lots of languages to choose as dub. The music was okay in my opinion. There weren\'t exactly songs building up for things, since there would always be some kind of sound in the background. I did love parts where the orchestra would go crazy when Yumeko was about to say something insane.Sound: 8/10The characters were not very interesting besides Yumeko. Nothing was exactly special about Ryouta. He was basically supposed to be the nervous guy who thought Yumeko was crazy half of the time. It was kinda cool to see him actually do something in the end (I\'m not saying what cause spoilers). Midari was pretty interesting to me. She wasn\'t like anyone else in Kakegurui; she showed signs of suicidal thoughts and rambled on about things. Pretty much everyone else in Kakegurui didn\'t show any sign of growth or maturity, and most of them just seemed like the same person, striving for that same goal of power. There wasn\'t any kind of actions that one of the characters would do and I would think, ""Oh yeah, that\'s so them to do somethin\' like that."" There weren\'t enough episodes even for character growth and development, and so far, the only intriguing characters I can think of are Yumeko and Midari.Character: 3/10My enjoyment of this anime was great. My heart would quicken whenever Yumeko was stuck in a tight spot during a match, and I would actually be relieved that she won, even if I kind of expected the outcome. The different matches would leave me intensely focused on the details of how a game worked so that I would know what\'s going on for the next five minutes.Enjoyment: 8/10Overall, I would recommend Kakegurui to people who like thrillers/horrors. Even though there is not that much gore, the language and disturbing scenes could really scare certain people. Though, I\'m sure a person above 15 would be completely fine and love the TV show, depending on their taste in television. that Yumeko was the main character, yes.. but she would also never lose.

Gambling has been something not so common as a main topic in an anime, which might have made it confusing or a bad storytelling for some.The story. As an adaptation of various luck-games, i feel like the anime did a pretty good job when representing them in a clever and fun way. But for most people outside Japan who never heard of a big part of the gambling styles, the extreme representation made it a lot more confusing.Outside the theme, there isn’t much of a story or a background to anything. The gambling academy is there with...the rich and freaky children and that’s it. No why or how. Regardless, if you watch the anime with only the experiences of the characters in your head you’ll be able to enjoy it. Don’t look too deep for a story or a big plot, not even romance. “It’s all about gambling”, remember.Art. For sure an outstanding one!

Regardless the lack of a story i enjoyed the overly acted scenes and all the strategies in general.', 'I really enjoyed watching the first season. The music was catchy and something I could hum along to, I never skipped it! The artwork was SO gorgeous, especially in the moments where Jabami was having one of her ""episodes"". Whenever she gets excited the imagery has this soft demonic look that has a wonderful animated style, but is glossy and realistic.Not to be disrespectful towards other anime, but I really don\'t like it when a simple concept is taken and they start adding powers and unnecessary elements. Not every anime needs that. So I\'m glad...that when it came to the tournaments and matches they really did just play the game. Yes, it had many moments of high-intensity with grotesque faces of fear and thrill, but the characters were just using their skill to play these interesting games. You can either be in pure ecstasy (Ikishima) or you can be cool as a cucumber. (Kirai)An unrelated factor that might go overlooked is Suzui\'s treatment between him and the other girls. Typically, when the cast is female oriented they make the only man look like a numb skull that doesn\'t add any value or merit to the team. He\'s reduced to ""emotional support"" and that emasculates him. I\'m happy to say that they don\'t do that in this anime. He\'s not a doofus or worthless, he just can\'t gamble as well as his female counterparts. That only makes sense because the majority of the characters are female and are really great at what they do. They don\'t discriminate as to who is greater or less than. We can see this in episode 1 when Mary, who was so amazing she was carrying other people\'s debt, was demoted to Mittens because of her match with Jabami. Suzui was only seen as a bad player initially because he was introduced as a Fido. Since then, he HAS been an emotional supportive character, but he\'s also shown to have forward thinking skills that make him an endearing friend and ally to Jabami.I really did love this season, I\'m glad that I gave it a try! that when it came to the tournaments and matches they really did just play the game.

The problem it has right now is an unfinished story and that of course leads to confused viewers. I haven\'t read the manga adaptation myself but it was clear to me that the ""ending"" was only an opening to the next entry. I enjoyed this anime because it had a vibe I could grip onto. The jazzy intro, the crazy facial expressions, I\'m all in! Now my biggest compliant would have to be the uhm, protagonist of the story? I say that very loosely because well, he was blank and felt almost unnecessary? I understand that some stories...require the one dimensional character so that the viewer can put themselves into perspective, but really was he needed? The story almost felt like it had to pull itself back whenever Ryouta was around. Other than that I enjoyed Yumeko and how mysteriously lucky she was. I liked the variety of competitors and the reasons behind their gambles too. Definitely an interesting anime, but needs more background. require the one dimensional character so that the viewer can put themselves into perspective, but really was he needed?

Usually in anime emotions and feelings are transmitted through the expression of the eyes, but in Kakegurui they are transmitted through the expression and facial expressions, which at first can be a little scary.Story: The story at first may seem a bit mundane, a high school where students play gambling, some taken to the extreme. At first it seems trivial but along the way it becomes more and more interesting. The story contains many psychological struggles.Characters: Characters are well built with...well-defined purposes, even if they seem to be skipped.The soundtrack is very well chosen, making us think of Las Vegas casinos. Opening takes us more to casinos, but also to cabaret music. well-defined purposes, even if they seem to be skipped.The soundtrack is very well chosen, making us think of Las Vegas casinos.

I really liked the character designs of all the characters bar yumeko\'s unessacarily large breasts which I just felt were gigantic for no apparent reason. While some of the devices used to showcase the malignity of gambling may seem like too much such as the facial expressions of the characters or the literal sexual ecstasy gambling makes them feel I believe it just really clearly shows us the madness of the world and the extent to which gambling has grabbed hold of their lives.I...rated low on story as for awhile I felt I was just watching Yumeko enjoy herself gambling (because I was). Yumeko is a rather ok main character , in gambles it\'s her opponents who make the scenes interesting to watch, she has no drive to become the best or climb the social hierarchy she just enjoys the madness of risking it all. That\'s all there is to her, she\'s for lack of better terms just a crazy bitch. She never really faces any major character development. Her opponents on the other hand have interesting backstories explaining the way they are and their motivations for gambling. Even her friends grow throughout the series but Yumeko simply does not change one bit and the anime makes a point of it.  Another one of my smaller complaints is there is undeniable ""edgy"" feel to Kakegurui which at times stopped me from taking it seriously.Overall I still enjoyed watching kakegurui especially listening to the opening/closing tracks. rated low on story as for awhile I felt I was just watching Yumeko enjoy herself gambling (because I was).

They are separate in there own ways, but they are watchable. The live action version sets up...for a better sequel that'll most likely take a lot of time to develop, but if they go towards the direction that I think they should go, it's gonna be way better then the first one.As for the Anime TV version, the second season is the question of it being good or not.

However this anime falls flat as a gambling anime. You never get the feeling that the main characters are ever in any real danger or that she even cares if she loses. It kind of gives you that boring repetative yu-gi-oh feeling where you can predict the outcome of every duel based on the protagonist's lack of fear. She did lose once, but that's only because the antagonist student council president cheated and even then, that one loss doesn't really mean much or add any...fear to the show. I mean, what does she lose? She has to marry a rich guy and live happily ever after with her friends and family? Again, there's no real loss or fear regarding the gambles in this show.It's almost like they had a premise of a bunch of neurotic and crazy girls in a slice of life anime and decided to add the gambling for suspense or something.

Food wars, Assassination classroom, Classroom of the elite, Mikagura School Suite. The high school genre in general has a long history in anime so it\'s hard for a new one to stand out, but Kakeguri more than manages.First the concept, it\'s a torture school. The kids run the place there\'s no other way it\'s going to work and the anime works with it, taking it in believable directions and and doing a nice job of exploring the consequences.The characters are extreme delightful and funny and with just the right touch of the real. You have excitement junkies, sadists, the compulsive losers, the manipulators, they are all there and they are both real and hilarious.The art is a step or two above most anime. The faces and bodies have real features and details while still retaining the anime style. Backgrounds look great, and the characters are well composted into them .The music is a jazzy mix, that goes well with noirish feel of the setting. It\'s definitely something you wouldn\'t mind having soundtrack mix of.Overall this is a solid 10. examples include. Food wars, Assassination classroom, Classroom of the elite, Mikagura School Suite.

It might just not be my thing but at times it was hard to push myself to keep on watching.For better or worse, the story isn't like any other anime I've watched. If you're like me and aren't used to gambling rules you get confused from time to time.The art is......unique. The way it switches from manga to realistic style is kinda disturbing though. You eventually get used to it but stillThe voices were something. The main character often moaned and started not looking so SFW.

""Villain of the week"" episodic plot with some fun thrown into it.I was honestly rather impressed with Kakegurui. I remember attempting to watch this a year or so ago and just giving up after the second episode. This time, I watched the whole thing through and found myself overall enjoying it!It is very challenging to make gambling and basic brain games look fast-paced and energetic, but somehow, Kakegurui manages to accomplish it! I found myself braced against the screen enthralled, waiting to see the results of each and every challenge. Perhaps...I\'m a bit of a compulsive gambler myself. The animation style of Kakegurui really lends itself here, in addition to the fantastically jazzy soundtrack. Overall, these elements of the show are incredibly satisfying and almost worth it on their own.My primary gripes come with the framing of the characters; each episode is essentially a ""villain of the week"" plot, where Jabami and gang must discover with member of the student council they\'ll face...with some other fun foes thrown in there. While the interactions are exciting, they lack some depth due to the time restrictions of the episodic format. This was disappointing, but I really enjoyed Suzui\'s and Mary\'s character development the most. They felt the most reasonably paced out of any other character.Also not a plus for the show: predatory/villain lesbian trope (like, a bunch of this). I\'m kind of tired of only seeing the villains as queer-coded. In Kakegurui, it really suffers from this. However, Jabami and Mary seem to also potentially be queer-coded, which I find interesting. I can\'t tell if it was simply meant to be fanservice for the simping male crowd or actually a testament to Jabami\'s sheer dedication to the pleasures of gambling. In the end, this made for an interesting twist on the villain lesbian trope; perhaps in the second season, we can see more development.I enjoyed seeing characters that weren\'t blatantly ""good"" or ""evil."" I hope that Kakegurui Season 2 lends itself to more development of the characters we\'ve grown to love, and perhaps we see more of Jabami\'s backstory. I\'m a bit of a compulsive gambler myself.

I saw it on Netflix and the art is what caught my eye at first. I thought it was really pretty, and that stayed true. Although one of the most off putting things in the anime to me, is the weird moments where the art goes from very anime and pleasing to a scary close up realistic. Which to me was not very pleasant but I could excuse it overall. The story line seems sort of lost, while it is a really interesting concept with the whole gambling...thing, it felt kind of plot-less.

The art/animation and sound were both absolutely incredible and added to the show immensely. If it weren't for those two things, the show could've received a lower rating for sure. The art/animation and sound is what kept me drawn to the show, as it was so dark and disturbing in just the right way and with just the right amount.Both the disturbing and pleasured expressions shown through the art was absolutely perfect for this type of show. They wanted the audience see exactly what the characters felt while gambling in an intense and dramatic way. This...show aimed to show you just why some people gamble: For the risk, fear, pleasure.For the story itself, I had to give that a bit of a lower score because of my feelings about the finale. For a show that is meant to have this sort of repitition throughout the episodes, I think they did a good job handling that. The episodes all contained a sort of gambling with a new character, but it never felt entirely repetitive. As the show progressed, character development occurred and that's always my main focus in a show. Bad characters = bad story. You cannot have a good story with poor characters.That leads me to my next factor: The characters. I thought the characters were surprisingly well rounded for a show with such a variety of characters. I honestly did not expect that after watching the first two or three episodes. HOWEVER, I had to give this a lower score because one of the MAIN characters--Ryouta--was not well rounded at all. He had barely any personality and barely any character development throughout the show. You had pretty much no reason to like or care about him whatsoever. He was boring.Therefore, overall I think this anime is worth the watch if you're up for something a bit dark and unsettling. Do not watch this anime if you want something cute and innocent. I can't say this was incredible because there were some aspects of the show that could've been improved to make me more addicted to the show.

A school where everything including your future is constantly gambled upon with no adult authority figures and a student council that is absolute in power? Gimme a break. For people to accept such an unrealistic setting, you will have to be entertaining and well-written, otherwise your house of cards will come crumbling down. Or you can, like, just play up the ecchi and hope nobody notices. The games used in this show are pretty creative to be...honest, but I had a really hard time following the rules. If you come up with a completely new game and want your characters to exploit it to their benefit, you need to give your audience more time. If I barely understand what they are doing, how am I supposed to realize that they are doing something extraordinary? On the occasions I did indeed understand what was going on, the games were very entertaining and the thought process of the participants was well done. But then it was already over, puff. That was quite unsatisfying for me, I would have loved to see more of the matches I liked. Kakegurui also has a problem with its structure. You can’t have the final battle be not even half as long as most matches against her lackeys, no matter what kind of game you picked for that duel. The ending is anime exclusive from what I know, but they managed to leave it half-open, so that a return is possible should a second season be decided upon. I feel like a broken record, because I keep repeating this a lot recently, but this show could have been better with a better pacing.6/10Art:Kakegurui is all about the faces, let’s be honest, that is what people will remember about this show. And they are fantastic indeed. The contrast between the actually pretty sexy and gorgeous ladies and the horror that is what I call “serious close-up” is hilarious and works wonders. I’m very sure that a remarkable number of viewers discovered a whole new kind of arousal. They were somewhat creative with the character design, as much as the limitation to the school uniform allows for this. Everybody had a memorable look, except maybe our male lead, but we get to that boy later. So yeah, in terms of animation and style, Kakegurui is quite impressive. There is one scene where we see two girls singing and dancing that was rotoscope if I’m not mistaken. That is something I do not enjoy, but I understand that it’s a matter of taste and not quality, so for the sake of this section, I will not take this into account.9/10Sound:I love openings with a big band feeling, I loved it when Cowboy Bebop and Baccano did it and I enjoy Kakegurui’s opening as well. I also acknowledge the creativity put into the ending song, even though it’s not so much to my liking. In terms of anime openings and endings, I’m a huge advocate for trying different styles of music, it doesn’t always have to be J-Pop. So, as you can guess, the idol part in this show did nothing for me, that was easily my least favorite arc. The voice acting was superb, all the characters had…er, well, character. I have the impression, that female seiyuus really enjoy voicing loud, angry or deep-voiced characters, must be great to not do a squeaky high-pitch for once. Saori Hayami has made her way onto my watchlist, I still can’t believe that all the roles she’s been doing are the same person.8/10Characters:The girls, Yumeko most of all, are very entertaining to watch in their silliness. They are either addictive gamblers or megalomaniacs or some variation between these. Yumeko reminded me a lot of the early chapters of Yu-Gi-Oh, when the pharaoh was still a murderous lunatic. But instead of killing her opponents, she just has multiple orgasms while gambling. I’m not complaining. Her predator-like sexual aggression while gambling is in stark contrast to how she behaves outside of these games, where she seems to be a nice, cheerful girl. Most of the others are not AS twisted as her, but they are definitely a couple of two-faced bitches. The only one who has lost even more marbles than Yumeko was Midari. I was shocked to find out that there is a real life fetish like hers, called autoassassinophilia. In total, these girls are fucked up, but they are hilarious and interesting and that is worth a lot.Which brings me to…wait a sec, I have to look up the name…Ryouta, that’s what it was. The poster child for every forgettable, bland, beta cuck male main character you know. I have no idea what his point in this anime was, except maybe as sex slave for Yumeko after getting all hot and bothered by her latest gamble. At least that’s what I think happened when the camera was off. That guy is so meaningless that you cannot help but come up with an outrageous theory like thisyourself. He served absolutely no purpose. I think they tried to make him important in the final episode by giving in to the gamble fetish, but it did not work for me at all.7/10Enjoyment:Kakegurui was certainly a fun watch, but I don’t think it has much of a rewatch factor. This is one of those anime that you can easily pick up if you don’t really know what you wanna see and just want something easily digestible and mildly entertaining. It was able to smooth over its weaker parts with its other qualities, so it never went into a territory that required me to shake my head. If you want to watch a gambling anime, I don’t think this is exactly what you are looking for. There are some mind games, yes, but they aren’t the focus and the matches are way too short anyway. I’d say Kakegurui didn’t really do anything wrong, but it didn’t provide much either.6/10Overall:7.2/10 honest, but I had a really hard time following the rules.

They are either addictive gamblers or megalomaniacs or some variation between these. Yumeko reminded me a lot of the early chapters of Yu-Gi-Oh, when the pharaoh was still a murderous lunatic. But instead of killing her opponents, she just has multiple orgasms while gambling. I’m not complaining. Her predator-like sexual aggression while gambling is in stark contrast to how she behaves outside of these games, where she seems to be a nice, cheerful girl. Most of the others are not AS twisted as her, but they are definitely a couple of two-faced bitches. The only one who has lost even more marbles than Yumeko was Midari. I was shocked to find out that there is a real life fetish like hers, called autoassassinophilia. In total, these girls are fucked up, but they are hilarious and interesting and that is worth a lot.Which brings me to…wait a sec, I have to look up the name…Ryouta, that’s what it was. The poster child for every forgettable, bland, beta cuck male main character you know. I have no idea what his point in this anime was, except maybe as sex slave for Yumeko after getting all hot and bothered by her latest gamble. At least that’s what I think happened when the camera was off. That guy is so meaningless that you cannot help but come up with an outrageous theory like thisyourself. He served absolutely no purpose. I think they tried to make him important in the final episode by giving in to the gamble fetish, but it did not work for me at all.7/10Enjoyment:Kakegurui was certainly a fun watch, but I don’t think it has much of a rewatch factor. This is one of those anime that you can easily pick up if you don’t really know what you wanna see and just want something easily digestible and mildly entertaining. It was able to smooth over its weaker parts with its other qualities, so it never went into a territory that required me to shake my head. If you want to watch a gambling anime, I don’t think this is exactly what you are looking for. There are some mind games, yes, but they aren’t the focus and the matches are way too short anyway. I’d say Kakegurui didn’t really do anything wrong, but it didn’t provide much either.6/10Overall:7.2/10', 'I honestly went into this anime expecting to hate it. I began watching it whilst doing work, but I soon found myself inexplicably drawn in- the characters are fairly two dimensional, Suzui who exists to narrate the show and be Jabami\'s foil is forgettable- and most of the cast are pretty, for lack of better word, meh. The sound design was alright, the music was alright, the art was alright; but somehow it came together to create something very fun!I was initially put off by the amount of close up shots to crazed expressions shown within the first 5 minutes of the show, and saw...it as a bit of a not-very-well-done homage to Death Note. The first episode is a lot, but the further I went in the less I thought ""this is dumb"" and just enjoyed myself. It really did seem like Kill La Kill, but done in a less horrifically sexist fashion.There\'s a huge cast of girls, but they really don\'t serve as a harem or romantic interest for the males in the show! Everyone\'s shown on pretty equal footing, and Suzui\'s ends up serving as a self insert for those watching- but not in a way that it disrupts the show. He could not exist and the story and character arcs would be exactly the same. Of course there\'s a bunch of female characters in sexy poses and so on, but it\'s shown less as ""isn\'t this hot?"" and more, ""these people are nuts, right?"".Anyway, it\'s a good anime to watch to pass the time, but it\'s not particularly deep or enigmatic. It\'s a fun show that know\'s what it is, and y\'know what? That\'s really what we need sometimes. it as a bit of a not-very-well-done homage to Death Note.

While some may find this hilarious, some may be disgusted by this and be turned away.Nevertheless, the overarching plot is pretty intriguing. In Hyakkaou Private Academy, the only rule is gambling. The most successful ones will climb to the top of the school, ruling...over those that are less successful than them. Lose too much, you will incur a debt too huge, and you have no choice but to pay with your life, similar to a lifestock, a cattle, where you lose all freedom and choice of your life, letting others dictate every second and moment of your life until your time has come. As far-fetched as it may seem, it actually drew some parallel lines with the real world, as this is exactly how the world works. Power and success will always rule over those less successful than them.Despite the fact that high stakes are involved most of the time, the games featured in the show are mostly fictional and self-made by the author himself, which are, sadly, mostly unfair. While the creativity has to be applauded in some way or another, it is rather apparent that the games are made so that drama comes first, rules come second.Another problem with the plot, while having an interesting premise, its full potential was never unleashed. We mostly follow our heroine, Yumeko  Jabami in her monster-of-the-week format, taking down enemies one by one, just to make her way to challenge the student council president.The up side, however, is that Yumeko is a pretty decent main character. For most part, we are not shown of her thoughts. Throughout the show, she remains pretty enigmatic, that it is pretty hard to guess what\'s she actually scheming or thinking. Sometimes she may be seen to be acting recklessly and brashly, sometimes she may seem to be superbly intelligent. At times she may be assisting the weak, but there are times she would be seen as abusing the weak to her advantage as well. While watching the show, trying to guess her intentions alone makes it quite an thrilling ride.The only character as mysterious as Yumeko would probably the student council president, and her twin which has yet to deliver a line throughout the show. Yumeko and president mostly share the same addiction of risk taking and gambling, but anything beyond that, remains unclear despite finishing the show. Well, we are not quite done with the plot yet.The other characters, although heavily featured, does not strike to be as interesting as the aforementioned duo. While we are given sufficient background info on them, enough to know who they are. Ultimately they are only there to serve as stepping stones for Yumeko to reach her goal.Art-wise, it\'s nothing special, except for the exaggerated facial expressions. There\'s not much action going on so don\'t expect anything too flashy. The idol performance segment which is purely hand-drawn might be one of the highlights.The OP and ED, however, are a different matter. I am going to be honest with the fact that it\'s the OP that led me to watch this. The song is catchy, but the animation involved is sublime, the colors are vivid and you don\'t get to see any of those cliched OP segments, instead you will see many little subtle hints telling us how all 12 episodes are going to play like, hence it is very difficult to skip it. The ED, while less animation is involved (mostly we only see Yumeko walking forward), it tells us about her eccentric behavior - while seemingly innocent and naive at the outside, she also has a maniacal side inside her. The ED put these two contrasts pretty well in the two halves of the song.Sound-wise, you will be treated with probably some of the best seiyuu performances in the anime industry. Saori Hayami and Miyuki Sawashiro, who voiced Yumeko and Kirari the student council president respectively, are as if having the time of their lives, going all out and have a myriad of tones and expressions in their voices, and they delivered it to absolute perfection. If anything, Kakegurui at least deserves some seiyuu performance award. The soundtrack is pretty fitting as well, doing well to lift up the tension and suspense of every gamble.The enjoyment of this show will vary from person to person. The show have some cringy moments (orgasmic moans, anyone?) which will easily turn one away. But if the huge-risk-at-stake thing is your thing, where your heartbeat accelerates, your breath intensifies, your body trembles at the sight of a high stake gamble, then Kakegurui will be the show for you.+ Interesting premise, drawing parallels with the real life+ Can get pretty intense (it\'s gambling, duh!)+ Interesting female lead, try guessing her intentions!+ Superb vocal performance- Has some cringy moments (orgasmic moans)- Exaggerated facial expressions may turn people away- Wasted plot potential, and cliffhanger ending. over those that are less successful than them.

I will talk about the second season separately and then maybe make a combine review but probably not because it sounds pointless.To sum up the review in case you don't want to read all of it just to get to the point, I feel that while Kakegurui has flaws with the plot and some moments, the pros such as the music, animation, characters, acting and many others just overshadow the flaws and makes it very enjoyable for newbies, veterans or just looking for an anime to binge watch.Also before going into the details, there...will be some bias in this because this is the first ever anime I watched (unless you include pokemon and all that) but hopefully my points will justify it. Now with all of that done, lets go into the good and bad of Kakegurui and why it's my favourite anime.STORY/PLOT- The story for Kakegurui is ok but has flaws and could be way better. The story is basically the main character, Yumeko Jabami, attends a school where she gambles with other characters in order gamble with the school president. While the story is good for the character and gambling part of Kakegurui which I'll explain later, the main issue with the plot personally is how it forces the story into a linear path and they cannot break out of it. An example of this is how there is always gambling going on an nothing else. The closes we see is when either the student council or Yumeko, Mary, Ryota and/or other characters are just talking buts that's only for half an episode before it cuts to gambling. I would really like to see an episode or 2 where the characters are just talking and there's no gambling going on. While that would kinda ignore the whole gamble part of a gambling anime, it could help with the world building and characters. The story does have pros, like the way the school operates with how gambling is the main priority if living in the school and how if you are the bottom 100, then you get treated worse. That helps show how life is different in the school and how it affects the characters which I will explain later.ART/ANIMATION- With the manga having a good art style and MAPPA being the studio behind Kakegurui, the animation is amazing. The character design, the colour, the movement, the background, all of it is amazing. Where Kakegurui shines with their animation is the detail on the eyes and face expression. The combination of these two help express how crazy the characters really are because of gambling and helps stand out from other anime. My only gripe with the animation is how they would repeat scenes, mainly during gambling when cards are getting hand out for example as it kind of puts you out of the experience as you seen the scene before but I do understand why and it still exist in season 2 so its more than a nit pick then an actual flaw with the animation.SOUND/MUSIC- The sound in Kakegurui is pretty good. Most of the time the sound matches with the scene whether that be background noises like a crowd of people talking or the main focus of the scene such as steps or chips being placed down and I can't say when the oppoite occurs. The music is amazing and is has personally one of the best soundtrack in anime. Almost every music piece matches the scene whether its a calm scene where characters are talking or something more thrilling. The music works best with the gambling as it matches with the atmosphere where something is going on but it looks/sounds like something is about to happen but you don't know what until it does happen and it catches you off guard. The only issue with some of the music is that most are either just unforgettable or just weird (mainly the song where it's just a boing noise) but it doesn't ruin the soundtrackCHARACTER/ACTING- This is where Kakegurui shines. The characters as a whole are just outstanding. There a no bad characters (apart from Jun) but there are weak characters compared to others such as Ryota who is your mid anime protagonist. However, most other characters are just a wonder to watch such as Yumeko Jabami who is the other protagonist who goes crazy when she gambles, Kirari Momobami who is the school president, Mary Saotome who is a classmate of Yumeko and many others. They way each character acts with others both in and out of gambling is simply amazing, building on how gambling has become their life and how their personalities are built around it. This also plays into the acting. Now before I continue, I will be talking about the dub version but this still applies for sub as I have watched both and the point I will be getting across is still the same for both. Each character's voice actor matches them perfectly and helps us see how each character acts such as Mary being a confident women, Ryota being more cautious, Midari being insane and horney, Kira being both calm and cunning, and Yumeko being an normal girl until gambling enters her mind where she's a combination of Midari and Kirari. There are many more characters I could talk about but I think you get the point. The characters and their acting in Kakegurui are one of if not the best in animeOTHERS- This will just be others bits and pieces that don't fit with the other categories that I want to talk about. First is the gambling games represented. These are clever as there are either spins on existing games such as rock paper scissors but you only can only use a card with either rock, paper or scissors, or entirely new games such as the one with the 5 swords. Next is how characters explain how the game works and their strategy. I personally like this a lot as it reminds me of Sherlock Holmes with how he would explain how he solved the mystery instead it's either 'how can I win' or 'how you lost' relating it back to gambling. And finally, the intro and outro. While I could of talked about it in the music part, I wanted to talk about it as a whole. The intro is pretty good, the song is catchy and matches with the theme of Kakegurui and represents the characters pretty well. The outro is pretty good too. The songs is a jam and the sequence is pretty good. I wish it was less simple but if you've seen it you know why it's good.OVERALL- While some aspects could of been changed or improved like some songs and characters and some stuff relating to the story, everything else about Kakegurui is amazing from characters to music, animation to acting, it is fun enjoyment for new and old anime fans and is my favourite anime. 10/10 will be some bias in this because this is the first ever anime I watched (unless you include pokemon and all that) but hopefully my points will justify it.

Not sure what else is could be this batshit crazy.This anime isn't perfect, and god forbid, please do not watch it with anyone you wouldn't feel comfortable watching very mature rated shows with, because it gets a bit much at points.The absurdity of it is the best part. There were actual points where I either laughed, sighed, or scoffed out loud. It is over the top and excessive in the best way. It does not take itself seriously at all, and is just a fun ride for everyone involved.Not sure about rewatchability, but it is certainly enjoyable. "", ""[This review is written from the perspective of someone who identifies as Asexual. Please keep that in mind.][This review does NOT include any spoilers.]I went into this blind. I ignored the ratings and reviews to form my own opinion entirely. However, while I had high hopes for this anime with its interesting concept and characters, I dropped it after episode 4.Why? Because there are a lot of sexual innuendos and references. Being on the Asexual spectrum, watching every episode where at least 1 person borderline climaxes, gets very uncomfortable.Perhaps if the anime lacked those scenes, I would have been able to tolerate it more. Because...again, the concept and characters are incredibly interesting. It's my own problem that I cannot get past the near-climax scenes from someone getting too excited over their gambling game.I hope at the very least my review can be a precaution for another Asexual wanting to watch the show. It never hurts to do a little more research, which I always fail to do. again, the concept and characters are incredibly interesting.

Oh but don\'t forget to add psychopathy to 90% of its characters.Story (2/10):Nearly all of Kakegurui\'s entire runtime is devoted to gambling battles, so the story is barely sufficient setup. While it works for the first 2 times, it gets repetitive after that. Yumiko, the MC, doesn\'t have a motive to her gambling, she just does it for the fun of it. That\'s where I have a problem. See, the battles are done fairly well. Despite knowing before the game even starts that Yumiko will...somehow win, they were able to make the battles interesting by having all/most of the gambles they make on fake games, or otherwise ones that aren\'t usually bet on (ex: Memory). But when these battles have no end goal ahead, and you already know that Yumiko will, in fact, win due to poor writing, all of the battles lose their purpose.Art (8/10):The art here is nothing to write home about except for the OP. The OP was very well drawn/animated and even at ep 12, I was still captivated by it.Sound (10/10):As you would expect for a show with ""suspense"" and ""surprise twists"" and high stakes, characters often are surprised, triumphant, excited (read as: sexual excited), in despair, etc. This was (luckily) done very well. Not only that, but the OP was very catchy (in a good way) and I even added it to my playlist of anime music. Very well done in this department!Character (6/10):As I said earlier, most of the cast is comprised of psychopaths. This made the battles more interesting in some cases because Yumiko\'s opponents were hard to read, but in one or 2 cases it made it much easier. I won\'t say which to avoid spoilers. But even for the ones where it added mystery, you cant just make someone psychopath and call it good writing, especially with how often its done in Kakegurui.Enjoyment (8/10):Despite its many flaws, when I watched it, I was in need of a discount Food Wars and Kakegurui served that purpose. If that\'s what you want, try Kakegurui out. If not, well, its still a decent show, just don\'t expect the world from it. The OP was a shining star, and I highly suggest watching it on YouTube if you don\'t pick up the whole show. somehow win, they were able to make the battles interesting by having all/most of the gambles they make on fake games, or otherwise ones that aren\'t usually bet on (ex: Memory).

This is exactly what you get with Kakegurui.Why do teachers allow students to form an organized gambling ring in the school? How was a student council, which promotes a blatant system of oppression, even elected in the first place? Are parents really ok with allowing their children to bet millions of dollars on an after-school game of poker?And, perhaps the most important question of all, who cares?Sure, there are a lot of elephants...in the room, but these elephants are damn cool. With Kakegurui you're getting an original, thrilling anime, so who's to blame you if you simply close you're eyes and enjoy the ride. (Don't actually close your eyes. If you do, you won't be able to see your computer screen).The anime's strongest and weakest point has to be its characters. As one might expect from a school full of gamblers, every character is a psychopath on some level, and Kakegurui does a great job of juxtaposing these various personalities. What's more, (almost) none of the characters are expendable, with even the minor characters serving as foils which offer the viewer striking comparisons. The one exception to this would be Kakegurui's protagonist who, in keeping with the time-honored tradition of Japanese animated culture, is virtually nonexistent.

The other two-thirds of the time I either wished he would get lost and make room for the more interesting characters, or else forgot he existed entirely.Although we view the show and the self-destructive actions of its many insane characters through the eyes of a sane (and boring) protagonist, Kakegurui never feels like a public service announcement, courtesy of the Japanese, against the horrors of gambling. The show's characters tend to suffer in relation to their lack of internal stability and, generally speaking, each character's greed or arrogance eventually leads to their downfall.

It was incredibly entertaining to watch the characters weasel their way in and out of trouble by making the tables turn dramatically one way or the other, and the fact that the bets were often won by cheating only added to the fun.

All things considered, Kakegurui was a joy to watch as long as you're willing to put up with some occasional issues.   7/10. in the room, but these elephants are damn cool. With Kakegurui you're getting an original, thrilling anime, so who's to blame you if you simply close you're eyes and enjoy the ride. (Don't actually close your eyes. If you do, you won't be able to see your computer screen).The anime's strongest and weakest point has to be its characters. As one might expect from a school full of gamblers, every character is a psychopath on some level, and Kakegurui does a great job of juxtaposing these various personalities. What's more, (almost) none of the characters are expendable, with even the minor characters serving as foils which offer the viewer striking comparisons. The one exception to this would be Kakegurui's protagonist who, in keeping with the time-honored tradition of Japanese animated culture, is virtually nonexistent.

I'm not hating on the anime but towards the end of it, it left me to realize that it wasn't very focused on the School genre and would've done equally good without using School (genre)Story: 7The story is obviously unique to the Game genre but it wasn't very clear what Jabami was trying to do.

The first episode starts off with the Yumeko Jabami,...transferring into the school. We soon then come to realize that Yumeko is very addicted to gambling, and cannot resist a good gamble where everything is on the line.  It is an interesting plot because i do know there are a few gambling anime but this one was the first one i had watched so it definitely stood out for me.Enjoyment 8/10The first episodes really drew me in, but then it became very predictable, however i still found it interesting to watch to find out the outcome of each gamble and how it would play out.Character 8/10There were many characters but they all had their own personality and story line although they were all quite over the top.i think the characters and their background were well thought out however i personally cannot give it a 10 because of the perverted faces and sudden 'orgasms' the characters would have whilst gambling. which would sometimes make you think you were watching a hentai instead.Art 8/10The general art is nice, not hard too look at or anything but also nothing out of this world. Sometimes during the anime the art style would drastically change to become incredibly graphic at times and personally i found it a bit hideous when it did.Overall 8/10Based on all the points i covered i conclude this anime with an 8/10. once the anime ended i couldn't help but want more. luckily for you and me there is a 2nd season.see yall there perhaps? transferring into the school.

It's not the type of anime I suggest everyone needs to check out. I really think this is for a niche audience. But if you are someone who is excited by chance, then this is a must watch.The games they play throughout this anime are really creative and well thought out. There is never a moment that isn't tense, and the stakes always feel high. What's stopping Kakegurui from getting that perfect ten is that the...episodes become a little routine as they start to form a pattern. You always know roughly what the outcome has to be for the show to keep going. Regardless, the show still manages to keep you entertained and surprised so even though you often know who is going to win the gambles, you are still invested in how it plays out, and what impact it has on the characters.Like I said, I'm not a fan of Ecchi, however something about the added chance factor in this anime really makes it work for me. Maybe I've got like a gambling thing?

The backgrounds were really well drawn.As a fan of jazz, I really liked background music because the saxophone is epic. The Opening was... meh at best. I feel like it didn't have a steady rhythm. The visuals for the Opening were astounding. Very smooth.Kakegurui's story didn't feel like a gambling anime story. Sure it had gambling elements but it mainly focused on the Jojo style drama (Oh. My. Goood!) and while it tries to hype you up for the climax, the delivery was just solid and boring.But hey, that's...just my stupid opinion. just my stupid opinion."", 'my expectation wasn\'t that high and i think that what made me enjoy it even more.the most important point, the characters:MIDARI IKISHIMA ?! that psycho girl ?!?!! she\'s insane i mean what she did in episode 7 ahh god I CAN\'T SPOIL, my favorite character, her thoughts about pain is really interesting.Yumeko Jabami, she wasn\'t an interesting character until i realize she is poising everyone around her, but for the main character ehh not that good.Ryouta Suzui, i don\'t see him as the main character ( 5th time i say character ) but i think he will in the second season.Sayaka Igarashi...and Kirari Momobami, i just want to see them shining in the next season but i think Momobami\'s sister will steal the lightsthe story and the opening:it isn\'t a great intelligent story but good enough, the opening is a masterpiece *pews voice* the song is so good especially when she says ""HONEY"" ahha. i made it as long as i can please add it. and Kirari Momobami, i just want to see them shining in the next season but i think Momobami\'s sister will steal the lightsthe story and the opening:it isn\'t a great intelligent story but good enough, the opening is a masterpiece *pews voice* the song is so good especially when she says ""HONEY"" ahha. i made it as long as i can please add it.', ""Didn't enjoy this anime as much as I expected to.

Its just one of those weird animes ya know? i dont think I'll be able to get some images off of my mind for a long time now.As for the story, the writers seem to have tried to complex(ify?) a lot of scenarios but in the end it seemed...just, simple.but it definitely gets you hooked once you start, for some reason. i guess its the curiosity of how things end. just, simple.but it definitely gets you hooked once you start, for some reason. i guess its the curiosity of how things end."", 'The thrilling mystery sports-esque world of Kakegurui is utterly captivating. This shows basis is the raw adrenaline that occurs in the human body when getting the odds stacked up against them and having only ""luck"" to be your savior. To what extent does ""luck"" actually play in these sort of gambling games, this show questions that and fate itself while also delivering an absolutely thrilling argument for sadism.The plot of the show itself is fairly simple and standard in terms of sports anime, although gambling isn\'t a ""sport"" it definitely takes many elements from this genre. New girl comes to school and needs to...win her way to the top. Practically every episode ends up having a twist as it always seems that the MC will lose her gamble but most of the time, she knew something all along. The show doesn\'t completely abuse this trope because the MC will actually lose to some people so it\'s still relatively unpredictable. The art of this show is pretty great. There are some CG scenes of fast-paced cards moving or something similar that are great for building a sense of wonderment around gambling. Most of the girls have an utterly disgusting face they\'ll throw in which have much detail and are amazing. Nothing spectacular, everything is just pretty good.The OP is amazingly catchy with a jazzy feel. The general sound direction is just decent, nothing really stands out in my mind and everything just felt in place. The ED is was also just decent.The characters are pretty wild. It\'s an inane concept, a school based around gambling and using your parents millions of dollars to gain or lose social status within the school hierarchy, so all the characters have to be just as wild as this plot line. Then the true MC is your self-insert bland boy so while you get a taste of every other characters extremely distinct flavors, you get to settle yourself with the ever so grounded bland MC, which is actually pretty refreshing here. My overall enjoyment of the show is greatly enhanced by these extreme characters because it gets the viewer into a certain sense of disbelief that needs to be there for such an insane story. This isn\'t about superpowers or anything fantasy related, it\'s just gambling. How can you make gambling interesting? You make the people around it even MORE interesting.I give this show a +1 on a personal level because of how much I enjoyed the ride.

From the start it doesn't bore you with drawn on exposé and forces you right into the world of high stakes gambling. The games themselves were innovative and fun to learn with each episode. The titillating characters are colorful and have interesting back stories, which is impressive considering the length of the series and how longer more fleshed out anime often fail to do this. The art style is crisp and each character has their own look. The close-ups of facial features were my favorite parts of this series because it captures the absurdity of...certain situations.

This was a great watch and I would definitely recommend it."", 'Story 4: The story, as it is presented in the anime, is a pretty standard set up for the ""villain of the week"" formula, but sadly nothing more than that. The plot structure of Kakegurui seems similiar in nature to some battle anime, specifically Kill La Kill, but unlike Kill La Kill which used this structure as a means of highlighting certain narrative elements and in turn enhance the world building presented to us, Kakegurui uses this structure as a crutch, as to allow shallow world building, lackluster characters, and pacing that doesnt give you a moment to to stop and take in exactly what...is going on. The plot at best can be called uninspired, but at worst can easily be seen as a lazy and clearly thoughtless endeavor that the writers never took into concern. However, this structure does mean that moments that are egregiously poor ass quickly, and in turn keeps the attention of the viewer, which is the only real pro I can find.Art 6: On the other side however, we have the art, which is quite good. The girls while attractive feel much more adult like in appearance, which makes the scenes in which they....uhm....""get their gamble freak on"", for lack of a better team,  all the more believable and all the more extreme visually speaking. It is consistently pleasing to the eye...except when it tries to raise the tension. You know what I dont like when Im invested in a moment, shaky cam, you know what they use alot in here...shaky cam, and it doesnt work at all, and instead makes a scene that could be intense feel comedic. Then there is the strange phonemina in the later episodes where plaid patterns on clothes move independent of the  character, as if the artist put a green screen over the clothes and just didnt properly crop the it or something, its quite jarring.Sound 5: I hate to say it, but beyond the surprisingly excellent Op, which just over sells this anime to an incredible degree, the audio in this show is pretty poor. Sure the voice acting is solid, and the vocal range of the characters is excellent, but otherwise, there is nothing remarkable in this series\' audio. The music is drab, the idol part is audio cancer, and I swear they use the same voice actor like 6 times in this show for different characters, once you notice it it becomes hard to not be pulled out by it. Nothing really remarkable in terms of music, and plenty of nitpicks to choose from is how id best summarize my feelings about the sound design.Character 6: The characters when viewed in a void could have been some of the best psychos in anime, but...when viewed in a group or with some context are flat and shallow. Take midari for instance, a character that I quite liked at first, shown at first to be a reflection of Yumeko, instead of rather sweet, she\'s aggressive, instead of being more dominant, she is submissive, but she is seeking the thrill of the gamble, though not to feel alive, but to truly experience a satisfying death, in otherwords the perfect foil for our protagonist and a character that we could see more development for...but it turns out no...she\'s just a masochist, and that is all, no growth, no intrigue, no follow through. ANd this happens constantly,  the series gives us tons of interesting characters with great chances for growth, but continuously squandered these chances for shock value and the continuous expression of our protagonists superiority over everyone else, which really gets old. By the end of the 4th game its pretty clear that she\'s a mary sue, but with a kink.Enjoyment 6: Kakeguri is fun and entertaining when viewed as nothing more than a \'villain of the week\' action series with a focus on the schadenfreude element. Watching these horrible people get taken down is excellent fun, and gives an excellent sense of catharsis, but...well, it isnt much more than that. The moment you try to analyze this as something more, like analyzing it as a cautionary tale of the dangers of gambling, or as a tale of justice, or the difference between \'true gambling\' and a \'gambling house\', it all comes apart. This series is filled with idiosyncrasies that just kills any kind of deeper meaning it has. Regardless, it is still fun, in the same way watching a shitty asshole getting their dues is.Overall 5: if you enjoy watching terrible people getting whats coming to them, spliced with a surprising amount of sex appeal from teenagers that look...really adult like...to an almost worrying degree, than this is the perfect show for you. This show has tons of shock, awe, and catharsis.  This series is alright for a quick afternoon binge,with its flashy sets, swift pacing, and array of colorful, if flat, characters. The action may be well...uninteresting, the plot a bit dull, the stakes non-existent, and the plot predictable to a pretty tiring degree, but it is still something that IM sure you\'d enjoy if you have a strong need for catharsis. However, if you\'d like something with a bit more depth, or something with better direction, or better characters, action, plotting, animation, and if you just want to watch something that is better in every way you dont need to look far.

But still, Kaiji is a good example of a well-made gambling anime, so while I\'ll try to avoid making comparisons too often (largely for the sake of those who haven\'t actually seen Kaiji), some will undoubtedly appear.To start off, a basic overview of the plot: Kakegurui...takes place in an elite school wherein people\'s ability to gamble properly is what gives them their status, from the student council at the top, and house pets at the bottom, with the story taking place upon the transfer of Yumeko Jabami, who is addicted to gambling, and cannot resist a good gamble.Now, one thing I can commend the show for is it goes for a nice aesthetic. The lighting in particular helping to focus, and Yumeko\'s eyes going red, or characters being animated in grotesque amounts of detail when shocked/excited (the best parallel I can think of would be the ""I need it!"" scene from Spongebob). Additionally, the voice acting for the eyepatch girl with the gun was quite good as well, and this is where my praise for the show ends, with considerably more complaints to come.The first gamble happens in the first episode, which is a rock-paper-scissors based card game (just like Kaiji), wherein Yumeko spots that her opponent is cheating, but still finds a way to circumvent it and win, through single-digit percentage levels of luck, which is hard to suspend your disbelief for when you know it\'s not actual luck, just plot convenience. For some brilliant gambler, a plan so reliant on luck certainly is questionable, but I\'m partially convinced I put more thought into writing this review than the author did the manga. Additionally, she gives a little speech about how ""In a capitalistic society, money and life are the same"", which isn\'t too dissimilar to a speech made by Tonegawa in Kaiji, the only difference being that not only did Kaiji wait about 8 episodes before giving this speech, but in Kakegurui it just feels completely artificial, and I think this is embedded by the fact that in Kaiji, Tonegawa does make a good point. We do see Kaiji, and many other characters risk life and limb for the sake of money, meaning that his statement is quite impactful. Yumeko bets 10 million yen in the first 10 minutes like it\'s all Monopoly money, and at the end of the day, it is. It\'s also worth noting that as a very rich Yakuza boss, for Tonegawa to say it actually makes sense, but Yumeko\'s saying it in front of a woman she\'s just met, in a school she\'s only just been to for the first time, and doesn\'t even know how things properly work yet. She has such a high amount of money that no gambles are impactful, it\'s like playing a video game with cheat codes. If she wins, ok she had a fun time, but that money doesn\'t matter to her, nor the viewer. If she loses, it doesn\'t matter either, because she can not only pay that money off easily, but if she gets a ""Life Plan"", and is forced to marry some rich bloke, well that\'s in ten years, it doesn\'t impact the story right now. It\'s like the shonen cliche of using a special power that takes off a tiny amount of life, which the viewer never sees the impact of, so it might as well not even happen. It seems like something really basic, if you\'re making a gambling anime, make the gambles impactful to the viewer. Imagine if John Rambo was completely incapable of being killed. The action wouldn\'t be engaging at all, and it\'s the same here. In fact, given that she is the daughter of a CEO or politician or something else, maybe we could see her getting disowned, or at least ostracised for a huge failure as well as her addiction? Doesn\'t happen. There\'s little point it even being a school other than because girls with big asses in schoolgirl outfits is where the money is. Speaking of which, I really didn\'t appreciate the very heavy and blatant BDSM overtones in the show, and I liked Prison School, for crying out loud. It was just really poorly handled, and a bit of a disappointment all things considered. In fact, sexual imagery as a whole is poorly handled, I really don\'t know why Yumeko or any of the other girls were so sexually excited by gambling, sometimes even having to touch themselves, it\'s just absurd. It\'s not even trying to be funny, and I really don\'t think anyone could\'ve appreciated it.So I should probably also speak about the sound design. With the aforementioned eyepatch girl with the gun, who I will not give the respect to look up the actual name of, the voice acting was very poor. Yumeko\'s the main character, but she\'s disappointingly average with her voice acting. With the adrenaline rush from gambling that\'s meant to be tantamount to cocaine, when she\'s shouting in her opponent\'s face, she should at least speak at a bit louder in volume, and with a more enthusiastic tone of voice. Not to mention most the time she just sounds like, for a lack of a better term, a fake bitch. Perhaps I\'m just too used to anime characters who make their emotions clear as day, but she just sounds so distant from everything, and just about every instance during the gambles in which she spoke, I could just tell that she was speaking in such a manner to aggravate their opponent. This isn\'t because I\'m brilliant at detecting fake personas during gambling matches, nor because I\'m an expert on emotions. Rather, it was just poorly done, and I\'m half convinced this show was programmed by a computer. Schoolgirls, fanservice, and a poorly implemented gimmick, but no human actually checked to make sure everything works.So to conclude, Kakegurui is exceptionally poor. On its own merits, it is an utter failure. The characters are uncompelling, the omnipresent fanservice does no favours in actually making the show any easier to stomach, the gambles are about as poorly written as I can imagine, just having the formula of Yumeko wins at first, then she starts to lose and says something along the lines ""Oh, now things are getting interesting"", then the villain taunts her and gets overconfident, then she makes a comeback and explains how it was all according to keikaku and exploited something that the viewer had no actual way of seeing or knowing, and then walks off triumphantly.  Even as just a SOL, it\'s got nothing going for it, and as a gambling anime, and thereby contender to head honcho Kaiji, it is an embarrassing failure. The only reason I got as far as episode 4 was to see how the arc would end, but it got so unbearable I couldn\'t even manage that. That it was popular enough to receive a second season is a mystery I\'m just waiting for Yumeko to laugh in my face and explain the reason behind, because it\'s well beyond me.Genuinely and utterly contemptuous in all regards, and one last note, what the fuck are wrong with the school uniform trousers/skirts, most bizarre pattern I\'ve ever seen. takes place in an elite school wherein people\'s ability to gamble properly is what gives them their status, from the student council at the top, and house pets at the bottom, with the story taking place upon the transfer of Yumeko Jabami, who is addicted to gambling, and cannot resist a good gamble.Now, one thing I can commend the show for is it goes for a nice aesthetic. The lighting in particular helping to focus, and Yumeko\'s eyes going red, or characters being animated in grotesque amounts of detail when shocked/excited (the best parallel I can think of would be the ""I need it!"" scene from Spongebob). Additionally, the voice acting for the eyepatch girl with the gun was quite good as well, and this is where my praise for the show ends, with considerably more complaints to come.The first gamble happens in the first episode, which is a rock-paper-scissors based card game (just like Kaiji), wherein Yumeko spots that her opponent is cheating, but still finds a way to circumvent it and win, through single-digit percentage levels of luck, which is hard to suspend your disbelief for when you know it\'s not actual luck, just plot convenience. For some brilliant gambler, a plan so reliant on luck certainly is questionable, but I\'m partially convinced I put more thought into writing this review than the author did the manga. Additionally, she gives a little speech about how ""In a capitalistic society, money and life are the same"", which isn\'t too dissimilar to a speech made by Tonegawa in Kaiji, the only difference being that not only did Kaiji wait about 8 episodes before giving this speech, but in Kakegurui it just feels completely artificial, and I think this is embedded by the fact that in Kaiji, Tonegawa does make a good point. We do see Kaiji, and many other characters risk life and limb for the sake of money, meaning that his statement is quite impactful. Yumeko bets 10 million yen in the first 10 minutes like it\'s all Monopoly money, and at the end of the day, it is.

Some are original, while others change up the rules of traditional gambling games to make it more extreme. Despite the overall outcome of the gambles being easy to predict, down to the last one, it is the process of gambling that makes this anime very intense and you will want to come back for more.

Personally though, I'm not a fan of the ED song.

Meanwhile Ryouta stops becomes less of a coward and risk-adverse in a system with the foundation built on the concept of high risk, high reward, yet at the same time give us a realistic and rational point of view among the many lunatics in the anime. The backstories of other characters are also touched upon, which helps to flesh them out and show us the high stakes that these other characters are also facing.Enjoyment: 7The tension and novelty of each gamble made me hang on the edge of my seat and the conclusion of each gamble leaves me wanting to find out more about the eccentricities of the other characters in the school. I also love the mindgames the characters play with each other, adding a level of complexity to each insane gamble and making it even more thrilling to watch.

Every time when the schizophrenic Yumeko transformed from her innocent student self to a demonic gambler with red snake-iris, Saori\'s voice just chilled the hell out of me. It is a transformation of Yumeko, but if we consider all the other cute kawaii roles Saori has voiced so far, that was as much as a transformation of Saori herself. Every...time when she whispered at anybody, she was talking to the character on the one side as well as addressing to me on the other side of the camera. No wonder I searched for her name at every credit just to confirm ""it was she""  in the episode.The plot itself is a bit of heavy taste. I\'m afraid the show is not for all ages. Cutting off the younger viewership is a hard choice because it impacts the quote. But the plot made it up by delivering the thrill and pumping the adrenalin that a gamble brings. Twists in plots made the watch even more gut wrenching. I did get a feeling that the show ends a bit abruptly and deserves something much more dramatic to conclude.Yes, gambling is illegal in most countries, but I believe that life makes out of many many small gambles, whenever we invest, get the job A instead of B, confess to the person we fall for. In this sense, the show is a dramatic depiction of what happens in everybody\'s everyday life.It is a pity there is not too much chance for Saori to sing in this show. She did have a short song duo at the end of one episode. But this is no Tari Tari.All in all, the plot is decent, not a 10 but thoroughly enjoyable.

However, after a couple of months, I eventually found myself rewatching it.Story- 8/10The premise of gambling is always an interesting topic. Kakegururi revolves around a new transfer student named Yumeko Jambi. Over the next episodes, Yumeko either challenges or is challenged to gamble. I have to admit the strategies and thought-processes of the characters were confusing to me from time to time because of my unfamiliarity with the game, but it was no big deal after reading the summary of the episode.One...factor that I didn\'t mind, but could understand is a ""drop"" for others would be the pleasure that some characters get from intense gambling. Don\'t watch this show on the bus or anywhere public.Art- 8/10I was surprised by the animation for this one. At first, I didn\'t quite like the (what I believed at the time) high-quality hentai art style, but I believe it grew on me. The detail on the character\'s facial expressions is top tier. The opening is up there in terms of opening quality.Sound- 9/10The voice acting in Kakegururi is one of the best. First off, the VA for Yumeko does an excellent job utilizing her soft-sounding voice to fit the insanity of the character. The other cast members also do a good job of complementing the anime. If I were to nit-pick one thing, however, it would be the sound of the teeth-gritting - I\'m not a fan.Character- 7/10The main character (Yumeko) is the main highlight of the show. There are times when other characters shine, but only when they\'re playing against or working with Yumeko. Some characters were stereotypical such as the Manyuda Kaede the smart analytical type with glasses or Suzui, Ryouta the ordinary simp. However, the rotating games and different tactics are what make each character interesting.Enjoyment - 8/10After giving Kakeguuri a second chance, I enjoyed what it had to offer. It was fun seeing how the characters approached each game and anticipate their opponent\'s next move.Overall - 8/10It\'s cool to learn new things when watching anime. I didn\'t know how to play Indian Poker at all before watching this show; now I do.

The premise reels you in and it\'s fun to see how far the gambling will go.', ""Kakegurui is over.It was ok.It was one of the most hyped anime of the summer season.Unfortunately, the show didn't meet the hype levels given to it.We thought it would have been a more psychological thing, but all we got were some interesting games.No game No life did gambling way better then this show.But Kakegurui was entertaining even spite that.So I give this anime a 6 outta 10.I enjoyed myself, but I was expecting too much when I got into this.I wouldn't recommend this unless you were already interested in it.This has been your spoiler free, but not really review on Kakegurui. "", 'Story: 5The progression is as basic as can be: Yumeko defeats a new person every week in preparation for the big baddie, the president. I can\'t say that there\'s much of a story here. We know that Yumeko gambles because it\'s her lifeblood, but as there\'s no real reason other than that, that means the idea of a \'story\' falls flat. There is no story. There\'s only Yumeko and her gambling. As for the other characters, we do learn about their backstories, but there\'s only so much you can cover in 12 episodes. That said, it\'s worth noting that these 12 episodes only really exist...to establish the characters and the academy itself. In my opinion, the story gets MUCH better in Season 2. Still, it doesn\'t excuse the fact that there\'s not really much story to feast our eyes on in this first season.ALSO, one major thing that really annoys me is the cheating. The games more or less revolve around the expectation that someone will always, always be cheating. So, it becomes less about gambling and more about ""who can spot the cheat first?"". It\'s true that cheating is a thing in gambling and I don\'t think it should be excluded entirely from the series, but EVERY SINGLE EPISODE? I wish they\'d vary it up a bit more. It takes the excitement out of it a little since it\'s like ""oh but Yumeko will probably expose their cheat and win anyway, right?"" and of course, it\'s true. The formula of this show makes it predictable after a certain amount of episodes, which is disappointing. Of course, the original games in Kakegurui are still very intriguing to watch, but the cheating gets a little annoying. The explanations of the cheats can also be a little confusing at times.Art: 7I really love the art in this series. The opening is really different to what you\'d typically expect to see, but I found it so visually appealing. One thing worth noting is that even despite having a cast which is mainly female, there\'s NOT that much fanservice. The most fanservice appears in the opening rather than the actual show, which was a nice surprise. The detail which goes into depicting the contrast between ""normal"" and ""caught in the throes of gambling"" facial expressions is also remarkable. Some have commented that they didn\'t like the contrast, but with this show, I think it\'s a case where you\'ve gotta just sit back and let it grow on you. I can\'t fault the art, if I\'m completely honest. One thing though... it really bugged me how Yumemi\'s eyes were star-shaped. Small thing, but I remember thinking ""god I wish she had normal eyes"". That\'s the only thing that really stands out to me, but otherwise, the art was nice. I liked the character designs and felt they suited their respective characters, so yeah!Sound: 10LOVE the soundtrack for this series. So much that I went to the trouble of going on Spotify and saving a soundtrack playlist for personal listening. The opening theme is really addictive to listen to and when you\'re at the height of whatever gamble Yumeko\'s taking part in, you won\'t be able to ignore the soundtrack. Anything less than 10 would be a crime. The voice actors were also AMAZING at their roles. It was remarkable just how Yumeko could go from sounding soft and sweet to cold and ruthless (especially when addressing Midari).Character: 6Suzui, the \'normal\' boy in this academy, is my major gripe with this series. He\'s so boring that he might as well not be in the show. Seriously, I didn\'t understand the reason for his presence. If we\'d learned more about him I might\'ve been able to tolerate him being on my screen, but he\'s more or less a cardboard cutout. He\'s meant to contrast all of the gambling freaks in his school, but instead, he fades into the background.To the people who have complained about not being able to relate to the characters... it IS worth noting that this show is called ""Kakegurui"" (Compulsive Gambler). So, I don\'t think we\'re MEANT to be able to relate to them. They\'re all freaks. We\'re not meant to be able to understand them. That\'s what makes it so fun. We never know what they\'re going to do.That said, there\'s not much character development. They\'re more or less gambling vessels and nothing more. We don\'t learn about the characters through their backstories, but rather, we learn about them through their resolve and their ambitions. Mary Saotome is a great example of this. With Yumeko... she doesn\'t really seem to have any ambitions beyond gambling, so she falls a little flat. I like her and I like that they\'ve hinted towards expanding on her character a little more, but as it stands, her character isn\'t really much to marvel about so far. I think they\'re dragging out Yumeko\'s family backstory a little bit, but we\'ll just have to wait and see.Enjoyment: 7Despite the negatives I\'ve mentioned so far, I really did enjoy this series. I was pulled in by the premise--so much that I finished the entire season in one night-- and though I wouldn\'t class this as a gambling anime (if you\'re watching this for the gambling, you\'ll be disappointed) I still enjoyed it! The soundtrack was amazing, the art was riveting and there\'s always a new character to offer an exciting game for Yumeko (and the audience) to enjoy. There are no boring episodes. That much is true. The games feel fresh and the characters always bring something interesting to the table. The only thing is that I wish Yumeko would develop as the plot did. Her gambling skill doesn\'t seem to change, and that stagnancy becomes more apparent as you progress through the plot. However, the show seems to realise this and focuses on Yumeko\'s opponents just as much--or more--as they do on her.Hopefully, my review was able to help you make up your mind!

The detail which goes into depicting the contrast between ""normal"" and ""caught in the throes of gambling"" facial expressions is also remarkable. Some have commented that they didn\'t like the contrast, but with this show, I think it\'s a case where you\'ve gotta just sit back and let it grow on you. I can\'t fault the art, if I\'m completely honest. One thing though... it really bugged me how Yumemi\'s eyes were star-shaped. Small thing, but I remember thinking ""god I wish she had normal eyes"". That\'s the only thing that really stands out to me, but otherwise, the art was nice. I liked the character designs and felt they suited their respective characters, so yeah!Sound: 10LOVE the soundtrack for this series. So much that I went to the trouble of going on Spotify and saving a soundtrack playlist for personal listening. The opening theme is really addictive to listen to and when you\'re at the height of whatever gamble Yumeko\'s taking part in, you won\'t be able to ignore the soundtrack. Anything less than 10 would be a crime. The voice actors were also AMAZING at their roles. It was remarkable just how Yumeko could go from sounding soft and sweet to cold and ruthless (especially when addressing Midari).Character: 6Suzui, the \'normal\' boy in this academy, is my major gripe with this series. He\'s so boring that he might as well not be in the show. Seriously, I didn\'t understand the reason for his presence. If we\'d learned more about him I might\'ve been able to tolerate him being on my screen, but he\'s more or less a cardboard cutout. He\'s meant to contrast all of the gambling freaks in his school, but instead, he fades into the background.To the people who have complained about not being able to relate to the characters... it IS worth noting that this show is called ""Kakegurui"" (Compulsive Gambler). So, I don\'t think we\'re MEANT to be able to relate to them. They\'re all freaks. We\'re not meant to be able to understand them. That\'s what makes it so fun. We never know what they\'re going to do.That said, there\'s not much character development. They\'re more or less gambling vessels and nothing more. We don\'t learn about the characters through their backstories, but rather, we learn about them through their resolve and their ambitions. Mary Saotome is a great example of this. With Yumeko... she doesn\'t really seem to have any ambitions beyond gambling, so she falls a little flat. I like her and I like that they\'ve hinted towards expanding on her character a little more, but as it stands, her character isn\'t really much to marvel about so far. I think they\'re dragging out Yumeko\'s family backstory a little bit, but we\'ll just have to wait and see.Enjoyment: 7Despite the negatives I\'ve mentioned so far, I really did enjoy this series. I was pulled in by the premise--so much that I finished the entire season in one night-- and though I wouldn\'t class this as a gambling anime (if you\'re watching this for the gambling, you\'ll be disappointed) I still enjoyed it! The soundtrack was amazing, the art was riveting and there\'s always a new character to offer an exciting game for Yumeko (and the audience) to enjoy. There are no boring episodes. That much is true. The games feel fresh and the characters always bring something interesting to the table. The only thing is that I wish Yumeko would develop as the plot did. Her gambling skill doesn\'t seem to change, and that stagnancy becomes more apparent as you progress through the plot. However, the show seems to realise this and focuses on Yumeko\'s opponents just as much--or more--as they do on her.Hopefully, my review was able to help you make up your mind! Kakegurui-mashou~', ""Kakegurui is a really bizarre anime. It kind of gives off a Kill La Kill vibe in that the school is run with an iron fist by the student council and the main character has to battle, or in this case gamble, student council members to get to the president. It also tries to be over the top like Kill La Kill but unfortunately Kakegurui lacks the fun characters or true zaniness that made Kill La Kill so great. All the characters (minus Suzui) fit on a scale of horribleness and insanity. The villains are truly detestable and that makes their downfall in gambling matches...in many ways cathartic. However, villains personalities also change without much, or in some cases really any, character development when they join Kakegurui's posse. All and all Kakegurui is really bizarre and somewhat cathartic, but lacks a good enough story to backup its weirdness. That being said I still plan on watching the second season since I believe that the first season might be serving mostly as exposition to allow for better character development in the next season. in many ways cathartic.

The student council is all-powerful and imposes a slave system to students that...owe extremely high debts. Main protagonist (and best girl) Jabami Yumeko transfers in, and she is as insane as she is beautiful (Barney Stinson\'s Crazy-Hot graph comes to mind instantly). Yumeko is a gambling addict, a perfect fit for this academy, willing to take insane risks all for the sake of a good gamble, and she soon finds herself surrounded by friends and enemies alike.If it wasn\'t obvious enough, Kakegurui IS all about Yumeko. She participates in every gamble, she\'s the center of attention for the student council members, she steals the spotlight in every scene. While I don\'t mind having a story revolve around one character, it\'s no excuse for everyone else in the story to be given poor treatment. Mary is your standard foreign tsundere character, Sumeragi is ambitious but not much else, everyone in the student council feels like a bunch of Pokemon Gym Leaders given how they\'re just there to give Yumeko someone big to play with. These characters do get some level of backstory, but it usually comes too late or just too generic to make a lasting impact (notable exceptions being Ikishima and Yumemite). The biggest sinner for me is Ryouta, who does absolutely nothing throughout the course of the series and is created JUST to play second fiddle to, you guessed it, Yumeko.The music and visuals for this show however, are surprisingly well done. The jazzy intro coupled with the well animated dancing sequences and not-so-subtle foreshadowing of future events are splendid, whereas the ending theme; while powerful and funky, didn\'t really need THAT MUCH fan service. The gambles throughout the series are all creative twists on common games like Rock, Paper, Scissors and Poker. The only problem I have with the games is that everyone cheats in one way or another, as if they have way too much to lose, so we never get to see anyone match Yumeko\'s raging gambling boner (for lack of a better word).If you\'re looking for a gambling story, where the characters are more properly established, and where there is genuine risk and high stakes involved, I cannot recommend Kakegurui. Please go watch Kaiji instead (which is what I will be watching next for comparison).

After reading the original series, I was skeptical of starting the anime, but it turned out to be a pleasant surprise.Kakegurui is what I like to refer to as an ""edgelord"" anime. Its premise is ridiculous, but also so self-indulgent that it\'s absurdly fun to imagine all sorts of gratuitous self-inserts...Yumeko Jabami is the new transfer student in a prestigious high school that is governed by how good you are at gambling. Everything, from your social standing to members of the student council, is decided by your ability...to outpace your opponent in a game of luck.

Obstacle appears, challenges the main character in a gambling match of whatever, loses and gets humiliated. Repeat it for about 4 times and you get the idea of this whole anime.

I hate this show with a passion. I\'ll get this out of the way, most shows I watch and I don\'t like I just think ""well, that was bad but harmless I guess"". that didn\'t happen this time. this show\'s everything made me angry, I felt legitimate disgust and evil feelings while...watching this pile of garbage. and now let me tell you why. starting with the characters, every one of them is EMPTY. they don\'t try to give them any slight piece of personality, the girl mc is just ""cute"" or just ""insane"". she never shows any actual emotions apart from happiness and one time disgust, she legit just smiles all the time and sometimes smiles in edgelordness. she is completely bizarre in the worst way possible and I just felt bored and annoyed with her. another thing I hate about her in this show is the lack of sympathy I had to her. there is NO point in the entire show I actually wanted Yumeko to win, she isn\'t gambling for a morally good reason (they make up some bullshit about her caring about the housepets but she clearly says she only gambles for thrills). she CONSTANTLY manipulates people around her just for the sake of her little ""thrills"" and is overall just a complete bitch. ANOTHER thing I just despised about her is how she constantly spews bullshit about ""what it means to gamble your life merely because of the chance you\'ll lose is so thrilling"" to win nothing if I may add, is that SHE NEVER LOSES. she knows she\'ll never lose, yet she tells all of the other characters that they should still risk lose, just because she\'s a bitch, she doesn\'t even earn ANYTHING apart from money, which she already has a shit tone of, from those stupid gambles of her. a great example is when she and a girl named Mary gamble against some other guy and a girl who he BULLIED FOR YEARS, and in the middle of the gamble, she just starts touching that timid, poor girl just to win that dumb game, and telling her how she needs to stay up for her self and it\'s all done in a very manipulative tone. she\'s clearly manipulating her. and the reason she needed to win that game makes no sense, she had so much money and always wins (except for one time, she got in debt and then needed to pay it off and that\'s the reason). meaning, in other words, SHE MANIPULATED THAT POOR GIRL, FOR NOTHING, JUST DUMB THRILLS!. ok, now when we got why I hate Yumeko so much lets get to why I hate the dude mc so much. he has NO character, NO backstory, NO growth (apart for falling for that bitch\'s bullshit and starting to get addicted to gambling), NOTHING! he is just a boring character who exists to be scared and tell exposition, and make the stupidest ending to anything I ever saw happen. not much to say. in another note about the characters, the side characters are also bland and boring. we have a ""cute"" loli who\'s a little richer than everyone else and a blonde bitch. we also have a masochist bitch. want to know why I call them bitches? you guessed right! they are flat and annoying and overall, almost useless for the plot. the one character I liked is Yumemi because she made me laugh a little but the best way I can explain it is, a cute girl who gets money off simps. ok, we finished talking about the characters, what\'s now? the story... well, let me just think.... it sucks as well. it\'s just ""Yumeko gets into a new school and wants to become the best gambler for reasons"". just really basic and boring, not a lot to say here. though if you like underdog stories it\'s not really that, more like if the writer took the story of kill la kill and thought ""this is way too charming and interesting..."". I don\'t have a lot to say about the story, I didn\'t care about it and I thought it was terrible but I don\'t have a lot to say about it. I want to talk about the fights now. I think the gambles in this show are predictable and terrible with no stakes at all, they fight over HUGE amounts of money but because everyone is rich, it doesn\'t really matter who wins what. the strategy feels basic and it follows the same formula, Yumekio loses for a moment then wins with a dumbass plan she pulled out of nowhere. it feels unrealistic and completely shatters any attempt for believable or interesting fights, instead focusing on how much big vagina energy the mc has. and they always try to trick you into thinking the mc will lose this time, which never works. overall, just lack any thrill or any reason to be invested in, 1/10 fights. now lets get to the reason this show is a 1/10 and not a 3/10 (because the one arc that made me laugh actually was pretty funny). the thing that turned kakegurui from a mindless, slightly annoying kaiji wannabe to a horrible piece of garbage, the psychology/commentary. from my knowledge and experience with the first season, the morals it portrays are.... well.... ""being a gambling addict means you have a lot of resolve, and big pp/vagina energy, not that you\'re psychologically troubled, just gamble and people will love and respect you if you win"" and also ""you can and should bet everything in every meaningless situation because you might win, also it\'s thrilling"". now lets take into account that this show is a shonen, and with it\'s atmosphere, it\'s main demographic is 13 yo girls. and the writers probably KNEW that, yet still telling them shit like that! it\'s just disgusting to me that the writer tries to make big commentaries on society like how the strong hurt the weak but it completely falls apart because they are all spoiled high school brats, they can just tell it to a teacher or switch schools, no ones stopping them! and while watching it I just kept thinking some 13 yo girl is watching this shit thinking ""omg I\'m soooo like Yumeko"" and that thought is just gross to me... I\'m not saying that if this was a seinen it was much better, then I\'d see it as just pretentious and overexaggerated and a shame to the seinen demoghrapic. as I see it, this is the worst kind of a shonen romp. the one that\'s not just generic, or not just stupid, but the one that tells it\'s audience fake pseudophilosophical bullshit as if it\'s true. now, I want to comment at the music, the op was ok...ish but it had some really dumb and edgy engrish lyrics, saying stuff to make the show sound darker and more interesting. the ed was ok as well... if the ed\'s animation was shit and the op\'s animation was way better than the show\'s. and I want to comment at the animation as well, it looks... mediocre but really not good, some of the drawings just look... bizarre and ungood but some of the cg effects were actually nice, I like how it shows the cards being devided by players, that just looked smooth. so the visuals just go from generic at best to almost being kind of ok but overall, not good animation. ok, we\'ve now finished my first mal review, if you sticked that far, I hope you\'re enjoying your day so far and that it will continue to be pleasent. so long from me, majora24 watching this pile of garbage. and now let me tell you why. starting with the characters, every one of them is EMPTY. they don\'t try to give them any slight piece of personality, the girl mc is just ""cute"" or just ""insane"". she never shows any actual emotions apart from happiness and one time disgust, she legit just smiles all the time and sometimes smiles in edgelordness. she is completely bizarre in the worst way possible and I just felt bored and annoyed with her. another thing I hate about her in this show is the lack of sympathy I had to her. there is NO point in the entire show I actually wanted Yumeko to win, she isn\'t gambling for a morally good reason (they make up some bullshit about her caring about the housepets but she clearly says she only gambles for thrills). she CONSTANTLY manipulates people around her just for the sake of her little ""thrills"" and is overall just a complete bitch. ANOTHER thing I just despised about her is how she constantly spews bullshit about ""what it means to gamble your life merely because of the chance you\'ll lose is so thrilling"" to win nothing if I may add, is that SHE NEVER LOSES. she knows she\'ll never lose, yet she tells all of the other characters that they should still risk lose, just because she\'s a bitch, she doesn\'t even earn ANYTHING apart from money, which she already has a shit tone of, from those stupid gambles of her. a great example is when she and a girl named Mary gamble against some other guy and a girl who he BULLIED FOR YEARS, and in the middle of the gamble, she just starts touching that timid, poor girl just to win that dumb game, and telling her how she needs to stay up for her self and it\'s all done in a very manipulative tone. she\'s clearly manipulating her. and the reason she needed to win that game makes no sense, she had so much money and always wins (except for one time, she got in debt and then needed to pay it off and that\'s the reason). meaning, in other words, SHE MANIPULATED THAT POOR GIRL, FOR NOTHING, JUST DUMB THRILLS!. ok, now when we got why I hate Yumeko so much lets get to why I hate the dude mc so much. he has NO character, NO backstory, NO growth (apart for falling for that bitch\'s bullshit and starting to get addicted to gambling), NOTHING! he is just a boring character who exists to be scared and tell exposition, and make the stupidest ending to anything I ever saw happen. not much to say. in another note about the characters, the side characters are also bland and boring. we have a ""cute"" loli who\'s a little richer than everyone else and a blonde bitch. we also have a masochist bitch. want to know why I call them bitches? you guessed right! they are flat and annoying and overall, almost useless for the plot. the one character I liked is Yumemi because she made me laugh a little but the best way I can explain it is, a cute girl who gets money off simps. ok, we finished talking about the characters, what\'s now? the story... well, let me just think.... it sucks as well. it\'s just ""Yumeko gets into a new school and wants to become the best gambler for reasons"". just really basic and boring, not a lot to say here. though if you like underdog stories it\'s not really that, more like if the writer took the story of kill la kill and thought ""this is way too charming and interesting..."". I don\'t have a lot to say about the story, I didn\'t care about it and I thought it was terrible but I don\'t have a lot to say about it. I want to talk about the fights now. I think the gambles in this show are predictable and terrible with no stakes at all, they fight over HUGE amounts of money but because everyone is rich, it doesn\'t really matter who wins what. the strategy feels basic and it follows the same formula, Yumekio loses for a moment then wins with a dumbass plan she pulled out of nowhere. it feels unrealistic and completely shatters any attempt for believable or interesting fights, instead focusing on how much big vagina energy the mc has. and they always try to trick you into thinking the mc will lose this time, which never works. overall, just lack any thrill or any reason to be invested in, 1/10 fights. now lets get to the reason this show is a 1/10 and not a 3/10 (because the one arc that made me laugh actually was pretty funny). the thing that turned kakegurui from a mindless, slightly annoying kaiji wannabe to a horrible piece of garbage, the psychology/commentary. from my knowledge and experience with the first season, the morals it portrays are.... well....

He had of course done all the right moves, to an extent. Ironically, Yumeko found his weakness in forcing his hand to fight with his pride and not his much beloved order & law mindset. Seeing Yumeko lay down a queen pair, he expected that she was trying to draw the game down to her decision on high or low victory by raising higher than him. Like the thuggish man defeated in Indian Poker, his firm conviction in himself and the caste system he stood upon led him...to dive into a situation without realizing he was standing on sand, not stone. He played exactly as he should have, ignoring that his own hand - trip eights - was not so secure as he believed it, never considering that he had guessed wrong by assuming Yumeko was trying to lower her hand as far down as possible. Yumeko laid down trip queens and his hair turned white in shock. The man of the blazon - dethroned.There's a saying, that the march of history is mailed boots ascending a staircase as silk slippers descend. The anime is full of arcs like this, plays on the ebb and flow of power. Yumeko emerges from nowhere, taking control of every palace and stability like the mailed boots of those rebels in the upswing of a dynastic cycle. This is the truth of power - power emerges from what gives it life, a chaotic flow that temporarily crystalizes where certain forces match up in the right way. Yumeko is from chaos, her eyes glowing blood red, as Kirai is stability, her eyes the pale blue of the immortal full moon. Yumeko fulfills Kirai's vision of the school as the wilderness of power plays, the lawless open where the powerful select themselves to crystalline form above the undifferentiated mass. Each of her opponents is a different play on power, one that she exists to find the weakness in and pry the armor apart by it. She's the upswing of a dynastic cycle embodied, where a unified army marches on the decadent palace of a broken nation to bring in another era of stability.My video player was glitching so I couldn't fully enjoy the visuals, but everything is very beautiful. The character designs, architecture, scene composition, color palette, etc, are all composed to give the entire show the aura of a casino - a nice one, not some backdoor poker game at a sleazy motel or the chintzy plastic of a slot machine. It all comes together to bring a wonderful feel to the show, one that feels just like the swipe of cards, the roll of dice, the chatter of chips, all the triggers a gambling addict could ever relapse by, all in a theatrical style that highlights key themes with works of art, strikingly composed scenes, or the personalized actions of the unique and wonderful characters. to dive into a situation without realizing he was standing on sand, not stone.

I sometimes didn't even skip them lol.the story is very interesting in my opinion. I love the variety of games and event though you know who's gonna win you're always surprised how they do it. its just addicting.my favorite part about this anime is the characters. I love how the main character is a strong amazing smart women and all the side characters are like that as well. basically the female characters are more emphasized and focused on which not a lot of anime does that:(. and every character...has their own unique personality. its just great. also the male characters are mostly lame which makes it even better:)ive watched season 2. its very good as well but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the first season.I highly recommend you watch this anime.<3 has their own unique personality. its just great. also the male characters are mostly lame which makes it even better:)ive watched season 2. its very good as well but I didn't enjoy it as much as I did the first season.I highly recommend you watch this anime.<3"", 'Kakegurui (Compulsive Gambler) Is a another game related anime with a out of a box art style and attracting characters. I will watch the second season (Kakegurui XX) in hopes for it to be like the first! Even though it was great, it has some flaws, here is my review.Story: 7/10 (Good)Kakegurui\'s plot is like Pokemon in a way (more mature of course) with the fact that is consists of many trials of the ""Games"" within\' it. Yumeko Jabami has to prove herself time and time again through gambling however, the games aren\'t the same each time. Each game there is normally a cheat that...Yumeko needs to discover. While the gambling set up is different every time I found it to be repetitive at some times. Besides that, it is a very absorbing story that made me want to watch every episode in a row.Art: 9/10 (Great)Everyone was hyping up Kakegurui\'s art and I first didn\'t see it in the trailers. Once the gambling begun, I swear I almost jumped up from my seat. Wow. The facial expressions are creepy yet show the characters pride. Often anime sticks to one style. Kakegurui\'s approach was more humanoid and made for a much more entertaining visual. It really added to the story when it became confusing.Sound: 8/10 (Very good)This is just a add-on just to say that there is a lot of, lets just say ""weird noises"". You may not want to watch this that loud.. But in the terms of quality, it was great, it sounded professional as it should.Characters: 9/10 (Great)I have rarely ranked characters this high in any review I\'ve ever done but it was needed, here\'s why. Every character that had any interaction with Yumeko always start the episode feeling prideful or something along the same line. By the end, they are beat down or feel like a failure. Even though it may be little, this is still character development. The writers managed to do this in a episode. Also, every character has one thing to them even though they are all based around the concept of being compulsive gamblers. These are remember able awesome characters!Enjoyment: 8/10 (Very good)Though the concepts could get confusing at times Kakegurui was VERY entertaining. The facial expressions were amazing to see as they weren\'t recycled and were new every time. Seeing new games and new areas every episode were also incredible. Of course the games could go kind of slow sometimes but towards the end they would kick off and end amazingly!Overall: 8/10 (Very good, not perfect, but way better than average.)In the end, I really liked this anime. It had twist and turns, trials for each character, growth, truth, and important messages hidden behind  the crazy faces. With all its flaws I believe it still is great, the way it puts itself apart from other anime is crazy, and almost even beautiful. Kakegurui was better than I thought it was, in fact, better than most. If you are reading this to decide if you should watch it, you really should. The amount of hidden symbols in it and values are nuts, I would watch it again, thank you for reading.~sakisanily Yumeko needs to discover.

A unique premise combined with great animation from Mappa studios and voice performances that truly make each character memorable.The story is centered around an academy that focuses on gambling instead of education. A unique concept that I've never seen presented in other anime. I find it to be an interesting way of creating conflict between characters, seeing each character gamble, and having the risk of losing their social reputation at the school is something I love about this series.The...animation and art style are brilliant. I find Mappa studios always does an amazing job in their animation, and Kakegurui is no exception. The animation does an amazing job of showing the overt and intense body movements of each character. Doing it in a way that makes the scene feel more intense but also remaining on the grounds of realism.The music and opening are alright, I more or less felt uncomfortable with the opening. I am more interested in voice acting, something that was performed brilliantly. The voice performance heavily reflects the character's movements, and when a scene becomes more Chaotic, ut can be heard in the voice of the characters.Each character had some unique trope about them that I like. Ryota is a spectator, just like us, and in a way, we see the world through his perspective. Yumeko is a person who is clearly defined by their intense desire for the concept of gambling. Even the development of characters like Mary and Itsuki was interesting to see.Centering a narrative around gambling makes for an interesting show that while it is overrated.

The story is boring and the characters are mediocre. Despite the school setting, no actual learning takes place, and only gambling is shown all throughout each episode. The school has an immoral hierarchy system too, but as everyone gambles, no one really cares for it, and instead supports the notion except for a select few. In a world where gambling is everything, if you suck at it, you become the lowest of the low -- a housepet.Jabami Yumeko is a new transfer student who is introduced as a gambling maniac. She does not gamble to get money, but...rather due to the fact she is addicted to the concept of gambling instead. She loves it when her opponent makes her have a hard time, but of course, she ends up beating eveery single one of them no matter what. She is a genius at reading everyone's tactics and cheap tricks. Although that's supposed to make it cool, it just decreases the tension and cool factor. The Student Council members are extremely weak and worth nothing in comparison to Yumeko, yet they are considered the best gammblers in the whole school. Once their tricks are revealed by Yumeko, it is just Yumeko storytelling and not the animators actually showing how exactly she could have figured all of that out, and leaves viewers to imagine the links themselves. That is just lazy work, and the tricks become even more boring and stupid. It's basically child's play.Kakegurui failed at highlighting Yumeko's intelligence (they only scraped the surface of it) and a psychological meaning behind her addiction towards gambling. It's just filled with hot girls, some flashing and rather disturbing faces whenever they get 'turned on' from gambling.One of the most disturbing scenes ever would be when the president of the beautification club or whatever the fuck it's supposed to be, Ikishima Midari, got turned on from Yumeko blatantly calling her disgusting and the absolute lowest of the low. She fucking drooled and squirted on the floor, like what the fuck is wrong with you? The words she said were also very disturbing, saying shit like how Yumeko's her goddess and all the others just feel like normal masturbations. What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

And some insane characters including Yumeko Jabami are even ready to put their life on the line just to have an exciting game. And this plot is ""Ok"".  Even when I know NOTHING about gambling, I still watched the games with full attention and interest. And...each plot twist that comes at the end of the game is just that insane.

The story expressed the perfect side of gambling, it showed how enjoyable it is but destructive at the same time but that thing also ruined it sometimes. And another crazy thing is that there\'re no teachers in any episode, nor any studies............is that really a school? Also sometimes the amount of bet just went so crazy that they were just unacceptable even if the student was from a rich family. How can you expect a high school student paying even 10 million yen as a debt? Even if his/her parents were filthy rich, the student would\'ve been hanged by the parents themselves if they heard about a debt like that. And how even a filthy rich parent let his/her teenager child go crazy with gambling?? By the way, who needs teachers and even principal of school where the student council does the financial and social work and also the rules of the school?????The art is amazing. Specially the animation style is really good and the variant bright colours , lighting, animation of the characters, the scenes where the characters go crazy and of each and every scene made it highly suitable for the for a gambling show. I must say I like the color filters and color coordination alot!!For the characters, it was interesting too see how Yumeko Jabami just wanted to have a great gambling all the time and how she can stake everything for a moment of enjoyment. It was really great to see how much calm and well behaved she is and then how she goes totally bananas and was ready to slam the hammer on everyone\'s head when it was gambling. And as she went on gambling around, she made her opponents\' characters bloom to the surface. With each game, the true colours of the characters came into light. And there were some character development in those characters who Yumeko smashed into peices. Like Mary Saotome, that crazy beautician, that wannabe idol whose names I forgot, and even Suzuki Ryota. Honestly I didn\'t like that crazy gunwoman at all. And how did she even get a gun in school? And which teenager is that maturely excited too die???I honestly enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. Even when I couldn\'t understand a game, it was still enjoyable. And watching a show with such good animation, a good premise, watching characters totally exposing their inner personalities, these all summed up into a great amount of enjoyment each plot twist that comes at the end of the game is just that insane.

And watching a show with such good animation, a good premise, watching characters totally exposing their inner personalities, these all summed up into a great amount of enjoyment', ""okay so I just finished the first season of kaketgurui and I, like so many other people, have a lot to say about it. This is one of the most divisive modern anime if you ask me, so I think it should be interesting to talk about.Story: 8- The story is about Yumeko (the main character) enrolling in this school that puts is almost entirely focused on gambling, and about her making a huge breakthrough through this and just being good at gambling. I know that's probably not a very good representation of the actual story but that's the vibe I got from it; and...I enjoyed it. the premise is awesome, and the series has multiple twists and turns throughout the plot to keep you interested. my only problem is that the pacing is super slow in like on or two episodes, and not in a good way. But besides that, pretty solid.Art: 9-  Okay this is one of the best parts of the show. The art looks really great. All the character designs are excellent and represent the character as a whole, the school itself looks unique and feels incredibly large, which is a good thing. the op looks incredible and so does the ending... if you catch my drift ;). the animation is good too I'll beat it with a few hiccups here and there but when it hits its incredible. So yeah the art style is greatSound: 10- The ost is freaking clean. It goes for this, like, electric edgy sort of thing and I love it: I remember thinking about how good the music was in certain scenes, which I rarely do. The op is great, and the ending is... pretty damn erotic ... and on top of that is very  great and represent Yumeko as a character perfectly. So yeah, no major complaints.Characters- 7: Okay this I where the series is at its peak and its lowest. let me get my complaints out of the way: Runa is really fucking annoying and is given no motivation or backstory watch so ever (in the first season idk about the second), so I have no reason to like her: she's not cute she's an annoying little shit. Okay that's harsh I find her annoying but her design is cool there, and she's not even the worst character in the show. That award goes to Tsuki. Tsuki is one of the most selfish anime characters I've ever seen: everything nice she odes is done for her gain, the fact that SHE BETS FOR PEOPLES NAILS IS COMPLETELY SHRUGGED OFF, and you know you're a bad kakegurui character when I like every other character r design except yours. That ends my rant. and uhh, I could care less about the president's assistant: shes just mediocre. Now, I can't talk about the best part of the show: Yumeko. honestly, she is perfect for the main character for the show. She's like the human reincarnation of gambling itself. She never ceases to make me smile, From being just a wholesome person one second to being ABSOULOUTLY INSANE the next, I absolutely loved her and she might be one of my favorite protagonists of any anime now. I liked the president and her outlook on the world was pretty interesting to say the least. And uhhhhh most of the student council members were pretty cool, especially the vice president can wait to find out more about her in the next season hopefully. Ryouta's pretty cool and has a good arc, and HIM AND YUMEKO ARE THE BEST SHIP CMON THEIR PERFECT THEY PLAY OF EACH OTHER SO WELL WE NEED THIS SHIP IM BEGGING HERE PLEASE NEXT SEASON. oh, and marys pretty good. so yeah the characters are rough around the edges but still pretty good overall.Enjoyment- 9: This was a show I loved and mildly disliked at the same time. I'd say overall tho, I had a blast with the show.Overall- 8: This show is flawed and is not the best it can be and I more so enjoy the show rather than respect it. but what it does well it does really well and I'd recommend it if you need something a bit more simple I enjoyed it. the premise is awesome, and the series has multiple twists and turns throughout the plot to keep you interested. my only problem is that the pacing is super slow in like on or two episodes, and not in a good way.

But I don't think it's bad. If you disliked the anime I'm willing to bet it was because it was really weird and disturbing and on that level I have to agree with you. But if you haven't seen it and are interested... well...So this is one of the first animes I ever watched, and was probably the first where 99% of the characters were crazy psychopaths who got high on the idea of getting their lives ruined. Like...I said, not a bad anime, just very freaky. The story is kind of basic and it lacks a good amount of continuity but I don't really mind it. It does kind of build up to the climax and all the arcs (and there are A LOT of arcs for 12 episodes) have themes that can be stringed together pretty well. The characters are really solid and even though they're not exactly three-dimensional, they're not really designed to be so I don't care too much to be honest. They all just have strange quirks (or mental problems to be honest) and are messed up in very different ways. Their behavior is pretty consistent so I never feel like any of their actions feel forced. The animation was pretty good albeit horrifying and I was entertained for the most part while watching the series (I hope that doesn't condemn me as a madman or something). If you're going for an anime that will thoroughly disturb you then I highly recommend this one. This anime could honestly rival Neon Gay in terms of how freaky it is.There's not that much I don't like about the anime. I've pretty much mentioned it all in the previous paragraph. It's just not particularly great. I mean they kind of make up for a lack of substance with horrifying imagery and dialogue (something that Neon Gay does not do) but aside from that it's enjoyable (once again, for crazy people).Overall I really don't have that much to say about it. It really is an acquired taste so if you get a bit queasy from seeing blood and people getting turned on by the idea of death/bankruptcy/being-forced-into-slavery then don't watch the anime. Just do yourself a favor and don't watch it. If you're masochistic like me (that was a joke don't worry mom and dad) and this sort of thing intrigues you or gives you an adrenaline rush then watch it. You'll probably enjoy it even if it doesn't really leave a lasting impression.-Sincerely, 100% non-psychotic non-masochistic good christian boy Kallocarina I said, not a bad anime, just very freaky.

I went into this for the attractive characters and was hopeful for an equally attractive plot. I hate to say i was disapointed, the art is stunning and i did find most of the games and bets really intriguing, however there really wasnt much else going for this show. The plot lacked any development- as did the characters.I have not watched past the first season so if it does get better feel free to let me know! But as of right now it ws an interesting watch but by no means a favourite, or one i wish to watch more of any time...soon soon', '- ""The willingness to bet, for most people, is only related to the rewards that one of the players will receive. This is a great concept of our current capitalist society. There are even people who risk their own lives to be able to win some coins, but even so, the casinos still continue to be filled, because many people know the real pleasure and madness that gambling games causes within themselves. "" -So, yeah! This quote is directly from Yumeko Jabami, the most psychotic girl on this anime. Kakegurui is an anime for people who wants to look a badass, right? I\'ll not coil...with the introduction (something I always use to do), so yeah! Let\'s go!Story: 8/10[WARNING: SPOILERS AS ALWAYS]Even the plot can be a thing that you\'ll think: humm, this anime will be wild. AND IT IS!! Kakegurui talks about the Hyakkaou, an prestigious school by your fame in gambling games, and this school is near to comemorate your 12th anniversary since your foundation. The majority of the students on this school are the richest people in the world, and the most skilled on gambling games. On the first episode, we\'re introduced to the main characters: Mary Saotome, Suzui Ryouta and mainly YUMEKO JABAMI. So, Suzui is with a really great debt, because everything in this school is based on gambling (not with grades, sports abilities, or something). The gambling games can determinate: if you can continue to study on Hyakkaou or not. And the students that are with a lot of debts can turn to a pet (a mutt, referring to the girls). And Suzui is on that situation, which can result in your expulsion (after losing a game with Mary Saotome). But, fortunately, a mysterious new girl called Yumeko Jabami came to that school, and she can save Suzui\'s life. So, on the first look for everyone, Yumeko looks a cute girl, that understand just the basic of casino games, but after Mary Saotome has invited her to play game called ""Rock, Paper and Scissors by Vote"" (which is basically the classic rock, paper and scissors, but on that, you can\'t choose what you want. Basically a lot of people draws an rock, paper or scissors symbols in mini papers, and put on a casket. After that, the two main players will pick, randomly, three papers that can contain: the three options, or repeated options). So, before that game, all the characters thought that Yumeko is a cute girl, but after this game against Mary just started, Yumeko proved that she can be very wild and skilled on gambling games. This, clearly, scared the people on the class (specially Mary). But, after that, Mary Saotome simply lost against Yumeko, resulting in a big debt. For Suzui, this was impressive. And, the fact that he was the guy that introduced the school to Yumeko, made her give a great amount of money, to basically award him for the fun that she had with her first gambling game, and help him so he wouldn\'t leave the Hyakkaou school, due to his big debt. So, this was the first episode. Starting on the 2nd episode, things starts to be wilder, with Yumeko playing against the members of Hyakkaou\'s student council (the group of students and school adminstrators, that are the best gambling gamers on all the school, even Sumeragi is not the best gamer, because she entered on the council due to an donation that her father made to the school). Yumeko lost against Yuriko Nishinotoin, and turned to a mutt. You\'ll feel a little bit of pity by her, but she recovered your position, so it\'s fine. And the episode that Yumeko and Kirari Momobami were fighting themselves (in a gambling game) makes Kakegurui more goose-bumpy. And I need to admit: I felt a lot of goosebumps on this first episode, and this was one of the main reasons that made me to continue to watch Kakegurui. The start was impressive, I felt like: WOAH!!! THIS EPISODE IMPRESSED ME. And yeah, a lot of people gave Kakegurui a low rate because those people thought this anime is: very appelative, the characters are very wild, and the things that are said in this anime are very inappropriate and horrific, anyway: those people felt very offended with Kakegurui. I mean, yeah! It can be very exaggerated sometimes, but to clarify: KAKEGURUI ISN\'T FOR KIDS. This anime, for a lot of people, is considered: ""a very great appeal, and can turn the people very addictive to gambling games"". Well, it depends of the way you watched it. This anime, for me, started in wildly way, the 1st episode was so impressive, that I felt: like I was taken by a big gust of wind. I know, this looks strange, but this anime is, clearly, to explode your brain with the genius that Kakegurui has. It\'s also anime for people who want to be a badass, but the psychological aspect only makes this anime better with the course of the episodes. Anyway, there\'s nothing to talk about the story, it\'s goose-bumpy, and will make you glazed, always wanting to know: what\'ll happen on the next episode. The anime can be scary, but that\'s the point that makes Kakegurui a badass anime. So, I rate it: 8/10, because the story is unbelievable and unpredictable, but there\'s some holes, and I\'ll talk about them later. But, overall, the story is not so memorable, but it\'s insanely great.Art: 9/10So, Mappa is one of the most famous anime studios by the gorgeous art. They produce very very stunning animes, such as: Dororo, Zankyou no Terror, Zombieland Saga, Yuri! on Ice, and etc. And Kakegurui is one of them: the art has a beautiful looking: it\'s pretty somehow, right? The anime story can be an horrifying thing, but the art is very detailed. The traces, the scenarios, the textures, and even the opening art can turn to stunning wallpapers to put on your phone, right?. The art is very great, as the majority of animes by the MAPPA studio. The character design is f*cking amazing, right? Very details, stunning and realistic scenarios, vivid colors, and beautiful character design are the main aspects of Kakegurui\'s art. I mean, there\'s nobody that can say the art is bad, because bruh: look at the style. Do you have courage to say the art is a shit? NO, you clearly don\'t have. So, the art is beautiful. Again, the story can be scary or spooky, but at least, the art can be a collyrium to the eyes. So, 9/10, no deffects at all, and yeah!Sound: 9/10The soundtracks is also one of the things that can make you addictive to Kakegurui. Specially on the opening: ""Deal with Devil"". The opening song is very addictive, and it\'s stuck on my head, right? The background soundtracks are also one of the things that make this anime even more great and more tense. There\'s some funny moments, and there\'s another moments that you can easily make a face compilation video, right? Because, returning to the art, the design is beautiful, and the character face design is very great and detailed (it can turn to a spooky material in some moments). But, clearly, Kakegurui has a lot of horrifying (scary) moments, and the background soundtrack contribute to make it be a lot even better. On the tense moments, they putted the right soundtracks on the time, and some funny moments, there\'s also some good and exquisite (stylish, to give a more ""rich"" air) soundtracks. So, my man, the sound aspect is also very beautiful. So, I rate it 9/10. MAPPA studio is not the best on this aspect, but Kakegurui just moved me on and made me think the opposite (that they can make catchy soundtracks and songs).Character: 8/10So, speaking about characters development, is not the best aspect. You know, I cherish too much about story and character development, and if these two things are not well worked, I\'ll definitely drop. Kakegurui\'s characters development is not the best, but one thing about that, that make me motivated to finish this anime is because of their personality traits. The explanation about their pasts is not the best, the only two characters that are average on this aspect is Yumeko and Kirari (because it was showed a little bit about their pasts: Yumeko is gambling and was transfered to a new school, because she wanted to protect your old sister of an serious illness, that until the present moments, we don\'t know: what illness is, and what happened with Yumeko parents, because they didn\'t showed on the anime; and about Kirari Momobami, and how she became the actual student council president). Basically, Yumeko, Mary and Kirari are the main girls (and the most badass characters) on the anime. And there\'s some crazy characters, specially Midari Ikishima, because she\'s an insane bitch, right? LOL, but the fact that Kirari judged her (and it resulted by she removed her own right eye, and hurted herself) was definitely crazy and insanely good, okay? I know, some people don\'t like of scenes like that, but I don\'t have trigger with these types of animes. Some animes like that (with psychological genre) are really dumb and horrible, but Kakegurui don\'t! I don\'t know how I can explain that, but Kakegurui hitted different on me. The characters past are not the best thing, but at least, their personalities are impressive. That\'s something that you can\'t deny, right? Specially about Yumeko: she can be crazy and insane, but she\'s cute sometimes, and a very good gambler, right?? So, 8/10, because about the character development. It\'s not the best, but their personalities can make this aspect so amazing. 8/10.Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 8/10Usually, I like so much to make big reviews (and talk so much about the animes that I watch), but there\'s nothing too much to talk about Kakegurui. It\'s an insanely great anime, and there\'s a lot of people that consider the anime (the story and the plot) very exploitable, but not for me. This anime gave me goosebumps in a lot of moments, and it\'s: like you were receiving a big wave of winds straight to your face, because this anime is very unpredictable and unbelievably absurd, in a lot of moments. So, I gave this a 8/10. Some people are very harsh with this anime, but again, Kakegurui is not for everyone: it\'s only for people that like to watch psychotic (not so much) and unpredictable animes. I don\'t like too much the psychological genre (I like more of drama genre), but this one really really intrigued me and excited me. I also already watched the 2nd season, so I\'ll review it later. But, for while, Kakegurui is definitely 8/10 for me. Some people underestimate this anime so much (and I don\'t exactly understand why), but I liked it. You can judge me, but the fact that you didn\'t like Kakegurui won\'t change nothing. It\'s 8/10 for me FOREVER, so yeah! Finish right there, and have a nice day guys! Bye! with the introduction (something I always use to do), so yeah! Let\'s go!Story: 8/10[WARNING: SPOILERS AS ALWAYS]Even the plot can be a thing that you\'ll think: humm, this anime will be wild.

I mean, there\'s nobody that can say the art is bad, because bruh: look at the style. Do you have courage to say the art is a shit? NO, you clearly don\'t have. So, the art is beautiful. Again, the story can be scary or spooky, but at least, the art can be a collyrium to the eyes. So, 9/10, no deffects at all, and yeah!Sound: 9/10The soundtracks is also one of the things that can make you addictive to Kakegurui. Specially on the opening: ""Deal with Devil"". The opening song is very addictive, and it\'s stuck on my head, right? The background soundtracks are also one of the things that make this anime even more great and more tense. There\'s some funny moments, and there\'s another moments that you can easily make a face compilation video, right? Because, returning to the art, the design is beautiful, and the character face design is very great and detailed (it can turn to a spooky material in some moments). But, clearly, Kakegurui has a lot of horrifying (scary) moments, and the background soundtrack contribute to make it be a lot even better. On the tense moments, they putted the right soundtracks on the time, and some funny moments, there\'s also some good and exquisite (stylish, to give a more ""rich"" air) soundtracks. So, my man, the sound aspect is also very beautiful. So, I rate it 9/10. MAPPA studio is not the best on this aspect, but Kakegurui just moved me on and made me think the opposite (that they can make catchy soundtracks and songs).Character: 8/10So, speaking about characters development, is not the best aspect. You know, I cherish too much about story and character development, and if these two things are not well worked, I\'ll definitely drop. Kakegurui\'s characters development is not the best, but one thing about that, that make me motivated to finish this anime is because of their personality traits. The explanation about their pasts is not the best, the only two characters that are average on this aspect is Yumeko and Kirari (because it was showed a little bit about their pasts: Yumeko is gambling and was transfered to a new school, because she wanted to protect your old sister of an serious illness, that until the present moments, we don\'t know: what illness is, and what happened with Yumeko parents, because they didn\'t showed on the anime; and about Kirari Momobami, and how she became the actual student council president). Basically, Yumeko, Mary and Kirari are the main girls (and the most badass characters) on the anime. And there\'s some crazy characters, specially Midari Ikishima, because she\'s an insane bitch, right? LOL, but the fact that Kirari judged her (and it resulted by she removed her own right eye, and hurted herself) was definitely crazy and insanely good, okay? I know, some people don\'t like of scenes like that, but I don\'t have trigger with these types of animes. Some animes like that (with psychological genre) are really dumb and horrible, but Kakegurui don\'t! I don\'t know how I can explain that, but Kakegurui hitted different on me. The characters past are not the best thing, but at least, their personalities are impressive. That\'s something that you can\'t deny, right? Specially about Yumeko: she can be crazy and insane, but she\'s cute sometimes, and a very good gambler, right?? So, 8/10, because about the character development. It\'s not the best, but their personalities can make this aspect so amazing. 8/10.Enjoyment: 8/10Overall: 8/10Usually, I like so much to make big reviews (and talk so much about the animes that I watch), but there\'s nothing too much to talk about Kakegurui. It\'s an insanely great anime, and there\'s a lot of people that consider the anime (the story and the plot) very exploitable, but not for me. This anime gave me goosebumps in a lot of moments, and it\'s: like you were receiving a big wave of winds straight to your face, because this anime is very unpredictable and unbelievably absurd, in a lot of moments. So, I gave this a 8/10. Some people are very harsh with this anime, but again, Kakegurui is not for everyone: it\'s only for people that like to watch psychotic (not so much) and unpredictable animes. I don\'t like too much the psychological genre (I like more of drama genre), but this one really really intrigued me and excited me. I also already watched the 2nd season, so I\'ll review it later. But, for while, Kakegurui is definitely 8/10 for me. Some people underestimate this anime so much (and I don\'t exactly understand why), but I liked it. You can judge me, but the fact that you didn\'t like Kakegurui won\'t change nothing. It\'s 8/10 for me FOREVER, so yeah! Finish right there, and have a nice day guys! Bye!', ""Kakegurui isn't just a typical school anime or even a sports one. It follows a unique path focused on gambling and addiction. The episodes are exciting and the excitement comes from the characters inside the show. It's impossible not to get on the edge of your seat watching Yumeko play against many political figures inside the school, or even arranging some sort of game against them. Honestly, I wasn't very interested in the plot when I tried to watch it, I just wanted to see why this anime was so popular - and now I completely get it. Social criticism in the form of light...comments; hell of a good opening; interesting plot and characters; eye-catching animation. This anime is a gem, and totally worth watching. Also, some episodes are really triggering for people with anxiety/PTSD, so be aware. comments; hell of a good opening; interesting plot and characters; eye-catching animation.

It showcases the characters' personalities and how the game changes them. Dare I say it reminds me of the mind games in Death Note, which is a huge compliment. I almost wanted to give the plot a 7 for 'good', but.............. the setting in this anime is AWFUL. It makes no sense. Is the private academy enabling all these? The student council for gambling? The hierarchy thing? The rule of being awful to the slave? How did they even reach this kind...of consensus? Was consent involved? Where are the adults? How could our main character join this school if he's not rich or powerful? And why, oh why, is it GAMBLING out of everything else? I cringed a lot, especially during the first few episodes coz the setup and characters are so CRINGE. This seems to me like the creator pulled shit out of their ass just because they couldn't come up with a more believable scenario on how to stage multiple, high-staked rounds of gambling. Lazy ass writing. 5 for 'average'.And the characters................................ phew. Okay, I'll just say that I like Yumeko a LOT. I think she's the most interesting female character I've seen in a while and it's amazing how, despite how unchanging she is throughout the show, she has changed a lot of people around her. It's also nice to see the development of the other characters including our main character. Like the plot, I almost gave the characters a 7 for 'good'. But omg THEY ARE SO CLICHE AND STEROTYPED!!! Yes, I do support women's wrongs as much as I support women's rights, but a lot of female characters here seem to exist with the main purpose of fulfilling a certain tsundere/yandere/etc fantasy and I just... blegh. I am SO tired of male-catered fanservice as well as self-insert, boring male characters whose initial existence in the show is unwarranted (like, why tf was he even enrolled in that school?). This anime would've been SO much better if Ryouta was a girl tbh. This would've been an iconic lesbian anime about mind games and free will which only comes out once every blue moon and proves that whoever creates this has enough balls and is, therefore, should be critically praised but NOPE, this ends up becoming your seasonal mid af edgy anime which we should've gatekept from cishet men especially incels. 4 for 'bad'.The animation and art are just fine tho, ngl. I really don't have a problem with it, but there's also nothing groundbreaking, so imma give it a 6 for 'fine'. BUT THE SOUND OMG. Anyone who as much as stands a few feet away from my bedroom would've thought I was watching porn because there is just so much moaning. It's fine at some point but... this is just too much. Plus, the OP and ED songs aren't that memorable, so imma give the sound a 4 for 'bad'.Lastly: my overall enjoyment. Despite my complaints, I managed to finish Kakegurui relatively quickly and I kept wanting to know what's going to happen next coz every episode is paced relatively well and the cliffhangers are good. Having said that, I still cringed at times and even had to put the speed at 1.5x at some point due to my wanting to know what was going to happen next, but not really enjoying the story enough to soak everything in.

This being really my first anime in terms of the story being fixated around gambling. This is my 3rd review using my MAL account. 1st TV anime. So, here goes.Story: With 12 EP's and an ongoing manga. It kind of hurts you with opinion wise on what to score it. I truly think Mappa is so good of a studio at capturing viewers with the intensity of psychological genre. Heck, even mystery, sci-fi. Yumeko a mystery girl at first glance to me walks into Hyakkaou academy blind of what really is going on. Usually...for me, I'd immediately scramble. But like Yumeko I enjoy what I'm unable to predict. Risk, challenging maneuvers inspires for sure. Anyway, this anime is a real gambling treat. 8/10.Art: The artwork was lovely. I seen glances of the manga and the glowing eyes when Yumeko feels the risk. It's crazy how Mappa times it out all accordingly. The cringing of the teeth, the blood, everything. The character detail art was nice too. My personal favorite being Mary. I have a thing for blonds. Whoops....8/10.Sound: Like I said in the Art section. Mappa times it all out accordingly. I feel the cringing of a characters teeth presents viewers a feel of their own frustration like your actually standing before them. At least, for me it was.Yumeko, Mary, Midari included have the tendency to yell when things feel hyped. Their voices echo perfectly when I'm listening in with my Bose headphones. I have no complaints. The music is tremendously well done as well. It comes into play right when it matters. Gambling....8/10.Characters:MAL calls this section character. But for me, it's everyone. Here's my thoughts on them.Yumeko: As I said before. When I first glanced at her, she was a real mystery. I think any girl or character would be when you don't know too well yet. I heard about Yumeko's exploits before the summer season started. That she was crazy, she lives for the feels, risks. I guess that's what really drove me to watch this show. You know what, Yumeko is crazy insane just like folks said. Was I surprised? Yes and no. I had the feeling she'd be crazy. But not that insane as she was. Yumeko provided the feels, the blood chilling moments at every turn when she gambled.Mary/Meari: Unlike Yumeko. When I first laid my eyes on her, I thought she was stuck up. But she really just has a prideful she's trying to cover for. Mostly personal too by the looks of it. Mary was my favorite character in this anime. Not to mention her crazy way of thinking almost aligned with Yumeko. Those two made a great gambling team, by the way. Watch the anime and you'll see what I mean.Kirari: The student Pres truly was a mystery. To me, she felt bored, wanted some fun. She got her wish when Yumeko came into play and it went on from there.The other characters including a specific one revealed in EP 12 makes me think this anime needs a S2 badly. But manga readers won't complain. It's a must read for me. 8/10.Enjoyment: This anime really was my first for a gambling kind of thing. I really can't recollect if I've ever seen something so good as Kakegurui that just makes gambling feel worth it even though it's not. Scary thing, being in debt. Sure expressed that deeply in this anime too. Whelp. 8/10Overall: I think overall it's about an 8/10 to me. I feel more could go on with this anime. We could see more intense matches. May an answer with the ending in EP 12. I guess that's we are encouraged to read the LN/manga of content afterwards. Right?Thanks for reading my review of Kakegurui for me, I'd immediately scramble.

Right?Thanks for reading my review of Kakegurui"", 'I watched this till the ninth episode in 2017 when it came out and I never finished it so yesterday I binge-watched it from the first episode again. I never had many expectations about this anime. I didn\'t watch any gambling animes so I was mainly drawn in by the art style.The way I would describe this anime is ""psychopathic lesbian gambling porn"", less emphasis on the gambling. Mostly this is about the main character who is a compulsive gambler and doesn\'t care if she wins or not, she just wants to gamble for very high stakes. But she always wins. So if you\'re...looking for a high tension gambling anime where even the main character is crushed by this addiction, I wouldn\'t recommend this. Even if the main character doesn\'t win, she doesn\'t care and you won\'t get a worthwhile reaction from her because she is not desperate to win. The other characters are all psychopaths too who very much care for winning but it\'s not that devastating when they lose because you don\'t care as much for them as you do for the main character.For me, the most enjoyable is the art style. The characters are drawn very innocent but turn into monsters when gambling or talking about it. This was the kind of anime where I was just staring at my screen with WTF eyes. The porn part is because the main character literally looks like she orgasms every time she gambles and the female characters are so sexual with each other, I swear I thought they would fuck at some point.Overall, I think it was ok but definitely not my favorite and I wouldn\'t watch it again but I am interested in the second season. looking for a high tension gambling anime where even the main character is crushed by this addiction, I wouldn\'t recommend this.

(something that most new viewers aren\'t comfortable with). Pros: This show is unique and different from all the typical harem or shonen anime. It takes a typical school genre and turns it into a completely different direction. I also love the fact about how each character has a unique reaction to...gambling. Yes, it may seem like they are all having orgasms but if you look closely they are all fighting for something. Either fame, money, or the desire to cush others each character has a different reaction.Okay, now for the bad parts about the show. The way that the show paces itself is a little weird. Since the first few episodes, they are already foreshowing the main opponent of the school. It got me excited but towards the end, it felt a little rushed. All this hype I had left me disappointed when the show ended and it confused me a little because I didn\'t know if I wanted a second season. The grand finale wasn\'t all that grand. Maybe they were trying to get you to want an another season but I just don\'t know.Anyway, this show still deserves a watch and I highly encourage you to check it out. gambling.

And I know pretty much NOTHING about gambling other than black jack and the house always wins. Possible SpoilersPlot: So I went into this anime with high expectations due to the hype it got from the manga. This hype and optimistic outlook I had into the anime slowly decreased when I came back to earth; this anime is just about a compulsive gambler. I felt like there was no conflict in the plot. Jabami gambled, Jabami\'s opponents mostly cheated, Jabami saw through the deceptions and bets it all on the best strategy. She wins, ties,...or leaves satisfied; rinse and repeat. She never improved, she never slacked off. The one time she actually lost and was put in debt wasn\'t even a struggle or satisfying because the anime mentioned that she won enough money to pay the debt and simply didn\'t want to.Storyline: This storyline, in my opinion, has a hit-or-miss opportunity (some may love it, others may hate it). For the longest, Jabami had no goal and was just going about her school days. Her gambling skills remained constant and thus limited. The only thing that engaged me was trying to figure out what strategy she would take and that was only when I understood the game\'s rules. 1/3 of the games played relied on the viewer to be familiar with the rules prior the episode (Ex. poker), and if you weren\'t, you were left utterly confused until the end. Then once we see some inkling of a conflict or goal forming (gambling the entire student council), they missed 2 out of the 9 members (one being quite vocal) and jumped to the ""final boss"". Then, once we reached the final gamble against the president, the game wasn\'t rigged (no strategy, sly ability etc. needed) making it anti-climatic and the most important part of the gamble wasn\'t even done by Jabami. I watched each Sunday, but couldn\'t predict whether I\'d like the episode that week or not.Art: The art was very detailed. The anime managed to precisely show the viewers the intensity of the situation and the feelings of the players. The, almost sexual, high the players would experience during suspense, the sweat dripping down the stressed opponents face, the almost inhumane appearance of the callous cheaters and Mike abusers, the setting that focused solely on the gamble; all was expressed in great detail.Sound: I like a soundtrack that is not distracting and can match the situation; I\'d like it even better if the songs were memorable and able to blend in with the situation at the same time. The anime soundtrack did just that and the opening and ending songs had this jazzy, flashy, seductive feel in them, which fit the mood of the anime to me. However, I don\'t know if a dub will come out, but the sub actors were really hard to listen to. Some voices were trying so hard to be queaky and cute or raspy and tough that it was cringe-worthy (*cough* Ikishima and Yomozuki *cough*). Not the worst, but it was uncomfortable when the 2 most vocal council members had annoying voices.Main Characters: Jabami had no depth to her. There was no reason given as to how she became a compulsive gambler. She was so good at gambling, but it was never revealed why. A lot of the side characters were given a backstory, but Jabami\'s was left a mystery. When she\'s not gambling, she kinda acts like any person would around strangers; polite, bland, and fake. She clearly holds her friends dear to her, but her friends weren\'t really friends. For a good half of the anime, I was still not convinced that Suzui wasn\'t just hanging around Jabami for ""other reasons"" ( ;D ). Mary hated her, had to team up with her once, and kinda hung out with her for the latter half because her friends were b****es. Sumeragi only joined her band of misfits because she wanted Jabami to become the new class president and give her a council seat back. I feel like the only reason Jabami really considered them as friends was because some gave her gambling money and others made the games interesting. It\'s kind of hard to like a character that had no development. She came into the anime as a gambling addict with no friends and came out a gambling addict with questionable friends.Student Council: Although a school full of rich gamblers is rather uncommon (at least I think it is XD) there are still certain things I expect to remain realistic simply because it\'s a school setting; they weren\'t. A callous, tyrannical, student council; okay. A caste system treating those in debt like slaves who have to do ANYTHING the other students say; a stretch, but I\'ll accept that. A child can bring a loaded gun to school and use it for gambling; NO!! A student can poke another student\'s eye out; NO!!! The students have their entire lives mapped out until the debt is paid; even if they owe money, NO!!! Some of the student council members were so unbelievable and unrealistic EVEN FOR AN ANIME LIKE KAKEGURUI. There was this big, scary reputation built around the council president being even worse than her council underlings, but she was just another Jabami with power and a strong opinion not about gambling.Enjoyment: The games I actually understood the rules to were fun to watch. The addition of cheating created a challenge for the bland Jabami and had me trying to guess how she would get out of the mess and win the pot. But, this anime was hit-or-miss for me; some episodes I loved, some I hated, and the last one left me utterly disappointed. Maybe my standards were too high. or leaves satisfied; rinse and repeat. She never improved, she never slacked off. The one time she actually lost and was put in debt wasn\'t even a struggle or satisfying because the anime mentioned that she won enough money to pay the debt and simply didn\'t want to.Storyline: This storyline, in my opinion, has a hit-or-miss opportunity (some may love it, others may hate it). For the longest, Jabami had no goal and was just going about her school days. Her gambling skills remained constant and thus limited. The only thing that engaged me was trying to figure out what strategy she would take and that was only when I understood the game\'s rules. 1/3 of the games played relied on the viewer to be familiar with the rules prior the episode (Ex. poker), and if you weren\'t, you were left utterly confused until the end. Then once we see some inkling of a conflict or goal forming (gambling the entire student council), they missed 2 out of the 9 members (one being quite vocal) and jumped to the ""final boss"". Then, once we reached the final gamble against the president, the game wasn\'t rigged (no strategy, sly ability etc. needed) making it anti-climatic and the most important part of the gamble wasn\'t even done by Jabami. I watched each Sunday, but couldn\'t predict whether I\'d like the episode that week or not.Art: The art was very detailed. The anime managed to precisely show the viewers the intensity of the situation and the feelings of the players. The, almost sexual, high the players would experience during suspense, the sweat dripping down the stressed opponents face, the almost inhumane appearance of the callous cheaters and Mike abusers, the setting that focused solely on the gamble; all was expressed in great detail.Sound: I like a soundtrack that is not distracting and can match the situation; I\'d like it even better if the songs were memorable and able to blend in with the situation at the same time. The anime soundtrack did just that and the opening and ending songs had this jazzy, flashy, seductive feel in them, which fit the mood of the anime to me. However, I don\'t know if a dub will come out, but the sub actors were really hard to listen to. Some voices were trying so hard to be queaky and cute or raspy and tough that it was cringe-worthy (*cough* Ikishima and Yomozuki *cough*). Not the worst, but it was uncomfortable when the 2 most vocal council members had annoying voices.Main Characters: Jabami had no depth to her. There was no reason given as to how she became a compulsive gambler. She was so good at gambling, but it was never revealed why. A lot of the side characters were given a backstory, but Jabami\'s was left a mystery. When she\'s not gambling, she kinda acts like any person would around strangers; polite, bland, and fake. She clearly holds her friends dear to her, but her friends weren\'t really friends. For a good half of the anime, I was still not convinced that Suzui wasn\'t just hanging around Jabami for ""other reasons"" ( ;D ). Mary hated her, had to team up with her once, and kinda hung out with her for the latter half because her friends were b****es. Sumeragi only joined her band of misfits because she wanted Jabami to become the new class president and give her a council seat back. I feel like the only reason Jabami really considered them as friends was because some gave her gambling money and others made the games interesting. It\'s kind of hard to like a character that had no development. She came into the anime as a gambling addict with no friends and came out a gambling addict with questionable friends.Student Council: Although a school full of rich gamblers is rather uncommon (at least I think it is XD) there are still certain things I expect to remain realistic simply because it\'s a school setting; they weren\'t. A callous, tyrannical, student council; okay. A caste system treating those in debt like slaves who have to do ANYTHING the other students say; a stretch, but I\'ll accept that. A child can bring a loaded gun to school and use it for gambling; NO!! A student can poke another student\'s eye out; NO!!! The students have their entire lives mapped out until the debt is paid; even if they owe money, NO!!! Some of the student council members were so unbelievable and unrealistic EVEN FOR AN ANIME LIKE KAKEGURUI. There was this big, scary reputation built around the council president being even worse than her council underlings, but she was just another Jabami with power and a strong opinion not about gambling.Enjoyment: The games I actually understood the rules to were fun to watch. The addition of cheating created a challenge for the bland Jabami and had me trying to guess how she would get out of the mess and win the pot. But, this anime was hit-or-miss for me; some episodes I loved, some I hated, and the last one left me utterly disappointed. Maybe my standards were too high.', '- May Contain Spoiler -player1: i will bet 5player2: i will bet 10player3: i will bet my life....everyone: wHat tHe F#@%.... :\\LOL, ok enough joking forgive me for this, but i do will say this - ""THIS ANIME IS INSANE""man i was so f**ing turned on while watching this anime, don\'t get me wrong here what i mean is THIS ANIME IS SO DAMM AMAZING that it gives you HELL OF A THRILL while you are watching it.This anime is really a hell of a masterpiece. it\'s so thrilling whenever you are watching YUMEKO playing against someone and when she catches him/her cheating and still...makes him/her lose and explains who\'s the boss, your little trick won\'t work on me, fascinating.Tbh episode 10th and 11th, especially 11th was too much for me to handle i actually paused the video, took 2-3 minutes to breathe and then continued to watch. (THRILLING)Story - as for the story, it just too much of a mystery, what i mean is that YUMEKO - she came out of nowhere? who is she? where she has come from? what her goal is? why she is here? there so little info about her in the anime, and is that all of it? or is it true or false? while watching each episode there were so many theories about YUMEKO and her past in my head which made me love this anime more and more...But whatever we have seen in these 12 episodes everything is so perfectly done (plot). Every move she makes, decision, progression it\'s just too good.10/10Art, Sound and Character - i don\'t know, how should i praise or compliment the sound and animation they are just on a different level, too good. The animation is so detailed. Sounds, voice dubbing and music are just too good or if i have to say - they are crazy level.Now about the characters, every character is crazy but we know who the boss here, YUMEKO\'s character is just so intriguing, her addiction for gambling is OMG. Sometimes she is attractive, sometimes you think she is really a crazy something. (oh i would like to stop myself here, or else my actual thought will slip out about her :P)10/10 for allEnjoyment - i don\'t think i need to write much here by reading the above stuff you already know how amazing this anime. one thing i am forgetting is the explanation of games are done so well, before and while they are playing the game, which make you think like -""how you should be proceeding "" or ""how you should play your bet"" - If you were playing this game. And also they have done the animation part of what the character is thinking in his mind while playing the game which makes the anime more enjoyable and watching interesting.10/10Overall - overall10/10(i haven\'t written much about animation, characters, music and sound here. why? because they are much more fun if you experience them yourself and notice how amazing they are.) makes him/her lose and explains who\'s the boss, your little trick won\'t work on me, fascinating.Tbh episode 10th and 11th, especially 11th was too much for me to handle i actually paused the video, took 2-3 minutes to breathe and then continued to watch.

Kakegurui unfortunately did not fufil any of my aims. That aside, it was a pretty solid show with a crazy and outright ballistic girl as the show's protagonist, which to me, was the best part of the series because her actions defied all normalcy and it was thrilling seeing how she would respond to the different challenges thrown at her (or rather she happily throws at herself).However,...aside from one or two episodes, I found myself slowly getting really bored from the things that were being presented. Every episode felt like it was following a formula and the games played, although all superficially different and unique, all felt the same and repetitive in some sense. And my oh my is there A LOT of cheating. Is this how gambling works? Because literally how someone won was by cheating or discovering how someone cheated or outsmarting someone's cheat by another cheat. And yes it was somewhat intellectual, but I had really wished they used more justified and proper ways to truly demonstrate the gambling prowess of the cast, rather then have them resort to such means.The art was really really spectacular at the start, and was what caught my attention with its unique art style that gave off a tinge of malice, which I thought was pretty darn cool. But the later episodes lacked the same quality as the first few.

Ultimately it didn't quite live up to them but the show was still very enjoyable regardless.The story was entertaining to watch as we followed our main character, Yumeko Jabami and the various gambling games she got herself involved in.  A critique I have for how the story was presented is that I thought the psychological elements weren't taken advantage of to the fullest and this caused the story to lack a certain level of depth.The art and art direction were very good although how...the faces were animated may irk some people. The very jazz influenced soundtrack seems to fit the atmosphere of Hyakkaou Private Academy well and makes you feel like you're in a casino. Kakegurui had a nice range in the personalities of the characters with some being quirky to eccentric to sometimes just plain insane.Kakegurui is a show I highly recommend to at least try.

I\'ll be keeping this review as spoiler free as possible.Story-6: the story is alright, or i suppose i should stay that there really is not much of a story here, this show is simply about the thrill of gambling primarily, and the plot basically involves the mc challenging the student council.art=10: At first i was a little bothered by the art, however i feel after finishing the entire show that while there were parts i didn\'t like and do like, it did an amazing...job at conveying the emotions the characters were feeling. Even if I personally did not like the art where they were making their ""meaner"" faces, I think that it was still very well done and appropriate. Their faces of ecstasy actually f**king got me hot and bothered honestly. Very well done.Sound-8: I thought the sound was pretty well done, there were a few times where i thought the sound that was used was kind of not needed at all which was why i deducted a point.characters-9: The characters are really why i like this show. You see why alot of characters are the way they are, you see why many people are desperate, and you can especially see in some characters how much they love what they are doing, and this kind of thing makes the show shine so much more in my opinion.Enjoyment-10: I enjoyed this show enough that i watched all 12 episodes back to back. Honestly it may be because of how overly dramatic and exciting everything was, I don\'t really know, but I was on the edge of my seat the entire time and really really enjoyed this show and that is enough for me.Overall-10 while adding my scores up may be different, the simple fact of the matter is that I felt amazing while watching this show, and felt very sad when it ended because I am once again stuck in a void not knowing what to watch.

Thank yous!', 'Totally over the top hornyness, definitely to the point that you will feel uncomfortable if this is not your personal fetish. There are moments that are straight out of a hentai. The world is very unbelievable and its one of those school animes where you literally never see a single teacher and you\'re wondering how they ever have time to do their homework. The main character, Yumeko is somewhat OP. Yet, I was very entertained. For an anime so stupid and lacking in depth, the twists in each episode are surprisingly clever and engaging. Each episode has its own game where the characters will gamble...using a version of a known game. You have to pay attention to the rules otherwise you may get confused. Yumeko uses logic to sort of figure out the twist or catch of the game each episode - it reads almost like a mystery show with the way she deduces who is cheating and how the game might have been rigged against her.The thing that saves Yumeko from being a complete Mary Sue is her motivation. She is totally obsessed with gambling for the sake of gambling, she\'s an addict and she gets off on taking huge risks, even when it may not seem like the smartest move. Actually, this school seems to have quite a few people that are sexually aroused by risk taking. That\'s where it gets egregiously horny.I love the devaluation of men in this show. Basically all the characters who are seen as intelligent or powerful are women. I do still think it\'s a story written by a man - the loser male character that follows Yumeko around definitely strikes me as the authors self insert - he\'s who men are supposed to see themselves in. The level headed everyman who gets to stand around and watch a bunch of perverted yanderes cum all over themselves while they gamble in sexy seifukus. The yuri aspect in this show definitely has a classic ""male gaze"" feeling. But again I give it a pass because of how weak and sad all the male characters are. The only really intelligent male character in the first season, Kaede, ends up being the one that Yumeko totally destroys. Everyone else she does battle with sort of ends up being her friend or not really losing. Kaede loses everything tho and is not particularly redeemed in the second season.

On the one hand it has an appealing opening and ending theme, a few episodes that cover mature themes, attractive female characters with a fair amount of fan service, and a unique premise (a high school with a penchant for gambling).On the other hand it has underdeveloped characters that only serve to provide exposition, a ""gamble of the week"" episodic format that results in no conclusion to the story, and really leaves me wanting something a little deeper.I would call this an ""edgy"" anime. The characters facial expressions are constantly exaggerated...to levels that I haven\'t seen since I watched Higurashi (or When They Cry in English). It seems so off putting at first but once it happens for the seven or eighth time you really just start to think its amusing. This show also loves to give the main character Yumeko glowing red eyes when anything intense or dramatic starts to happen. It really reminds me of Death Note when Light\'s eyes would constantly turn red. I mean hell, the student council president\'s eyes are constantly blue as well so you could say she is the L to her Light. Its stylish but ultimately unnecessary, in fact, at one point since Yumeko\'s backstory is never explained I thought she was some sort of demon or something but who knows.Overall I would say I thought this anime was enjoyable. I am a sucker for stylized shows with fan service and interesting music, I would even dare say I found some of the gambling matches entertaining due to the characters reactions. That is why I am giving it a 7 but really if they had fleshed out the characters more in say a 26 or even longer episode version of this show I feel like I would have loved it a lot more. It definitely has wasted potential although I have heard that the manga is better and that a second season of the anime is still possible. to levels that I haven\'t seen since I watched Higurashi (or When They Cry in English).

The psychological elements lies in Yumeko herself playing around with many of her rivals in different games, whether it is to recruit and bring...people to her side, lose and still win psychologically as well as Yumeko herself being a major hindrance Hyakkaou Private Academy\'s student council.The gambling aspect, well people will continuously say that it\'s a foregone conclusion that Yumeko will win every match she comes across and to that LA will say....did you even watch the anime?, Yumeko be it through rivals cheating, tying and even herself letting herself lose, well yeah Yumeko DOES LOSE but that is not what LA is getting at as for these kinds of animes, LA does have a simple rule of ""it\'s not the destination but the journey"", if the journey of Yumeko\'s results of winning or losing was entertaining then it did it\'s job and it did in LA\'s eyes at least and that is helped by it\'s crazy batshit aesthetics especially when it comes to the narmy looking facial expressions in the anime and sometimes genuinely unpredictable results. In the cases of Yumeko losing, she may have lost the gambling battle, but she won the psychological war.On speaking of Yumeko, Yumeko herself is quite the interesting character especially for a character to have such a belief and crazy batshit nature of wanting the thrill of the gamble to the point of her betting her life COUNTLESS times. Yumeko has a small backstory and even then it\'s vague to say the least but even then her mysterious yet batshit nature does make her interesting if out of curiosity or just her love of the gamble. LA does see Yumeko\'s existence in Hyakkaou Private Academy to be something of a chaotic nature in comparison to the student council, as she shakes confidence to the ""house pets"" and the ""poor"" in the form of some of her rivals and her allies of Mary Saotome voiced by Minami Tanaka and Ryouta Suzui voiced by Tatsuya Tokutake. Mary is something of a friendly rival and had Ryouta as a house pet before losing her status to Yumeko. Ryouta on the other hand is something of an audience surrogate as he\'s the most ""normal"" of any of the cast members in Kakegurui. People also say that he doesn\'t have much leverage in the anime, however LA begs to differ and he takes risks in many of Yumeko\'s gambles thus he has some bearing to the plot if not because of his choices being Yumeko\'s ultimatum the majority of the time. However Yumeko even trusting someone like Ryouta does bring up Yumeko as a symbol for the unlucky or poor thus able to shake the core of the student council and them trying to bring down or even make Yumeko\'s life a living hell.The animation by MAPPA is eccentric to say the least from overly exaggerated facial expressions LA told before, character designs are decent though it\'s mainly because of the nearly the entire cast are in red school uniforms, exceptions being Midari, Runa and Yumemi. Although LA saw some CGI work mostly on the games presented but nonetheless from the crazily exotic facial expressions, decent backgrounding and character designs and ok CGI work, MAPPA did pretty well on the animation department.As for voice acting, well LA needs to address this being Saori Hayami in Fukumenkei Noise as in LA did not like her voicing the main character of Nino, Saori Hayami\'s role here?...rejuvenated and got her acclaim back for LA for her role as Yumeko just........damn, why?, because Saori Hayami voicing Yumeko is one of her pinnacle playing against the type roles, her voicing as character who is a large ham, batshit crazy fanservicey girl in comparison to some of her more nice ojou-like girl archetype roles she\'s done. Yes, Saori Hayami was LA\'s favourite voice actor in this anime without a doubt. Aside from that, Mary\'s voice actor Minami Tanaka, Midari Ikishima\'s voice actor Mariysa Ise, Itsuki Sumeragi\'s voice actor Yuki Wakai and the student council president\'s voice actor Miyuki Sawashiro are highlights in this anime.Well as much as LA is praising this anime, but Kakegurui does have some faults, such as the predictability factor but like LA said LA already defended this flaw especially concerning Yumeko, several of Yumeko\'s rivals are stock evil though this includes some of the student council members as well though at least they get a bit of HOW they got into the student council, characters including from the main cast are bareboned in terms of development especially from the majority of the Student Council, Ryouta and especially Yumeko due to her mysterious nature and her static beliefs of gambling and finally the ending which was an anime original, was anticlimactic to say the least but LA says that although this was an anime original ending the message of ""fate"" was pretty solid but nonetheless the open-endedness of this ending just kinda stopped the plot right in it\'s tracks.Kakegurui is....quite a unique anime, for as it\'s not much of a gambling anime as a psychological anime aimed at both wanting the pleasure of the thrill of the gamble and breaking of societal structure all manifested by Yumeko Jabami. Does LA love this anime like Yumeko love gambling?...""love"" is a strong word due to 2 other animes succeeding LA\'s favourite animes for Summer 2017, batshit crazy as all hell and was thrilling to watch but it was entertaining nonetheless. Kakegurui isn\'t the best anime of the year let alone for Summer 2017, but like LA said at the start of this review ""Sometimes it\'s not whether you win or lose...it\'s the thrill of the game."" and even though Kakegurui won and lost in some elements but the thrill of the game was still a great-yet-batshit-crazy ride, not the best ride of an anime but a damn great yet crazy one. people to her side, lose and still win psychologically as well as Yumeko herself being a major hindrance Hyakkaou Private Academy\'s student council.The gambling aspect, well people will continuously say that it\'s a foregone conclusion that Yumeko will win every match she comes across and to that LA will say....did you even watch the anime?, Yumeko be it through rivals cheating, tying and even herself letting herself lose, well yeah Yumeko DOES LOSE but that is not what LA is getting at as for these kinds of animes, LA does have a simple rule of ""it\'s not the destination but the journey"", if the journey of Yumeko\'s results of winning or losing was entertaining then it did it\'s job and it did in LA\'s eyes at least and that is helped by it\'s crazy batshit aesthetics especially when it comes to the narmy looking facial expressions in the anime and sometimes genuinely unpredictable results.

Yes, Saori Hayami was LA\'s favourite voice actor in this anime without a doubt. Aside from that, Mary\'s voice actor Minami Tanaka, Midari Ikishima\'s voice actor Mariysa Ise, Itsuki Sumeragi\'s voice actor Yuki Wakai and the student council president\'s voice actor Miyuki Sawashiro are highlights in this anime.Well as much as LA is praising this anime, but Kakegurui does have some faults, such as the predictability factor but like LA said LA already defended this flaw especially concerning Yumeko, several of Yumeko\'s rivals are stock evil though this includes some of the student council members as well though at least they get a bit of HOW they got into the student council, characters including from the main cast are bareboned in terms of development especially from the majority of the Student Council, Ryouta and especially Yumeko due to her mysterious nature and her static beliefs of gambling and finally the ending which was an anime original, was anticlimactic to say the least but LA says that although this was an anime original ending the message of ""fate"" was pretty solid but nonetheless the open-endedness of this ending just kinda stopped the plot right in it\'s tracks.Kakegurui is....quite a unique anime, for as it\'s not much of a gambling anime as a psychological anime aimed at both wanting the pleasure of the thrill of the gamble and breaking of societal structure all manifested by Yumeko Jabami. Does LA love this anime like Yumeko love gambling?...""love"" is a strong word due to 2 other animes succeeding LA\'s favourite animes for Summer 2017, batshit crazy as all hell and was thrilling to watch but it was entertaining nonetheless. Kakegurui isn\'t the best anime of the year let alone for Summer 2017, but like LA said at the start of this review ""Sometimes it\'s not whether you win or lose...it\'s the thrill of the game."" and even though Kakegurui won and lost in some elements but the thrill of the game was still a great-yet-batshit-crazy ride, not the best ride of an anime but a damn great yet crazy one.', 'here\'s what i sincerely thought about this anime as I watched it until the end.It was entertaining. Simple as that. I been always a sucker for mind games and this setting of the school having one hierarchy based on gambling really caught my attention. That\'s what pretty much kept me on my couch watching it.As for the characters, I don\'t mind them being kinda kooky; In fact those exaggerated expressions gave the anime some great ridiculousness, but the fanservice wasn\'t really necessary; in fact, like most of the times, it\'s awfully cringy.The characters were ok? I mean I didn\'t get to love any but...at least some of them had some growth and ""decent"" amount of depth. I\'m only mad at how the most hollow-looking characters were nobody else than Yumeko Jabami, the protagonist, and Kirari Momobami, the antagonist. I would have enjoyed to see more of their stories and some development/relation of that with their personalities.SPOILER.My biggest complaint is with how it all ended. That last game wasn\'t enjoyable to watch at all; it was really hollow compared to the other ones. Also, with the stakes of losing, it didn\'t made the tie really enjoyable to begin with since pretty much nothing important ended up changing. And there were soooo many questions they left me with...Why the heck they were slightly leaving us to believe that Jabami and Momobami had any relationship since the start of the anime if they just never end up touching such subject? Why the heck would Momobami randomly disband the student council? did anything happened to that pet system?Even though I thought the ending was rushy and dumb, I still slightly enjoyed watching it to the very end. at least some of them had some growth and ""decent"" amount of depth.

Gambling for going deeper into madness. Gambling for the thrill of losing everything with one wrong move. This is what Kakegurui which literally translates to Compulsive Gamble is all about. In a way it is a love letter to gambling and the madness that entails it.Kakegurui starts out with the main protagonist, Jabami Yumeko, enrolling in Hyakkaou Private Academy. The academy’s most centralized of traditions is gambling as it helps their students who come from rich and influential families learn how to negotiate and read people better. Jabami Yumeko looks like an ordinary beautiful girl but all that changes...when gambling is involved. She suddenly becomes a sociopath that easily gets off from the thrill of gambling and becomes so enraptured in it that she can easily swallow those around her to take the bet with her. She can easily read all the possible tricks through deduction and all in a calm manner but she is by no means perfect as she can also lose even by luck.In the academy, the student council reigns supreme and imposes a tax law for the gambles. If the participants are unable to pay the tax then they become “livestock” which is basically the lowest of the lows in the academy’s social hierarchy. Since the students come from very well-off families, the amount of money being gambled start off at really high amounts and the debts can even go into the billions range. It doesn’t stop at just money as even more can be placed on the betting table.Watching Yumeko-san read her enemies and beat them is as fun as it is erotic since nearly everyone in the academy is nuts in one way or another but Yumeko takes the cake 40 levels higher than the limits. The anime is much more depraved and entertaining than Kaiji which is a gambling anime from a decade ago. It would be fun if the two ever meet in some crossover though most likely that will never happen.The characters are quite questionable especially the viewpoint main character Suzui, Ryouta, as he is quite the opposite of Yumeko-san and is the only truly sane person in the whole anime. The relationships between them are also quite odd and does not make much sense except for one of them who is just using Yumeko-san for their own ends.Gambling has never looked so animated before and I mean that in both a figurative and literal sense. The animation quality is so high that it easily trumps those action oriented anime to shame. This has been the most impressively animated non-action anime I have ever seen that is not done by the legendary KyoAni, so kudos to MAPPA. The level of art was also as equally impressive as the characters would show off their gambling faces which showed so much emotion and detail that it was downright disturbing. Even the iris had so much detail to it that I couldn’t help but wonder how much did the producers pay for this level of detail, though with Square Enix being one of them I wouldn’t really be surprised how they managed to achieve this quality. This animation style was the closest I have ever seen to be a match to hentai animation as I felt like I was literally watching hentai in many scenes. The level of eroticism in this anime is so prevalent that some characters got so wet and drooled so much, they were an open book. I can’t tell you how many times I have seen an ahegao (intense amount of sexual pleasure that is translated in facial expressions) in this anime, the frequency made this the number one anime of all time (to my knowledge) to have so many ahegao.The OST was also quite exceptional as they were very distinct and matched the mood so well especially at the height of a gamble. The opening was one of the most, if not the most, animated opening sequences I have ever seen. It didn’t take me long to guess what theme they were going for with the animation which is “devour.” Gambling can easily devour anyone, so the opening fits quite well with it. The ending was also fun to watch since it shows Yumeko-san’s descent (or ascent) into madness in a very erotic catwalk. The voice acting was also very well done as the characters felt so alive whenever they talked and especially when they showed their gambling faces. The most exceptional case was Hayami Saori’s voice of Yumeko as it was one of her most memorable performances ever.So if you are ever in the mood to watch a thrill, some gambling, or girls getting wet and show ahegaos in a non-hentai (or even hentai) way, then go ahead and descend into the madness that is Kakegurui.P.S.

It shines through its mysterious student council\'s characters.

It takes only a couple of episodes to figure out that the protagonist, Jabami Yumeko, is so badass that she\'s going to reach the top, and from then on it\'s only about ""hmm, let\'s see in which unpredictable way she\'s going to figure the puzzles out so she can emerge victorious from her encounters"".However, a strong suit is represented by the variety of games, even if this element becomes lackluster in the final part of the show when we\'re pretty much done with card games and maybe we\'ve enjoyed more something more different, like the mini swords game in episode 3.In the end, the entire experience of the show encapsulates its spirit quite well: it\'s a gamble. You know it can go wrong, but you watch it anyway for the thrill of it. And even if the final taste is a bit more sower than expected, the show was fair and square from the start with you.

I will buy the soundtrack when it gets released and I never buy soundtracks, but this one is worth it. The Voice acting though...oh my good Saori Hayami and Miyuki Sawashiro gave me chills throughout this entire series. They took a step out of their comfort zone and went with more Yandere-ish characters and they nailed it.Characters: Again back to the acting which played a huge role in this anime. The characters were a joy to watch. Can't really discuss more due to spoilers but Yumeko and Suzui have more of a Holmes and Watson relationship then anything else which is something I enjoyed.

a game of your choice, and come out either richer or much poorer than you were when you came in.\xa0 That\'s all good and all, but you want more, something to satisfy the gambling craving that you\'ve grown accustomed to.\xa0 So put on your big anime tiddies, brush back your long black hair, slap a metal ring on your left thumb, and prepare to ahegao, it\'s Kakegurui.Story: Hyakkaou Private Academy is a...peculiar academy.\xa0 In order to prepare its students for the important positions that they\'ll succeed from their parents, the school after hours turns...into a place for exchanging money and bets through cards, chips, and dice as students gamble away parts of themselves where, if they end up poor enough, are deemed as a \'house pet\' by the school, mistreated and bullied for their lack of status.\xa0 It\'s here where a new student by the name of Jabami Yumeko enters the fray of this dog eat dog world of gambling, showing the school and its student council that they let a fox in the henhouse.Following its original source material, Kakegurui follows the story of Yumeko (and Suzui too, I guess) as she gambles her way through various characters from small fry among the student body, to larger prey in the student council as she bets everything she has going up to the top.\xa0 Each few episodes is dedicated to a specific gambling battle with different opponents, games, and stakes tied to each of them with Yumeko ending up making a name for herself in the academy.\xa0 There\'s...just one problem with this.\xa0 It\'s not satisfying.The problem with Kakegurui is the fact that practically any and all stakes put down by any of the gamble\'s participants are...negligible.\xa0 With each progressive gamble, the show stacks up more and more money, higher and higher stakes to the point of even risking the characters\' own lives only to have nothing happen in the end.\xa0 If you plan to make such ridiculous sums, someone\'s gotta pay the price.\xa0 Yet at the end of the day, it never seems like the show wants to put anyone down, making the gamble pointless because no one pays anything.\xa0 Sure there\'re some things noted aftereffects, but there\'re so minor that it doesn\'t really matter.Despite that, the show manages to cover up these problems (sorta) by having an exorbitant amount of style and energy with its storytelling and pacing.\xa0 A majority of the show\'s screentime is focused on its gambles and the thought process between each gamble\'s combatants, making the overall viewing experience rather immersive due to how involved the show gets with its core battles and gambles that it advertises.All in all, Kakegurui is a flawed yet exciting piece of media that puts style over substance.\xa0 Indeed the show lacks a lot of storytelling quality due to the false sense of risk with the result of each gamble, making that up only through its efforts to try and make the actual event as exciting and orgasmic that it can possibly be.Overview:+ Exudes excitement and thrill-\xa0 Very few actual \'gambles\'Characters: The enigmatic vixen of the series, Jabami Yumeko comes in as the wrench thrown into the plans of the academy\'s student council.\xa0 Living purely for the thrill and excitement of gambling, Yumeko is an addicted freak with her biggest (and potentially only) trait to her character being how much she\'s willing to take a risk and the pleasure she takes from doing it.\xa0 While yes Yumeko is an entertaining and unique character, her addictive trait begs the question of really what her motives really are.\xa0 Acknowledging her as an enigma is interesting, but there\'s nothing else to her aside from wanting to bet her money or herself for poker pleasure.\xa0 What\'s more is that the show questions her motives through the usage of other characters, only to get no payoff at the end of the day because ""no one gets her"" so it kinda makes me wonder why the show even bothers trying to hint at a deeper more secretive part to her character when nothing really happens.Then there\'s Suzui Ryota, the beta male of the series and the customary \'explanation\' character for those unable to fully comprehend what\'s going on at the current moment of time.\xa0 Either that or there always needs to be a narrator character.\xa0 Throughout the series, we see Ryota following behind Yumeko\'s tail after a first encounter of the terrifying yet alluring nature of this strange girl, attempting to be the show\'s voice of reason and as mentioned before, narrator character to add an explanation to those that need it.\xa0 Quite honestly, there\'s very little else to tell about Ryota.\xa0 His role is surprisingly minimal for being the show\'s main male protagonist, and any connections/motivations he may have always tie back to Yumeko, so in a sense, he\'s just an extension of her character.As far as other cast members go, we have Saotome Mary, a girl who surprisingly enough, is affected by the backlash of debt and loss in a fairly big way (in terms of where in the story it happens), and the members of the student council where Yumeko challenges each one of them, increasing with position as the series goes on.\xa0 Members of the student council really don\'t have that much going for them.\xa0 Sure they hold the highest amount of power in the school, but each of their individual motives for having Yumeko fight them are quite shoddy and are sort of a one and done deal with each \'defeated\' member being forgotten so we can move onto the next.\xa0 There\'s not much investment for them, and the resulting end for the finale is such a cocktease that I\'m not even sure why MAPPA went for the anime-original ending where again, nothing really matters in the end.Overview:+/- Relatively interesting main protagonist-\xa0 Very little time investment for each \'opponent\'-\xa0 Male protagonist is just kinda...thereArt: Produced by MAPPA, Kakegurui is no doubt a show that lives up to its original source material.\xa0 Replicating the original manga\'s style, the show exudes a fluid style capable of distorting the appearance of characters, turning them demonic with scarily detailed faces, to its more casual style with everything looking more like a \'normal anime\'.\xa0 Its charm really shows in the art as the closeups and dramatization add to the overall hype of how the show builds up to the climax of each gamble.Despite that, the show has a few quality issues.\xa0 Particularly with the last few episodes, MAPPA seemed to have dropped the ball with quality checking the \'normal anime\' sections, as many times the art doesn\'t really have the quality or polish that its first few episodes had.\xa0 There\'s also a surprising lack of imagery from the anime, which honestly would\'ve fit the show greatly due to its affinity with seeing gambling more than just a game.Overview:+ Style matches up with the original in spades-\xa0 Later episodes show quality problemsSound: Sound...doesn\'t really need words.\xa0 Its opening ""Deal with the Devil"" is very reflective of the show\'s obsessive and even sexual nature as the stylistic opening showers us with imagery hinting at what\'s to come combined with an energetic and sassy jazz theme with its artist \'Tia\' providing alluring vocals to compliment the song\'s wild nature.\xa0 Definitely a memorable piece.In contrast, the show\'s ED, ""LAYon-theLINE"" by D-selections is a more celebratory piece with more expressive vocals relative to the show\'s OP by losing sexual appeal in exchange for the kind of pure bliss and euphoria achieved with winning a big gamble.\xa0 Personally, I don\'t think it\'s as good as its partner OP, but it\'s still something worth a listen to.It\'s also worth noting Hayami Saori\'s performance as Jabami Yumeko.\xa0 Her voice provided a perfect balance of the two faces of the main protagonist capable of going from sweet and innocent to obsessive and crazy at the drop of a dime.\xa0 The flawless transition made Yumeko even more enjoyable to watch and was honestly a really good performance worth mentioning.Overview:+ Memorable soundtrack+ Hayami Saori did a great jobPersonal Enjoyment: Kakegurui was...an interesting edition to my list.\xa0 If you ask me, the show screams \'fun\' more than anything else.\xa0 With all of the cheating asspulls and the no stakes yet still exciting gambles wildly happening on the screen, the show was certainly an immersive watch.\xa0 For a while.\xa0 The problem was the fact that the show felt too comfortable in its formula and the expectant result of a progressively scaling show like this really didn\'t excite me.\xa0 Sure Yumeko was getting wet, biting her nails at the prospect of seeing herself win it all or lose it all, but quite honestly, I just sat there like a dead fish in later episodes unable to feel the pleasure that she was having because of the show\'s repetitive nature.\xa0 To me, it was fine, but nowhere near anything worth the kind of praise it\'s been getting.Did I like this anime?Despite my personal criticisms, the show was still fun to watch.\xa0 Its early episodes had me enraptured in its formula, but too much of a good thing ended up spoiling the joy that I had with the series early on.What didn\'t I like about this anime?In terms of specifics, the last two arcs and especially the last episode were really, REALLY weak.\xa0 There was absolutely no payoff for either of those.\xa0 Nothing substantial actually happened and I felt rather aggravated knowing that I spent my time watching something that didn\'t even matter in the end.\xa0 That\'s not something you do to your audience.\xa0 Don\'t do that.Would I recommend this anime?Yes...and no.\xa0 Kakegurui is certainly worth a watch because it has the whole \'thrill\' aspect to it with its main protagonist going through the school making her spine tingle (among other things) with cards and chips, but it should not be taken as anything other than light entertainment.\xa0 With the main problem of \'nothing matters at the end of the day\', the only reason to even watch this is to have fun and watch something that prides itself in style over substance.\xa0 Cause if you plan on watching it and think about it too much...you\'re gonna have a bad time. into a place for exchanging money and bets through cards, chips, and dice as

there always needs to be a narrator character.\xa0 Throughout the series, we see Ryota following behind Yumeko\'s tail after a first encounter of the terrifying yet alluring nature of this strange girl, attempting to be the show\'s voice of reason and as mentioned before, narrator character to add an explanation to those that need it.\xa0 Quite honestly, there\'s very little else to tell about Ryota.\xa0 His role is surprisingly minimal for being the show\'s main male protagonist, and any connections/motivations he may have always tie back to Yumeko, so in a sense, he\'s just an extension of her character.As far as other cast members go, we have Saotome Mary, a girl who surprisingly enough, is affected by the backlash of debt and loss in a fairly big way (in terms of where in the story it happens), and the members of the student council where Yumeko challenges each one of them, increasing with position as the series goes on.\xa0 Members of the student council really don\'t have that much going for them.\xa0 Sure they hold the highest amount of power in the school, but each of their individual motives for having Yumeko fight them are quite shoddy and are sort of a one and done deal with each \'defeated\' member being forgotten so we can move onto the next.\xa0 There\'s not much investment for them, and the resulting end for the finale is such a cocktease that I\'m not even sure why MAPPA went for the anime-original ending where again, nothing really matters in the end.Overview:+/- Relatively interesting main protagonist-\xa0 Very little time investment for each \'opponent\'-\xa0 Male protagonist is just kinda...thereArt: Produced by MAPPA, Kakegurui is no doubt a show that lives up to its original source material.\xa0 Replicating the original manga\'s style, the show exudes a fluid style capable of distorting the appearance of characters, turning them demonic with scarily detailed faces, to its more casual style with everything looking more like a \'normal anime\'.\xa0 Its charm really shows in the art as the closeups and dramatization add to the overall hype of how the show builds up to the climax of each gamble.Despite that, the show has a few quality issues.\xa0 Particularly with the last few episodes, MAPPA seemed to have dropped the ball with quality checking the \'normal anime\' sections, as many times the art doesn\'t really have the quality or polish that its first few episodes had.\xa0 There\'s also a surprising lack of imagery from the anime, which honestly would\'ve fit the show greatly due to its affinity with seeing gambling more than just a game.Overview:+ Style matches up with the original in spades-\xa0 Later episodes show quality problemsSound: Sound...doesn\'t really need words.\xa0 Its opening ""Deal with the Devil"" is very reflective of the show\'s obsessive and even sexual nature as the stylistic opening showers us with imagery hinting at what\'s to come combined with an energetic and sassy jazz theme with its artist \'Tia\' providing alluring vocals to compliment the song\'s wild nature.\xa0 Definitely a memorable piece.In contrast, the show\'s ED, ""LAYon-theLINE"" by D-selections is a more celebratory piece with more expressive vocals relative to the show\'s OP by losing sexual appeal in exchange for the kind of pure bliss and euphoria achieved with winning a big gamble.\xa0 Personally, I don\'t think it\'s as good as its partner OP, but it\'s still something worth a listen to.It\'s also worth noting Hayami Saori\'s performance as Jabami Yumeko.\xa0 Her voice provided a perfect balance of the two faces of the main protagonist capable of going from sweet and innocent to obsessive and crazy at the drop of a dime.\xa0 The flawless transition made Yumeko even more enjoyable to watch and was honestly a really good performance worth mentioning.Overview:+ Memorable soundtrack+ Hayami Saori did a great jobPersonal Enjoyment: Kakegurui was...an interesting edition to my list.\xa0 If you ask me, the show screams \'fun\' more than anything else.\xa0 With all of the cheating asspulls and the no stakes yet still exciting gambles wildly happening on the screen, the show was certainly an immersive watch.\xa0 For a while.\xa0 The problem was the fact that the show felt too comfortable in its formula and the expectant result of a progressively scaling show like this really didn\'t excite me.\xa0 Sure Yumeko was getting wet, biting her nails at the prospect of seeing herself win it all or lose it all, but quite honestly, I just sat there like a dead fish in later episodes unable to feel the pleasure that she was having because of the show\'s repetitive nature.\xa0 To me, it was fine, but nowhere near anything worth the kind of praise it\'s been getting.Did I like this anime?Despite my personal criticisms, the show was still fun to watch.\xa0 Its early episodes had me enraptured in its formula, but too much of a good thing ended up spoiling the joy that I had with the series early on.What didn\'t I like about this anime?In terms of specifics, the last two arcs and especially the last episode were really, REALLY weak.\xa0 There was absolutely no payoff for either of those.\xa0 Nothing substantial actually happened and I felt rather aggravated knowing that I spent my time watching something that didn\'t even matter in the end.\xa0 That\'s not something you do to your audience.\xa0 Don\'t do that.Would I recommend this anime?Yes...and no.\xa0 Kakegurui is certainly worth a watch because it has the whole \'thrill\' aspect to it with its main protagonist going through the school making her spine tingle (among other things) with cards and chips, but it should not be taken as anything other than light entertainment.\xa0 With the main problem of \'nothing matters at the end of the day\', the only reason to even watch this is to have fun and watch something that prides itself in style over substance.\xa0 Cause if you plan on watching it and think about it too much...you\'re gonna have a bad time.', 'The is probably one of the prettiest mediocre shows I have ever watched. it\'s one of those anime I wish I could have liked more, but I know it\'s been done better in the past.And it\'s sad, Kakegurui has all the elements to be a great show. It\'s intro has our main Jabami going trough a buffet with a fork and knife and all the meals on the table are the opponents in the show. as if she actually means to devour them. great visualization and a very addictive song.Jabami herself is a very interesting character. while underneath her gentle and polite exterior hides...a near psychotic and highly intelligent gambling addict. ultimately she means well. winning or losing isn\'t her concern, She\'s she loves the feeling of ""risk"" that comes with gambling and respects people who throw away their logic and sensibility for that feeling of risk. wether she wins or loses she\'ll look upon anyone who can give her a satisfying experience as a friend.Sadly I don\'t have much to say about the rest of the characters or villains. most of em are very run of the mill or one trick pony\'s.then again the music and visualization in the show is phenomenal, the bright glowing eyes, the shadows, the overly superior smacktalk, the ugly and distorted gamble faces the characters make when they\'re losing it, On that note! I\'m also very surprised that Kakegurui is brave enough to depict it\'s female characters with the ""ugly"" gamble faces. also Orgambles...many many... Orgambles.I\'d say the only thing where it falls flat is keeping the tension high. the first...8 or so episodes really build up the ever increasing stakes of the gambles in question but then it reached a point of stagnation where they couldn\'t go any further. because once gambles revolve about life or death you can\'t really go any further. and anything after that feels underwhelming.just as an example; you can\'t follow up a game of Russian roulette, with a regular poker game in which a loss means getting expelled from school. You could almost call this the ""power-ceiling"" for gambling, and unless you can figure out creative way\'s to make the ""lesser stakes"" really mean something for your story things start to become boring really fast.Which is why I still hold Akagi and Kaiji in higher regard as the more superior gambling-anime. a near psychotic and highly intelligent gambling addict. ultimately she means well. winning or losing isn\'t her concern, She\'s she loves the feeling of ""risk"" that comes with gambling and respects people who throw away their logic and sensibility for that feeling of risk. wether she wins or loses she\'ll look upon anyone who can give her a satisfying experience as a friend.Sadly I don\'t have much to say about the rest of the characters or villains. most of em are very run of the mill or one trick pony\'s.then again the music and visualization in the show is phenomenal, the bright glowing eyes, the shadows, the overly superior smacktalk, the ugly and distorted gamble faces the characters make when they\'re losing it, On that note!

The started off slow but one's emotions started to rise and the cheating was explained I was invested.I wanted to see how the comeback would happen for either character. And though I dislike the school setting and how almost every main character is low-key crazy, I did really love the way the psychology was expressed. The ecstacy of winning (though it did get a little too sexal...at times) or the meltdown from losing. The inner thoughts. All of that made for very interesting matches in games that I did not understand. I also liked the character opposites of Ryota. Yumeko being a gambling addict who doesn’t care if she wins or loses and Ryota being the common sense questioning (and being amazed) by her every single time. The main point of this anime is the psychology/mystery and not knowing if Yumeko will actually win or how. Also I love watching how she is always calm and how razzled her opponents get. The betrayals, bluffing, reverse psychology, and so much more keeps the watchers on the edge of their seats.Cons: I think the school setting for this is too unrealistic and makes it hard for me to become immersed. Also, the fact that this is a school but we see no teachers or actually class, except for the 5 second introduction makes this even more irksome to me. In my mind there were a variety of different settings (specifically with adult characters) where this would’ve fit better. I mainly have an issue with this because the punishments that happen for losing, such as planning the loser’s marriage and pregnancy to a creep, is a little much. Or a character being able to walk around and gamble with a gun with 1 bullet as the gamble. If it was just kept to bullying/school servitude I probably would have liked the setting more. Also, all the characters are very one-dimensional- they’re all crazy. This makes Yumeko less interesting, especially because we know that she is going to have a crazy gambling moment, her opponent is going to be spawned to have a crazy moment, and Yumeko is most likely going to reveal their cheating method. The reveals are fun, but it is all so monotonous. The only one that isn’t is Ryota. There is not a single sane character besides him, and besides one other from this large cast he is the only other male. This is a co-ed school but even most of the background characters are female, except when they do a quick full room shot. There were a few more males in S2 but stillAnimation:The animation is mostly pretty solid, for the main characters at least. This is one of those anime where you will experience a lot of slack on background characters, even if they’re on screen for a good amount of time. For example, there was this one episode about group gambling to swap bets and you could see a stark difference between the two important characters at the table and the two background characters that were used just for this plot device, but since they were on screen this long they should’ve gotten the common decency of things like eye shines and not basic flat shading. Even someone who has not watched the anime would be able to look at a screenshot and be able to tell. Also, there are scenes, such as when they grab cards and it just shows their hand, that it looks like they changed the animation to CGI or something to make it delicate, but to me it just looked off. Now the next thing is personal opinion: I did not like how detailed the animation would become for the scenes where the girls go crazy. The eyes and facial expressions were epic, but I felt like it morphed a little too much at times. And all of the sudden their usually flat colored hair would show all the strands, etc. I felt like the style changed a bit too much in these scenes compared to the normal scenes, but others may have loved it. I loved the eyes but the other parts were a bit much. I like the style to remain mostly consistent. I did like the overall designs of the characters, except that it wasn’t consistent with the eyes. One character having stars, some characters having pupils, the shading etc. But that is personal opinionOverall: I think that this anime was too sexual for a shounen, not as in actual scenes but with how excited the women sometimes get with their squirming, self touching, and flushed faces. But this is a shounen so I’m sure it is trying to appeal to young boys with that, but I think it is more appropriate for a seinen. Also I stated how I feel about the setting being in a school. I won’t go into detail about settings I think would be better, but with the amount of psychological problems and the extreme risks of some games (having an eye gouged out, possibly being shot, being sold into a marriage from debt) was just way too much for a ‘private high school’. The psychology and mystery of the series was on point though, but there was just too much of every character being crazy one way or another, aside from Ryots and Mary was actually pretty normal compared to the rest. Also, though I liked the psychology the whole thing was pretty repetitive.With all that I give this a 6/10 because though the psychology was good the cast was very monotone and I could get immersed in the game but not the setting. at times) or the meltdown from losing.

We could have peace, we could have progress, but in the world of Kakagurui, what the world needs was... gambling. Apparently.Right off the bat, Kakegurui slams us to a semi-futuristic world where apparently the world is in crisis for having too much money by how much students flaunt their fortunes for a round of game. It is such a ridiculous premise and kinda sound stupid but i was intrigued ofcourse. We meet our main character, the glamourous Jubami Yumeko and almost immediately get in a battle of wits...and luck against a classmate. With a world where power comes in the ability to gamble well, this was like a really bonkers kind of shonen. By the end of the episode, our heroine outwits the opponent and then we learn that the show is about this ludosexual girl who plays to hustle out and outwitting those who dare cheat their way and with that, it was hook, line and sinker.With how the show went on, it felt like a thriller that makes you guess what sort of stupid faces the characters will do during their gambits. So much of the joy from the anime comes just watching the faces as these depraved gamblers battle in out in increasingly absurd gamble games and their eventual fallout due to Yumeko's insight, kinda similar to why i love the Ace Attorney series. Not only that, but because of the gambling aspect of the show, i knew for sure some deus ex bullshit is just around the corner which YugiOh thrived in. I didn't care. I liked YugiOh. The show did throw some curveballs by having Yumeko lose every now and then but the fact remains that bullshit is inevitable.The characters are variants of bitches, assholes, crazies, degenerates, with  Yumeko being a mixture of them all depending on the situation. There are barely any heroes in the show...just people being at their worst to win the upper hand. There is the main guy who was the audience insert, the defeated allies, and the ridiculously powerful student council that serves as hurdles to Yumeko as well as having the dynamics of shonen villain groups. The thing however is, despite the characters being so fabulously hammy and dynamic, Yumeko herself has no meaningful development but remains the wild, unpredictable schemer that our villains have to mess around with.Artwork was great. The characters all look like models, with most girls possessing some of the best animated lips ever, and some sexual bits as well. Yes, the show is sexy and boy does it raise the temperature to the roof sometimes. Yumeko's obsession with gambling is literally orgasmic for her and it shows. Even one of the villains play hide the cuckoos nest with a gun. Most importanty, the facial expressions stuck with me the most in the show and many of which deserves to be memed.Sound was great. The OP and ED were both unskippable due to how groovy and eyecandy they are. Yumeko's voice was heartstoppingly sexy and the villain voices are cheezily fun to hear as well. Overall, season 1 was far and beyond superior to 2nd season in terms of soundtrack.The show is fun, ridiculous, and cathartic. I do not recommend watching it with family though cause things will get steamy. This show is like YugiOh, Saw, Death Note, HxH mixed together with a dash of Miru Tights. If you want a villain vs villain type of show, this may scratch some itch.Binge watch it. The first season was definitely easy to finish.

I started to watch XX and the idea board me due to the feeling they were going for a money grab, pumping out more episodes that did not relate at all to the original direction that...the show was going.Overall, I would highly recommend to a casual viewer. There were a couple more problems that all Netflix anime has, such as I feel they tried to tone down some of the psychotic elements compared to other psychological thriller anime, but they did a great job on the characters, story line and theories with every game which is hard to do while appealing to such a large audience. the show was going.Overall, I would highly recommend to a casual viewer.

However when mixed with unpredictable and uncanny characters it makes it more intriguing.That alone, makes it enjoyable to watch. Adding more to this, the plot in each episode aren\'t as predictable as the characters (especially the protagonist) may make it seem, which what makes this a psychological anime.Overall, I mainly find...the enjoyment in this anime from it just making the gears in my head spin.

I just love it hear it all the time I don\'t know why. I am kinda like addicted to that song. The name of that opening is ""Deal with the devil"". I guess. I am not sur about its opening\'s name.

And amazing concept!', 'After watching the first seven episodes of Kakegurui, I decided to drop it and I don\'t feel like I can recommend this show.We watch anime for entertaining purposes, it can either be about a beautiful story, epic battles, funny adventures, cosy slice of life moments etc... In the case of Kakegurui, it\'s hard to understand what the story is trying to accomplish, or I rather should say, it\'s hard to find another goal beside showing fanservice scenes, different kind of weird kinks etc...There are many different things that make it hard for the viewer to believe those world\'s settings. There isn\'t any kind...of logic regarding the rules that dictate the characters\' life, a gambling school where enslavment is authorized, and bullying is encouraged up to the point where rape is tolerated ? And we are supposed to believe that the kids at this school all come from rich and influential families, alright, remind me again why would any parent allow their kid to get into this school/torture camp ? The fact that this plot revolves so much around money is pretty weird as well, because on the one hand, we are supposed to believe that money is of the utmost importance for students, but on the other hand, the anime doesn\'t adress how the students get their hands on those ( insanely huge ) sums of yens. We get it, rich kids are gambling a lot of money but since it looks like they can bet millions of yens without giving it some thought, how are we supposed to be impressed by those huge numbers ?I mean, it\'s an anime, logic can be bent, it\'s a work of fiction after all, but here comes the disappointing part : with all those crazy rules, one might expect an unique story with high stakes moments etc... but after watching the first episode, well you\'ve pretty much seen the whole season.Every episode follows the same rhythm : the overpowered MC Yumeko gambles against the most cliché antagonist one might think of, the mc will feign that she is struggling at first only to ""make"" a comeback while disclosing the trick her opponent tried to use against her. You can add some fan service scenes here and there, and that pretty much sums up every episode, at least up to the seventh one.Therefore, the events are predictable, which makes it even harder for the viewer to care about this unbelievable story.All in all, this anime doesn\'t have a lot to offer, aside from fanservice scenes that usually depict teenage girls getting aroused by gambling stakes or some unusual kinks. To qualify this review, I have to reckon that regarding the technical aspects, this anime does have a good animation and a nice cast of talented seiyus, but that\'s about it. The plot is absolute nonsense and the antagonists are forgettable. If you enjoy shows that contain a lot of fan service, you might enjoy this, otherwise, you\'ll probably be disappointed and/or cringed by this show. of logic regarding the rules that dictate the characters\' life, a gambling school where enslavment is authorized, and bullying is encouraged up to the point where rape is tolerated ?

If you enjoy shows that contain a lot of fan service, you might enjoy this, otherwise, you\'ll probably be disappointed and/or cringed by this show.', 'This is obviously not a seriously-written story, in fact it\'s rather shallow and flawed. Since the show isn\'t that hyped up or highly rated on here I don\'t feel compelled to convince you, but I will anyway. On the other hand, the show does attempt to say something and through its depth alone in that sense I would consider it way more meaningful than the average popular romcom or shounen. I would find it very ironic for people to call this repetitive, shallow or weak (and they do, for very solid reasons regardless) but then go on to rate certain other shounens and isekais highly....I keep comparing Kakegurui to that category because in essence, to me, this is quite literally a shounen about gambling. A narrative about an invincible gambler taking on a different opponent every episode replaces the usual shounen narrative about an invincible fighter taking on every villain in the world. This can naturally get quite repetitive, but I have to say it was pretty entertaining, especially having the blessing which is being able to skip through the episodes whenever the content was too cringeworthy.What Kakegurui gets right, which in turn makes it entertaining: style, certain ideas gambling-wise and story-wise, and a certain progression. Although you can easily skip certain episodes without missing on anything particularly important about the story, you feel their purpose whilst watching. You know the effects of Yumeko\'s matches will be far more immediate than the average Naruto battle, for example. You know there are only a few elite opponents, which are presented beforehand most of the time, thus giving the whole situation a sense of belonging within the universe and content of the show. The narrative is, however, quite simple, in this sense. In that Yumeko takes down the student council members one by one (quite predictably) in a well-paced progression. Each such occurrence is fairly entertaining due to some of the characters\' style (Yumeko seems specifically designed to attract not only her opponents but also the viewers) and the gambling games, all of which are either complex or allowing for complex mind games. I didn\'t really get the rules all of the time, it was pretty vague in my opinion, but I always got an idea of how the participants will fuck each other over mentally, which is exciting albeit a bit predictable already.Speaking of predictability, we have to touch upon the show\'s flaws in a critical review and sadly this does have a lot. Most of the ideas from the paragraph above usually present themselves with a caveat; the realism and quality of the story are not great, as the show prefers the trade-off of having insane yet entertaining characters instead. The first flawed aspect of the show is the story itself. The premise is ridiculous: a school like that existing, and a teenager such as the student council president possessing so much power is simply not a viable starting point for any mature show. This might be a spoiler from the second season but they basically say that that position controls not only the school, but the nation itself through all its connections. I don\'t really have a problem with this entertainment-wise, but as an adult you can imagine that I noticed from the first second that this isn\'t a viable story.Then, of course, this elite and elitist school has this gambling thing going on, which a reasonable adult viewer should have an issue with, too. These kids\' parents got to where they are in the world exactly because they didn\'t gamble their winnings in the first place. The show is trying to say that this society\'s mentality is that the kids should learn how to lie, deal with and dish out mind games, profit off others, learn how to handle money etc etc. Even if it could be reasonable that certain elites want to teach their kids this stuff, the high stakes are too big a loss for this already debatable purpose. They\'re gambling billions, or even their lives. It\'s just not realistic in a capitalistic society. Of course, gambling on lower stakes would not be as entertaining, but even then I think it wouldn\'t be a viable premise, because the parents would have the obvious insight that their kids will get addicted to gambling (which they do) which is very dangerous. The show even illustrates this, very clearly. In any case, again, this works as a sort of comedic, entertaining shallow show for some other reasons, but let us not act as if it\'s well-written.Still, Kakegurui isn\'t meaningless. Every episode it is quite clear what the show is trying to say: gambling corrupts people. Already through how extensively the show tackles this theme it is far deeper than the average anime... and yes that is a very low standard. This didn\'t come without flaw: their ugly portrayal of characters\' expressions were overly edgy, repetitive and overall needlessly included way too many times. We get it. Gambling has made these people ""ugly"". I\'m too old to be watching kids think they are cool, like in the average anime. So the first 5 times were understandable and needed in order to show the theme they\'re going for clearly. There was no need for every character to be like this. Sure, you may say, of course they must all be like that if they\'re getting a high status in the ""gambling universe"" of this show. That may as well be one realistic aspect of this show, but this time, entertainment-wise, it wasn\'t a great choice. Everyone feels the same, acts the same, represents the same thing.The show attempts to develop characters further. We get certain characters\' backstories beyond just that they like gambling - such as the nail collector freak. This reminded me of a shonen very clearly. Just as our girl Yumeko fights these guys, their stories come to light, and we\'re supposed to care about them. Wrong! Character development sure is good in a story, but your characters are trash regardless so please don\'t try to make it a character-oriented show! Sorry Kakegurui! The designs and personalities are ridiculous. Yumeko - stereotypical as hell through her looks, seductive mannerisms, certain fanservicey actions, not to mention her unrealistic intellect, memory and of course the classic story of a transfer student coming into a school in anime and wreaking havoc. The president - what the hell is her design? Stuff such as the characters\' designs and personalities are the quickest indication of how mature a show is. It\'s laughable in my eyes to even suggest that these kids are mature geniuses yet still have them act in these edgy ways, not to mention going to the trouble of using blue lipstick. Can you imagine the president, the way she is, taking the time to care about the appearance of her lips to match with her eyes? Come on... I\'m waiting for years for anime to become more oriented towards adult watchers such as myself, yet it seems not even a show about gambling can achieve this. All of this ridiculously childish stuff obviously being done for the hype factor, edginess and shallow attractiveness for less-than-intelligent teenage masses is still the reason I\'m embarrassed to say I watch anime.And that is just my reaction to the designs. Don\'t get me started on their personalities. Weird, weird psychos. Who the fuck gets scared or thinks it\'s cool when Runa, a kid dressed in a furry onesie, acts all edgy on screen and her face gets shriveled up? Certainly not me but clearly these girls way older than her believe a lot in her authority... I\'m... the opposite of impressed. I don\'t even think my teenage self would\'ve thought this is cool. So most of the time when these kids even attempted to be cool, let alone their freakish outbursts (e.g. the hipster, Yumeko, nail collector, Mary) I had to laugh it off in order not to vomit from how cringeworthy it was. Jesus Christ man. We get it, gambling destroys your psyche. Beyond showing this, the anime is trying way too hard to be cool and edgy and it\'s not working, although the sort of dark vibe overall is cool.In any case, none of the characters have any sort of realistic quality, really. I\'m not so easily impressed as to think the traumas they try to show are in any way above average, original, or interesting compared to the average anime character. I appreciate the attempt though. In any case, this is one of the many shows that derails from the main storyline in order to show us this stuff, which is a mistake: we decide to watch your show for the main storyline, the interesting intrigue and premises and how they develop. At most, we care about the mains if you do put effort into making them special, but that is also because we know they are important characters in the story. With these side characters... I can never care. They aren\'t important, and everything about them which is not part of the main story (e.g. Yumeko gambling with them) is an unnecessary, uninteresting detour. So the show wasted a lot of time in my eyes that could\'ve been used to develop a better story. Because it wanted to be character-oriented, and make us care about each opponent, like in a shonen. Which is a bad, bad structure for a 12 ep show in my eyes!The president isn\'t a particularly interesting villain due to the reasons mentioned and also because her dreams are weird. Supposing that she does indeed get this ridiculous power (and monopoly on power) over not only the school but basically the nation itself - I guess her intention of experimenting with humans is understandable, or even cool, but you can\'t get used to the idea that she does have this amount of power. Somehow, she still falls a bit flat; viewers can\'t care about her motivations because they are basically on full display from early on, the motivations don\'t change and don\'t have any immediate effect. Everyone saying that Yumeko and the pres are so similar also doesn\'t help - we know Yumeko, so if you show that so clearly... we know the pres too. Her design is weird, she speaks weird, with no energy or much of interest to say; if anything, her dialogue is quite stereotypical for a villain. And specifically an edgy powerful ""mob boss"" teenage girl. The only cool thing about her was indeed her strength at gambling, but in the end it was barely shown.The gambling games each episode were cool, viewers can get into them, just that this quite episodic, quite formulaic execution is a bit unintriguing not to mention non-intricate. From the first episode you can basically guess that Yumeko will win most of the time and get to fight the president (the outcome of which is 50/50). The fact that she wins practically all the time and seduces everyone around her into giving her what she wants was overkill. We get it, that seduction was a decent theme and it makes sense the ""compulsive gambler"" would use that to her advantage, but come on. If it succeeds every single time... are you even trying to spread an anti-gambling message? If anything, with all of this, combined with all the edginess and trying to make people look cool (in a twisted way) while being compulsive gamblers is almost glorifying how horrific gambling addiction is. Don\'t you feel that? It\'s kind of a contradiction, I know, since I said the show is also trying to show how ugly the effects of gambling are, but I still feel that the show is trying way too hard to make the characters look cool as well.Thus, I cannot really respect its story as anything serious or well-written, and the less said about the characters, the better. The entertainment comes mostly from the gambling itself, seeing what the mains get up to which can be intriguing at times. This is, for one, a merit of making your MC extremely over the top (as Yumeko is) - we can feel at least a little bit intrigued about what she will get into next. Everything else is sort of secondary, of bad quality as described, and so I usually skipped it, such as these weirdos\' backstories and psychotic episodes.All in all, it was more entertaining than I\'d expected, but nothing too impressive writing-wise, which makes me wonder what was really the source root for my enjoyment. Some cliches and games, I guess i enjoy. Still, any reviews saying it has no redeeming qualities or deeper theme it attempts to illustrate, are false. Kakegurui quite clearly portrays the ugly effects of gambling on different types of people, their motivations in that sense, how they do it and how low they stoop. This is the most significant way in which the characters\' personalities differ (and the show does include several types of different-feeling personalities which is good): why they gamble and what effects it has on them, which I felt was sufficiently realistic (even the freak that seeks the thrill of death through gambling). The execution of this and of the storytelling is decent, with stuff happening at a good pace such that viewers don\'t get that bored, at least in my experience. Since enjoyment is by far the most important aspect to rate a show by, I have no issues giving this a positive rating despite everything happening in the story being largely unrealistic. It also did not feel too repetitive as there were always new games and new opponents to play. I keep comparing Kakegurui to that category because in essence, to me, this is quite literally a shounen about gambling. A narrative about an invincible gambler taking on a different opponent every episode replaces the usual shounen narrative about an invincible fighter taking on every villain in the world.

It doesn’t make it a good show necessarily, but it sure is breathtaking.A show about gambling is hard to pull off, or any show about games for that matter. You have to have the talent to be able to explain the rules, the stakes, and the aura surrounding the game without sounding boring like a rule book.I won’t be the first to admit that Kakegurui is not for everyone, most people will simply see it as an over-exaggerated and bizarre piece of media. While in reality, it’s a hidden...gem. Sure the art style is unique and menacing at some points, however, that just adds to its appeal. I haven’t seen a show like this and it made me really pay attention to the screen. Additionally, compositing and all of the 3D scenes were done splendidly. Talking about art, what a wonderful OP, and the rest of the sound, I was feeling the emotions through the scene simply due to the sound. But the BIGGEST plus of the show is the THRILL. Oh my goodness I can’t praise this show enough for how well it managed to explain the games and the cheating without making it boring, I found myself feeling like a character trying to figure out how one character or another is manipulating the game, it really pulls you in. The last 3 episodes were my favorite, I was leaning in after episode ten betting my males, the enjoyment, and the stakes made this so much more exciting.However, you can’t have a rainbow without rain. To have a really good show you have to sacrifice some aspects. This anime lacked character development. I couldn’t connect whatsoever. The protagonist lacked reality, and some of her actions made her look a bit too powerful. You can’t connect to characters without weakness or at the very minimum explanations for their abilities or drive.Non the less Kakegurui was a hell of a ride.

I know that it was intentional, but for me this exaggeration of emotions, gambling and game thrill was way too over-the-top and made the anime way less enjoyable to watch. Honestly, watching anime girls orgasming and destroying parts of their body is a pretty questionable way to spend your time.But...I must say, I really enjoyed the idea of survival of the fittest and the way the weakest students stop being seen as humans, it neatly adds up to the unsettling vibe of the show.

I think everything else made up for it. There were a lot of intense scenes and action that definitely filled the gap.ART 10/10The art was incredible for this series. Sometimes when nothing was going on, it was a bit dull, but I found that contrasted well with the main scenes and especially when the characters would get a sort of feature moment hahSOUND 9/10...I really liked the sound for this series, they chose perfectly the effects. And the music was well chosen, I escpecially enjoyed the songs they sang. The one thing was that some effects were a bit repetitive, but not a problem at all.CHARACTER 9/10I really liked the characters in this series. Now, I know that they didnt really have a lot going on apart from the main storyline/ not much backstory, but it would have been hard to fit it in with such a dramatic series. I hope that if further seasons occur (past season 2) they touch on backstories more. I also found Ryota really dull. I know he wasnt really the focus of the story, but he was very basic and had no interests whatsoever, it seemed like he only existed. I mean, all he did was be Yumeko's friend and somehow he was the class president, despite not really seeming super hardworking.ENJOYMENT 10/10Amazing series. 10/10 chef's kiss. bravo.cya later kids I really liked the sound for this series, they chose perfectly the effects.

Now, I know that they didnt really have a lot going on apart from the main storyline/ not much backstory, but it would have been hard to fit it in with such a dramatic series. I hope that if further seasons occur (past season 2) they touch on backstories more. I also found Ryota really dull. I know he wasnt really the focus of the story, but he was very basic and had no interests whatsoever, it seemed like he only existed. I mean, all he did was be Yumeko's friend and somehow he was the class president, despite not really seeming super hardworking.ENJOYMENT 10/10Amazing series. 10/10 chef's kiss. bravo.cya later kids"", 'Kakegurui is the best gambling content that I\'ve watched or read ever including ""The Gambler"" by Dostoevsky. It portraits gamblers perfectly. It\'s too exciting to watch even though sometimes they cheated to provide that. Animations aren\'t the best but they are pretty good actually especially in making gamblers look disgusting. I like the rules and themes. I don\'t know if they did it on purpose but a few times I stopped the anime and calculated the possibilities myself and every time, except the last game, the person that statically in favor won the game I simply love this. They don\'t over-explain everything often but when...they do it generally occurs very unnaturally. Gambling scenes are excellent but I\'m not a fan of school politics and it has so much screen time. Overall Kakegurui is an exciting and entertaining anime. they do it generally occurs very unnaturally.

The entire series is a smashing success thanks to Saori Hayami’s voice. Not joking, her amazing, crazily erotic voice is what makes this show as entertaining than the typical knife brandishing psycho show. Though I did enjoy School Days. The ludicrous, over-the-top edgelord type of stuff would be written off as another Deadman Wonderland if it weren’t for her voice … wait, people actually liked that show, didn’t they?• So, I guess it’s a smart marketing move!

I give Kakegurui a 4/10.', '**Small spoilers ahead, but mostly for the fan service***I don\'t review stuff, but I feel like someone who has seen a lot of gambling anime should give my take on the show.So, I\'ve been a fan of gambling anime for a while now. I had seen it all, Kaiji, Akagi, One Outs, Legendary Gambler Tetsuya etc. So when I heard Kakegurui was going to be the new jaw dropping, nail biting gambling experience in anime form for us gambling fans I was pretty excited.Man, was I wrong.Let me get this straight from the start, Kakegurui isn\'t bad it\'s just...tainted. It\'s tainted with cringey fan service,...it\'s tainted with weird sexual facial animations and people have orgasms over gambling that are, once again, fan service, it\'s tainted with dumb characters, a weird plot, fan service everywhere. It\'s one of those animes that normal people think of when they think of anime.I\'ll give a quick run down of the story, but it\'s basically about a girl who comes to this rich school that makes their students gamble and if they lose too much they become a ""housepet"" which is just like being a slave to the other students. You\'re treated like trash and in some cases have your entire lives written out for you down to the smallest detail so that you\'d be able to pay back the school whatever you owe them if you can\'t currently. (Such as getting married, being a housewife and having three kids before you\'re even 30)If you have good taste and have seen/read Kaiji or Akagi, then you\'re probably dismissing this as trash and, you\'re right to do so but I wouldn\'t say to completely disregard it. The good part of this anime is still that the gambling is quite interesting (at least to me), and while you know Yumeko is going to win you want to see how she\'s going to win, if she\'s going to cheat or if there\'s going to be a random turnabout that no one saw coming (in a similar way to Akagi), the music is surprisingly good as well (well, not the OP and ED those are awful), it\'s not Kaiji/Akagi tier (but who could beat Tanuchi?) but it\'s good in its own right and surprisingly Yumeko as a character is actually a bit interesting due to being unpredictable in ways. Sadly it all boils down to one thing as a viewer.Can you stomach all the fan service?Okay, maybe I\'m implying that the show is like 5 minute of gambling and 15 minutes of fan service for the whole show, but it\'s really not. Instead you\'re getting fan service being thrown in for no real reason at random intervals. One episode had the main character pretend to be a cat, get down on all fours and start meowing after she became a housepet for the first time. Another episode had her and some random idol start singing on stage together for a minute and a half, and man the amount of times people sensually whisper in each others ears while blushing is too much.It\'s just confusing and cringeworthy stuff. Imagine if in Kaiji, he started to dance whenever he won a gamble and pretend to play an air guitar, it\'s just weird and ruins the mood of the show.To add onto this, the plot barely deals with anything like death or loss of body parts (well one episode had her betting her fingernails). If you lose, the worst thing that could happen to you is becoming a housepet and having your life written out for you, and it\'s not even that bad since in many cases you can just pay off the debt because, surprise surprise, you\'re the kids of rich people (although many of the debts are very very high and are too much for the parents, it\'s still POSSIBLE to pay off the debts). If you\'re the kind of person who wants there to be a big consequence behind the gambles instead of just gambling for fun, then you\'re not going to enjoy this even if you do find the gambles interesting.Yumeko as a character is like a watered down Akagi, she\'s kinda unstoppable and is gambling for pleasure more than the feeling of total destruction and I will admit that I do enjoy her being unpredictable and them smiling in the face of the loser, but on the flip side she\'ll always so a weird sensual thing of facing the character head on with glowing red eyes and telling them to ""pay up"" whereas Akagi never gave a crap and would\'ve left by now.  The side character whatever his name was is just some dude who I guess the viewer is meant to represent and does nothing but tell Yumeko ""No don\'t gamble :(((( "" if anything he should\'ve been the main character. I\'d rather see him go up against impossible gambles and cheat his way out of it a la Kaiji.To sum it all up, pick one out that you feel represents you.1) Have you seen Kaiji, Akagi, One Outs, Tetsuya and read a whole array of gambling manga, are you here for the gambling?Give it a shot, you might enjoy it. The fan service is awful, but the gambles in of themselves are interesting. Well, if you don\'t already work out the cheating behind some of them.2) Have you seen the above, but want a show that\'s thrilling, nail biting, jaw droppingly intense?Give it a pass, sorry man but you\'re not going to like this. The gambles mean very little, and the fan service just worsens the whole experience.3) Have you see the above, and can stomach fan service?Give it a watch, if you enjoy fan service, this show is chocked full of it along with gambling.4) Have you not see the above, but want to watch some gambling?Stop what you\'re doing, and watch Kaiji because that\'s the superior gambling anime, with One Outs trailing behind for people who don\'t know Mahjong. This show barely touches what makes gambling so great.5) Did you actually look at/watch Kaiji/Akagi and think ""Damn, this artstyle is ugly, and the story is boring, man this is awful""?Yeah, this is your anime right here. You\'ll enjoy this stuff 100%.6) If you\'ve truly got nothing to watch, and like gambling?Give a few episodes a go, you\'ve got nothing better to do if you\'ve seen it all and just want to see something new, it might be your thing.Now of course, everyone has their own opinion on this stuff. Maybe I\'ve missed the point of what has made this great, maybe I\'m comparing it to a masterpiece and in comparison it sucks. Who knows, personally I don\'t think Kakegurui is bad, the art is nice, the music is good, the gambles are fun to watch (mostly) but it\'s just not as good as other gambling anime out there that you could spend your time watching. If you\'ve got nothing else and think 12 episodes is worth your time, go for it, otherwise if this is your fist gambling anime or Kaiji is still on your ""Going to watch"" list, do yourself a favour and watch Kaiji instead. it\'s tainted with weird sexual facial animations and people have orgasms over gambling that are, once again, fan service, it\'s tainted with dumb characters, a weird plot, fan service everywhere.

Otherwise, you just have a bunch of set pieces and events, but no direction to them."", 'Kakegurui is a poor man\'s gambling anime. Despite luring you in with the promise of high stakes and exciting mind games, the series ultimately fails to deliver on either of those essential fronts. If you watch this series like me expecting it to have either of these qualities, you\'ll get spat out its 12 episodes feeling dejected as an anime fan on prom night.Each gamble in this series is a fight for survival, represented by bets that inflate at a comical rate. Characters constantly wager their lives for some slim chance at victory, creating a fleeting illusion of tension. Unfortunately, no matter how much money...is put on the line, Kakegurui fails to make any of its games feel meaningful whatsoever. Threats of bodily harm and indentured servitude are repeatedly thrown out, but the series is completely unwilling to flirt with its main protagonist losing in any meaningful way. Yumeko\'s near-supernatural gambling abilities make victory a guarantee in every situation, with even her technical losses still benefiting her in some regard. When the audience realizes that the story would effectively end if Yumeko truly lost, they come to realize that any and all wagers are a mere formality obfuscating an inevitable victory. Nothing is on the line because nothing truly matters.Despite its complete lack of real narrative tension, Kakegurui still holds the allure of watching its overpowered protagonist steamroll through cocky opponents with some quick thinking. Even in this department, the series still mostly fails. Rather than allowing viewers to follow Yumeko\'s internal thought process, the narrative repeatedly opts to present only her conclusions with fairly little to justify them. Much like an unsatisfying mystery, Kakegurui believes it\'s more important to shock the audience with unpredictable twists and turns than actually respect their intelligence enough to drip feed clues. The writers often attempt to elicit an ""aha!"" moment, but instead can muster little more than a ""sure, I guess."" These tendencies reach their worst form when the pretense of strategy is dropped for pure displays of luck. When the characters choose to believe in the heart of the cards and hope that luck is on their side, the last inkling of intrigue is drained from this shallow battle of wits.Ultimately, Kakegurui is the perfect gambling anime for people who those that lack the patience and attention span to watch a better series such as Kaiji. The characters are bland, the payoffs are immediate, and very little brain power is necessary to work through each episode. Aside from conveying the mental derangement necessary to enjoy the masochistic elements of gambling, nothing is really learned by the end of this non-thrill ride. The worst part of the series is that never dares to be truly be outlandish and wild, leaving it squarely in the valley of forgettable anime. There are plenty of perfectly enjoyable dumb-fun shows that deserve your time far more than this bland display. is put on the line, Kakegurui fails to make any of its games feel meaningful whatsoever.

I deliberately say \'weeb\' because of the type of fake ""dominant"" women and weak ""feminist"" males who were the heroes of the series. They were trying to support these heroes with the illusion of them being smarter than the highly respected first-class business-world players they are to be taking life lessons for, but being an ex-poker league player- the scenarios were poorly conceived: mainly focusing on there being a ""clever"" cheat to be discovered and photographic memory, instead of actual intellectual gambling strategy which would have made each episodic scenario much more fascinating. There was...little character development of the main characters, instead a repeat of the same episodic structure over and over swapping out different antagonists and game types. The inevitable loss of each egotistical antagonist became boring, especially since their never ending spoilt money pool made the risk so small and the idea that they would have their VIP lives planned for by mere students laughable, and I become desperate for either a) the main hero to get ****ed on in order to go through a much needed character arc; or b) for us to stop being so weak with the fan service and just get around to ****ing on the card table already so we can at least thinly praise it for being well animated hentai.

Sorry!', ""Hello everyone! This is my first review on MyAnimeList so I will try to express my thoughts the best I can.Now, I understand that people are not gonna like this but hear me out. Kakegurui is a bad anime that sadly did not live up to the standards that great gambling animes uphold.Here is why.Story: 2/10The thing that is probably most at fault for Kakegurui's failings is the story. Yumeko is supposed to be the catalyst of change for Hyakkaou Private Academy. She is presented as the one who is going to break the hierarchy upon which the students function. The issue with this is...that it is done in the most lazy, predictable way possible.Every ''gambling match'' is predictable to the point of being formulaic. Every match goes like this:1. Yumeko decides to battle someone who is set up to be powerful and unbeatable (but they actually are not).2. The gambling match begins. The rules of the game are ''explained'' to the viewer in a contrived manner.3. Yumeko starts off playing casually, making a few mistakes a long the way. This makes her opponent feel overly confident.4. As it looks like her opponent is about to win, Yumeko reveals the big ''secret'' of this match. For example, she has a secret strategy, she finds out someone is cheating etc.5. Yumeko does ''the crazy face'' which makes the opponent realise how ''crazy'' she is.6. Yumeko wins and her opponent goes crazy.10. Match ends with Yumeko explaining how she was able to win to Ryuota as an excuse to dump some exposition onto the viewer.This is more or less how every episode goes which undermines the very purpose of what Yumeko's character was supposed to be. There is no weight to any of her actions because she is so over-powered in comparison to everyone else. This ''scary'' hierarchy is not so scary anymore once it becomes clear that Yumeko will win every battle with no effort. This takes any and all excitement/ suspense out of the story. You know who is going to win every single time, so can it even be considered ''gambling'' anymore at that point?One more issue I have with the story is the setting. Hyakkaou Private Academy is supposed to be school that can only be attended by the rich children of politicians, businessmen etc. My first issue is that this setting seems very artificial.There is no time where the students are actually learning, being taught by teachers etc. The only thing these students ever do is chatting and gambling. I can not stress enough how lazy this is.Now I understand that this show by no means has to be ''realistic'' but the setting has to be believable! Do you really expect me believe that an academy would allow their students access to an underground dungeon that can be used as an interrogation room? NO! Do you expect me to believe that Midari can wave around a gun at school without any consequences? NO! Do you expect me to believe that the parents of these children place the value of gambling above that of their academic achievements? NO! With all of these unanswered questions the show becomes extremely more frustrating to watch.Art 7/10This is probably Kakegurui's one and only strength. The designs of the characters are really fun and the overall look of the show is quite aesthetically pleasing. The animation is also fairly good but it's a shame that the animation is only really allowed to shine when the characters ''go crazy''.Sound 5/10For me, nothing about Kakegurui's sound design was memorable. The show is already suspenseless as it is and the sound effects do not make it any better. The musical score is fine but nothing extraordinary. I personally do not like the opening either but I know that is more subjective. Overall, its mediocre.Character 3/10Oh boy... where do I even begin? There is not a single likable or even sympathizable character in this show. First, let me talk about something that applies to all characters and then I will talk about a few of them individually.First off, it seems like all the characters were born from the ''rich kids problems'' memes. It's hilarious to me how characters like Kirari and Manyunda can take their roles as student council members sooo seriously knowing full well that the only reason they have their success is because they have their parent's money to back them up.Every character has a bland personality with very weak, arbitrary motivations that by no means justifies their shitty behavior. All I can see when watching this anime is pretentious children gambling away money they did not even earn themselves, with no regard for the consequences, while trying to leech off of their parents who actually worked for their positions in life.And as a small side note, the whole ''character goes insane'' thing is so overdone and gets more boring each time. It's almost as if every character is just a slightly altered version of Yumeko that are all bat-shit crazy.Now I will briefly talk about some characters individually.Yumeko.Yumeko is an extremely dull and annoying character. Every time she gives a little ''motivational'' speech to one of the other characters I can not tell whether she is being genuine, or if she is just a manipulative asshole that pretends to be friends with everyone to emphasise her ''god-like'' status in the school. She also never has to face any real consequences for her actions.Despite being a mittens for the majority of the show, she is almost never treated like it. This undermines this supposed ''oppressive'' nature of the hierarchy at the school.RyoutaHonestly, why is he even here? This simp can not help but stick himself onto Yumeko every chance he gets and he has no personality beyond that. He is there as a vessel for exposition dumps. Nothing more, nothing less.MidariOk let me get one thing out of the way. The voice-actress for Midari is fantastic but the character she is voicing is awful. Every time she came on screen she made me feel beyond uncomfortable. She is given very maniacal and psychotic character traits for no narrative purpose other than the fact that she needed to be ''edgy''. Not to mention her constant over-sexualised behavior (this counts for all the other female characters as well) is just there for shock value/ fan service and is gross to see cause it's clear that the characters are most likely under the age of 18. I had to skip so many scenes with her in it because it was just too awful.One last thing, the fact that they made her a suicidal maniac is degrading and insulting. The reason for this being that there is no purpose or meaning behind it. Suicide being the extremely difficult subject matter that it is should be handled in a way that would give meaning to the story. Kakegurui does nothing but romanticise Midari's suicidal tendencies at least to some degree. I am not saying that this was necessarily intentional but this is how it came across.MaryI honestly feel like she is the most decent character in the entire show. The only one that goes through at least some sort of change/self reflection but this is still sloppily executed by the show itself. Instead of exploring Mary's arc further, they use her as a puppet to explain how the gambling games works to the viewer.Enjoyment/overall: 3/10I was not invested at all at any point in the story. The gambling matches were stripped from any suspense or tension due to their formulaic nature. The gambling games were needlessly complicated because the show wanted to pretend to be smart. The characters are horrible, the soundtrack is mediocre and the setting is plain childish and stupid.Overall, this show is fundamentally broken in so many aspects which made for a very dull, unemotional watch. This was a waste of time and I will not waste my time any further my watching the sequel.If you made it this far, thank you for reading.xoxo that it is done in the most lazy, predictable way possible.Every ''gambling match'' is predictable to the point of being formulaic. Every match goes like this:1. Yumeko decides to battle someone who is set up to be powerful and unbeatable (but they actually are not).2. The gambling match begins. The rules of the game are ''explained'' to the viewer in a contrived manner.3. Yumeko starts off playing casually, making a few mistakes a long the way. This makes her opponent feel overly confident.4. As it looks like her opponent is about to win, Yumeko reveals the big ''secret'' of this match. For example, she has a secret strategy, she finds out someone is cheating etc.5. Yumeko does ''the crazy face'' which makes the opponent realise how ''crazy'' she is.6. Yumeko wins and her opponent goes crazy.10. Match ends with Yumeko explaining how she was able to win to Ryuota as an excuse to dump some exposition onto the viewer.This is more or less how every episode goes which undermines the very purpose of what Yumeko's character was supposed to be. There is no weight to any of her actions because she is so over-powered in comparison to everyone else. This ''scary'' hierarchy is not so scary anymore once it becomes clear that Yumeko will win every battle with no effort. This takes any and all excitement/ suspense out of the story. You know who is going to win every single time, so can it even be considered ''gambling'' anymore at that point?One more issue I have with the story is the setting. Hyakkaou Private Academy is supposed to be school that can only be attended by the rich children of politicians, businessmen etc. My first issue is that this setting seems very artificial.There is no time where the students are actually learning, being taught by teachers etc. The only thing these students ever do is chatting and gambling. I can not stress enough how lazy this is.Now I understand that this show by no means has to be ''realistic'' but the setting has to be believable! Do you really expect me believe that an academy would allow their students access to an underground dungeon that can be used as an interrogation room? NO! Do you expect me to believe that Midari can wave around a gun at school without any consequences? NO! Do you expect me to believe that the parents of these children place the value of gambling above that of their academic achievements? NO! With all of these unanswered questions the show becomes extremely more frustrating to watch.Art 7/10This is probably Kakegurui's one and only strength. The designs of the characters are really fun and the overall look of the show is quite aesthetically pleasing. The animation is also fairly good but it's a shame that the animation is only really allowed to shine when the characters ''go crazy''.Sound 5/10For me, nothing about Kakegurui's sound design was memorable. The show is already suspenseless as it is and the sound effects do not make it any better. The musical score is fine but nothing extraordinary. I personally do not like the opening either but I know that is more subjective. Overall, its mediocre.Character 3/10Oh boy... where do I even begin? There is not a single likable or even sympathizable character in this show. First, let me talk about something that applies to all characters and then I will talk about a few of them individually.First off, it seems like all the characters were born from the ''rich kids problems'' memes. It's hilarious to me how characters like Kirari and Manyunda can take their roles as student council members sooo seriously knowing full well that the only reason they have their success is because they have their parent's money to back them up.Every character has a bland personality with very weak, arbitrary motivations that by no means justifies their shitty behavior. All I can see when watching this anime is pretentious children gambling away money they did not even earn themselves, with no regard for the consequences, while trying to leech off of their parents who actually worked for their positions in life.And as a small side note, the whole ''character goes insane'' thing is so overdone and gets more boring each time. It's almost as if every character is just a slightly altered version of Yumeko that are all bat-shit crazy.Now I will briefly talk about some characters individually.Yumeko.Yumeko is an extremely dull and annoying character. Every time she gives a little ''motivational'' speech to one of the other characters I can not tell whether she is being genuine, or if she is just a manipulative asshole that pretends to be friends with everyone to emphasise her ''god-like'' status in the school. She also never has to face any real consequences for her actions.Despite being a mittens for the majority of the show, she is almost never treated like it. This undermines this supposed ''oppressive'' nature of the hierarchy at the school.RyoutaHonestly, why is he even here? This simp can not help but stick himself onto Yumeko every chance he gets and he has no personality beyond that. He is there as a vessel for exposition dumps. Nothing more, nothing less.MidariOk let me get one thing out of the way. The voice-actress for Midari is fantastic but the character she is voicing is awful. Every time she came on screen she made me feel beyond uncomfortable. She is given very maniacal and psychotic character traits for no narrative purpose other than the fact that she needed to be ''edgy''. Not to mention her constant over-sexualised behavior (this counts for all the other female characters as well) is just there for shock value/ fan service and is gross to see cause it's clear that the characters are most likely under the age of 18. I had to skip so many scenes with her in it because it was just too awful.One last thing, the fact that they made her a suicidal maniac is degrading and insulting. The reason for this being that there is no purpose or meaning behind it. Suicide being the extremely difficult subject matter that it is should be handled in a way that would give meaning to the story. Kakegurui does nothing but romanticise Midari's suicidal tendencies at least to some degree. I am not saying that this was necessarily intentional but this is how it came across.MaryI honestly feel like she is the most decent character in the entire show. The only one that goes through at least some sort of change/self reflection but this is still sloppily executed by the show itself. Instead of exploring Mary's arc further, they use her as a puppet to explain how the gambling games works to the viewer.Enjoyment/overall: 3/10I was not invested at all at any point in the story. The gambling matches were stripped from any suspense or tension due to their formulaic nature. The gambling games were needlessly complicated because the show wanted to pretend to be smart. The characters are horrible, the soundtrack is mediocre and the setting is plain childish and stupid.Overall, this show is fundamentally broken in so many aspects which made for a very dull, unemotional watch. This was a waste of time and I will not waste my time any further my watching the sequel.If you made it this far, thank you for reading.xoxo"", 'absolutely dreadful show. not only is the gambling aspect so dry as the main character has nothing to lose and lacks any emotional value, but the mc is the most obnoxious sounding piece of shit ive ever seen in anime.also holy fuck the cast of characters is horrendous and do not support the show at all. the writing is sub par and the only good thing i can say about this show for sorry losers that rate shows 10/10 because of the appauling fan service is that the animation is fairly good but used on a trash show.This show lacks everything, good characters, good...plot etc. if you are looking for a gambling anime to watch i do not suggest  this pathetic show only losers with the brain capacity of a 2 year old will enjoy. plot etc. if you are looking for a gambling anime to watch i do not suggest  this pathetic show only losers with the brain capacity of a 2 year old will enjoy.', ""Fucked up original '''''ending'''''.Also their lazy concept of 'I don't know how to depict psychopath gambling-addicted girls so just mess up their faces' annoys me.Sound and characters were great, I enjoyed show until their fucking 'ending'.So, overall, I enjoyed this show but I would never recommend this.Since I can't tell you guys what story is so you still have hope(you might like the ending)Fucked up original '''''ending'''''.Also their lazy concept of 'I don't know how to depict psychopath gambling-addicted girls so just mess up their faces' annoys me.Sound and characters were great, I enjoyed show until their fucking 'ending'....So, overall, I enjoyed this show but I would never recommend this.Since I can't tell you guys what story is so you still have hope(you might like the ending) So, overall, I enjoyed this show but I would never recommend this.Since I can't tell you guys what story is so you still have hope(you might like the ending)"", 'I found this anime as I was looking for horror - this was classified as ""psychological"", close enough. It turned out to be..A crazy over-the-top gambling show with some caveats, which I\'ll list!- There\'s some real ugly faces!- Most of the cast, especially the main gambler, are totally bonkers, ludicrously crazy, really hard to empathize with. And so is the premise by the way - a school where gambling is everything, and people literally become slaves to others when they lose a gambling game!- The main gambler is inhumanely flawless, noticing every cheat instantly and producing the perfect counter out of nowhere. She\'s also ludicrously...lucky, relying on RNG and lucking out very often. Conversely, we as the audience are not given any clues to even try to keep up, so when the reveal comes at the end, there\'s no feeling of ""oh that makes sense"", we just have to accept that main gambler caught all that.- People are betting gigantic wages, even betting their lives, but almost never is there any consequences. Owing money means nothing, being a slave means nothing, losing a career means nothing. The gun-episode really hammered that in. Either there are no consequences, or it\'s a tie.- It moves really fast, idk if it was good or bad.BUT there are also many good things!- The aesthetic is unique and fitting I find, I felt very jazz. :D And the design and sound fits in very well!- I love how the main character is a side character in his own show. xD He even grows a bit!- I like the idea behind most of the games. Some of them are really quite interesting!- I was fairly satisfied with the ending, and the fact they didn\'t reveal everything to the audience.It\'s not a full conclusion, there\'s a s2 apparently, and it\'s kinda needed I think.

The premise is interesting enough, a school where all gambling is central to the power hierarchy. It would have been interesting to me if it really was all about chance in the end. Unfortunately, there is a lot of trying to make up science behind gambling to justify people being in the right spot for the story. This was to the point that it was difficult to suspend my disbelief. Especially when (spoilers) physical violence, poison and etc. are  included. It just got to the point where I didn't know...why some disgruntled student had not staged a strong arm takeover. My last big issue was the pacing. I watched the whole thing at 1.5 times the normal speed. For most of the time it sounded like normal pacing at that speed.There were some redeeming qualities however, despite my disagreements with the show, I still found myself watching the whole thing. The ability for students to cheat with only consequences after the cheat has been exposed. There was also the Vice President, who I think is the most interesting character is the show. Probably because we know almost nothing about her, and she doesn't seem to really care about gambling like everyone else does.In the end I think it would have been more interesting to me if the writers decided on a coin flip who would win what game and then have to figure out how to tie it all together. Oh and if you came for the way the girls get worked up on gambling, you are better off watching Konosuba. There you can watch Darkness get crazy for punishment in a way that doesn't make you cringe or look over you shoulder praying that your roomate/mom/gf/whatever comes in. why some disgruntled student had not staged a strong arm takeover.

What may look like a gambling show becomes more about the game than the stake.Kakegurui is NOT a gambling show, it is a show about thrills and decite . The main characters wishes to enjoy the thrill in its purest, unadulterated form, (to a hornylistous extent) and hate those who would manipulate such an experience for their own gain. That is the same reason why she gets other people to experience the rush of gambling in its original form, a pure game of chance,  instead of the one made by...this school whose purpose is to benefit one player at the cost of others and teach the player to cheat in life.Throughout the story, the main character is confronted with a great many people, who all try to twist the preferred game in their own way to achieve equally twisted ends, only for our main character to come in and destroy all that by taking what is a unequal game tilted in one player's favour, and turn it into what it should be, a game of chance.Again, kakegurui isn't about GAMBLING STAKES, it is about the rush and about ejoing a game the right way, or at least that's my shit take, maybe wrong cuz I am exhausted. this school whose purpose is to benefit one player at the cost of others and teach the player to cheat in life.Throughout the story, the main character is confronted with a great many people, who all try to twist the preferred game in their own way to achieve equally twisted ends, only for our main character to come in and destroy all that by taking what is a unequal game tilted in one player's favour, and turn it into what it should be, a game of chance.Again, kakegurui isn't about GAMBLING STAKES, it is about the rush and about ejoing a game the right way, or at least that's my shit take, maybe wrong cuz I am exhausted."", ""I was excited to see this anime finally, after getting through some of the other things on my list.I found Kakegurui from a friend who cosplayed Yumeko and was obsessed with this for a while.

I love how they explain the games or how gambling works and the views of it, it makes this anime more interesting. The only reason I didn't give this a...10 or 9 is just because of a few of the empty-ish characters that look to have more potential but aren't given enough time to show it, and I also feel some things (don't want to give spoilers ), could've been used in another episode and happened too fast but you can really only ask for so many episodes in an anime before it could just drag things out too much. 10 or 9 is just because of a few of the empty-ish characters that look to have more potential but aren't given enough time to show it, and I also feel some things (don't want to give spoilers ), could've been used in another episode and happened too fast but you can really only ask for so many episodes in an anime before it could just drag things out too much."", ""A bit of a spoiler in this review. I'll start right away.

She got kidnapped out of nowhere.The art is good. The Saotome Baka scene has good animation and so does the whole series overall.The sound has nothing wrong with it either.The characters, though. I mean, almost everyone that Yumeko beats is literally the same, extremely obsessed with...gambling and goes crazy when they lose. Midari is a character with a different personality then the others, so she's a good example of a good character, well if you like psychopaths of course..I do like how they make the female characters more badass more than the male ones, because many anime's portray the female characters as weak and emotional.It was boring at some times so I skipped some stuff, I enjoyed it at some moments but normally I'd sit and look at my phone while watching cause nothing fun really happened.Well.

Please also note that I haven´t read manga and even tho I have seen both seasons, I will review only the first one here.I will say now that this review can be triggering to gambling addicts. The series talks about gaming addiction. Also, gambling can´t solve money...problems. The series left the overromanticizing portrayal of gambling addiction and of gambling as a whole.  Please remember that.Do you like gambling for the thrill of it and not because you can get ""easy"" money out of it? Then the show is for you. I and my siblings play poker to what hose work someone does and it gave new gambling ideas. And cool games isn\'t even all of that. Super cool lesbians? you got it. (where are all our bi/lesbian girls?)The story was refreshing. Regular school anime with really cool twists and not your normal romance stories. Also, I think Kakegurui did a good job showing hierarchy and what all money can get you, but also that money is not stable, so you have to have strong personality traits as an addition. I can\'t really come up with any minuses, as for now.I think the art was outstanding for this anime. Those semi-realistic eyes and those facial expressions. It surely was a bold way to go. And I think this eye-catching choice gave the anime the spice it needed.I usually don\'t talk about sounds but I loved the intro song. Please listen to it.  Deal with the Devil- Tia.  Thank you.So, on to my favorite subject- characters. I know how hard it\'s to write a good character and I think they did it very well. Almost all of them had their dreams and even their personality disadvantages. Only Ryouta Suzui didn\'t have any personality traits. He could as well not exist there, it would have been literally the same. But I understood that he was there for the people to relate to someone. Kakegurui also surprised me with this really good character development. So I give them extra credit for it.Overall I really enjoyed the anime. It was fun to watch and those games seemed entertaining. I will be testing the games on my friends, who don\'t know the anime, and see what they think. Kakegurui was visually pleasing and I really loved the characters. I recommend you to watch it.I will give it 9 problems.

You have to suspense your disbelief otherwise you will be scratching your head a lot. I did not find he gambling in this series to be dramatic or thrilling because the main character, Yumeko gambles not to necessarily win but simply for the thrill of it. That alone kills most of the suspense. The games are generally very simple, but the show goes out of its way to stretch an inch into a mile. The same thing goes for their deductive reasoning. They try to make it more complicated than it...really is to fill in for time or for more dramatic flair. I also recognized that for a majority of the games, one party is cheating. it gets old very quickly and it ruined any suspense I would have. A lot of these games boils down to luck, but since the more important characters have plot armor, it feels less like luck and more like because the author wrote it that way which I very reminscent of yugioh. The game on episode 12 was extremely simple and anticlimatic.ArtThe best thing about the series is the great artwork and animation.SoundThe opening and ending themes are nice.CharacterWhen it comes down to it, a lot of the characters are very one note (most of them are deranged or otherwise illogical). They are one note, but exargerrated to the point of absurdity. Logic has little to no room in this series. The main male lead is incredibly bland, but I guess he is the straight man in this sea of eccentric people. It feels like the author went out of their way to inject a lot of absurdities into chracters just to make sure the readers are paying attention or to give the series more flair. It feels less organic and more shoehorned in.EnjoymentThe production values are great, but the story and characters are mediorce. It is such a simple concept but it is streched way too far. The games do feel a bit repetitive and the one in episode 12 is by far the least climatic. The gambles feel less like luck and more like asspulls. The stakes are not overly dramatic as well, so the thrill is watching the players deducing what their opponent is trying to do. Even that gets repeitive and contrived the further the story goes along.OverallThis series suceeds in some departs but stumbles in others. The plot is streched way too thin and you really have to suspend your disbelief. The artwork and music are great but the characters and story is not. More eye candy than anything really. I think it is a mixed bag so not the easiest thing to recommend unless viewers want to see something that is mostly flash but lacking in substance. really is to fill in for time or for more dramatic flair.

Make an enticing story, with content enough for 12 full episodes with nothing lacking?I to be honest dont know how they did it, but they did. The main reason for my perfect score is that I personally found nothing wrong with this. I enjoyed every single episode, nothing was too slow paced for me, nothing felt cheap or they didnt drop budget mid way through. There were constant twists and turns that despite the mc...seeing, you wont be able to tell because of being in the position of the viewer. If you come into this with no fantasies about what it should be, not to be a simple critic, you WILL enjoy it as long as you are psychologically adept. It isnt so much of a big brain anime, but you have to be able to understand small things that might fly over the normal viewer.I hate giving spoilers as well, including character names and story progression, so i will use the point based system relatively.The story leaves nothing behind while being relative enough to progress you from episode 1 to 12 without being lackluster anywhere. The ending of course leaves room for the next season, there is questions left to be answered, but the story is complete and actually enticing. It makes you want to watch the next episode to see exactly what will happen because there are so many what ifs, and even if you think you know, youd be suprised by what happens.The Art is purrff for me. The stylization of this anime because of lack of action focuses heavily on portrayed emotions and bodily visuals. As wierd as that might sound, from the hundreds of anime I have seen, this was unique. And they have a single contrasting element that they incorporate a lot in this that I found stunning every time. Its really powerful to say the least.The sound... The op is more than enough to give this a 10 alone. But they really emphasis the little things in this. Again with a lack of genuine action that is what is necessary. So unlike stupid sounds or out of place music and ambient sounds, this has none of it. But the op is really amazingThe characters are to each their own. And I really like that despite discrepancies in agreeable decisions, the characters move along with each other the best ways possible. I dont find them to be too much like any other visually or personality wise that you find yourself comparing them throughout the entire anime. I also didnt see any big archetypes in this except for the big burly bully, but that was also handled well based on the story of the anime.That being said my point system is really probably on a scale of 1-15, but the reason for that is the hypercritical people and the way the point system is viewed by those who are coming to see if an anime is actually worth watching. a 7 will turn somebody away just because it seems like it wasnt enjoyed by a lot of people, like a 3.5/5, but that really isnt the case. imagine when you see a game rated 3.5/5, that sounds pretty bad and that is a very good perspective that you can visualize easily. But thats why I give this a 10. I thoroughly enjoyed this and binged this completely within the time i had between the two days only because i needed to sleep and had my little brothers party. I really recommend this at any point in time, its a good fit if your looking for a pick me up or just something thrilling, because itll pull you in and make you feel the excitement for gambling no matter how you feel. seeing, you wont be able to tell because of being in the position of the viewer.

Lots of 'gotcha' plot twists. In literally every game. Scarcely does she wins game in a satisfying manner. Absurdly edgy, almost to the point of parody. Mary was the only well written character with a multi-dimensional personality.I was expecting some deeper meaning revealed or some great truth of human nature exposed by the end of the series. This never happened. Any glimpses we see of the long term devastations of gambling addiction are either glossed over or ignored, and the fish tank analogy, while good, doesn't really go anywhere beyond making a statement.A political game of little...significance. The political hierarchy of the school is absurd, and the student council are merely figure heads with the ultimate purpose of falling to Yumeko one at a time untill she reaches the student council president. The meaning to all of this, is non-existent, seen most clearly in the frustrating 'final boss fight' where neither player seems interested in the outcome. In fact, the entire last episode was aggravating. The suggestion that Yumeko cheats, the obviously marked card, Ryouta recklessly picking a card, and the laguhable suggestion that the all the characters are great friends now... It's all so vile. I was able to over look a lot in this show, but expecting me to believe that everyone is friends and there's no hard feelings is unrealistic and ridiculous. significance.

Everything she says sounds witty and naive, erotic and childish at the same time. ""She is mad crazy"", it\'s what everyone says when they have to play against her. She is crazy, indeed, for gambling, risking it. The anime itself could be defined as crazy, but in a stylish and entertaining way. I haven\'t read the manga, so I will simply judge the anime.Story: 7The plot is quite simple. It keeps you always entertained, but ""nothing much"" happens.

I also really liked that the characters were mostly girls and they were all interesting but very...cool at the same time, I think that they weren't made to be sexualised, they were made because they take up the whole cast. I love that our supporting lead male, is not useless, perverted and annoying but a person who shines his own way because of his patience i guess.. and kindness for the most part.I LOVED the music direction they went for, i also loved the animation and the art style. Everything was very easy on the eyes and could be watched very naturally. I liked the 'psychotic' scenes and its animation, I think they were an interesting take.I think i recommend this show for people who are definitely in it for the thrill and just fun!

I’m sure you’ve seen some of the characters, they are very attractive and have relatively nice body types. This is not all though, throughout most of the series there are sexual scenes to the point where (Spoilers)[You can see a character, Midari, pleasuring herself in the school bathroom to the thought of yumeko](Spoilers end) This all counts as the...sexualization of schoolgirls, keep in mind all these girls are in high school, although it definitely doesn’t seem like that. For this reason I rate the show a 6, most of it is hot girls.Pushing that aside, the plot is pretty good, and the show is entertaining and thrilling to watch.

Her personality is inconsistent and poorly developed. The other characters are stereotypical and lacking charisma, and their games often rely on trivial tricks or arbitrary rules. Furthermore, it can be said that all the characters are the same, as they all share the same obsession with gambling and a sadomasochistic attitude towards it. None of them think or...behave differently, despite being in a school with hundreds of students. How is it possible that all the students have the same personality without any nuance?The anime only shows exaggerated expressions and orgasmic reactions of the characters while playing, without creating any tension or suspense. Additionally, for a series centered on gambling, there is no real tension because the only thing at stake is money, which has no value for the wealthy academy students.I have nothing against gratuitous fanservice, quite the opposite! But in this anime, it\'s excessive. It\'s as if every twenty seconds, they remind you that the students are going through a hormonal storm, as if you could have forgotten that fact.""Kakegurui"" fails to meet expectations and, in my opinion, boils down to a series of senseless erotic scenes. In the anime, they couldn\'t achieve a good mix of emotions, which should have been the series\' strength. Excitement, fear, and risk are excellent ingredients for creating a captivating and engaging work if used with skill and balance. Transitioning between these emotions is easy and intriguing, especially with gambling involved, as it can quickly shift from joy to sadness and even excitement. However, those behind this production don\'t know how to create atmosphere and tension or make the characters and situations believable and interesting. Despite having these three factors as a foundation, they failed to deliver anything good.The drawings and animations are well taken care of but this really isn\'t enough to save a work. Another positive point I would say is the opening which has a very catchy song and the video in which you seem to be going on an ""acid trip"" I love it, but I don\'t remember the various pieces of music that make up the soundtrack of the opera (I was probably too busy seeing girls\' orgasmic reactions)In conclusion, ""Kakegurui"" is an anime not worth watching as it offers nothing original or appreciable apart from the characters\' orgasmic reactions, but if you want to spend some time watching a very banal, well-animated ecchi without thinking, I highly recommend it. behave differently, despite being in a school with hundreds of students.

Another positive point I would say is the opening which has a very catchy song and the video in which you seem to be going on an ""acid trip"" I love it, but I don\'t remember the various pieces of music that make up the soundtrack of the opera (I was probably too busy seeing girls\' orgasmic reactions)In conclusion, ""Kakegurui"" is an anime not worth watching as it offers nothing original or appreciable apart from the characters\' orgasmic reactions, but if you want to spend some time watching a very banal, well-animated ecchi without thinking, I highly recommend it.', 'This show for me is I love it but I also absolutely hate it, there are a lot of unneeded  parts thrown in too make it feel like a non stop borderline hentai without the nudity, lots of lesbian sussy, and just annoying male characters, the emotion was really good but then became a little too much at times, still not too bad In my opinion, the series was alright. Story wasnt unique or anything crazy the gambling aspect was kind of bland, No story at all.Pros:Great AnimationOstFemale CharactersCons:No storymale characters...overly horny for gamblingId reccomend it, but at the same time I dont overly horny for gamblingId reccomend it, but at the same time I dont', ""The anime is confusing, drags on, and overall not great.The characters aren't developed enough to get attached to, it's hard to resonate with them or their motives so it's difficult to get into and enjoy the story.The story can be confusing and unenjoyable at times. sure there's moments where you are interested but they're fleeting and short.I dropped the anime because I couldn't get into the story.

But it holds too much predictability and repetitiveness. It mostly just goes through the same ""I gamble simply for the pleasure of the risk"" situation. It\'s also easy to tell who\'s going to win in each game/what will happen in said game.The world building isn\'t all that great as they never explore anything outside of the school, which makes the plot, once again, very repetitive and limits it greatly.Yumeko\'s character being this ""shrouded in mystery"" type thing while never revealing more than a little pebble of information is a bit frusterating to sit through....Why does she gamble simply for the risk? Anything in specific that causes her to act like the way she does? Who is her family? And really any other question simply avoids getting answered.The ""main character""? Who really is just kind of there.. doesn\'t do much despite being seemingly introduced as the main character.

This show was made by kinky bastards for fucking psychopaths. This is a show that is not afraid to go over the line. It walks casually forward like it doesn’t even notice the fucking line. It will make you uncomfortable, it will make you say ‘hol up’ and it will make you question humanity. At first I really didn’t like this show. It was just too much. In the first episode this dude was being called a ‘house pet’ while being used as a chair. All of the characters are extremely sexual and get horny off of big bets and gambling...so they get super promiscuous and uncomfortably close to each other. The voice actors go all out giving off extremely energetic performances as they gasp, moan, scream and giggle at the chance to completely ruin each other's lives. They go all out in the over-the-top aspects. There’s a girl who bets fingernails and ends up ripping hers off later. There’s a girl who gets horny off of Russian Roulette and masturbates with a gun to her head. If you’re bad at gambling you basically become a slave and they even hint that you can be freely raped (they imply casually). There’s a full on America’s Got Talent stage and studio and a whole fucking tower built for one specific gambling game. This one guy loses and basically stresses out so much that he's hospitalized. They bet their fingers, their lives and millions of dollars. This show has no boundaries. It makes for a very uncomfortable watch as there are really no limits to what can happen. But it’s always going to be fucked up and make you question your sanity. On one hand that’s why I will never rewatch it, but on the other, that’s what makes this show so good. This show knows exactly what it’s doing and it does it with style. The jazzy over-the-top animation of this anime and its music is just so stylistic. It’s bold and it has no fear. I appreciate a show that shows no hesitation. It is energetic as all hell, with its acting, with its animation, with its colors and with its music. This show just oozes style and energy and I have to respect it for that. It is a fucked up show that displays its horrific games in neon lights. The main girl is fucking insane but so is everyone else. Their insanity matched with their genius creates gripping mind games and seeing her outsmart everyone is thrilling. It’s a great show if you can handle it. Me personally though, once was more than enough. so they get super promiscuous and uncomfortably close to each other.

However, the series is more than that below the surface.In essence Kakegurui is revenge porn at the upper classes of the capitalist society.Hyakkaou Private Academy - A hyperbolic parody of capitalist societyThe way the school is created it\'s dividing pupils in two general classes. The ""ordinary"" pupils with all rights, and the house-pets. The latter are poor people who, aside from having to pay off their debt also have to serve the upper class without question. This servitude and constant abuse by the rich make it very...unlikely for a house-pet to get out of their underprivileged status under normal circumstances.Despite being technically part of a bigger society, the environment of Hyakkaou Private Academy is a closed microcosm of classist society in itself.The rules extend to all pupils in the same way. On paper it\'s a fair system, however, some pupils come from more privileged background and can afford more than others to lose money, and money here is really everything. Your money decides your position in the class system and you need money to engage in the gambling activities.The deciding power factor being money and influence instead of martial power and prowess make Kakegurui stand out as microcosm of a society driven by material wealth. The amount of money ones amasses equals their social status and the chances offered to them.The Student Council - The Government BodyThe closed ecosystem of the school is entirely controlled by the Student Council. There are no teachers or school administration. It is the council, it is Kirari Momobami, who control all aspects of the school. After all, she was the one that established the gambling system the school is running on.The council is in theory a meritocracy. The president is initially a fixed point since she set up the system and owns the school, however, it is quite clear that she also possesses the ability to hold that post and is superior to every member of the council. This is also demonstrated by her offering the post in the election in the second season.where she also dismantles a number of minor gamblers, while the more able gamblers avoid her.The laws of the school benefit the rich and powerful and enables them to amass more wealth, while making use of the middle class to keep down the lower class. This can be seen in the first gamble with Mary who is supported by her classmates to stack a game against Yumeko and other instances where Council members use their influence and wealth to influence games, like Yumemi and her fans.Suzui - The Lower ClassSuzui and Tsubomi are two highlighted examples of the lower class. They became house-pets because they couldn\'t compete in the corrupt system and experience for themselves how the attitude of people changes just based on the class. People love to punch down, as is demonstrated by people who used to be friendly quickly turn against Suzui and Mary when they dropped from ordinary students to house-pets, as well to a minor degree with Yumeko. She didn\'t have a big status to begin with, as new student, but most people were respectful to her until she turned into a house-pet. Ordinary students are shown to be accepting of the lower status of house-pets. Everything is fine as long as you\'re not one yourself.Both Suzui and Tsuboi were saved by Yumeko. Not just by removing their pet-status, but by giving them confidence that they are able to fight the upper class. That there is no reason to be content with being a slave forever. What Jabami is bringing to the lower class is not just freedom of pet status, but hope to generally escape the wretched system.The issue that one faces when falling to house-pet is the vicious circle of debt. On one hand, you\'re indebted to the Student Council, on the other your ability to climb up again is limited as you lack resources to get new resources and recover from pet status. In turn, the Student Council holds power over your future and makes plans on how to use you and your future position.The original content in episode 12 of the first season spelled this out quite explicitly with Suzui refusing to take the card the president marked, but rather to take fate into his own hands and take an uncertain, unknown path to his own ""judgement"" instead of chasing the ""fool"".Mary - The Middle ClassThe class system in Hyakkaou Private Academy is nominally binary. Either you are a normal student or you are a house-pet. However, not all normal students are equal. Most students don\'t have grand ambition, they are trying to survive and not become house-pets. They don\'t dare to defy the powerful because, due to their success in the system, defying them endangers the average student to lose everything.And after all: opportunity is there. Poor students can theoretically become rich very quickly by winning a gamble against a wealthy person. Ultimately, the core theme of the school system is gambling. Just a bit of brain and a load of luck, right. However, as the series showcases frequently: the rich don\'t keep to the rules if they don\'t benefit them. Cheating is rampant in the school and the powerful pull every dirty trick legal and illegal to keep their wealth.Most of the Council Members are incredible wealthy, but those outside are not. While they act arrogant towards their peers and especially the lower class, they buckle in front of the Student Council who hold not only legislative power but immense wealth individually. And this is a legitimate strategy to survive within the system. And who knows? Maybe one day you will belong to the rich and have others buckle to you? And everything is better than to be at the other end and buckle to everyone as a house-pet.Students generally get angry at individuals who beat them, but rarely question the systematic problems that lead to their demise.Council Members - The Upper ClassThe Council members are a unit on the surface, managing the daily administration and enforcement of their own enacted laws in the Academy. However, as seen in the series, they are a fragile bunch that get busy with infighting and with their own selfish interests. They are serving the president, because it furthers their agenda and because they\'re scared of her and would rather work for her than fight.In a way the ordinary students are split in three groups. The regular ones as the Middle Class that tries to stay above water, the Upper Class that has bigger ambitions, and means and the Student Council who hold the government, the legislative, the executive, and the judiciary, as well as vast amounts of personal wealth. Above them again, is the president who is another level by herself.Yumeko - Das GespenstYumeko, while for the most part pretty silly and reserved, turns into something else once gambling is involved. Her depiction during games is demonic and otherworldly, her eyes shine crimson red, her aura is dark.When she gambles against the rich and powerful she becomes a supernatural force. She values taking risks and doesn\'t value gambling for the sake of the materialistic profit, but for the sake of it. She defeats the rich and powerful in their own playing fields. It\'s always her opponent that picks the game and she goes with it, no matter how stacked it is.Most of the wealthy people Yumeko gambles look decent - until they get pushed to their limits. Here is where the crazy faces come into play, showing the true nature of the gamblers. Their inward ugliness gets quite literally turned outside as they scheme in their superiority and get knocked down. When they look at Yumeko in her unhinged moments they see their own madness reflected in her crazy face.Yumeko does not only defeat the rich, she dismantles them by showing them the other side of their own madness and where their unchecked gambling leads. She is what the ordinary student can\'t be: a vengeful spirit that does not care for her own well being and just relentlessly pursues the arrogant rich upper class successfully, regardless of the unbalanced system.In conclusion - We live in a societyNo, mom, I am not watching filth, I am watching a power fantasy about the dismantling of the upper class by taking their greed and lust for money ad absurdum.Ecchi and the over-the-top crazy faces are the most visible elements of Kakegurui, but they are flavour to the actual content. When you strip away the flavour you will find in the narrative core a power fantasy about dismantling the rich elite and giving power to the diminished lower class by a supernatural force that overpowers the unjust system against oddsSomeone successfully fighting the elite and uplifting the powerless is a common power fantasy, as the struggle for one\'s existence is relatable to many people and it makes for engaging storytelling, as it\'s satisfying when a protagonist wins against systematic odds.Kakegurui stands out in so far as the class struggle is more explicit. The issues are not just some randomly evil people, but a system accepted by the common people. The strength of the exploiters is not physical strength, but the ability to game the system.Kakegurui may be questionable if you\'re just looking for a gambling anime, however it makes a stand as a mockery of the capitalist system by showcasing the madness of chasing ever more wealth, of gambling away for the sake of more power. It shows the middle class as it claws upwards to not fall into the lower class. It\'s a specific kind of revenge porn that empowers the powerless in systematic equality stacked against them and encourages taking risks instead of accepting a safe, but downtrodden position, instead of just taking the bread crumbs the rich let fall off their tables. unlikely for a house-pet to get out of their underprivileged status under normal circumstances.Despite being technically part of a bigger society, the environment of Hyakkaou Private Academy is a closed microcosm of classist society in itself.The rules extend to all pupils in the same way.

That sounds cool but i felt underwhelmed. Maybe it’s because of the fandom but when I watched kakeguri it was okay but I went online and all anyone could talk about how it was good. This was more on people’s obsession with the characters rather than the actual plot and storyline. Without the fandom I would rate this anime a 7 but they had just affected my experience of the show too much. The main character (Yumeko...Jabami) was one of my favourite parts of the show but her “sidekick” is very much forgertable, i wish they had made more of him. I liked how the gambles kept changing and how cheating and psychology were all part of the show. I didn’t find myself excited for the next episodes tho because the episodes usually finish with a resolve. I have forgotten quite a bit about the show but the characters were interesting.

Now I am by no means complaining about this but if you are a straight woman best to steer clear of this one because you will create an angry twitter thread about it otherwise. People have very mixed opinions with this series, some say the oversexualisation is too much and boycott the anime while others such as me embrace the horny and enjoy the authors hard work like normal people. Sure, a show about gambling and hot women...in the wrong circumstances can seem wrong i get that but for the world the series creates it fits the vibe immensely well.Story:To summarise, there's a school where the only form of education is gambling and the only kids there are filthy rich. In this school there's a very simple hierarchy; house pets, students, student council members and finally the student council leader. House pets are student that are in debt from gambling and the students are encouraged to treat them as dogs and filth, the students are like the everyday man they could move up the ranks or fall to house pet status, student council are the ones running things in the school (ahem kill la kill) and are top gamblers. Its defiantly a unique premise for an anime and a welcome one at that, and while there is defiantly better gambling anime out there this is by far the most unique one. The Story follows Yumeko Jibami who definitely doesn't get wet over gambling at all...  as she fights her way all the way to the top to defeat the student council. This part of the story is meh, but it is what it is.6/10Characters:Most of the characters in this anime are female with the odd exception here and there, this isn't a bad thing, but it would have been nice if some more of the guys where important like the two guys on the student council. Luckily this isn't a bit deterrent being the horny ass individual I am and in fairness the characters are really well written with Yumeko's mystery, Mary's backstory in the prequel called kakegurui twin and the guy I can't remember the name of for my life essentially being a toy for yumeko (mommy). The mains are likable and fun and the student council acts as a great villain and shows just how much power they hold over the students, the dynamic between characters are fantastic and it gives the feeling that the mains actually have a proper end goal that makes actual sense and has some severity behind it. There are a few characters that are a tad over the top like the girl that constantly has a gun and who's whole personality is that she's crazy. Overall, not a bad cast but if you dislike fan Servies you 100% will not enjoy the cast.7/10Op/audio/VA's:This is a MAPPA anime its bound to have a banger soundtrack and ops, and low and behold in this anime it only delivers in the op category. The Ost is possibly the most forgettable thing ever, normally i can remember at least one song from a Ost but i do not remember a single track here which is disappointing. The Voice actors could be better (in the sub because who watches dub), but most characters voice actors do match their characters for the most part. Some of the student council members have the worst voices ever known to man, however. You know that one annoying ass woman who voices every Loli in every comedy anime? it's like listening to her every time the student council is on the screen. The op is really good however, it completely matches the craziness of the world they set up with the lesbian innuendoes and absurdness that the premise of the show is. The track for the op is fantastic and is extremely fitting for the show as a whole. I could go on forever about it but i need to wrap this up so overview time!6/10Overveiw:ill break this into 2 categories because you most likely skipped half the review.Pros: great op, story premise, atmosphere.Cons (for some people): fan service, crap voices for some characters, mostly women cast.thank you for reading! in the wrong circumstances can seem wrong i get that but for the world the series creates it fits the vibe immensely well.Story:To summarise, there's a school where the only form of education is gambling and the only kids there are filthy rich.

There are a few characters that are a tad over the top like the girl that constantly has a gun and who's whole personality is that she's crazy. Overall, not a bad cast but if you dislike fan Servies you 100% will not enjoy the cast.7/10Op/audio/VA's:This is a MAPPA anime its bound to have a banger soundtrack and ops, and low and behold in this anime it only delivers in the op category. The Ost is possibly the most forgettable thing ever, normally i can remember at least one song from a Ost but i do not remember a single track here which is disappointing. The Voice actors could be better (in the sub because who watches dub), but most characters voice actors do match their characters for the most part. Some of the student council members have the worst voices ever known to man, however. You know that one annoying ass woman who voices every Loli in every comedy anime? it's like listening to her every time the student council is on the screen. The op is really good however, it completely matches the craziness of the world they set up with the lesbian innuendoes and absurdness that the premise of the show is. The track for the op is fantastic and is extremely fitting for the show as a whole. I could go on forever about it but i need to wrap this up so overview time!6/10Overveiw:ill break this into 2 categories because you most likely skipped half the review.Pros: great op, story premise, atmosphere.Cons (for some people): fan service, crap voices for some characters, mostly women cast.thank you for reading!"", ""The OP and the art, is the only good thing about this anime imo. I found it boring, and the main character cringey. The fact the main character always won made the games less entertaining to watch. 4/10 I guess...In my eyes. But the OP is really great!!! I loved the artstyle of it and the music, fit the anime quite well. The colours were so pleasant too! I don't have much to say to the story as honestly to me there is nothing to add .I liked only like 2-3? Characters--- I don't even remember the names much except Yumekos and Marys--- and Mary...was better than cringey Yumeko was better than cringey Yumeko"", 'Decent plot executed badly. What looked like a romantic start was in its entirety a whole together different story. Plot development was normal and plot devices such as the games they play were very interesting although explaining the rules were a bit long and required utmost attention (may confuse some people). Forced ecchi characteristics ruined the show. Emotions portrayed by the characters were superfluous. Sick sadism was unnecessarily imposed. Some characters were not needed and were kept for the sake of the protagonist maintaining a cogent relationship. The monotonous repeated situations were given decent animation and sounds which made the show bearable. ', ""The review may contain spoilers found in the Netflix description.I started watching this, at first, because the description for this anime was dumb enough to make me laugh, I expected something very shite.I don't know if I would go as far as to call it great, but it is quite tense and sexualized, enough to keep me watching the two seasons.We follow the journey of a girl who gets turned on by gambling, in a school where the pecking order is governed by the house. Everyone cheats, but she likes to play. She's smarter and more cunning than most, so she manages to outdo them,...sometimes by mere luck. There lies the strength of the series when it comes to gambling, seeing a force of nature wrecking torment on her opponents.If the series often gets compared to Kaiji, it's unjustified. Yumeko seems to share more of a semblance to Akagi. Both are near unbeatable figures who share a taste for risk and disdain towards those they deem too cowardly to match them. Kaiji turns out to be a mediocre man who is far too commonplace. Technically, most should be able to identify with Kaiji more easily and find him more endearing. But that would be forgetting one of the primordial points of attachment and identification in a narrative work: the will to identify oneself. Mysterious and extraordinary characters such as Akagi and Yumeko naturally guide the viewers to become more attached to their destinies. There is an exotic fascination around characters whose actions someone can't rationalize immediately.But there's a catch, Kakegurui takes a different characteristic approach.The anime is fast-paced, often covering a single game within one or two episodes. Nothing is explained through viewer exposition, visual hints often get more explicit if one rewatches an episode after seeing the outcome of the game. In earlier episodes, we often have Ryota being explained the tactics behind certain tricks. This serves to alienate the viewer, in a sense. Even if one can be familiar with the real references and psychological tricks the show loves to cite.It's odd for a gambling show because we aren't really meant to feel the stakes from Yumeko's perspective but from her opponents.They are the main characters of their own arcs, we are shown why they choose to play, what they stand to lose, and some are presented with sympathetic motivations.We feel the anxiety that takes over them when Yumeko gets closer and closer to breaking them because they simply don't stand a chance. It's not Manichean as other gambling animes, there's little to no character who is truly villainous. At most, they are tools of a hierarchical system that can take everything away from them.The series also holds particular interest, because it's morbid and sexual. The main cast is almost entirely feminine, and we see them openly masturbate over the impossible odds. We feel the pleasure that dominates them in possibly losing everything, a deadly desire that is both sexual and masochistic. The numerous shots of the cast's erogenous zones (ass, lips, boobs, thighs..) only exist to excessively sexualize these students. But the morbidity of their fetish and the expressions they pull counterpoises the overabundant fanservice. These are young women who are ready to die so they can feel fulfilled, for a taste of risk.After a while, it becomes impossible to heighten the stakes. Once a character has taken part in a game of Russian roulette, the thrill is sort of gone. So the series makes the games more rational, we go from simple challenges in the first season to a full-on game of thrones, with trials that are more complex and mathematical. We start to get more of this addiction to risk, where there isn't even anything to gain anymore, just the possibility of losing all hope.This council president arc still isn't resolved at the end of the second season, leaving me a bit disappointed. But the series is short, no filler, no useless character arcs, and we never spend five episodes on a steel beam. So my usual gripes about anime adaptations aren't an issue here.I might see some real legs in the live-action series until then, who knows. sometimes by mere luck.

It is all about gambling and taking risks. I don't know a lot about gambling but at the beginning of each game, you are informed about the basics of the games. Everyone is trying to win one way or another, some students have ulterior motives apart from winning, some are in it for prestige, some are for fame, some are for control, pleasure... and some other are gambling for the sake of gambling.

The plot was simple yet it added a good amount of unique twists. It was entertaining at parts but there wasn't anything I would say was eye-catching or amazing. The characters make up for that though. From the sadistic personalities of people like Midari Or Kirari, to the adorable yet still sadistic Yumeko, most of the characters were unique and definitely fun to watch. I feel like everyone had there own character they like. The art was pretty bright but it was also very clean. It was semi sleek but it had this certain touch to it that made...it very unique and made you want to look at it. The way they color eyes, for example Yumeko's and Kirari's are very vibrant and breath taking. They look so beautiful and vibrant. I'd say this anime (season) is 5/10.

I enjyoed watching kakegurui prettymuch and overall it was...a 7/10 for me. a 7/10 for me.', 'If you are expecting some amazing mind games like that of Death Note, you will not be satisfied with this anime.Story - 5This anime is a little bit episodic, with a new transfer student entering the school and basically just taking up a new opponent every episode or two, although there is a logical progression since as she wins, she becomes more of a powerful opponent.The gambling is just okay. I really liked the first episode, it felt the most like a mind game and was interesting to see the different tricks used. However, the opening where they describe the school as a...school where ""your grades don\'t matter, but your gambling skills do"" should be changed to ""your grades don\'t matter, but your cheating skills do"" because practically every gamble done has one of or both of the opponents cheating. The person monitoring the game is always just like ""well nowhere in the rules does it say you aren\'t allowed to do that exact method of cheating so FINE BY ME"". It just makes the game less about strategy and more about using specially manufactured cheating tool.Also, the gambles often play out like this: you watch the two characters are they gamble for like 10 minutes and see them react to bad plays or good plays, etc., and then at the very end our main MC reveals they had it all figured out and win the entire thing with some insane move/trick that is totally unbelievable to come up with in time.I will say that there is still a good variety of gambles, and therefore you don\'t get too bored.Oh also, don\'t expect this to have a school-anime feel to it at all. There are no teachers and they never go to class, the student council rules the school and can bully students, and all students do is gamble all day. This isn\'t a problem to me because I am just here to watch the gambling, but keep in mind that all these gambles could take place at a casino they all visit or something and it would make no difference from it being at a school.Art - 6The art is okay. Eyes are drawn exceptionally well, so if you appreciate some detailed aspects of art, you will find that here. Except sometimes the art is a little awkward, like the way tears look when someone cries.Sound - 5The opening is okay, it is a creative jazz. The ending is nothing special. Overall, the soundtrack only has a few that really hype things up.Characters - 5The ""main character"" or this anime is a useless guy who for some reason hangs around with these people who are insane about gambling. But honestly it\'s not that annoying. I really like Mary, she is the most real. There is a good amount of characters, and I like how there is the student council, it kind of gives a structure to the people our female MC will gamble with. However, don\'t expect any character development... except some that is a little random for our useless male MC.Enjoyment - 5The gambles were fun at times, especially in the first episode when you didn\'t know what it would be like. However the mind games weren\'t really there. Also, there is some sexual elements which just felt so random and like they didn\'t add anything to the story. They never really go anywhere so it was just annoying.Overall - 5This anime did not meet my expectations.

It\'s similar to Shokugeki no Soma but it\'s about gambling. Both have schools going by strict rules and getting seriously their main goal. Both have a council that is created by the strongest students.The main character is Yumeko Jabami, she\'s amicable, carrying and of course, loves gambling. She\'s new in Hyakkaou Private Academy, it\'s a common motive to get viewers close to the rules of this world, but I think it\'s made in a good way so you don\'t feel like a dumbass at the beginning. Yumeko loves all gambling games and is just searching for...someone to play with her in basically anything. She tries to get to the top of the academy to play with stronger rivals. Yumeko is easy to like, she doesn\'t scream all the time, has a brain, and usually makes logical choices. But she\'s addicted to gambling, when others play to get money or status, she\'s playing for fun. She\'s kinda addicted to gambling and the feelings which come with it.Other characters are various, some of them are easy to like, but some of them are weird in a good way. The most important thing is that they show a lot of points of view on gambling, for example, Midari is a girl which for fun would play roulette with a full carousel with herself, Matsuda is calculating the risk of every game, Itsuki gambles just to stay in a council. Characters have a lot of different motivations and reactions to almost anything. And I think that\'s important, cause sometimes side characters are just worse clones than main characters.Anyway, the way how gambling is shown is overblown, but I think it\'s just an artistic choice. Characters are almost close to orgasm when they play and I think it\'s the moment when most of the people had the first wtf. But I think it\'s nothing new in anime. For example in Shokugeki no Soma people are just cumming from food, it\'s overblown, but I think if it\'s ok with food then why shouldn\'t be ok with gambling? But gambling is more controversial than food, so I understand that it\'s too much for some people. Personally, I like gambling, so maybe that\'s why I can understand the characters\' feelings even when they\'re overblown. And this anime woke up in me that excitement which is when I gamble. I think that provoking emotions should be the main goal of any medium, so that\'s the biggest advantage of Kakegurui for me.The plot is simple. Basically, it\'s about Yumeko looking forward to a rival, which will give her an exciting game. She meets a lot of people and gets into conflict with the council, which tries to eliminate her from the academy.The most important thing is that for them, gambling it\'s not only poker, they also do idol competition, play traditional Chinese games, or do coin flip to figure out who is right. And I think it\'s the best thing in the anime. They\'re getting over traditional gambling games, of course, here\'s blackjack or poker, but it\'s a small amount of games. A lot of them are more creative.I think it\'s also important how cheating was shown. It\'s not only gambling, it\'s also a psychological game between rivals. It\'s really satisfying to watch how they try to cheat each other. And it\'s important that cheating is in normal amount, not like Death Note and legendary ""I predicted, that you would predict, that I would predict, that you would predict, ...""When it comes to music I don\'t really like opening, visually it\'s nice, but it\'s not my type of music. I think it\'s not really a fitting vibe of Kakerugui. Anyway, the soundtrack in all anime is good but not that good to be on your playlist. It\'s common so I didn\'t really pay attention to it.The visual side is nice, this is a really pretty anime. It has its own style. But sometimes hair and eyes become weird. I\'m not sure what exactly is wrong with them, but I just feel uncomfortable when I\'m looking at them.So afterall, if you like the concept of Shokugeki no Souma, you can like Kakegurui too. But if cumming from gambling is too much for you, I suggest watching something else. someone to play with her in basically anything.

DO NOT WATCH if you value mystery over suspense, or are the type to be upset when characters are unrealistically smart. Kakegurui is all about putting on a show for others the turning the tables. They won’t walk you through was is happened frame per frame, but explain at the end. Overall an enjoyable show.Story: 8/10. Decent plotline for a very...intriguing premise. My main complaint is that the main character has zero aspirations outside of the thrill of gambling, which kinda leaves you with nothing to root for. I get that that was the point, but still, less enjoyable than if she cared about the stakes she put out.The show is basically just challenging the top gamblers, beating them with tricks and tactics, then moving on to the next challenge. Each episode features a different game, each with their own risks. No, the protagonist doesn’t win each game, but she doesn’t often lose either, so you can always expect the games to turn in her favour. In that sense, the show can become repetitive. The only thing saving the routine plot is the characters, which isn’t a bad thing. Keeps things refreshing.Art 9/10. Kakegurui has a masterful grasp on expression. They are NOT afraid of making the characters look ugly. The characters are pushed to their mental limits, and Kakegurui shows that. The animations are extremely dramatic, which makes sense for such a flamboyant show. The opening is iconic, and the characters designs are also very good, despite their simplicity. I think we can all recognize Kakegurui’s characters by their uniforms, which shows how iconic they are even when they are super low-key compared to other shows.Sound 8/10. Voice acting was AMAZING! The sell the fact that everyone in that school has a couple screws loose. I imagine they had a blast in the studios. The OST, opening and endings are nothing noteworthy though. I feel like the OP and ED didn’t sell the gambling themes too well. Went a bit too hard into edgy zone.Character 7/10: Most of the characters serve their purpose, but none are particularly interesting. You don’t get anything beyond 1. Key character traits, 2. Brief motivation explanation and if you’re lucky 3. Backstory. For our protagonists, we don’t even get that.Female lead is just crazy obsessed with gambling for no reason. Male MC is literally just a guy. Sidekicks have some motivation, but are most there to be used to further the stakes or plot. They DO have their moments to shine, but overall lacklustre.If you were to take any of these side characters out of Kakegurui, they wouldn’t be able to hold their own, because they aren’t truly “characters” and more like “plot devices” specifically made to make our protagonist’s plans achievable.Also they are all batshit insane, so it’s very difficult to find anyone relatable, or likable even.Enjoyment 8/10. If you like shows that make you feel intelligent, this show is not for you. None of the tricks are easy to see through, since often they aren’ shown on screen. Regardless, still fun to watch if you aren’t expecting a mentally stimulating show, which i was not.Overall: 8/10. Great show, good art, decent characters.

Though, it’s funny how scary these girls are over gambling I don’t think we should ignore how oversexualized these high school girls are. Of course, I can’t stop you from watching this and I’ve at least watched this twice ngl because it’s entertaining. I think the scene that I most remember and that made me most uncomfortable is when the girl that always licks the guns and stuff. Her whole character was so...crazy to the point you started to like her yet sexualized. I always wonder why people love to sexualize Japanese high school girls? crazy to the point you started to like her yet sexualized.

By nature, Jabami Yumeko is a fascinating creature, but her character design is meant to stay stagnant, as someone who is consumed and obsessed with gambling. Because of this, it becomes repetitive, and after the first few outbursts, Kakegurui feels gratuitous.Kakegurui definitely shamelessly appeals to its male audience through its artwork, but also draws out...some of the most grotesque and twisted expressions seen in an anime. For those that are even mildly interested in Kakegurui, I say go ahead and dive in, its well worth your time, and for those that are drawn in the replayability of this anime is extremely high. some of the most grotesque and twisted expressions seen in an anime.

You know how almost every episode is going to end and even if you don\'t the ""surprise"" endings don\'t tend to bring much surprise or joy in and of themselves. This isn\'t what I would recommend to anyone looking for a deep thought-provoking show. However, if you enjoy psychology, like a main character who is always in control of the story and are fine with many of the characters besides the MC being either predictable or annoying, then it\'s not a bad watch. It\'s entertaining and it does have some interesting elements...like the pet concept (though I feel they could\'ve done more with that and many other plot points). If nothing else it could be a fun watch for the right person just not necessarily good as far as a plot goes. like the pet concept (though I feel they could\'ve done more with that and many other plot points). If nothing else it could be a fun watch for the right person just not necessarily good as far as a plot goes.', ""Kakegurui is feminist literature; Yumeko Jabami is a sexual character who is allowed to exist outside of any male gaze, and I love the show so much for that. She acts and is portrayed in a very sexual way, but that is never done for the benefit of any particular man - or character for that matter - in the show. In fact, I would argue Yumeko is asexual, as she never really shows romantic or sexual attraction to any PERSON.

All I can say is me taking a fat dump was intellectual symbolism on how the Characters and story are smelling and blatantly shit. The only difference is I enjoyed my dump but I did not enjoy the show. Go play enter the gungeon instead of watching this show. ', 'Was anyone really surprised that the most hyped show of the Summer 2017 season would end up horrible? Even from its trailers, one could see how much the creators gambled (pun intended) on the show’s simple premise and gonzo style to carry it into superstar status. Despite their efforts, however, “Yu-Gi-Oh, but with Psychopaths” turned out to be nothing more than a flash in the pan.Kakegurui takes place in what could possibly be described as the most unnecessarily forced high-school setting since Angel Beats. Despite everyone walking around in school uniforms, there don’t seem to be any classes for the students to take. The only...thing that the students ever do on this campus is play card games and treat everyone else like crap. In fact, the only purpose of this school seems to be a mechanism for questionable competition and networking amongst the children of the Elite. While I can see how being an asshole could be an appropriate if cynical attribute, the show fails to explain how playing children’s card games makes you a good businessman. That said, failing to explain key elements is a pervasive theme of this show.The only thing that is reminiscent of high-school in this anime is the existence of cliques. In fact, there exist three distinct cliques: The Normies: which is where all of the asshole students thrive, The Student Council: where all of the psychopathic assholes preside over the Normies, and the Pets: where all of the potentially likeable students are pushed into so that they can be abused by the Normies. Where you are placed on this miserable totem pole depends entirely on how good you are at cheating at gambling and how much of your daddy’s money you have to bet.With setting established, our protagonist Jabami, Yumeko enters the scene with whatever fragments of plot this show actually has. The story of Kakegurui, from what I can gather, is that Yumeko really wants to play a card game against the Student Council President and can only do so by slowly beating her underlings. Why does Yumeko want to beat the Student Council President? I wouldn’t know, because the show never bothers to properly establish a reason for anything Yumeko does.Even though their horrible backstories can be summarized as “My dad is a rich asshole who will disown me”, at least the other characters have reasons for why they are putting up with this God-awful school. Yumeko doesn’t seem to have awful parents breathing down her neck, as their existence is never even mentioned. Yumeko doesn’t seem to be particularly interested in money, as she casually bets insane amounts of it for no adequately explained reason. Yumeko doesn’t seem to be interested in status, seeing as how she willingly and joyfully adopts the status of “House Pet” for the inexplicably convenient reason of being able to challenge the members of The Student Council. And no, “Enjoying gambling for the risk of it” isn’t a good enough character motivation.The show casually brings up the subplot of Yumeko’s hospitalized sister in Episode 6, but that is never given any context, never given any explanation, and never brought up again for the entirety of the season. The entire plot of Kakegurui plays out like a lazy tournament arc of a bad Shounen Action series. It is essentially a series of card-based “fights” (because the show is too lazy to come up with more than a few alternate ways to gamble) conveniently ordered in terms of difficulty, with the “Big Bad” saved for the very end. It’s lazy, it’s boring, and it all comes to a close with the most over-simplistic, anti-climactic card game of the series and a massive cop-out ending.The problems of the story are further mired by its protagonist Jabami Yumeko. Yumeko’s biggest flaw is that she isn’t actually a character, but a lazy plot device meant to drive the story forward by any means necessary. You see, Yumeko is blessed with the magical ability to read ahead in the script, thus beating all of her opponents by making humongous leaps in logic. Yumeko has no internal monologue to explain her rationale or communicate her feelings about anything that is going on around her. Instead, Yumeko communicates entirely through blushing, giggling, and creaming her panties at the very thought of gambling. Then, when she wins, she throws out a bullshit reason for why she won and the formula repeats in the next episode.The concept of tension doesn’t exist in this “Psychological” Gambling anime, because there is never a reason to believe that Yumeko will lose. Not only is she devilishly good at pulling victories out of her enormous ass and chest, but she also has a particularly sturdy set of plot-armor. Yumeko only loses twice in this show. The first time she loses, it ends up paying off exceptionally because it pushes her into “Pet” status and gives her the ability to challenge the Student Council. The second time she loses, she is given the random privilege of betting someone else’s money in order to continue playing. This move was so unprecedented that even her opponent nearly soiled himself in awe of her plot armor. Furthermore, Yumeko is never even punished as a “Pet” like everyone else in this show, being saved immediately the one time any trouble arises.Lastly, Yumeko’s often sadistic nature and back-handed, insulting speech makes it very difficult to root for her. Throughout the show’s 12 episode span, I very often found myself feeling sorry for her opponents despite the fact that they were all massive psychopaths and sociopaths. Somehow, Yumeko almost always managed to make herself look worse by comparison, simply because of the disgusting way in which she chooses to behave. This is especially true towards the end of the series when Yumeko strong-arms a “friend” into betting her life on a game just because it makes her panties wet. I feel that even villain protagonists should have some defining goal/feature that tries to justify their crude methods (i.e. Light Yagami). The only character that is really more unlikeable than her is Ikishima, Midari, a girl characterized by her disgustingly sexual fascination with killing herself. Easily the cringiest anime character of Summer 2017.With an ineffective lead like Yumeko at the helm, the viewer has no choice but to look to the supporting cast for any actual depth. Unfortunately, this move only leaves us with  Suzui, Ryouta and Saotome, Meari. Initially, Suzui was my early consideration for the only likeable character in this show, due entirely to the fact that he seems to be the only sane one. This changed quickly when it became painfully obvious that Suzui’s only role was to be the token love interest that desperately clings to Yumeko like a lost puppy, because she saved him in Episode 1. This persists despite the many times throughout the show her behavior weirds him the fuck out.Meari is the one truly good character that the show has due to her being the only one blessed with an ounce of depth. Though initially a psychotic bitch like everyone else at this school, Maeri has a change of heart once she is relegated to “Pet” status by Yumeko and threatened with being sold off to a pedophilic Senator. This experience opens up her eyes to the disgusting behaviors of her peers and the way The Student Council perpetrates these behaviors. Unfortunately, the show never capitalizes on this after the one time she teams up with Yumeko. Instead, it relegates Maeri into the background, where she has the dubious honor of commentating on Yumeko’s matches against the Council members. Even Yu-Gi-Oh’s Joey Wheeler was allowed to be useful, so hopefully Season 2 of Kakegurui is competent enough to highlight its only interesting character.Though largely incompetent, Kakegurui manages to, at least, occasionally entertain based simply on the merits of its unnervingly strange presentation. Everything from its bizarre choices for OP and ED to its dedication to physically manifesting the ugliness of its characters’ souls with garbage-tier facial expressions makes for a production that is difficult to turn away from. Even at its most painfully boring and mind-numbingly unbelievable, the nice art and visuals will be enough of a draw for most people to like the show.Personally, I found that the faces were woefully overused and often times placed in scenes that had either too little tension for their existence to have merit, or just enough tension that their jokey presence immediately took me out of the scene. Rarely do they ever make a scene better, opting instead to high-jack said scene with mostly negative results.The animation is a pretty mixed bag. Since the show is mostly people talking and playing card games, you would think that there would be little room for any major, noticeable errors. This is not the case. There are a few, minor gaffs like in Episode 2 where the animators forget to animate Yumeko’s hair as she walks out of a classroom, making it look like she has a long, stiff, black cape from a really old, free-to-play MMO.The really noticeable lack of appropriate budget use came in Episode 9, where Yumeko battles against the school’s resident Jpop Idol. The creators clearly shifted a large amount of their budget to the dance routine at the end, because the beginning is not only filled with awkward arm flailing from Yumemi’s fans, but Yumemi’s actual dance was a still image being moved around with music playing in the background. Last time I checked, this wasn’t 1997’s Berserk. It’s never enough to fully make or break the show, but considering MAPPA’s other works, it could have been done better.Lastly, for all of the hate I have spewed over Yumeko, her voice actress Hayami, Saori deserves massive praise for being the only one capable of making the character tolerable. She was able to perfectly capture every distinct tone on Yumeko’s near schizophrenic scale of emotions.Overall, Kakegurui was an incredibly disappointing show. It spends so much time building up its fragmented plot and woefully, bland characters for some monumental, climactic twist that it forgets to actually deliver. Instead, it places all of its chips on the garishness of its often unpleasant faces and overly-sexualized art, thus never delivering anything of actual substance. If all you want is an anime about cute girl making scary faces, you’re better off watching Mirai Nikki or Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. Even if the announced Second Season holds all of the twists, depth, and character development for the series, Season One remains as an exceptionally weak introduction.Story: 2Art: 7Sound: 7Character: 2Enjoyment: 4Overall: 4 thing that the students ever do on this campus is play card games and treat everyone else like crap.

The creators clearly shifted a large amount of their budget to the dance routine at the end, because the beginning is not only filled with awkward arm flailing from Yumemi’s fans, but Yumemi’s actual dance was a still image being moved around with music playing in the background. Last time I checked, this wasn’t 1997’s Berserk. It’s never enough to fully make or break the show, but considering MAPPA’s other works, it could have been done better.Lastly, for all of the hate I have spewed over Yumeko, her voice actress Hayami, Saori deserves massive praise for being the only one capable of making the character tolerable. She was able to perfectly capture every distinct tone on Yumeko’s near schizophrenic scale of emotions.Overall, Kakegurui was an incredibly disappointing show. It spends so much time building up its fragmented plot and woefully, bland characters for some monumental, climactic twist that it forgets to actually deliver. Instead, it places all of its chips on the garishness of its often unpleasant faces and overly-sexualized art, thus never delivering anything of actual substance. If all you want is an anime about cute girl making scary faces, you’re better off watching Mirai Nikki or Higurashi no Naku Koro Ni. Even if the announced Second Season holds all of the twists, depth, and character development for the series, Season One remains as an exceptionally weak introduction.Story: 2Art: 7Sound: 7Character: 2Enjoyment: 4Overall: 4', 'I wanted to like it, I really did, but after 3 episodes, I can tell you this show belongs in the trash heap.This show wanted to be what No Game No Life is, a show about gaming and gambling where you can gamble just about anything. The problem is, the writer seemed to take the sexual route with this just far too quick and early. Our main character seems to nearly orgasm several times just at the thought of gambling and risking her family fortune within just the short amount of time I gave it. It\'s really not worth your time.Pretty much the...only plus I can give here is the music was quite spot on, sadly the visual sequence follows the same trend in attempting to over sexualize things. While we\'re listening to a great jazzy opening theme, we are treated with an upskirt, then a girl licking mc\'s bare toes, mc holding a knife to boring supporting boy in a very yandere fashion, and her breasts are over accentuated. There\'s little focus on the actual gambling, instead it focuses on ""HEY WE CAN USE BETTING AS A COVER UP FOR GETTING OUR ROCKS OFF!"". No kink shaming of course, but if you want to be a big time animation, just throwing random fetish after random fetish at the viewers isn\'t the best plan of attack.Overall, if you want something that maybe you can get a boner to, go ahead and give it a shot, but otherwise steer clear of this paper thin excuse of a plot. only plus I can give here is the music was quite spot on, sadly the visual sequence follows the same trend in attempting to over sexualize things.

So first of all, the main focus of this series is the gambling. Seeing the rules of the gamble, how the opponent cheats, and how Jabami sees through it, all the while, seeing how all the characters react to the gamble as it progresses over time. Okay, so in a gambling anime, the emphasis is usually on how big of a pickle the main character is in and how he gets out of it, with the way having to be plausible. The first problem with this show is that the way Jabari figures how to get...pass the cheaters is either through a way not presented to the viewer or due to her amazing senses or some random plot armor to keep the story going. But thats fine, that just means the story has to emphasize on the characters and how they react to the gamble. However, this also fails. All the characters are usually in 1 of 3 states: normal, scared, and ahegeo. The normal state is usually when the action is the lowest and they act the most normal.  This is where most of the differences are apparent. then theres scared which is when the opponent is losing( Jabari never goes into this state), and ahegeo where the character is very aggressive, sometimes sexually turned on, dominate, and usually has an either intimidating face or ahegeo face. This is the extent of emotions capable of the characters in this story. And to add insult to injury, none of the characters are interesting, you can sum up most of each character with one sentence. Theirs also a male protagonist who has almost no purpose and it feels forced in just because shows like this typically have a male lead even though the show would have not lost anything if he was removed. The only reason to really see this show is to see the op which is very nice. But thats it, an op. There are no other reasons to really watch this show besides if you actually just enjoy it. pass the cheaters is either through a way not presented to the viewer or due to her amazing senses or some random plot armor to keep the story going.

It\'s not necesserily bad, but it is very mediocre, and I will explain why.Story; Kakegurui\'s story is basically non-existent. The show follows the story of Yumeko Jabami, a new student in Hyakkaou Private Academy(basically a gambling school) who\'s obsessed over gambling. Throughout the whole series, the only thing that happens is gambling via various games that are mostly card-games. Nothing else. Literally. Everyone gambles like crazy, putting insane amounts of money at stake, without ever giving a damn whether they lose it all or not, obviously....Heck, students gamble their lives and literally no one cares! This ""pattern"" is repeated again and again, until Yumeko finally gambles with the ""President"" and the anime ends in the most anticlimactic way possible. And of course, Yumeko wins all of the games she plays, even when the odds seem to not be in her favor because she\'s just too good for everyone. Most of her opponents lose miserably, but we never see the result of the dramatic loss, so the anime never really shows the importance of losing huge amounts of money, or your own life, thus making these high stakes unimportant and boring. Overall, the story is not interesting at all, and i was tempted to drop this anime lots of times.Art; the art is alright. I rate it a solid 6 because i believe ""fair"" (6) describes the art perfectly. It\'s not anything great, but it\'s not bad either. Their weird face expressions put me off at times, but I have to admit that the consistency of the artwork was a big plus. Despite that, I\'ve seen studio MAPPA do better than this, hence the 6.Sound; the songs were pretty boring, and not even once did I listen to them through the end. I have to admit that the beginning of the opening song is cool, but the rest is just a repetitive boring beat.Characters; now here is the big problem with this anime. First of all, there is no character development whatsoever. Literally, nobody in the show undergoes through any change and so they never develop as characters. I understand that it is a difficult task to develop all the characters within 12 eps, but noone? Really? Some characters are insane just because (Ikishima), some others are insane mainly due to bad parenting (Sumeragi,Manyuda). Yumeko\'s personality is defined by her gambling obsession and Ryota gives me the impression that he has no purpose in this anime (other than maybe representing the male population since there are 3 guys in total?).The only reason I didn\'t give this a 1 is because of Meary or Mary, who is the only one with some sense of logic, and one who actually realises the impact of gambling (this happens after she loses everything she has because of Yumeko, so it\'s understandable that she learns from past experience).Enjoyment; as I previously mentioned, I did feel like dropping this anime once or twice (or maybe thrice), but kept watching just for the sake of it. I didn\'t have a bad time, but that doesn\'t mean I enjoyed it. It was pretty boring and there\'s no way I\'m wasting my time rewatching.Overall; Maybe it\'s because I\'m not very fond of gambling, but I found this anime tedious. It lacks variation, both character-wise (as all of them are obsessed maniacs) and story-wise. I don\'t think that Kakegurui is entirely bad, but since I can\'t rate it with a 4,5 it gets a 4. I would give it a 5 because there were times when I felt that the show was trying to be interesting and worth, but seeing that it failed miserably made me choose the lower rating. To sum up, this anime is annoyingly dull, at least for me, so I can\'t really recommend this. Heck, students gamble their lives and literally no one cares!

However, there is one huge problem (at least, for me). That would be the ""MC"" Suzui Ryouta. From the very beginning he\'s been the cliche MC who wants to protect the girl since he thinks she\'s so weak. After being rescued by Yumeko, he STILL wants to protect her despite the fact that she is a gambling addict and won\'t listen to his pleas. This is seriously irritating. He\'s seen Yumeko completely ruin people through gambling yet he thinks that SHE is the one...who needs to be protected. Yes, he has helped her sometimes but that doesn\'t change this fact. And after her friend group grows, he, yet again, wants to protect her from gambling when she is clearly obsessed with it and is the one who usually instigates it or accepts a match. Besides this, the anime was great, with the exception of the lackluster ending. The story was great but they could have made the MC more likable and could have improved the ending (unless there is going to be a second season). who needs to be protected.

No amount of teenagers laughing manically is going to trick me into thinking this show is actually edgy. It certainly boasts how ""wacky"", ""insane"" and ""unhinged"" it\'s characters are implicitly, and all the kids on tik tok seem to buy into it, but for anyone with even a tangential awareness of genuinely fucked up anime/manga this seems asinine.  Look, your staring straight at Mary with her hyper distorted face, wandering what evil shenanigans is going on behind those eyes, and then you catch a glimpse of her brown serrated edge. You step to the side of her and she\'s 2D and...falls over from a stiff gust of wind.  Eye patch girl is the sole individual who comes close to manifesting the required mental instability to make this silly setting come to life. But even then, why does she act like that?

This anime is pretty awful.There is practically no development, in both the story and characters. The art is pretty great except for every close shot of hands where the animation goes from a 9 to a 2. The sound design is practically nonexistent besides the pretty okay OPs.It's also extremely repetitive in its writing.

Nothing of value is really here. Also why is the brown haired guy even there? Why is he the protagonist? Wouldn’t yumeko serve just fine? If he was taken out, nothing about the plot would change.

There\'s no nudity, but ... it resembles hentai anime visually, and there are very heavy sexual overtones to everything. Basically, most characters are deranged, and at least some of them feel clearly sexual level thrill from gambling. Honestly, with the whole ""loser becomes a pet"" thing, I\'m surprised they didn\'t go for the hentai title, because it is heavily implied. The main ""thing"" of this anime is trying to disgust and shock the viewer with insane (in bad sense of the word)...characters who overreact to everything. Also expect a lot of deformed ""ugly shots"", tons of sweat, people with tongue out, and on occasion liters of drool too. Add to that a spineless idiot male (it is unclear whether he is supposed to be a protagonist or just one of the primary characters), and everything goes down the drain fast. Honestly, I\'m surprised that square enix funded this.In greater detail:Story: 3/10The story is a chain of exaggerated events, which is fairly unbelievable when you stop to think about it. It has resemblance to shounen anime in structure in a sense that one character does a thing, the other character starts freaking out about it and we hear their inner monologue, then the other character does something even more crazy, then there may or may not be a ""reveal"" for some sort of crazy cheating technique, then we have several ""ugly shots"" where someone is making crazy faces while telling something.... basically, it is incredibly boring, and not pleasant. For some sort of ""social commentary"" on ""ugliness of gabbling, human nature or whatever"", they should\'ve tried something bigger. For a battle of the minds, they should\'ve tried more complex games. I deeply enjoyed, for example, battle of wits in ""No Game No Life"", but there\'s NOTHING like that in this anime. So, a disappointment.In the later half of the anime story gets worse, in the sense that anime becomes more drawn out, and starts strettching battles, I mean gambling games as far as it can. At one point there are several consequential episodes that happen at the same place and even on the same spot - they\'re drawn out because of ""internal monologues"", of various character, people freaking out in their inner monologue, etc. Amusingly enough, as the story gets overall significantly worse in the later half, it also creates small number of actually decent moments - 2 or 3 of them total. Those are the moments when kakegurui snaps out of its desire to show endless stream of ugly deformed drooling faces or blushing/sexual expressions of the main heroine, and actually shows something decent. There is a very small number of those episodes, they\'re short (seconds long each), and are instantly over.Art: 5/10Art is surprisingly good, when it doesn\'t try to turn every character into some sort of drooling deformed monstrosity. Characters use more or less adult proportions, with no chibis, or ""small teenagers"", so if they weren\'t trying to make everything look disgusting, it would work actually fairly well. Interestingly, backgrounds are fairly dull. Because most of the anime is spent showing somebody\'s face, the backgrounds barely have any noticeable details in them. You can have people sitting in the room where there\'s nothing visible behind them, or switch around some sort of dull concrete surroundings... and stuff like that. Backgrounds aren\'t POORLy drawn, just surprisingly bland, especially for the ""corrupt school of super rich"" kind of settings.Sound: 6/10:Interesting opening /ending themes, but that\'s about it. The music is decent, but because most of the time someone is freaking out or acting crazy, there\'s not much time to enjoy it.Characters: 2/10:Abysmal. Nobody is believable. Quite a lot of characters are in jekyll and hyde mode, and constantly flip out between their somewhat normal mask, and the part where they act crazy. The main heroine is the most annoying of all of them, changing between 2 or 3 ""masks"" of hers - ""crazy gambler"", ""disgustingly naive girl"" and ""ice queen"". Male lead is spineless coward, at least he is not bespectacled, so perhaps this is a progress. There are no believable interactions in the series between any two characters. The overall atmosphere is ""eat or be eaten"", so everybody goes full villain mode towards pretty much everybody else at the first opportunity.An extremely annoying thing about characters is that they to quickly switch from being enemies to acting like some sort of buddies, which is completely unbelievable, since there was not enough character development to support that kind of behavior. It looks odd, out of place and not believable at all.Enjoyment: 3/10:Thought I\'d like it, but nope. The whole ""let\'s act like a drooling lunatic"" thing started getting on my nerves, and eventually some of the characters got on my nerves too. Maybe original material was better, I don\'t know, but as things stand now, you\'ll have better story material and character development in a hentai anime compared to this.Overall: 3/10:Not recommended. Feel free to check the first episode, maybe you\'ll find something you enjoy, but I think there are better anime out of there.

I dropped it after the first episode, so I didn't think a review was necessary. Recently a friend of mine told me to re-watch the first and give it the 3 ep test and now I really wanna writeKakegurui takes place at a high school for the rich that values gambling skills over traditional academics. Yumeko is a rebel without a cause who breaks all the rules; main protagonist who came to play some games. There's a sidekick, but he's kind of just there to make Yumeko look cooler. Each week there's...a new challenge, but it's all kiddie games in the end.The premise is both a dream and a nightmare. I'm sure a bunch of kids would love to swap their classes for gambling, but those kids have no idea what they're talking about. Why teach people stupid sh*t like English, math, economics, philosophy, etc. when it's a lot more productive to bet millions of yen on Rock paper scissors.I've seen a lot of praise for this series and I can't understand why.I've read most of the reviews and it reminded me why nobody takes MAL seriously.I've seen a lot of 10s and I would say this is between 0-1.There's probably people who think the first 3 eps were quality, but you're wrong.Why you may ask? Well here we goSo the first problem is the school itself. Having kids gamble could've actually worked in a school setting. You'd be surprised what some people can do with a higher education and a gambling addiction; most extreme example I can think of was using math used for space travel to predict football games.(If you're interested in the link PM me)The life of a gambler is something worth exploringBut they don't really do anything with this premise.They actually f*ck the gambling up too, but i'll get to that later1st scene:For those of you unaware, a fullhouse in 5 card poker is almost unbeatable. Usually a pair will take the pot, which is why it's not played very often.Having a FH get beat by a RF, is something that'll happen 1 in a lifetime if you're unlucky, but you'd be a braindead moron to not go all in with that handNARRATOR: we value gambling luck herethis set the tone perfectly, because gambling in this world is all about luck.In 3 episodes I have no idea what the point of these games are.They're betting what appears to be a lot of money, but there's no context as to how much Yumeko is playing with.I think it's kinda important to have dramatic stakes is your gambling anime.I also think that there should be consequences for losing, but episode 3 treats debt as one huge joke.So with no clue what's at stake, the victories don't feel satisfying and even when Yumeko loses, the plot will dig her out of it.I get some people have a lot of tolerance to bad writing, but in 3 episodes they've killed all possible dramatic tension for the future.

I'm sure a bunch of kids would love to swap their classes for gambling, but those kids have no idea what they're talking about. Why teach people stupid sh*t like English, math, economics, philosophy, etc. when it's a lot more productive to bet millions of yen on Rock paper scissors.I've seen a lot of praise for this series and I can't understand why.I've read most of the reviews and it reminded me why nobody takes MAL seriously.I've seen a lot of 10s and I would say this is between 0-1.There's probably people who think the first 3 eps were quality, but you're wrong.Why you may ask? Well here we goSo the first problem is the school itself. Having kids gamble could've actually worked in a school setting. You'd be surprised what some people can do with a higher education and a gambling addiction; most extreme example I can think of was using math used for space travel to predict football games.(If you're interested in the link PM me)The life of a gambler is something worth exploringBut they don't really do anything with this premise.They actually f*ck the gambling up too, but i'll get to that later1st scene:For those of you unaware, a fullhouse in 5 card poker is almost unbeatable. Usually a pair will take the pot, which is why it's not played very often.Having a FH get beat by a RF, is something that'll happen 1 in a lifetime if you're unlucky, but you'd be a braindead moron to not go all in with that handNARRATOR: we value gambling luck herethis set the tone perfectly, because gambling in this world is all about luck.In 3 episodes I have no idea what the point of these games are.They're betting what appears to be a lot of money, but there's no context as to how much Yumeko is playing with.I think it's kinda important to have dramatic stakes is your gambling anime.I also think that there should be consequences for losing, but episode 3 treats debt as one huge joke.So with no clue what's at stake, the victories don't feel satisfying and even when Yumeko loses, the plot will dig her out of it.I get some people have a lot of tolerance to bad writing, but in 3 episodes they've killed all possible dramatic tension for the future.

A friend of mine suggested it and I thought ""aight let\'s give it a shot"". And man am I disappointed at this anime...It just falls flat on its face. The characters are exaggerations and lack depth. We basically get ""haha this girl is obsessed with gambling, look!"". No, not just once, but EVERY... - I REPEAT: EVERY EPISODE.Gambling anime are about cheating and finding novel and interesting ways to solve problems, however,The techniques and strategies that the gamblers use in Kakegurui lack imagination and just feel STALE. Bending the edge of a card to mark it -...Seriously? This is ancient knowledge everyone is aware of. There are numerous others but they are just too simple, stuff like signalling during teamplay when communication is not allowed. Ugh. Kaiji does it better. The tension, the atmosphere, the psychological horror of it... it\'s all ""404 Not Found"" in Kakegurui.I was utterly bored at the main character for lacking any form of humanity. She just likes to gamble and there\'s nothing more to her. I don\'t know her, her feelings (besides the obsession with gambling), and her motivations. Boring! Couldn\'t care less about her or any of the other characters. The sexual undertone that describes the character\'s affection to gambling doesn\'t do it for me either. Utterly boring.If this is your first gambling anime and you decided ""gambling anime aren\'t for me"", then go watch Kaiji: Ultimate Survivor which does gambling RIGHT. Instead of gambling for fun like they do in Kakegurui, Kaiji gambles to actually survive because he\'s just in a bad position in life.Overall: 3What a waste of time. Should\'ve dropped it but was always hoping for a change of pace/style. Art was alright though. Seriously? This is ancient knowledge everyone is aware of.

Should\'ve dropped it but was always hoping for a change of pace/style. Art was alright though.', 'Kakegurui is a Kawamoto Homura manga that\'s been adapted into both anime and live action forms. The first series of the anime came out in 2017 from MAPPA. The same studio that we only forgive for Sakamichi no Apollon because they proved they can do well with Dororo. Let\'s see how they did with this one.Story:Our tale takes place in a prestigious school where the children of rich and powerful families are allowed to gamble away their futures. For at this school, gambling is considered justice and all students take on gambles. Our protagonist is transfer student Jabami Yumeko. A girl who joins the school...to sate her gambling fetish and wants nothing more than the opportunity to go up against the student council.For the sake of argument, let\'s pretend the premise isn\'t completely, irredeemably stupid. Let\'s pretend there\'s some logic to a school like this being allowed to exist. So, what\'s wrong with the story when we allow for that? First off, there\'s no real tension to it. Our protagonist doesn\'t give a shit what happens to her when she gambles. Which means that when her opponent comes in and asks her to gamble her future, or some such thing, there\'s no reason to get invested since she very blatantly isn\'t concerned.A broader issue is that her gambles end kind of predictably. There\'s a case in particular where they participate in a ""debt erasing"" poker game and you know which character is going to lose as soon as the game begin. You also know which character is going to win because it\'s clearly set up. It\'s also pretty obvious which gambles Jabami isn\'t going to lose. To make things worse, it\'s obvious which ones she\'s going to draw.The only positive thing I can give the narrative is that it can be kind of interesting to see Jabami figure out how her opponent\'s cheating and turn it against them. Or to see her figure out how to beat the odds when they\'re stacked against her.Characters:The cast in this is quite bad. Jabami\'s whole shtick is that she gets caught up in the ecstasy of gambling and behaves in an irrational way that catches her opponents off guard. She probably spends tens of millions of yen on loot boxes every week. And the other characters in this have even less to them than that. They\'re pretty much one-note characters who are there to get swept up by Jabami\'s psychosis.Art:This series thrives on the spectacle of its scenarios. And a part of that involves artwork that\'s either overtly sexualised or absolutely hideous. This series loves to have its girls getting really close and cuddling up. As for the really ugly scenes, think of what the Phoenix Wright breakdown scenes would look like if they were considerably more grotesque and bereft of any charm and you have this series\' idea of intense.Sound:The acting in this gravitates towards bombastic over-exaggeration that\'s so bad it makes Brian Blessed\'s most over the top performance seem subtle. Particularly during those scenes that are supposed to come across as intense. The music is pretty decent. So, that\'s the best element to the series.Ho-yay:There are two girls, Ikishima & Igarashi, with very blatant romantic interests in other girls. This series also has a fetish for positioning its girls in ship teasing fashions. But don\'t get the wrong idea. There aren\'t any proper relationships betwixt any of the girls. That would require being able to write semi-decent human interaction.Areas of Improvement:Even the slightest hint of character depth would be nice.Put the gambling underground instead of in a school. You could pretty easily rework the premise to have a bunch of children from influential families engaging in illicit gambling in a more clandestine fashion. All you\'d lose would be the house pet system, which you could work around.Draw proper faces. All these scenes with overly pronounced teeth, bugged out eyes and such that are supposed to be intense are just ugly looking.Final Thoughts:This one is easily as bad as Sakamichi no Apollon. Granted, the characters aren\'t as obnoxious but the bombastic, over the top and downright ugly aesthetic is definitely just as bad in its own way. That\'s why I\'m giving this a 3/10. to sate her gambling fetish and wants nothing more than the opportunity to go up against the student council.For the sake of argument, let\'s pretend the premise isn\'t completely, irredeemably stupid.

In this instance that character is Ryouta Suzui.In case you are like me and don't realize that he will apparently be not only a main character, but a narrator for much of the plot, please don't be fooled.I was hoping that we could perhaps get a show without the typical simpering useless male lead that so many anime suffer from. This show barely has him...in the poster and doesn't mention him at all in the description. Yet he somehow manages to ruin every scene of the first episode by being there.On her own Yumeko Jabami is an extremely interesting and unique main character. Instead of relying entirely on her, for some reason the writers felt it necessary to add in this bland boy to explain all of the intense moments to us like we're toddlers and to treat Yumeko like a pair of pretty boobs.If you think you can get past or don't mind a character like Ryouta too much, then it was fairly fun to watch Yumeko be her insane badass self. Otherwise, here is my warning. I would give this a pass. in the poster and doesn't mention him at all in the description.

Of course, this isn't necessarily the message that the anime wants to send us, but it reflects a big problem in our society, so that's always a plus.I understand that the anime exaggerates with Yumeko - the main character - and her body, and I'm not necessarily a fan. Sometimes it's really exaggerated, sometimes uncomfortable, but I understand that she plays on that. That said, I don't watch an anime about gambling to see someone have an orgasm every 5 minutes.Obviously, it's not really an anime to be taken seriously and there are still some fun...moments, but it's disturbing. moments, but it's disturbing."", 'Ah yes good old kakegurui.

I’m not a huge fan a hentai so the first time I watched that scene I thought the anime would end up being like school days. I’m now going to talk about how horrible and shitty thee community itself is,...I already said that gacha life had ruined the anime one hundred percent from making “ships”, that most likely won’t become canon such as yumeko x midari. Also the cringe  level is insane in TikTok how they basically sexualize the characters. I’m finished speaking with the cringe side of the anime! Now I’ll move on to my full based opinion. The art style is okay, yet I think they put to much detail on the girls eyes and lips. I don’t rucking know why, but it seems like the girls in the show are real life women due to the insane amount of detail. Like many others I prefer kaiji over kakegurui because it shows more character development and it has a good storyline. In my opinion the show is just about a bunch of teenagers and shit acting like they are rich mafia leaders and if you loose you become their toy. Yeah yeah, it s a gambling anime what would you expect yet it’s garbage and has no plot to it whatsoever.Overall, it gets a 2/10 for me due to the bullshit storyline and absolutely no plot.

Sure it might seem a thrilling idea, but in reality it lacks any bite or consequence.The story is pretty basing and boring. Local gambling girl takes on various opponents in different games. The actual games played come quick and fast and there's barely any time to get into the games, so they're all pretty simple and predictable games. The biggest sin this 'gambling' anime commits is there are practically no consequences from any of the gambles going on, with the protagonist casually throwing away money or consequences never being...picked up on or ignored. Even the big ending gamble just results in a draw, so it might as well have not happened. There's no insight into the protagonist's thoughts so it's basically a game of waiting for her to call out the cheating going on whilst never being affected by the events around her. All its attempts to escalate the stakes fall flat and it comes off as pretty bad.The art? Pretty decent. Some moments definitely shine above others and the facial expressions can be so hilariously distracting when the rest of the show tries to come across as pretty highschool girls. There's nothing particularly standout about it but there's nothing too bad about it either, it's rather hard to talk about honestly. The only thing hugely interesting are the facial expressions and they come across as over the top and hilarious more than anything.The actual sound design of the show is pretty good. The soundtrack is nice and catchy and it's very fitting for a gambling anime with some jazzy pieces and tense numbers. The ED in particular is a personal favourite. Unless you want to watch some honest to goodness shlock, i'd recommend listening to the soundtrack on its own, it's much better than the show.There's not much character to be had here. The protagonist has two settings. Nice, demure high school girl and crazy broad who orgasms over gambling. Most of the cast just generally get pretty insane over gambling to the point of hilarity with a triage of generic melancholy backstories of great expectations to over saturate them to the point of meaninglessness. Most of them tend to go through 'development' over just one speech from the protagonist and the villains are all pretty one note and boring, again with just two settings, casual and gambling crazy.In terms of enjoyment, I had an utter blast watching Kakegarui. I can see why it has a positive score honestly because it's honestly kind of hilarious to sit through, see all the ridiculous cheating methods and stupid facial expressions the characters pull.

Nothing more, nothing less. However, the story has many plot holes.First of all, why no one from school staff does not give a damn about the activities of the students? Gambling is illegal for minors, and since the characters are teens in high school. I don't even know if it's right to call their school school. It's more of a casino than school.The second thing is, what's wrong with parents letting their children gamble with such huge amounts...of money?

Its always the same, the gambling methods are the same, there's no character drama at all. The only reason I didn't give this a 1/10 is because the characters at least have some good depth and look somewhat appealing.

This review will be examining the biggest problems in this anime its plot, characters, stakes and intensity.The PlotBrief Summary: This anime is set in an elitist school where the children seem to get away with gambling and nearly every character getting off on the thrill of it especially the new transfer student Yumeko.Problems: Where are the teachers in this so called school? Why are they not supervising the students? These questions are left unanswered, as the rich children...gamble away money with hardly any consequences. It is also another anime where they picture the student council as these \'Gods\' but thanks to luck, Yumeko has literally no problems winning the gambles against these so called smart characters.The CharactersYumeko: A character only popular because ""OMG! She is like so crazyyy and oh yeah hot waifu!!!!!"", she is clever for no apparent reason, somehow knows the weights of a loaded pistol (which is never explained as to how she knows this) and always wins except when there are no stakes. The anime makes the fact that she will always win obvious for example there is no way she is losing the gamble where her life is on the line (e.g. with the pistol this scene literally happens midway through the anime) and when she is gambling against that pathetic weird rapist kid.The other characters: There is really not that much to say all of them have no redeeming qualities and can be described in simple terms; crazy girl who masturbates in the toilets, rapist guy, smart guy with glasses, idol, male who goes all shy when around Yumeko and the evil student council leader. Wow! What an interesting bunch!The StakesThis is one of the biggest problems I have with this anime, the stakes are so stupid.  For example when Yumeko takes on the idol and shockingly wins, the idol\'s leaked recordings are exposed and what are the consequences? Nothing, the incel simps which are in attendance blurt out that they still love her even though she hates them and then the idol and Yumeko sing. Also, for example when Yumeko loses it could have not been more obvious as the only consequence was that she would become a housepet which happens to those that lose all their money. However, Yumeko is not treated harshly by her classmates as seen with other housepets rather she acts like a cat for some of that fan service. A further problem I have with this anime is when the students gamble for example 5 million yen and get upset when they lose, this school is quite clearly betrayed as elitist and upper class. How is it possible that these rich snobs can\'t afford 5 million yen? Did their parents offshore accounts get hacked?The IntensityTo show why the intensity of Kakegurui is an issue of mine, I want to use another gambling anime such as Kaiji as an example. In Kaiji, the intensity is gripping due to its iconic music such as the \'Zawa\' sound effect, the close up looks of the characters faces and the amazing charismatic voice of the narrator. Kakegurui fails to do this, instead on relying on miserable fan service and Yumeko\'s eyes turning red because she is crazy!!! The intensity, is also ruined as in basically every single gamble Yumeko\'s opponent is cheating (shock horror!) and she then explains how they are cheating making her opponent\'s breakdown. This is clearly supposed to show Yumeko as being smart, in my opinion it just makes her opponents seem dumb especially when it is made so obvious to the audience what Yumeko will do.ConclusionKakegurui is quite simply put a failure of a gambling anime although I will give its props when it comes to its opening which is quite catchy. It failed to make me interested in any of its characters or its plot and I doubt I will ever bring myself to watch its second season. gamble away money with hardly any consequences. It is also another anime where they picture the student council as these \'Gods\' but thanks to luck, Yumeko has literally no problems winning the gambles against these so called smart characters.The CharactersYumeko: A character only popular because ""OMG! She is like so crazyyy and oh yeah hot waifu!!!!!"", she is clever for no apparent reason, somehow knows the weights of a loaded pistol (which is never explained as to how she knows this) and always wins except when there are no stakes. The anime makes the fact that she will always win obvious for example there is no way she is losing the gamble where her life is on the line (e.g. with the pistol this scene literally happens midway through the anime) and when she is gambling against that pathetic weird rapist kid.The other characters: There is really not that much to say all of them have no redeeming qualities and can be described in simple terms; crazy girl who masturbates in the toilets, rapist guy, smart guy with glasses, idol, male who goes all shy when around Yumeko and the evil student council leader. Wow! What an interesting bunch!The StakesThis is one of the biggest problems I have with this anime, the stakes are so stupid.  For example when Yumeko takes on the idol and shockingly wins, the idol\'s leaked recordings are exposed and what are the consequences? Nothing, the incel simps which are in attendance blurt out that they still love her even though she hates them and then the idol and Yumeko sing. Also, for example when Yumeko loses it could have not been more obvious as the only consequence was that she would become a housepet which happens to those that lose all their money. However, Yumeko is not treated harshly by her classmates as seen with other housepets rather she acts like a cat for some of that fan service. A further problem I have with this anime is when the students gamble for example 5 million yen and get upset when they lose, this school is quite clearly betrayed as elitist and upper class. How is it possible that these rich snobs can\'t afford 5 million yen?

Shenhai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/44212/Shenhai,"['(Spoiler-free Review)I just watched this in the theaters as I\'m currently located in China. Overall, it was a fantastic experience.Story (7/10): The story of Shenhai was pretty interesting. It is about a girl Shenxiu （参宿） who ended up in this fantasy world deep under the sea searching for her mother who she has not contacted for a while. She was guided by this mysterious sea creature but ended up in a restaurant run by humanoid fish and seals. The restaurant was run by Nanhe (南河),  a greedy owner of the restaurant who cares only about making money. Much of the story was very...abstract and reflected themes of loneliness, depression, and hope. Overall this story had a very strong ""Spirited Away"" vibe to it, despite being original in its own way.Art (10/10): The art was simply fantastic. Especially, in portraying the surreal world. Everything looks so colorful and it had a very strong Chinese vibe. Also, the 3D effect was simply beautiful. I would definitely recommend watching this in the theaters if possible.Sound (8/10): The sound was beautiful. Although none of its music was particularly memorable, it fits the vibe perfectly. Also, the voice acting was pretty on par.Characters (9/10): All the main characters are multidimensional and had many sides to them. The background story of the main character Shenxiu was done really well. Her parents divorced when she was young and she ended being neglected as her father remarried and had another child. This led her to obvious signs of depression as she seemed hopeless and apathetic in this movie as she wanders to try to find her mother. No one is perfect in “Shenhai.” At first, you will probably not like Nanhe at first but he does have a benevolent side as well despite being super greedy in the beginning.Enjoyment (8/10):  This donghua was very enjoyable. Although the middle was slow, I was overall mind-blown by the visual effects. The story was also interesting reflecting deeper themes that most animated films fail to reflect.Reviewer’s Rating: 8 (I’m generally pretty strict when it comes to rating but this film is definitely underrated. Watch it in the theaters in 3D if possible, but even 2D should definitely be a great mind trip.) abstract and reflected themes of loneliness, depression, and hope.

Strike the Blood: Valkyria no Oukoku-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/30321/Strike_the_Blood__Valkyria_no_Oukoku-hen,"[""Having finished StB awhile back, I was eager to see what they would add in this OVA- perhaps a tad too eager. This OVA essentially adds an additional arc where La Folia's family visits Kojou's island, bringing along with them various troubles including a very protective father/king. The arc is completely offset from the main plot and doesn't really contribute much to the main show. What's more, they managed to beat down Kojou's personality and character a few levels; it feels to me like what KGNE's OVA did to Haruka- total injustice.If you really liked StB and really want more then by all means dig...in, though be warned that it isn't anywhere near the best that StB has to offer.Animation:The animation quality is pretty similar to the parent show, in other words pretty good. Expect all the main heroines to make appearances, even if they don't contribute meaningfully to the plot. There is a fair amount of action similar in nature to what we've already seen. The fights here aren't particularly long and involve the spamming of lots of shiny particles. There isn't actually any blood spilled in the OVA, instead they decided to focus on ecchi. Expect Kojou to lose his reservations towards ecchi acts and, for instance, show up buck naked to a bath with our other heroines who are of course topless. I still have a hard time believing that Yukina is supposedly 14...Sound:The OVA opens with a fast-paced but melodically weak OP and closes with a nice and calming song reminiscent of the parent show's ED- the singer's vibrato is pretty unique. The BGM borrows from the parent show and performs its role adequately.The VAs all return from the parent show though I feel like Yoshimasa Hosoya had an off performance; he came across as a lot weaker than during the main show. Otherwise, you can expect solid work from Saori Oonishi, Risa Taneda, and Asami Seto. There are some new VAs in the form of La Folie's parents (including Mamiko Noto!) and new antagonists.Story:The story is a simple linear plot with good rising action and a decent overall progression. Given the length of the OVA, it's hard to say much in concrete terms without spoiling the fun. I will note that the climax is the kind of cliche that I've grown quite tired of and ended in an all too predictable way. Regardless, it was still a pretty entertaining watch; and given the early rising action, you'll probably want to finish the entire OVA in one sitting.Character:Despite the average-at-best plot, the character interactions are still fun; you still get Yukina desperately trying to hide her affections for our protagonist for one. In addition, you now get La Folia's family weighing in on her attachment to Kojou.There are some blemishes here as well though. As is typical for these short pieces, there isn't much character growth. Likewise, you can expect pitiful, undeveloped antagonists. And of course, what I alluded to before, Kojou's character goes downhill here; let's just say he's not himself.Value:Overall, it isn't a bad OVA, I just happened to set my expectations way too high for it. It adds a mild arc that doesn't add to the parent story but is decently entertaining if a tad outlandish (in terms of climax and ecchi). The OVA is a fair, but nonetheless disappointing, addition to the StB franchise. in, though be warned that it isn't anywhere near the best that StB has to offer.Animation:The animation quality is pretty similar to the parent show, in other words pretty good.

Tales of Zestiria the Cross: Saiyaku no Jidai,https://myanimelist.net/anime/33558/Tales_of_Zestiria_the_Cross__Saiyaku_no_Jidai,"['Tales of Zestiria, the franchise based on the game. To be clear, the prologue is literally the special that apparently takes place before the main series. Dubbed also as “Tales of Zestiria the X Prologue: The Age of Chaos”, it stars protagonist Alisha as she investigates a strange phenomena that has hit the kingdom of Hyland.For those unfamiliar with the game, I think it’s safe to venture into watching this without a decent knowledge. Although judging on the setting, it’s probably a good idea to get familiarized with the world fiction as the show has high fantasy elements. The special episode contains elements of...fantasy that portrays peculiar characters such as Lunarre and weapons that you’ll easily find in fantasy genre games.Meanwhile, the special episode can also be rather confusing to watch as events unfold from the start. One of the main characters, Clemm gets caught into a violent catastrophe that puts her life in danger. Furthermore, Alisha and her crew runs into a strange female character with dark magic-like abilities. For it’s worth, the episode pretty much feels like it drops the story into the middle of nowhere for viewers. What I would recommend is watch the 44-minute special episode OVA (Tales of Zestiria: Doushi no Yoake) to get familiar with the franchise. It’s also noticeable that Sorey (the main male protagonist) is absent from this special. As such, Alisha is the main focus and her character is already established as a courageous heroine who puts others’ lives above her own.However, the story itself appears to be more of an abbreviated version of the franchise. It’s more of an attempt to hook people into watching for the main series. In particular, we can easily recognize the stellar production quality by studio ufotable. Similarly, the music produced by Sakuraba Motoi shows his talent with the high quality OST. There’s also some bits of world building although it’s far more likely that the main series will expand more into that. In addition, the episode makes it clear that there’s mysterious forces at works.  So should you watch this?

I think it is, but I'll talk about it anyway. The music in this episode was nothing short of majestic. It felt sweeping and epic, and it made many of the ending scenes feel that much more grand. Obviously, though, the real pièce de résistance in ufotable works is the art. In this particular episode, everything from the smoke...to the fire to the water to the lighting was done to perfection. This is potentially the only studio that will ever be able to pull of CGI elements in their anime and this one is no exception. There's this amazing moment during this episode where the ground is literally upheaved, and it was animated beautifully.At this stage, there isn't much to say about the story or the characters since this is only one episode, but I will say they hooked me. The storytelling in this episode built to a crescendo in a lovely way. You'll understand if you watch it, but the pacing of it was quite nice. This isn't much of a review-like statement as much as it is an opinion, but the sections of the characters we did get to see in this episode were probably the parts of the characters we needed to see to get excited about what's to come, so good on you, ufotable. Another thing this studio does really well, in my opinion, is fighting sequences, and this episode also showcased that nicely as well.The reason I haven't given this episode a ten despite all that stuff I just said is partially because it was simply a single episode, and it's difficult to earn a ten on just that, but it's also because it didn't explain much at all. For a prequel, I thought that what was happening on screen was going to be explained a little better than it was. That's what I usually expect out of prequels anyway. If it gets explained in the main series, then great, but I felt like this episode should've given me a firmer foundation to leap off of going forward.

Nazo no Kanojo X,https://myanimelist.net/anime/12467/Nazo_no_Kanojo_X,"[""Now, now, now. I've been informed that certain people think that Nazo no Kanojo is ecchi. I've also been informed that a lot of people think it's bad that it has some originality. Well, guess what? It ain't so. Not often will you find an anime which revolves around drool, and this one did a damn fine job in doing so. So, you think that people sharing drool is nasty? Well, guess what, it is. Oh, but you watched only the first episode of the anime and took upon yourself to be an arse and immediatelly toss it aside? Well, guess what, not all anime...start off great. There needs to be progress. Fluidity. And damn right I'm not gonna sit by idly while a perfectly good anime is being dissed.Now, let me start this review right.The storyline is about a guy. Not your generic anime guy without a personality/cowardly/insanely courageous guy, no; it's about a simple highschool boy with his unique personality. And, by a game of chance, he tastes the spit(yeah, kinda gross, but come on, you do that when kissing as well) of a new girl in class. Now, that new girl is kind of weird. She starts laughing in the middle of class without apparent reason, she's not socialising with anyone, and half her face is covered with bangs. And yet, this guy falls in love with her. And then, in time, he realises he's hit the jackpot. Now, her personality has been presented extraordingly. She's unorthodox, and mysterious, and I think that this anime will need a season 2 in order to fully explain her backstory. Now, let me move on from the characters.The storyline progresses pretty slowly, as it should with highschoolers, but not slow enough to make you bored. It's reasonably paced and will make you anxious in about what'll happen in the next episode. I think they were low on budget, so they couldn't make more episodes, but if there were more, I'm damn sure they would be even more awesome.The animation reminded me of old style. I'm talking before 2000 animation here, and it invokes a wonderful feeling of nostalgy and familiarity. Not too much fanservice in my oppinion, just the right mix. Didn't register many flaws in it, really.Now, the music. It's WONDERFUL. Track 04 from the anime, dream, is composed to reflect the mystique and the weird nature of Urabe (female protagonist). Not too thrilled about op and ed though, but thye're not bad. The songs playing during certain scenes in the anime are exceptionally fitting and they don't get boring quickly.And, finally, my overall and my grade.Overall, this is an unorthodox anime, with an original storyline and plot, and damn right it shouldn't be cast aside for trying something new. It has almost no mistakes/errors and it's pretty well made. It's one of the better romances I watched, and it differs from all others with it's unique way of presenting and developing the feelings of the characters; and that's why, this anime will make it in my top 5, along with GITS, NGE, Bakemonogatari and Toradora.My overall grade is 9, and I reccomend everyone to watch this anime, and not to give up in the first episode.Over and out, please submit your feedback about my first review :D start off great. There needs to be progress. Fluidity. And damn right I'm not gonna sit by idly while a perfectly good anime is being dissed.Now, let me start this review right.The storyline is about a guy. Not your generic anime guy without a personality/cowardly/insanely courageous guy, no; it's about a simple highschool boy with his unique personality. And, by a game of chance, he tastes the spit(yeah, kinda gross, but come on, you do that when kissing as well) of a new girl in class. Now, that new girl is kind of weird. She starts laughing in the middle of class without apparent reason, she's not socialising with anyone, and half her face is covered with bangs. And yet, this guy falls in love with her. And then, in time, he realises he's hit the jackpot. Now, her personality has been presented extraordingly. She's unorthodox, and mysterious, and I think that this anime will need a season 2 in order to fully explain her backstory. Now, let me move on from the characters.The storyline progresses pretty slowly, as it should with highschoolers, but not slow enough to make you bored. It's reasonably paced and will make you anxious in about what'll happen in the next episode. I think they were low on budget, so they couldn't make more episodes, but if there were more, I'm damn sure they would be even more awesome.The animation reminded me of old style. I'm talking before 2000 animation here, and it invokes a wonderful feeling of nostalgy and familiarity. Not too much fanservice in my oppinion, just the right mix. Didn't register many flaws in it, really.Now, the music. It's WONDERFUL. Track 04 from the anime, dream, is composed to reflect the mystique and the weird nature of Urabe (female protagonist). Not too thrilled about op and ed though, but thye're not bad. The songs playing during certain scenes in the anime are exceptionally fitting and they don't get boring quickly.And, finally, my overall and my grade.Overall, this is an unorthodox anime, with an original storyline and plot, and damn right it shouldn't be cast aside for trying something new.

However, although Nazo no Kanojo X goes to the absolute extremes of weirdness in some areas, it is perhaps the single most realistic in others.So I'm not going to talk about the drool, that may be what drew me to Nazo no Kanojo X initially, but it is not what kept me watching, it is not the part that I love about this anime.Most romance anime, especially school-based romance, are ludicrously unrealistic. We see the tsundere girl, the...weak, whingey guy. We see the noble, unfaltering cool guy and the submissive girl. Characters that are, for all intents and purposes, completely rooted in fiction.Worse yet, we're often presented with a female character that has absolutely no control over her sexual urges, once the MC breaks down a few walls. We are given characters who are offensive to men, offensive to women and completely unrealistic.Because of this, we are often presented with a type of romance which can only exist in the anime world. A type of romance that, if we were to try to emulate in real life, would end in utter catastrophe. This is where Nazo no Kanojo X surpasses all others and stands up as the pinnacle of anime romance, in my book. The utter realism that it shows us.I see a lot of myself, or perhaps my former self, in Tsubaki. Everything he does, I can remember myself doing at-least once in a previous relationship. From flirting with an ex-crush, to not wanting others to see her after a new haircut, wanting her all to myself.Tsubaki is a good reflection of most of the 'regular guys' in their first relationships. We, who watch anime and may not be the best at sports. We might not be the top of our class, but we know a thing or two. The regular guy.He is a cacophony of contradictions. He has an inferiority complex, but believes he can get better. He is needy, but sometimes wants space away from Urabe. He is proud of his girlfriend, but in some ways ashamed. Love doesn't make sense, love is rife with contradictions and Tsubaki represents them perfectly.He is almost like a mirror of myself, back in the day but, hopefully, not anymore. Don't get me wrong, he is very likable. He is not the whingey MC we're used to, he's not the asshole, he's not clueless. But that doesn't mean I necessarily want to be him.Now we see Urabe. Beautiful, shy, strange, kind, strong, talented, awkward, uncomfortable. There are so many words to describe Urabe, but submissive and reliant aren't some of them.She represents the real girl. She gets sad when Tsubaki hurts her, very sad. But she doesn't get on her knees and beg. She gets turned on by Tsubaki, sure. But she isn't taken aback by sexual emotions, emotions which take complete control of her mind and body.She's not quite an open book, but she's not mean - she's very kind. She's not submissive, dependent or a tsundere. She doesn't represent any of the offensive female characters we see in most romance anime. She is real.And best yet, although there are other love interests - there is no ridiculously unrealistic harem.I'm not a girl, so I don't know what this anime gives them. But if you're a single guy wanting to know what real first relationships are like, watch this anime. If you're a needy, dependent, possessive guy in a relationship and want to see a reflection of all of your negative aspects; watch this anime. I wholeheartedly believe that Nazo no Kanojo X can teach you about love, about real love. An aspect which most romance anime fall completely flat on. weak, whingey guy.

When I heard that the manga was getting an anime adaption, I looked forward to seeing other people's reactions to the synopsis almost as much as the show itself. Perhaps a fair few WTFs amongst viewers who've never read the manga?The story is simple. Boy encounters transfer girl. Boy deliberately tastes girl's drool on a desk. Boy falls in love with girl after that. Um, yeah.The drool. If there's anything in this series that would turn off those who watch it, it'll obviously be the various saliva-swapping scenes. Personally, I don't think it's that bad. If it helps, think...of it as an inevitable aspect of French kissing except without any lips touching. Nor tongues. Nor sensation. Well maybe sensation, in the form of the recipient of the drool experiencing the other's mood or feelings. Perhaps not as romantic though. But it's mostly down to individual tolerance levels for the things you find okay in anime; the same with fanservice, blood and gore, hentai, etc.The series closely explores the slow-building but charming relationship between the main characters, inside and outside of high school. It's quite different to the romances found in other anime. After all, who shows affection by ripping up a photo of a previous crush as opposed to holding hands or kissing to start a relationship? And that's just one of many examples. Although it rarely feels out of place, there is some ecchi and fanservice present.Saying that Mikoto Urabe is weird would be a huge understatement. At times in her relationship she just seems like a normal shy and compassionate girl underneath a cold demeanour, but her hobbies and certain superhuman abilities makes her more than that. She's a compelling character to watch however, and her various quirks (Fits of laughter? Scissors?!) are what makes the anime so addictive, along with her bond to Akira Tsubaki. Tsubaki is a relatively normal character, despite his attraction to Urabe's drool, and it's fun to see him cope with being the boyfriend of such a strange person and the requirements that come with the role; romancing Urabe is much harder than he thinks. The anime mainly focuses on the odd couple so important side characters are limited, but two of their classmates, Kouhei Ueno and Ayuko Oka, provide some extra entertainment; the playful and wild Oka has a particularly big influence in how the relationship develops between Urabe and Tsubaki.The art style of Mysterious Girlfriend X is excellent and rather interesting. It goes for an older style of animation, and reminds me of anime that were made a decade or two ago, back when clichés were still original ideas. Backgrounds are also quite nice, especially parts of the school like the classroom and gardens as well as the surrounding town. However, I'm still undecided as to whether I like the character models retained from the manga, which are sharp and detailed but make the 17-year old students look like they're in middle school rather than high school.The series makes use of a variety of background music that is sombre and mysterious, but also some which makes you think of a circus, and this works well with Urabe's character and the strangeness of the show itself. A few soothing melodies are thrown into the mix too. The OP is a catchy and upbeat song that fits with the high school setting, while the ED is also good and has a nice tune. The voice acting is decent all around; the voice actress for the role of Urabe is a newcomer but she's done an especially good job.Overall Mysterious Girlfriend X, or Nazo no Kanojo X, is about a bizarre high school romance with unique additions in the form of drool with multiple and mysterious effects, excessive nose-bleeding and a very weird yet enjoyable character in Mikoto Urabe. This anime is sure to captivate some viewers while alienating others but like the manga, it does what it sets out to do with a passing grade. And that is to provide us with an entry in the genre that feels fun and more than just a little different.

I found this series by clicking through recommendations starting from 'Kimi ni Todoke', how I arrived here I don't recall, but thank goodness I did.I don't think I've come across anything as unique as this. The story line was out of this world but not so far out that it is unwatchable.The art was a plus for me, it was clean and easy to look at. The characters are very well designed. It was only 13 episodes, but I felt like I really got to...know them well.The soundtrack was very well thought out and really added to the experience of watching the story develop.I'm almost tempted to hit up the manga to see if it goes any further. I was left wanting more.Definitely not a waste of my time. Give it a go. If you get through episode one, you will shoot through the next 12 very quickly. know them well.The soundtrack was very well thought out and really added to the experience of watching the story develop.I'm almost tempted to hit up the manga to see if it goes any further.

They wonder what kind of girl they\'ll be with for their first time.""TL;DR: boy meets girl, hen things happen, no general romantic shit.The series starts very cliched. We have The Ordinary High School Student, we have The Ordinary New Transfer Student... or not that Ordinary? Yepp, new girl looks weirdo, do weirdo things, drooling as hell and, in nearly everything, isn\'t usual high school girl, filled with shyness and taboos. That\'s cool, if you gonna ask me. Main Hero aka Akira-kun despite being at top of his sexual maturation is all round nice guy,...not pervert, not bookworm etc. Perfect character to project with yourself. Also, this is goin\' to be very unusual romantic anime, just because it\'s targeted on boys and ant the same time it\'s not Yet Another Harem.

It\'s quite oldschool, but not that dried mammoth shit like in parallel Ozuma. It have that 90-s flava. So if you\'re not scred of that, you\'ll like it. I\'m glad to see so different art styles presented today at TV-anime market. 8pts.Sound. Is. Quite. Amazing. Especially for the last scene of the first episode. It\'s some parade music with trumpets and stuff. Really brings feelings of craziness, madness and only God knows what else. 9pts.Enjoyment.

First of all, if you\'re an easy people to puke because of something weird then maybe this anime is not for you, since this anime will have SO MANY scenes that will make several people go puke. like i said before, your first impression while watching this anime is DROOL, yeah, i am not kidding. but dont take...this drool is something that revolting, but take it as the PROOF of the couple\'s bond.STORYThe story began with Tsubaki Akira, our normal main character that unexpectedly meet with a weird girl, i mean REALLY weird. that girl was Urabe Mikoto. she was transfered into Tsubaki\'s school, she is known as the weirdo because yeah... she is weird in many ways. Later, in afternoon after school, Tsubaki found Urabe in classroom and still sleep. without any ecchi or dirty minds Tsubaki wakes Mikoto, after Mikoto leaves he found a pool of DROOL in her table. And surprisingly, Mikoto without any particular reason lick the drool. A few days later he become sick and Mikoto comes to his house and cure him with a weird ways, and after that again, he date with her.This anime story is very unique or maybe the uniquest one that i\'ve ever watched in another rom-com series. Maybe you will think this anime will about lovey dovey, that they will kissing, flirting, or maybe make out. if you think that way, then you\'re VERY WRONG. what makes this story interesting is Urabe Mikoto, she is not your normal-type-moe girl. I am not gonna spoil it on how weird this girl was. anyway, The execution of this anime in the storyplot os really good. i mean, at the way they end each episode was really amazing. Usually they put some cute and heartwarming scenes in the end of each episodes. and with this strategy, they really attract (especially me) the viewer to keep watching this.Sometimes, this anime maybe will make you bored if you\'re not into a romance story. Since this anime is more focussing on the way how they develops their drool-lationship and moreover, this is not-your-all-anime since some of people will probably said disgusting with ""droll"" as the main themes. But however they said, i still found this anime is romantic and pretty enjoyable.ARTThe first thing that will comes to my mind while trying this anime is 90s. I guess several people will saying the same things since this anime art was like the anime from 90s. Small eyes, the contour of the hairstyle, and even the character design Its kinda rare to see this kind of art especially in nowdays, while other anime are trying to improve their art (like SHAFT\'s anime which have an amazing art) but this anime take a risk to use an old style, but does it bad? No! its really suitable with the story itself and moreover, its like they\'re bringing you back to the 90s, nostalgic. When i thought this art will irritate me with their old style,but it didnt happen and surprisingly i really fell in love with it.The background is pretty much increasing the atmosphere of romance feels. like when in the afternoon, the sunset is pretty beautiful and when it adds with romance scenes, it feels like the scenes is getting more romantic. The coloring in this anime are also pretty colorful and bright. They really representing the mood in the anime.SOUNDFrom the sound section, there was nothing special in this. though The OP and the ED wasnt so bad, in fact it was really good, when i hear the OP and the ED, the feel of 90s really exquisite, especially the OP ""Koi no Orchestra"" by Ayako Yoshitani which is also voicing Urabe in this anime. Piano and violin is really dominant in this song. The song itself is really catchy and easy listening and moreover its really suitable with the anime which is focussing on the romance thing. For the seiyuu, they have done well with their roles. Especially for Yoshitani Ayaka. she hasnt voicing any anime characters beside Urabe but surprisingly she is good and really suits with the Urabe personality.CHARACTERThe last, Character. The focus on this anime was between the couples, Urabe Mikoto and Tsubaki Akira. since this anime was focussing on these, the character development between two of them is really touching, there was sadness, happiness, jealous, and anything like that, furthermore In my opinion this one is what makes this anime is so appealing, i cant deny that i have fallen in love with Mikoto, you can said she is weird but sometimes she shows her cute side (Until now i dont know what kind of dere she is, i think this one is a new dere type). and for Tsubaki, none to much to say for this boy, he is kind and easy to nervous around the girls. but of course he wont be a main character if he doesnt have any special nature, and for him is loyalty.OVERALLWell, many people said this anime was weird and feel so old, i dont deny if many people saying that. but i am sure what they said are cannot be accounted, since i am sure they havent see the whole episodes. and for those who are saying that, boy you have missed an amazing unique romance anime. Giving it a 8 because this anime is not especially for all, but for me, this anime is pretty much enjoyable and really fun ride to watch.Anyways, If you\'re looking for something special and bored with usual romance anime, then this anime is for you.P.S : Feedbacks are welcome* this drool is something that revolting, but take it as the PROOF of the couple\'s bond.STORYThe story began with Tsubaki Akira, our normal main character that unexpectedly meet with a weird girl, i mean REALLY weird. that girl was Urabe Mikoto. she was transfered into Tsubaki\'s school, she is known as the weirdo because yeah... she is weird in many ways.

I was expecting something f**ked up and weird, but I must admit I was expecting something more on the comedy side for some reason. Not that I dislike how f**ked up and serious this show actually is, I actually think I love it even more that way. I was expecting some crazy ecchi with just some original characters, but it doesn’t look anyway like that at all.The first thing that caught my attention with this anime is how old the animations looked. It had this grainy and low definition look to it, It was kind of a...minor disappointment. But at the same time, the animation and style reminded me of some other special show like Paprika or Serial Experiment Lain, so it did add to the seinen and dreamy style of the anime.The second thing that caught my attention was this artistic and seinen way to present the story. There is this weird atmosphere in the show, were it looks like everything is just a little bit too normal to be real. There is this calm and constant feeling that everything you are watching at the moment is important. Because every dialogue and actions are so slow, we can really appreciate the feelings behind them.Next thing that caught my attention was obviously the characters. They are unique to say the least. While Urabe is quite rapidly labelled as a weirdo, I don’t think Tsubaki is any better. Who in their right mind would taste the saliva of someone else on a whim like that? No wonder he got sick in the first place, even if it was not love sickness. But let us return to our characters, Tsubaki might look like a regular guy, but he has some pretty weird and colorful dreams, not only that, he fell in love at first sight with a girl whose face looked retarded and she had drool on her cheek while looking at him with a confused look.  I think Urabe isn’t the only one who has some mental issues.But talking of the mysterious girlfriend in question, Urabe is a lost cause, she hear voices while she sleeps in class and proceed to laugh her ass off and roll on the floor laughing. She is so antisocial that even when everyone tried to talk to her and be compassionate towards her, she still managed to avoid all the attention and stay lonely at her desk. She spent her time sleeping during lunch break, so I wonder if that girl ever actually eat and while it was only revealed in the preview for next episode, we also know that she carries around scissor in her panties to cut paper. If anything, this girl sure has a personality of her own.Overall, I am positively surprised and impressed by this show, I was not expecting something so mysterious and serious from characters that are that special. I will most definitively watch this show and cover it. I think it might fit exactly in the kind of show I love and dream of.Possibility of Watching: High minor disappointment. But at the same time, the animation and style reminded me of some other special show like Paprika or Serial Experiment Lain, so it did add to the seinen and dreamy style of the anime.The second thing that caught my attention was this artistic and seinen way to present the story. There is this weird atmosphere in the show, were it looks like everything is just a little bit too normal to be real. There is this calm and constant feeling that everything you are watching at the moment is important. Because every dialogue and actions are so slow, we can really appreciate the feelings behind them.Next thing that caught my attention was obviously the characters. They are unique to say the least. While Urabe is quite rapidly labelled as a weirdo, I don’t think Tsubaki is any better. Who in their right mind would taste the saliva of someone else on a whim like that? No wonder he got sick in the first place, even if it was not love sickness. But let us return to our characters, Tsubaki might look like a regular guy, but he has some pretty weird and colorful dreams, not only that, he fell in love at first sight with a girl whose face looked retarded and she had drool on her cheek while looking at him with a confused look.  I think Urabe isn’t the only one who has some mental issues.But talking of the mysterious girlfriend in question, Urabe is a lost cause, she hear voices while she sleeps in class and proceed to laugh her ass off and roll on the floor laughing.

It\'s just completely pathetic. I Couldn\'t even finish the first episode, it was do bad. The art was poorly done. The choice of main character is unbearable. The Sound is quite decent. But the story, how every damn thing falls in to place ; Specifically the whole ,""Oh she\'s gone, Oh she left some drool, Oh maybe I should taste it."" I don\'t know if it\'s just the type of anime meant for people who tend to be attracted towards a drool tasting fetish, but I utterly find this as an anime as dreadful as possible. I give...it a 2/10. it a 2/10.', 'Mysterious Girlfriend X. What hooked me to watch this was, of course, the drool tasting. This series made me more open-minded to watch romance-ecchi, since this was ecchi but has a good storyline.What makes this anime different from others is its uniqueness. Drool as bond is not something a couple usually has, and drool tasting is something you can\'t see everyday. Now, on to the details.This review may contain spoilers.Story: 8/10Honestly, after seeing ""ecchi"" in the tags, I thought this anime was about sex, but man I was wrong. The story is surprisingly really good. It\'s not based on sex, though you can sometimes see...Akira loosing control, since he\'s in puberty and he has a girlfriend. The story is about how Akira, live his lovelife with his mysterious girlfriend, Urabe. Urabe\'s not your ordinary girlfriend. In fact, she\'s one of the weirdest girls I\'ve seen in anime. But the plot is solid. There are scenes that made me emotional, laugh, and surprised.Art: 7/10The first episode, I thought that the art sucked, but in the long run I realized that the art contributed to the uniqueness of the anime. It\'s kind of an old-style looking anime, comparable to Ranma 1/2 or Dragonball Z, but there were looks that I really liked. I liked how the following characters were drawn:Oka, Urabe (with her other hairstyle), and Youko.Sound: 8/10This rating might be a bit biased, since I\'m a sucker to Violin, Cello, and Piano music. The producers did a pretty good job in providing background music, since the BGM matches the atmosphere of a particular scene.Character: 10/10My expectations were met (and blown away) by Urabe\'s character. Since the title of this anime was ""Mysterious Girlfriend X"", I really expected that the female protagonist should be weird, and Urabe\'s character was right on the money. Other characters like Oka, Ueno, and Akira portrayed the ""high-school student"" role very well, especially when it comes to love and dating.Enjoyment: 9/10I really, really enjoyed this anime. The drool thing was very amusing. Made me laughed a lot. This series also made me think and reflect deeply on situations related to love and dating since I never thought of drool to become a couple\'s bond.Overall: 8/10Mysterious Girlfriend X really reached my ""must-watch list"".

As a viewer, one always has options, one can always make decisions. So, if you’re planning on watching this show, you have to get past the hurdle that is the synopsis of this show. A high school student one day discovers the new transfer student asleep at her desk after school. After she hurriedly leaves, he sees a small pool of her drool on the desk, and for some unfathomable reason, he puts his finger in said drool, and takes this finger into his mouth. He licks her drool.Without getting into...the other bizarre things about this anime (the main character’s proclivity for randomly laughing, the scissors she keeps in her panties, etc.), the drool issue is the most major one to contend with. Part of this piece will be about hopefully putting “the drool issue” into a larger context regarding what this show’s actually doing. It’s fairly obvious that the show is on some level about how love, at one point or another, must lead to intimacy. The protagonists of our show, because they’re weird, don’t take the usual path in these matters. They’re inching toward intimacy, but they do it in their own particular way. Mysterious Girlfriend X, in its own weird way, celebrates the time of our lives where we groped and felt around and decided what worked and didn’t work for us, what felt right; it’s a show about our sexual exploration, and how it’s a necessary aspect of relationships.After Tsubaki, our male protagonist, tastes Urabe’s drool, he just knows he has to be with her. It’s not a question of psychology or of motivation; his body dictates it. After not tasting her drool for a couple of weeks, he’s actually bedridden and sick. It’s only after Urabe shows up and gives him her drool that he recovers. So he asks her out. She says yes. The reason behind this is simple – he had a reaction to her drool, and to her that means he’s special. Every day after school, in order to stave off sickness, Urabe sticks a finger in her mouth and lets Tsubaki suck on it for a bit. It’s a moment of an awkward physical intimacy; and, I think, an undeniably erotic moment for both of them. Later on, we find out that Urabe’s drool can also serve as a communication tool (Urabe can find out about Tsubaki’s dreams and they can even find out what the other is feeling because of it). This daily ritual is no different than kissing before saying goodbye.I think if the drool itself were animated in a more tasteful way there wouldn’t be as much resistance to this show. Hoods Entertainment, the company who made it, do the series no favors when they choose to animate the drool, as being not at all dissimilar to other bodily fluids. The drool lingers, drips from fingers, forms puddles; in the op, it even splashes like we’re suddenly in a hentai or something. It’s distracting. In Mysterious Girlfriend X, the exchange of drool comes to represent other possible exchanges of bodily fluids. The act is both literal and metaphorical. This is really what we are talking about, isn’t it?Tsubaki and Urabe both understand where their relationship will end up. Every time they exchange drool, they come to realize the fact of it. This is where we’re heading, this is what’s going to happen. But many of the 13 episodes are about the slow crawl toward that goal (in this series, that goal is unfulfilled). One episode finds Urabe going over to visit Tsubaki wearing nothing but a coat, because apparently this is a normal remedy for the common cold. Like Junko Nakano’s Chisa x Pon (though nowhere near as explicit), the series maps out how over time, they become more comfortable with each other. Whereas in the first few episodes, Urabe almost kills Tsubaki when he tries to hug her; near the end, it’s Urabe who demands that she be hugged.  There’s even a moment later on where in a fit of blind passion, Tsubaki licks Urabe’s ear, and she’s completely overwhelmed by the sensation. Although this sense of experimentation and play is lighthearted in the show, I believe the show takes absolutely serious the drives of the main characters. Tsubaki has nightly dreams about Urabe where they dance in some strange circus-like town (not hard to understand what’s happening there), and Urabe herself often finds herself blushing and testing her own limits regarding what she’ll do (one episode finds her stripping completely down and letting Tsubaki lick her drool while his eyes are closed). The way they approach the issue is unorthodox, sure, but everyone’s different. The show even provides a foil couple to accentuate how different they are.Although the show is relatively straightforward in its depiction of teenage confusion, hormones and love, there’s one really interesting strand that I haven’t mentioned. Tsubaki and his friend, Ueno, both get girlfriends during the show, but they insist on keeping this a secret. Whereas in other shows, there’d usually be a scene where everyone whispers about the new couple, in this show our main characters never acknowledge their girlfriends in any special way while they’re at school. While I don’t think this is done for any real reason by the characters, it betrays an uneasiness about their own sexual development. I couldn’t help thinking that they were hiding their relationships because it meant that they were growing up, that they were embarrassed by their sexual curiosity/progress/etc. And, yeah, it’s completely embarrassing. During this time in their lives, we have no idea what we’re doing. Tsubake and Urabe may understand the mechanics of where this is all going, but it doesn’t mean that they have any idea of what it means, of what it looks like, of what it feels like; and not knowing, looking foolish while you figure out, is completely embarrassing. It’s easier to pretend you don’t have a girlfriend, because then you can keep that side of yourself completely separate from people’s image of you. The only one who can see you at your most vulnerable, most ridiculous, state is your Mysterious Girlfriend; and only she knows how much her drool turns you on.copied/pasted from my blog: thenextthingblog.wordpress.com the other bizarre things about this anime (the main character’s proclivity for randomly laughing, the scissors she keeps in her panties, etc.), the drool issue is the most major one to contend with.

', '(This has been adapted from my reddit thread)Saliva is a basic necessity for most animals. It provides humans with a way to break down food, aids in protecting our teeth, and allows us to have the ability to swallow easily. It\'s so ingrained in our daily lives that, for the most part, we pay it no mind. However, once it leaves the mouth, it usually goes from a friendly companion to a disgusting byproduct. In short, while saliva is seen as a benefactor to our everyday lives, drool is not. But this anime, Mysterious Girlfriend X, would like you to think otherwise.STORYMysterious Girlfriend X begins...rather cliche but then takes a rather interesting turn. Urabe is a new transfer student who gets close to no one and is usually found sleeping. One day, for whatever reason, our MC Tsubaki tastes the drool left behind on her desk.As far as premises go, X certainly stands up there as one of the more unique. Essentially, the connections that are established between the characters are based on the drool that they consume. In a metaphorical sense, drool represents love. Drool is this liquid, slimy, and foreign substance that isn\'t particularly appealing to someone unless that person desires it to be. Love isn\'t a liquid, but it certainly ""flows"" like one, cascading through and between people, taking shape in whatever form it has to. It\'s not particularly slimy, but it manifests itself as these rather strange feelings that are quite unlike anything else. And while we say we know what love is, it\'s definitely foreign to those of us who have yet to give or receive it in a deeply emotional way.I could go a step further and say that the pair of scissors Urabe is so fond of is a physical representation of her emotions. She hides behind it when she feels scared, threatened, or jealous, are used with tactical precision depending on the situation, and are worn ""on her sleeve"" despite her appearance. Maybe I can make another leap and argue that the X in the title isn\'t the scissors, but is instead the x-chromosome that, like love, is ""shared"" between Tsubaki and Urabe.The last one is probably too much of a stretch. But here\'s my point; where is it appropriate to draw the line between simply making connections and discovering the true intentions of the writer and producers? What I\'ve said before may sound pretty good, but if its just some reviewer\'s attempt at making the message sound nice then that isn\'t being fair to the anime in question.Let\'s diverge for just a moment and talk about the more obvious. X does something quite well, and that is demonstrating a mature relationship. Whether it be through drool or through words, both Tsubaki and Urabe almost always ""communicate"" in a respectful and realistic manner. There aren\'t any major misunderstandings, no one is fumbling around for words, and neither of them act particularly wishy-washy in the way they interact. Simply put, they are a believable couple.Tying this back in with the first few remarks, is it fair to say that X\'s overall theme is that drool is a lot like love? I believe so. While one is a physical entity and the other is a spiritual feeling, what this show is trying to get at is that the premise, like love itself, doesn\'t have to make sense. It\'s this strange occurrence that often pops up out of nowhere, usually when we least expect it. And while it may seem embarrassing to deal with in the beginning, over time everything more or less ""drips"" into place.ANIMATIONWhen first looking at Mysterious Girlfriend X, the phrase ""don\'t judge a book by its cover"" comes to mind. From the outside it looks rather old or outdated. While these descriptions aren\'t entirely accurate, they do have some basis. Both the character designs and the locations are nothing extravagant. Rather, they appear to be something taken from the late 90\'s instead of the early 2010\'s.In regards to actual animation, there isn\'t much attention given to it outside of two areas: Urabe\'s furious cutting and the drool. The former has at least a pretty cool effect attached to it where she seemingly moves faster than sound. The latter, understandably being the focal point, sees much glistening, movement, and fluidity.One small note is that on a handful of occasions, the animation was ""wrong."" In other words, things happening with the left hand suddenly were happening with the right hand. This may be nit-picky, but catching it in more than one instance is definitely something against the show.CHARACTERSMysterious Girlfriend X focuses mostly on two characters, Tsubaki the boyfriend and Urabe the girlfriend.Tsubaki is particularly interesting for his competency, his straight-forward behavior, and his willingness to trust Urabe. At certain points in the show, he may let his feelings or desires somewhat get the better of him, but instead of finding this perverted or possessive, it seemed rather natural. He\'s a high school boy, with the first girlfriend he\'s ever had, sharing a connection with someone on a deep level. Of course he is going to want to embrace Urabe, feel her, or keep her for himself. As a character, it felt like I was watching an adolescent boy experience his first true love. In short, as his sister would say, ""he\'s at that age.""Urabe most definitely earns the moniker of mysterious. Quiet, kind, and seemingly simple, it\'s revealed quite quickly that this isn\'t necessarily the case. Her hair hides her face, she always carries with her a pair of scissors, and her drool has a supernatural power. At certain times, she is asked why she is like this. Her answer, while small, speaks volumes: ""That\'s just the way I am."" This offhand and non-explanatory comment is further evidence for the ideas presented previously. Love isn\'t something that is easily describable, nor is it something that needs to be. It\'s this feeling that is born out of nowhere, often times without a specific moment to attach to. Nobody questions why Urabe is the way she is, and her character demonstrates this same approach towards love.SOUNDThe OP for Mysterious Girlfriend X is rather generic. It doesn\'t attempt anything new, and while the vocalist does have small moments at the beginning and the end it isn\'t enough to warrant recognition.The ED suffers the same fate, but is probably worse both as a song and with the visuals attached to them. The song itself is ""relaxing"" in its beat and gives off a feeling of being mellow. This coincides with the visuals, which are rather unappealing not because of the drool but because they are simple still shots without much life.The soundtrack is mostly forgettable except for the circus track that plays. It\'s most often used during the dream sequences and when Urabe is being her usual weird self. I thought the piece fit well with the show\'s general air of strangeness and mysteriousness.Voice acting has no notable mentions to be had.ENJOYMENTWhen first delving into this one, I will admit that the drool aspect was pretty gross. ""But Banjo, things like kissing involve saliva and sex has even more fluids involved!"" That\'s true, and I agree, but I think its the context of the situation. I would like to believe most couples aren\'t offering their drool-covered finger on a daily basis. As an onlooker, that just seems rather silly. It took an episode or two, but eventually me being perturbed by it went away.What came as a surprise was the show\'s ""Ecchi"" tag. It\'s not in your face about it for the most part, but there are shots of the girls involved being naked, dreams of playing with breasts, and a few panty-shots here or there. For the most part, the eroticism is supposed to be derived from the eating of the drool and the sucking of the fingers. Minus that, the fan-service overall seemed quite tame given the genre it fell under.At its core, the anime is a romance story. It\'s definitely not your typical one, but there is blushing, stuttering, and lovey-dovey moments abound. Tsubaki and Urabe\'s relationship is almost too real, which is most likely why they are not often talked about. Besides the drool they share, what they have is so common it just doesn\'t standout. That\'s not a bad thing, it just makes them less memorable overall.In the end, Mysterious Girlfriend X starts off with a peculiar premise, dealing mostly in drool. But by the show\'s conclusion, Urabe, her relationship with Tsubaki, and the show\'s final message are no longer mysterious. Instead, they are all quite apparent for any fan of anime to see.SUMMARYStory: Good, drool is love surrounding a mature coupleAnimation: Bad, old art style with boring actual animation and a few hiccupsCharacters: Good, ""believable"" high school kidsSound: Bad, bland OP, ED, soundtrack, and VA workEnjoyment: Fine, quite the weird romance storyFinal Score: 5/10 rather cliche but then takes a rather interesting turn.

From the outside it looks rather old or outdated. While these descriptions aren\'t entirely accurate, they do have some basis. Both the character designs and the locations are nothing extravagant. Rather, they appear to be something taken from the late 90\'s instead of the early 2010\'s.In regards to actual animation, there isn\'t much attention given to it outside of two areas: Urabe\'s furious cutting and the drool. The former has at least a pretty cool effect attached to it where she seemingly moves faster than sound. The latter, understandably being the focal point, sees much glistening, movement, and fluidity.One small note is that on a handful of occasions, the animation was ""wrong."" In other words, things happening with the left hand suddenly were happening with the right hand. This may be nit-picky, but catching it in more than one instance is definitely something against the show.CHARACTERSMysterious Girlfriend X focuses mostly on two characters, Tsubaki the boyfriend and Urabe the girlfriend.Tsubaki is particularly interesting for his competency, his straight-forward behavior, and his willingness to trust Urabe. At certain points in the show, he may let his feelings or desires somewhat get the better of him, but instead of finding this perverted or possessive, it seemed rather natural. He\'s a high school boy, with the first girlfriend he\'s ever had, sharing a connection with someone on a deep level. Of course he is going to want to embrace Urabe, feel her, or keep her for himself. As a character, it felt like I was watching an adolescent boy experience his first true love. In short, as his sister would say, ""he\'s at that age.""Urabe most definitely earns the moniker of mysterious. Quiet, kind, and seemingly simple, it\'s revealed quite quickly that this isn\'t necessarily the case. Her hair hides her face, she always carries with her a pair of scissors, and her drool has a supernatural power. At certain times, she is asked why she is like this. Her answer, while small, speaks volumes: ""That\'s just the way I am."" This offhand and non-explanatory comment is further evidence for the ideas presented previously. Love isn\'t something that is easily describable, nor is it something that needs to be. It\'s this feeling that is born out of nowhere, often times without a specific moment to attach to. Nobody questions why Urabe is the way she is, and her character demonstrates this same approach towards love.SOUNDThe OP for Mysterious Girlfriend X is rather generic. It doesn\'t attempt anything new, and while the vocalist does have small moments at the beginning and the end it isn\'t enough to warrant recognition.The ED suffers the same fate, but is probably worse both as a song and with the visuals attached to them. The song itself is ""relaxing"" in its beat and gives off a feeling of being mellow. This coincides with the visuals, which are rather unappealing not because of the drool but because they are simple still shots without much life.The soundtrack is mostly forgettable except for the circus track that plays. It\'s most often used during the dream sequences and when Urabe is being her usual weird self. I thought the piece fit well with the show\'s general air of strangeness and mysteriousness.Voice acting has no notable mentions to be had.ENJOYMENTWhen first delving into this one, I will admit that the drool aspect was pretty gross. ""But Banjo, things like kissing involve saliva and sex has even more fluids involved!"" That\'s true, and I agree, but I think its the context of the situation. I would like to believe most couples aren\'t offering their drool-covered finger on a daily basis. As an onlooker, that just seems rather silly. It took an episode or two, but eventually me being perturbed by it went away.What came as a surprise was the show\'s ""Ecchi"" tag. It\'s not in your face about it for the most part, but there are shots of the girls involved being naked, dreams of playing with breasts, and a few panty-shots here or there. For the most part, the eroticism is supposed to be derived from the eating of the drool and the sucking of the fingers. Minus that, the fan-service overall seemed quite tame given the genre it fell under.At its core, the anime is a romance story. It\'s definitely not your typical one, but there is blushing, stuttering, and lovey-dovey moments abound. Tsubaki and Urabe\'s relationship is almost too real, which is most likely why they are not often talked about. Besides the drool they share, what they have is so common it just doesn\'t standout. That\'s not a bad thing, it just makes them less memorable overall.In the end, Mysterious Girlfriend X starts off with a peculiar premise, dealing mostly in drool. But by the show\'s conclusion, Urabe, her relationship with Tsubaki, and the show\'s final message are no longer mysterious. Instead, they are all quite apparent for any fan of anime to see.SUMMARYStory: Good, drool is love surrounding a mature coupleAnimation: Bad, old art style with boring actual animation and a few hiccupsCharacters: Good, ""believable"" high school kidsSound: Bad, bland OP, ED, soundtrack, and VA workEnjoyment: Fine, quite the weird romance storyFinal Score: 5/10', ""If you've got this far, you know the show's synopsis. Your standard anime transfer student doesn't quite fit in, as expected, but due to a series of events ranging from ordinary to a bit weird, the show's main character ends up falling for the weird transfer student. All this made possible due to the strange effect her drool has on him, creating a bond between the two that makes him physically ill if he goes without it.While this may not sound all that interesting, and perhaps down right gross with the drool aspect, Mysterious Girlfriend X stands out as one of the most unique and...charming romance anime's I have ever seen.I'm not going to beat around the bush - the drool part is a bit disgusting to begin with, even if it's generally limited to licking it off fingers. The first episode serves to set up the circumstances and plot of the rest of the show, and while it's mildly intriguing to begin with, it's not until the end of the episode that you get the first glimpse of the more honest approach the show takes with young and/or first loves.This is the first hint that MGX is going to be different from most other Anime. Love and relationships with teens is usually dealt with in love triangles and harems/reverse harems, with the entire show mostly having unresolved sexual tension for either Japanese cultural reasons or just because it's the done thing. A lot of these and other relationship tropes get subverted throughout the show, and it doesn't get preachy about the romanticised pre-conceptions of love in media either.You don't have to wait long for any of this to start though, as the second episode is when the story really gets going. By the third you'll probably have gotten used to the drool aspect, and by then you'll be hooked. The drool is just a mechanism for the two main characters to understand each others feelings, both emotionally and physically, and aids them in the developments of their love life. Understanding is a big theme in the series, and leads to some genuinely tender moments.It's not just about the two characters getting to know each other, the viewer themselves is in on the process of getting to know the protagonists and the meaning of the show. While Akira Tsubaki, our eyes into the world, is portrayed as a fairly normal and relatable guy, Mikoto Urabe, his girlfriend, is a mystery. As the name of the anime suggests. However, while she has the almost supernatural drool, an odd manner, and is freakishly adept with a pair of scissors she keeps in her panties, it all seems like an allegory for the mystery and unknown of being in love for the first time.There is a bit of ecchi in the series as well - with the two main girls drawn as being quite busty. I honestly think this is commentary on how teenage boys see the world, and how love can sometimes alter your perceptions of your partners. Which in this case is shown by giving the girls big tits, as you do. The art style in general though is a little retro, which fits the atmosphere of the show a lot better than spindly limbs or soft moe features.Compared to the manga, it's usually very spot on, and any small changes made to the story, whether they're chronological or characters reactions, mostly better the flow of events. Due to the short nature of the anime, and the fact the manga is still ongoing, some stories have been dropped or blended together. However nothing feels rushed, forced, or out of place, and it at least means there's probably enough material for a second season if it gets that far.There are a few words that have been tossed around in this review that do manage to sum up the show better than others - that it is a charming, sweet, honest look at young and first loves. I hope they make more after the OVA. charming romance anime's I have ever seen.I'm not going to beat around the bush - the drool part is a bit disgusting to begin with, even if it's generally limited to licking it off fingers.

Although it comes off a little weird with the drool bond i think that it is just something you have to see as a beautiful bond between two people. The creativity of this bond is art. The Romance and Comedy are a great mix as well, there wasn't a point were the one overpowered the other it was a smooth mix. The way the two dreamed about each other was really cute and reminds me of myself. The dream world was so crazy and wonderful it brought...everything fun into one small town. Another awesome thing about this anime was the music! The music was perfect for every scene or tense moment. I now after finishing this show find myself humming the dream theme haha. The characters were also great. There was only 4 main characters so you got to know them pretty well! Plus Urabe and Tsubaki are such a wonderful couple with such strong feelings for each other but so little experience and differences they don't know how to show affection besides the swap of drool they share! I dunno i really enjoyed this anime and i hope anyone who reads this does too! Thanks for reading! everything fun into one small town. Another awesome thing about this anime was the music!

I\'ve been putting it off in part because reviews like this are by FAR the hardest to write. Here is what I mean. The easiest reviews to write are bashing bad anime that absolutely nobody cares about. They get quick and easy laughs from readers. Nobody gets angry or offended. You can just say whatever you want with no fear of the consequences.The second easiest to write are gushing praise onto a universally beloved classic. Have you ever seen an ""Anime everyday"" review? I\'m not trying to be mean, I\'m totally...serious. All you must do is repeat the same praises that other people have said countless times before and suddenly most people will think you are a deep thinker and sophisticated intellectual. I could go on IMDB and copy/paste pieces of essays written about Ingmar Bergman\'s The Seventh Seal and come across as brilliant without ever putting an ounce of effort or thought into the review.The 3rd most difficult type of review is bashing a series that is well loved. This can be a bit tricky and requires some thought, but it\'s still workable if you know how. The most common tactic would be to acknowledge the things the series does well, but also point out its flaws and basically say ""maybe this series isn\'t quite as good as people are saying"".The absolute hardest type of review is defending and praising a series that is widely disliked. Since few people will dare to do this, you can\'t rely on the words and arguments of others. You are on your own. Even if your words are elegant and your defense is Johnny Cochran worthy, it is slamming hard against your reader\'s preconceived notions. This means you will likely get a lot of bashing and ""thumbs down"" regardless. Defending an unpopular series is a Pyrrhic victory. No massively popular anime critic I can think of made their fame and popularity by commonly defending series that are widely loathed. Despite knowing this, I\'m writing this review anyways. Now as the great poet Pushkin wrote in his poem Wagon of Life, ""Let\'s get going for Fuck\'s sake!""Overview:Mysterious Girlfriend X is essentially the story of a quirky romance between 2 extremely socially awkward youths. So…this will be like Wes Anderson’s Moonrise Kingdom? Nope. This is a series featuring psychic saliva that creates a mental and physical link between those who share it. Basically, think Alexander Dumas’ short story The Corsican Brothers only gross. This is a WEIRD anime, but if you give it a chance it is surprisingly pretty good!Plot and characters:The story takes place in a highschool, as romance anime tend to do. Our hero is a guy named Akira Tsubaki. Akira is a lonely and withdrawn boy who lives with his father and older sister since his mother died when he was young. Akira has never had a girlfriend before, but is intrigued by an odd transfer student who is even more introverted than he is. This girl is named Urabe and she is…odd. She sleeps through most of her classes and quickly becomes a social pariah through her bizarre behavior. Her hobby is making art with scissors, which she has learned to use with superhuman speed and accuracy. One day after school, Akira notices that Urabe left a large puddle of drool on her desk and decides to taste a sample of it because he had never kissed a girl. Soon he develops a fever and starts having unusual dreams. It turns out that Urabe is psychic and can transfer her emotions and feelings through her bodily fluids. This link is also physical and causes any pain or injury inflicted on one to affect the other. Urabe quickly senses that someone must have tasted her drool and figures out it was Akira. She tells him that he will go through painful withdrawal unless he tastes a sample of her saliva every day. Now these 2 oddballs must learn to form a relationship and adjust to their new psychic link. The relationship between Urabe and Akira is also contrasted against the far more normal relationship between Akira’s only friend named Kouhei and his girlfriend Oka.Most romance anime rely on tired gags and a strict formula. The boy will accidentally see the girl naked or feel her up, then she will yell at him and punch him. BAKA! The next minute, the fight is over and the relationship is back to normal. Mysterious Girlfriend X manages to entirely avoid this. Not only is there a noticeable absence of bad romance anime gags and clichés, but just when you think you know where the series is going it completely surprises you. What is astounding is that it actually feels like a realistic relationship despite the whole psychic drool thing. I’m serious! Akira wants them to be public with their romance, but Urabe is shy about it. Akira wants to advance their physical relationship faster than Urabe is comfortable with, so this leads to a believable quarrel and gradual compromise. The relationship between Urabe and Akira has ups and downs like any real relationship, but grows stronger as both realize what it means to be in a long term romance and how they must now always consider their partner’s desires, hopes, and feelings.  Romance anime typically either move WAY too slow to keep a status quo, or they move far too fast and characters are having sex 5 minutes after meeting. Mysterious Girlfriend X has a gradual and satisfying romance that feels more organic.The final element that makes Mysterious Girlfriend a quality romance anime is the characters. Urabe is indeed highly unusual, but besides the whole psychic powers thing feels like a person you could meet in real life. She doesn’t really fit into an anime archetype of “Tsundere” or “Yandare”. Instead she seems to exhibit traits you would expect from someone with Aspergers or “Autistic tendencies”. She is extremely aloof, anti-social, dislikes physical contact, and has a very hard time making friends. She doesn’t understand social norms and has gotten to the point where she has stopped caring. However, she is warm and caring to the few people close to her. She has a good heart, but has a hard time relating to other people and forming meaningful bonds. Akira like many romance lead is the clumsy and awkward male virgin. However, he is far more realistic and relatable than most. Akira doesn’t put up with comedic abuse. He actually wants to get more physically intimate and is understandably frustrated by Urabe’s extreme reluctance. He isn’t an abusive asshole who forces himself on Urabe, but he also isn’t a stepping stone or whipping boy. He’s a fairly realistic teenager going through his first serious relationship.Music:Very solid opening and closing. Most of the soundtrack is quite good and really fits the atmosphere… then there is Urabe’s theme. WTF were they thinking?! The track is called “Dream” and I think they were attempting to instill a sense of mystery and awe. Instead we got creepy, sinister, circus music. Why? Just why?!Here is Urabe’s Leitmotif: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5YRokOjrdYHere is the theme to the shitty IT miniseries from 1990: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DC4zgfVj-K4Basically the same shit. If anything, Urabe’s theme is creepier.Art:Now since this is a series with a WEIRD premise it needed to find an animation studio that gives zero fucks and is willing to draw some weird shit. Unfortunately, that means it really had only a couple choices: Studio ARMS or Hoods Entertainment. Ultimately, they went with Hoods, who is best known for the brother/sister fucking hentai Aki no Sora and breastfeeding stupidity that is Seikon no Qwasar. Hoods is…not exactly known as a maker of quality titles and this really hurts the perception of Mysterious Girlfriend  X . Basically the same way that being an ARMS title hurts Elfen Lied or Kurosawa’s Runaway Train was completely overlooked or slammed because Cannon Films produced it. While most of the art and animation is fine, I do have one gripe. We are told over and over again that we are looking at “drool” or “saliva” but it is far too thick, viscous, and green. Hoods decided to draw phlegm or a “loogie”, which makes the series WAY grosser than it needed to be. This choice is a self-inflicted injury that wasn’t present in the manga and serves only to repel most viewers away. God damn it Hoods Entertainment!Overall:Mysterious Girlfriend X is not a perfect series, but it is still heavily underrated and gets way more shit than it deserves. This is the only anime I’ve ever seen where the back of the DVD cover for the English release actually bashes it. The entire back cover is basically “LOL, can you BELIEVE this stupid shit!” I live by a used DVD store and I’ve purchased a LOT of shitty anime to watch with friends. Here are some anime I own with only positive comments on the DVD cover: Mad Bull 34, Plastic Little, Garzey’s Wing, Kite, Legend of Lemnear, and even fucking Dark Cat!The tragedy in this is that many highly talented people worked on Mysterious Girlfriend X and actually put effort into it. There is a legitimately good anime buried underneath the thin outer layer of mucus and scorn. The series director is Ayumu Watanabe, who also directed Space Brothers. You know, one of the highest rated series on all of MAL. The series writer is Hitomi Mieno, who also wrote Arakawa Under the Bridge and of course Gintama. The guy that did the storyboard is the same guy that did the storyboards for Shinsekai Yori , parts of One Piece, and Penguindrum. I highly recommend checking out this series if you are looking for underrated, buried treasure. serious.

It was pretty weird and kind of stupid, but I've seen stuff that had more stupid premises and that was nonetheless very good.This manga and as such the anime was written by someone who obviously has a drool fetish, but it shouldn't be enjoyable only by people who have that kind of fetish.The first episode is about the protagonist feeling sick after tasting the girl's drool. The girl...reveals that he's actually feeling love sick and is in withdrawal after he tasted the girl's drool. Okay. That sounds pretty stupid, but you do feel bad when you miss people you love. Urabe properly explains that her saliva isn't magical, he's only in love with her.The following eps are then all about generic romance situations, except they solve everything with drool. First date, trip to the beach, situations that look like one of them is cheating ... Everytime, solved by tasting each other's drool. Where in other stories people would struggle to explain their feelings, there, they'd just use their cheap trick.The art is okay and does the job. It never looks bad, but never pretty either.The sound was good. Some songs gave some of that MYSTERIOUS feel, and Urabe's voice was a really nice surprise. It's a quiet,husky yet cute voice, which I thought was really fitting.The characters. The protagonist is as generic he can get. He is not TOO stupid like some protagonist can be though, so i guess he does the job.Urabe is mysterious. What does that mean ? She doesn't speak much and she has scissors in her panties. Mysterious.I have no explanation for the X tho.One thing that annoys me is that the protag just instantly falls in love with Mikoto after seeing her once and tasting her drool once. Similarly, Urabe is foretold that protag would be her first sexual experience, and she just goes along with it. So they start dating.The side characters include protag's BFF and his girlfriend. That girlfriend also seems to fall in love with Urabe for some reason, going as far as keeping a naked picture of Urabe, but that never bothers anyone.The protag's older sister looked nice, but she never interacts.I couldn't enjoy the story and I couldn't enjoy the drool fanservice, hence the 3. reveals that he's actually feeling love sick and is in withdrawal after he tasted the girl's drool. Okay. That sounds pretty stupid, but you do feel bad when you miss people you love. Urabe properly explains that her saliva isn't magical, he's only in love with her.The following eps are then all about generic romance situations, except they solve everything with drool.

It never looks bad, but never pretty either.The sound was good. Some songs gave some of that MYSTERIOUS feel, and Urabe's voice was a really nice surprise. It's a quiet,husky yet cute voice, which I thought was really fitting.The characters. The protagonist is as generic he can get. He is not TOO stupid like some protagonist can be though, so i guess he does the job.Urabe is mysterious. What does that mean ? She doesn't speak much and she has scissors in her panties. Mysterious.I have no explanation for the X tho.One thing that annoys me is that the protag just instantly falls in love with Mikoto after seeing her once and tasting her drool once. Similarly, Urabe is foretold that protag would be her first sexual experience, and she just goes along with it. So they start dating.The side characters include protag's BFF and his girlfriend. That girlfriend also seems to fall in love with Urabe for some reason, going as far as keeping a naked picture of Urabe, but that never bothers anyone.The protag's older sister looked nice, but she never interacts.I couldn't enjoy the story and I couldn't enjoy the drool fanservice, hence the 3."", 'If you can somehow, in some way that is not life threatening, remove your stomach from the rest of your body and sit right next to you, then this anime is a bizarre treat. . . Or at least I wanted to say that. . . .It\'s quite a feat to be both an intriguing and somewhat fresh look at the highschool romance genre and physically sickening at the same time, Nazo no Kanojo X is a rare case of doing something different yet doing something that immediately pushes you away, literally.It\'s starts out with Akira Tsubaki wondering about how his first girlfriend will be...like, and that\'s when Mikoto Urabe comes in. Mikoto is the new transfer student at Akira\'s class and is far from being an average and typical school kid, from randomly bursting out laughing in the middle of class to sleeping face flat on her school desk in between classes, she easily becomes what the class now considers her, a straight up weirdo. Then one day. . .  Why do I feel queasy. . . .Okay, I need to get this done and over with. This is the ultimate deciding factor of the show, one day as school ends for the day, Akira finds Mikoto asleep and unaware of class ending for that day. He wakes her up, with drool slowly pouring down her mouth, and proceeds to leave leaving a wide eyed Akira staring at what she left behind. . . and for some reason. . . Licks it up. . . .Now here\'s the thing, that\'s disgusting, Even though the anime does start off showing that Akira has some kind of fixation on liquid in general, it still churns my stomach in a way that tells me that watching this isn\'t a good idea for my physical health. But I tried to be open minded enough to almost look past that, especially since the show really is delightful in an offbeat way and shows it can be really something different. . . But, damn. . . It\'s an entry hazard of epic proportions.Which is also a shame too, visually the anime is fascinating. It goes for an old school look and the imagery is bizarre, a bizarrely delightful kind that can hook you in alone. Heck the music is more busy focusing on the oddity of the show and wants you to ignore the umm, drool, and instead want you to pay attention the strange and weird (Also, Mitoko\'s voice actor is a really unique choice by, instead of a typical high pitched voice, it\'s a lot deeper than you\'d expect).Which is married by unexpected (Though in hindsight is a bit cliched) turns in the development of the central characters. Akira becomes quite addicted to Mikoto\'s... saliva to the point of having withdrawn symptoms and requires more of Mikoto\'s. . . Saliva on a regular basis. And by the end of the first episode, the shows keeps up with it\'s promise of it\'s title and they become a couple. . . right after Mikoto. . . UGh, vomits a pool of saliva (I\'m over exaggerating of course) over the sudden and different way she wants Akira to confess to her, with talks of who and who is still a virgin. . . It\'s just her way of being surprised. . . .Okay, I\'m not going to blame anyone on wanting to past this up and never look back, especially with how the episode ends. But it\'s totally something out there and different with a genre that loves to stick with the usual cliches. This is a show that\'s trying to do something different, but one of it\'s methods is a clear deal breaker.A deal breaker, that honestly, would make this anime a whole deal better if the drool was never a part of the premise. In the second episode there are already hints of the plot starting to get loose at the stitches. Clearly we hear that Mikoto\'s drool isn\'t anything special, yet she produces a special kind of drool that, umm, gets you horny? It\'s something along those lines, and it\'s one of two things that are immediately pointless. The other being Mikoto\'s hobby(?), keeping a pair of scissors in her underwear for occasions when she cuts up paper into those paper cut out ornaments. I can hardly see where that ""talent"" will have any importance, other than to flash Mikoto\'s panties (Though she mentions that she doesn\'t mind Akira seeing them, at least she doesn\'t get all embarrassed about). Trying to do something different is fine, but having pointless quirks isn\'t a way to do it.However if you can manage not to lose your lunch (Terrible way to put it, ugh, I apologize for the bad imagery), then Nazo no Kanojo X might end up being something totally strange in a delightful way, or become a new way to over sexualize something and go down a bizarro path into obscurity (The ending theme song kinda fetishises drool coming down a girls mouth), unfortunately I will never see where it\'ll lead up to.Clearly this anime requires an acquired taste so to speak. The romance itself is very competent but the premise and subject matter however completely holds the anime back from the part of it that deserves praise, but with each episode more and more focus goes towards the drool (Like for example: Mikoto can ""transfer"" her feelings via saliva, the underlining purpose is great as it invokes a bond you can see between the main couple that needs no words. . . But it\'s revolting on the surface and becomes less ""special"" with the introduction of another person who\'s saliva is also ""special"").Either way, you\'ll need to stomach the premise out before going any further, I wish you good luck because it had me beat. . . Now excuse while I go grab some tums or something. . . Ugh. . . . like, and that\'s when Mikoto Urabe comes in.

Yes.Naze no Kanojo X is the definition of abnormal relationship or rather a bizarre story of ""how relationship can come in many forms"". This anime was indeed disgusting however that critic mindset of mind had already vanished by the time I accepted the fact that it\'s not a big deal and I could learn a thing or two from this intriguing story. Which is of course exactly just like what I stated a few sentences above : ""How relationship can come in many forms.""The entire anime is about an...abnormal relationship between a boy and a girl as they spend their school days doing whatever abnormal things they always do. Other than that, there\'s nothing else which this anime offers.This anime was great and I indeed enjoyed it but it probably would\'ve been very much more enjoyable if there were some drama in it and/or perhaps a tragic backstory of why she ( the girlfriend ) became that way. Overall a 10/10. Very fun to watch. Recommended to all romancers. abnormal relationship between a boy and a girl as they spend their school days doing whatever abnormal things they always do.

Recommended to all romancers.', 'Story:Everyone at one point in their school life fell in love, and had a girlfriend/boyfriend, and they get awkward with each other and try to….blah blah blah blah.  The point here is that the theme of this anime is that of the super typical ecchi school romance, with a chance of harem – of course that part did not develop (thankfully).  Many anime have already squeezed this already-dry theme to the max. However, this particular series manage to find a unique, and rather… Weird aspect that made it stand out: Saliva. Hmmm… Ok, we’ve all swapped spit (and potentially other bodily fluids as...well ;D) with a significant other before, but not in a way that the series does it, nor does it evoke the emotions the way they did neither. As strange as it sounds, it becomes more integral as the story progresses, and it becomes the vessel that keeps the characters and the viewers to become emotionally enganged. In short, the saliva swapping is weird, but it grows on you. I was apprehensive at first to continue with this series, but now, I can’t seem to stand it when I don’t see Urabe give Tsubaki her spit; it would lack substance. No pun intended. :PAnimation:The plot for this anime at first didn’t seem to go along with the overall animation of everything, especially the character build.  The animation was old-school; simple facial details, with slightly wild hair (at least for Urabe); the simplistic animation that struck me the most was the eye animation. They were so darn simple! It reminded me my animes from the 1990’s. The animation they chose was definitely something out of an action anime, such as Akira.  Again it was awkward at first. Everything didn’t seem to match. However, this becomes second nature as the simplistic design gives way to the complexity that is… the spit (oh lawd). I mean if one observes this, it’s plainly obvious that they paid attention to the detail of what a spit should look like: it looked thick, almost gelatinous, yet you can see it trail from Urabe’s mouth to her finger, with slight grace – Yes… I’m describing DROOL!!!  It works though!Sound:Not going to lie, the background music in the anime drives me nuts, even now that I’m 8 episodes in.  It just seemed to me that it overpowers through everything else that’s going on. It’s too loud in my opinion, and any other special effects get distorted.  That’s just my quirk. However, the Opening, I liked. It was pop-like and it definitely sounded something out of the 90’s for me. Sometimes old school music will just beat any modern day music.  This, along with the old school animation just works, and works well. The Ending? I LOVE IT!!! It’s jazzy and pop-like while still being laid back, along with the rather… sexy shots of the women involved in the anime. It surely adds to the overall “drool-ish” theme of the whole series in a way, and the lyrics, they contribute to the romance even more. Loved the Ending the most. :DCharacter:The character development in this series is a bit simplistic, although for a 13-episode one, it’s good enough: two classmate, one introvert, and one extrovert meet at odds with one another, and one of them (the guy) becomes interested. They start going out and things happen, and they discover “how to love” and “how to be the proper bf/gf”. Sounds generic right? Well, it is, but again the whole spin about “swapping spit” gives this an edge. Per-character wise, it’s also generic for the most part, except for Urabe.The lead male Tsubaki is your typical guy that kinda struggles in school, has a friend that he shares manly interests in and has those urges, like any boy in his age. He’s chivalrous but at the same time a little too innocent for his own good.The lead female Urabe, however, is anything but simple. She started out weird, as she never talks to anyone, and is very private, while almost dwelling in her own world (as seen in the first episode + hiding scissors in her underwear), and just plain creepy to others.  Her progression to “normalcy” though is interesting as her friend Oka, who happens to be the girl friend of Tsubaki’s best friend Ueno, gives her the push she needs in order to become a “better girlfriend”.  Their interactions – including swapping spit – are anything but typical. But they work.Oka is probably the most notable supporting character as she is basically the main catalyst to what’s happening between Urabe and Tsubaki. Her rather aggressive way of socializing with Urabe really becomes the backdrop of Urabe’s actions, either explicitly or suggestively. She’s just LOVES to teas Urabe, that it’s so cute, and almost yuri.Enjoyment:This series might throw people off, it might even make other’s eyes twitch, as no one in their right mind (at least in our society) would just get a wad of drool from their mouth and make someone else eat it.  However, this is what separates the anime from other school romance animes out there. Does it work? Of course it does, or else I’d just drop it. It’s a unique way of conveying one’s series, though not necessarily sanitary(?). Overall, the simplistic, yet riveting character progression is really the aspect that one has to look for, especially for Urabe, as it’s probably the most extreme relative to her everyone else’s.  The OP was very good, and the ED, I’ll be getting the full version definitely. Overall it’s something that has truth in its theme, while giving it a weird twist. Altogether, the series has definitely been something that I’ve been participating throughout this season. well ;D) with a significant other before, but not in a way that the series does it, nor does it evoke the emotions the way they did neither.

Why you may ask, because of the story it tells and how much I think people who have been in a relationship for the first time can relate to it and find it...relatable.Story- 10 : The story follows Akira Tsubaki a normal high school boy who finds himself in a relationship with the strange and peculiar Mikoto Urabe who has just transferred into his class and is a loner for the most part. One day he has a weird dream that prompts him to taste Mikoto's drool and making him fall in love with her and need her drool to keep going. After tasting her drool and forming a strange pact with Mikoto, Tsubaki decides that his feelings for Mikoto are real and asks her to go out with him making her his girlfriend and the story then follows the struggles and un-knownigness of a first time relationship and how bonds no matter how strange they may be keep people together and show how important some special people are to us.Art - 8 : The art style is unusual for me but I still enjoyed it. It was easy for the eyes and even though there wasn't that much need for major animation or artistic need it did a good job and creating a easy and relaxable feeling while watching which I enjoyed a lotSound - 10 : The sound and Op and Ed songs were really well done. I found myself watching and listening to the Op and Ed songs on each episode which for me is a rarity. The sound and voice acting throughout the series I found to be  perfect for it  and made me enjoy it so much more than I was already enjoying it.Characters - 10 : Now this is where the story thrives at the main characters Akira Tsubaki and  Mikoto Urabe both share a strange bond and throughout the series you learn no matter how strange the two may have seemed at the beginning they both have real world problems they deal with and the problems that arise and anxiety of being in a relationship for the first time.Akira Tsubaki is more over a normal high school boy who doesn't have that many friends other than Ueno, Kouhei. He isn't all that popular and just seems average which I find relatable and the plites that he has in past and present crushes and relationships that he has had.Mikoto Urabe for the most part throughout the series is as the title says a mysterious girlfriend. Not much is revealed about her unless I talk about spoilers which I refuse to do. Anyways for the most part she is a very loner type of girl who doesn't seem to have any friends at all and doesn't make any attempt to make any either. And even goes as far to say to Tsubaki that he is the only person she needs. Even though she seems like a inscrutable person and hard to approach she is still a girl and has normal feelings as one even if she doesn't act all the time like a regular girl.Enjoyment - 10 : The enjoyment I got out of watching this series is unfathomable; even though I had class early the next morning when I started this series I stayed awake just to finish it because of how much I enjoyed watching it and how I just didn't want it to end and even took up reading the manga even though I don't really read manga all that much.Overall - 10 : Overall if you are looking for a good romance story and one with the unknowngness that comes with being in a relationship for the first time I highly recommend this anime. If you are a romance and or drama lover then this is also a very good anime to watch. All I have to say even though it has a weird synopsis about tasting drool all I can say is if you can get past the first 2 or 3 episodes then you should be able to get through this anime and I can almost guarantee that you will enjoy this anime as much as I have. I highly recommend that you give this a watch if you are even thinking about watching it. relatable.Story- 10 : The story follows Akira Tsubaki a normal high school boy who finds himself in a relationship with the strange and peculiar Mikoto Urabe who has just transferred into his class and is a loner for the most part.

But to be fair, the story and the interactions of the other characters are good enough that most can bypass this. After a while, I noticed that I cringed less and less every time I had to see the two love birds put their drool in each other’s mouths.At times the show dragged. There were a couple episodes that really seemed to do a whole lot of nothing. Overall, I’m glad that it only ran for 13 episodes. The...pacing over the course of the whole series was alright though.As for the comedic value, it really depends on your personal tastes. As with most comedies, especially in the anime industry, it’s very subjective. It either syncs up with you or it doesn’t. With this particular series, you’ll need to give it at least three episodes to determine whether or not it falls within your personal taste.But even if the humor isn’t your thing, the story is still relatively interesting. I found myself really wanting to find out how the relationship between Mikoto and Akira would turn out. There’s quite a few surprises along the way, and although they didn’t end it the way the manga progressed, it was still acceptable whether you read the manga or not. If you’ve read the manga, give it a shot. They aren’t far off from it. If not, it’s still a decent pick if you want a romantic comedy with a weird concept. Just don’t think about it too much. If you do, it’ll just end up bothering you the whole way through and at that point it’s not worth your time.Overall i give this show 6/10, it took me a while to get into it, and at times I found myself getting an episode or two behind, prioritizing several other shows. It’s not horrible for what it is. It just didn’t have the “wow” effect on me.If you don’t like the animation style, and cannot get past the saliva concept, go ahead and pass on this one. Also, as always, if romantic comedy isn’t what you are looking for, this is not the right pick. pacing over the course of the whole series was alright though.As for the comedic value, it really depends on your personal tastes.

It’s not horrible for what it is. It just didn’t have the “wow” effect on me.If you don’t like the animation style, and cannot get past the saliva concept, go ahead and pass on this one. Also, as always, if romantic comedy isn’t what you are looking for, this is not the right pick.', ""Well I remember either on my podcast or on a blog I’ve said I have seen countless numbers of anime school rom-coms and really most of them don’t do anything particularly different……so to that end let me review this new 2012 anime rom-com that has a different / interesting? concept.SynopsisThe series follows two central characters Akira Tsubaki and Mikoto Urabe. Urabe is a transfer student who recently moves into Tsubaki's class.Urabe’s behaviour is particularly strange and soon gets a reputation for being the class weirdo. Later, Tsubaki finds Urabe asleep in the classroom. After Urabe leaves to go home Tsubaki notices Urabe’s drool left...from sleeping and wonders if it’s like a bee tasting honey from a flower….so he gives it a taste…..and finds it tastes sweet…..(whoa lol)Tsubaki later falls ill thinking he has a cold but is soon confronted by Urabe who claims he has actually contracted love sickness from her drool and after Tsubaki takes another dose of her sweet drool and recovers instantly, so he then comes to accept Urabe’s claim as the truthWhat follows is a growing relationship between the two characters that stems from their mutual connection to drool / saliva.Wow that’s Shakespeare writing in the making right there lolAnimationThe animation style has an older look to it imo. The character designs feel a bit more rounded then other slimline character designs I usually see in other typical school rom-coms. Fanservice is not so in your face but it is present in moderation. I did actually like the shows colour scheme especially the sunset scenes which are present in many episodes when the main characters are walking home togetherThere are also some cool dream sequences with the characters which I thought where done quite well. So overall I liked the animation style….which btw is very similar to the manga’s….also a good thing.SoundNothing really stood out to me as spectacular here….i didn’t like the opening theme song…closing theme was alright. The character voices seemed spot on and I did actually like Urabe’s Japanese voice actress as she does sound husky but had a little touch of emotion when needed which was good.CharactersThis was the saving grace for the show to be honest…particularly with our main characters Urabe and Tsubaki. Urabe to begin with does have a particularly detached personality but not so much where it bugs you out…there are plenty of times she holds a conversation and you can even see she is not a total shut in and does things like swim, go shopping etc….it seems her main problem is expressing her emotions..which she uses her drool to do….which to be honest gets very annoying at times as this does not only apply to Tsubaki but even with other girls….but at the same time I guess it’s consistent.Tsubaki on the other hand seems like your typical puberty stricken…nice boy. He is very friendly and a bit too kind for my liking but to his defence he does often say exactly what’s on his mind and has a couple of believably uncontrollable moments with Urabe.The other supporting characters are also pretty good with believable personalities and do sometimes add to the shows progressionStorylineOkay so with the synopsis this show will pretty much sound like a Hentai to most but its not. The premise is quite ridiculous but at the same time it is actually an interesting concept that yes is somewhat titillation but is done in a surprisingly passive and matter-of-fact manner that comes off more emotional then sexual.To me the drool exchanging and making the emotional connection is the central focus of this show and that is interesting however, I feel apart from that single element this show is ultimately nothing special. I mean in terms of comedy…it’s pretty tepid and most of what’s funny is Tsuabaki and Urabes sexual tension / misunderstandings and to be honest I found myself wondering if that was all that the show would be about and yeah that seems to be the case.Every episode soon feels like a will they or won’t they and it seems they take two steps forward and one step back in every episode and with rom-coms I like to see either the romance blossom at a decent pace or the comedy to keep me hooked until the story develops more…..well in this case it feels like a ranma-ish show without the emphasis on comedy.As a guy watching this I thought to myself if my girlfriend kept on telling me to taste her drool so I can fantasize about her when I got to bed I would loose my fuken mind…I mean it’s cool to be patient until your girl is ready n all but this concept was really hard for me to accept in terms of a real guy putting up with the: look but don’t touch, touch but don’t taste – taste but don’t swallow element….so in a nutshell the sexual tension starts to build and feels like a big dose of cock-teasing going on here lol……..but hey maybe it’s just me that feels that way………..lol I doubt itEnjoymentFor 13 episodes it was moderately enjoyable but honestly I was getting impatient with the story progression after a while…..even though its pretty shortValueWell it’s an okay show….not sure if it would be anything to talk about if there was no drool connection element but yeah I like the rikey-ness of the story and the characters are very likeable but even after looking at the manga which has been going on for a couple years this show seems to be one of those never-ending rom-coms that intends to re-use it’s formula until everybody gets fed up with it and that’s actually a shame as I think if this was written as a 26 episode show with possibly a more dramatic element it would hit harder but as far as rom-coms go this show really has only two things going for it except comedy…drool and somewhat interesting characters.Ima have to give this one a double ratingPlanet Tyro Rating: Watchable / Acquired tasteVisual Version: http://bit.ly/1bTm1DCPlanettyro.com from sleeping and wonders if it’s like a bee tasting honey from a flower….so he gives it a taste…..and finds it tastes sweet…..(whoa lol)Tsubaki later falls ill thinking he has a cold but is soon confronted by Urabe who claims he has actually contracted love sickness from her drool and after Tsubaki takes another dose of her sweet drool and recovers instantly, so he then comes to accept Urabe’s claim as the truthWhat follows is a growing relationship between the two characters that stems from their mutual connection to drool / saliva.Wow that’s Shakespeare writing in the making right there lolAnimationThe animation style has an older look to it imo.

I passed it up several times because I thought it sounded gross and fetishy, but its not. The whole ""addicted to drool"" part has nothing to do with the story, and is poor phrasing for what really turns out to be a super interesting and cool plot device.  The show has a great sound track, superb depth of character for the main cast, and is awesomely weird. The psychological motivation of each character is based on their unique personalities and fields of experience, and they behave very realistically within the framework the author has created for...them. The lead girl Urabe, for example, often does bizarre or outlandish things, but when you get a feel for her personality and how her head works, her decision making feels natural and fluid. Especially her, but all the main cast have an amount of depth to their character that is uncommon in anime (as it is a hallmark of excellent writing). Not to mention the supernatural part is beautifully dusted in and doesn\'t come across as stupid or forced. And the japanese voice acting is great. Watch this show.

It\'s really unthinkable that there could still be any fresh and original idea for a romance. But suddenly it turns out that there\'s one series with completely new concept, so simple, that no one else would come up with the same idea. Nazo Kanojo X.Story - 8/10Continuing the thought, if you watch a romance there are usually just a few possibilities: there are two lovers, for some reason not able to be together; there are boy and girl that need n episodes to confess love...to each other, proceeding with kiss ending the series; there\'s ""date me"" proceeded with ""have sex with me""; there\'s some love triangle, rectangle or any other awkward polygon, where everything is about settling, who is the \'right\' partner to whom.The action usually takes place in high school. How many of situations presented above happened to you or someone you know during that period? If at least one, you\'re already a rare case. Whereas thinking of romantic love or sex is common among teenagers, usually there only are pairs, that are going out together and enjoy themselves. It\'s just natural. So, you ask why these don\'t happen in any form of novels, movies, anime? Because authors know that common stories won\'t sell. Something unusual is just way more appealing to everyone.Nazo Kanojo X is an anime about a boy who falls in love with a girl. The \'love\' is declared already in 1st episode and the rest of the series focus on them going together, showing every situation seemingly unimportant to the observer yet vital for them. Situations that seem completely usual, but hardly seen in any kind of media at all. Why? Because, as I already said, media tend to focus on three thing in romances: Confession, Kiss and Sex. The rest in between, which doesn\'t lead straight to one of these \'checkpoints\' is supposed to be unimportant and either missed or treated as \'additional bonus\'.The series is episodic but not to the degree where you can skip an episode by mistake and not notice that. I would still mention a negative thing here, though: Because of this, the ending is an open one, which is annoying for most of people (""Will there be a sequel, or it\'ll just stay like this?"")Going back to the story itself, it mainly focuses on drool. ""What?"" you probably just thought if you neither saw the series nor read the description. Yes, here we are proceeding into the \'weird\' part. Instead of kissing, for which the main couple is ""unready yet"" they are exchanging saliva. It bears a role of bond between characters, and they\'re able to transfer their feelings through it. Well, it\'s said that ""You don\'t need words to understand a person you love."" Here it\'s interpreted a bit literally, or to be more precise, literally in strange way.This is where originality begins and where disgusted viewers give up on watching.The whole drool thing as well as main female character, Urabe Mikoto, are in complete contrast to the rest of the world, what makes the whole thing even better in book. Although it may be annoying as well - Depends on the person.Characters - 9/10As I already said, Urabe is, well, unusual. Not to mention that her drool is linking the whole story together, which is odd enough, she has remarkable scissor skills and sleeps all time during breaks in school. Despite she rather enjoy drool exchange, she thinks that she and her boyfriend aren\'t ready for kiss. She doesn\'t like hugs either. Her eyes are hidden under long fringe, she doesn\'t seem to have any friends either. Have you noticed that this part (since not being ready for kiss) isn\'t THAT unusual. So in the end she is just some lonely girl, who happened to find a boyfriend, who she can exchange drool (yay!) with. And so she begins to be likeable and we start to understand Tsubaki, who chose her over \'standard\' girls.Speaking of Tsubaki he is \'dear-japanese-virgin-watching-this-anime-you-can-personalise-yourself-with-me\' type of character. And he does this job surprisingly well. Used to standard romances, he have problems with understanding unusual (or maybe not?) way of Urabe\'s thinking. Well, men is trying to understand women (and vice versa) since prehistory to no avail.As of rest of the cast: Oka, Urabe\'s friend (and Tsubaki\'s friend\'s girlfriend), often \'test\' Urabe\'s ideas with her boyfriend out of curiosity. Save for her and one another girl, other characters neither know about main couple\'s relationship nor tend to act weird.Art & Sound - 9/10Moving on to the art. The backgrounds are well made, everything is full of details. Animation is ok, still it\'s not something crucial for such genre.However, if I were to rate the character designs, they, well, aren\'t really pretty. Just take a look at the picture. Is it problem? Nope, it\'d rather say it\'s even a positive aspect. Nowadays, anime creators rely hard on characters\' \'moe-level\'. They (obviously?) want them to appeal to audience as well as they can, not only with their character but the look. Nazo Kanojo X doesn\'t show us world made pretty girls and handsome boys. Why? Because real world doesn\'t look like this. So it makes this anime even more realistic in it\'s oddity. Also, it\'s like throwing down the gauntlet to other creators saying ""We don\'t need pretty girls to attract people to our show, and you?"". Nevertheless, it\'s also another way to repel potential viewers, not accepting series with non-moe characters. This may however be appreciated by fan of style from \'80s and \'90s.As of music, it\'s hardly noticeable during the show. Opening is very optimistic, motivating to watch the series, whereas ending is more calm and nostalgic.Enjoyment and other aspects - 8/10I can easily tell that the series is enjoyable as long as you don\'t mind seeing saliva every now and then, don\'t mind the fact the characters don\'t look like taken from K-On or IM@S and aren\'t too sceptic about romances overall.If I could speak of other flaws, it would be a little bit of fanservice. However it\'s not provided in a form of just another ecchi comedy, but more to emphasize the sexuality appearing in every love affair, even these without any kisses.Final thoughts:To me, this anime is really realistic in its complete absurdity. It shows love as it is in completely unusual way. This ""way"" may be both good or bad. In my opinion, it\'s great one, but even so it\'ll be best for you to just watch it and decide about it yourself.Final grade: 9 of 10 to each other, proceeding with kiss ending the series; there\'s ""date me"" proceeded with ""have sex with me""; there\'s some love triangle, rectangle or any other awkward polygon, where everything is about settling, who is the \'right\' partner to whom.The action usually takes place in high school.

People like this are assumed to be mysterious and generally avoided. Most others assume these loners have pent up rage or have some horrible past. On rare occasions others will recruit them for their close circles or these people will form extremely close bonds with a few individuals that they have almost nothing in common with.Mysterious Girlfriend X was a title I was skeptical about simply because it involves bodily fluids. After finishing this I feel it is the most undervalued title of the spring 2012 season. A story of a...mysterious slow moving romance revolving around drool, now thats original.In the current anime industry originality is rare to come across, a good title will appear once in a blue moon.Drool romance being what I'd like the call the theme probably set off an equal amount of disgust and enjoyment from all parties. The ratings certainly show this is the case. I like how Urabe and Akira meet through this strange idea of drool tasting and how its the basis of their relationship. A lot of romances now a days are based of visual novels that are generally harems, and they tend to become dull after too many are adapted. I particularly enjoyed this shows originality and everything it offered.The environment of the story had a dark, gothic feel to it which again would put many viewers off. The carnival dreams that these two hard were probably what interested me the most. The sounds for most of the settings was similar to this dream space and it was almost eerie. A lot of romances feature songs with vocals and light instrumentals but this brought a new sound the table, while dull it was interesting none the less.The animation style and old school theme songs is probably where this series was hurt the most. The majority of the new anime audience is attached to the post 2,000 genres of big eyes, large faces and colorful representations. While its a plus in the originality department a lot of fans are looking for new, not old. Another problem this show suffered from was the slow pace and dull VA acting. The pace was grueling and the romance aspect lacked in a traditional sense of what you have come to expect from rom-com's or straight romance. The progress of these two was limited by a bond of drool, and they barely made it out of first base minus naked middle school sweet heart.None the less I enjoyed this every step of the way, rarely do we see something new and unusual. The anime industry should focus more on the new and unusual. More titles could gain excellence if they stepped out of boundaries more often that are not set by the best sellers.If you enjoy a dark and unusual romance, you might just enjoy Mysterious Girlfriend X. mysterious slow moving romance revolving around drool, now thats original.In the current anime industry originality is rare to come across, a good title will appear once in a blue moon.Drool romance being what I'd like the call the theme probably set off an equal amount of disgust and enjoyment from all parties.

A slow pacing,  a classical soundtrack and retro character designs combine to create a realistic slice of life.The series separates itself from other romantic comedies through its characters. Spineless main leads and hair-trigger tsunderes are nowhere to be seen. Tsubaki and Urabe are every bit as unsure of their relationship as first lovers should be and they approach each other with a refreshing nervousness and intensity.You may be turned off by the premise.

From having no one recommend it to me nor having ever really heard about it I was not expecting much. But what you get is a Different Experience then I have ever had.The art style did not jump out at me nor was I blown away but I felt it was standard while the sound was simply one of the best I had ever heard well done characters voices and the soundtrack to the anime I found myself loving due...to its creepyness and originality one of the biggest thing I did not expect while I was not blown away by the op.

On the surface, Mysterious Girlfriend X is pretty much your standard high-school romantic comedy, insomuch as many of the characters and situations are almost universal within the genre, yet right out of the gate, it\'s obvious that there\'s something unusual going on here.Tsubaki Akira is in every way, your typical high-school boy. He\'s inexperienced, and awkward as hell, but he\'s also a nice average guy, with nice, average friends, and living a nice, average high-schooler\'s life.Until that is, the day a new transfer student arrives in his class...and turns his existence upside-down.Urabe Mikoto is that transfer student, and her unorthodox appearance, and curt demeanor immediately set her apart from the rest of the class, a distance which only widens when she displays some of her quirky behaviors, such as sleeping at her desk through lunch, and laughing uproariously, seemingly at nothing during class.And yet Tsubaki can\'t help but find her fascinating...It\'s not too long after Urabe\'s arrival that the weird amps up and we\'re introduced to the concept on which the series is based, and the one that makes this series a little squirmy for a lot of people.Yes, it\'s drool.One day after class, Tsubaki realizes he\'s left something in class and, upon returning to pick it up, he finds Urabe still sleeping at her desk long after everyone else has gone home for the day.Tsubaki can\'t help but notice the puddle of drool Urabe is lying in, and waking her up, sends her on her way, but then finds himself transfixed by the glistening pool of saliva she\'s left behind and...tastes it.This is probably the point where a lot of people make their decision on Mysterious Girlfriend X and choose either to move on to another show, or stick tight to see where this could possibly be heading. Those who choose the former are really doing themselves a disservice, because if you can get over the whole ""ick"" factor, what takes place from that point on is actually something pretty unique and special in the realm of anime rom-com.Two weeks pass after the ""drool episode"" and life settles back into the familiar routine of teenage life. Tsubaki finds himself even more fascinated by the mysterious Urabe, but being your typical awkward high-schooler, nothing comes of it until one day he\'s mysteriously stricken with a fever and passes out during gym class. Several days pass and Tsubaki\'s condition continues to worsen, forcing him to miss classes and remain in bed suffering from all the symptoms of a terrible cold and fever.But Urabe knows differently, and showing up at his home one afternoon, explains that what he\'s suffering from isn\'t a cold at all, but in fact is withdrawal. She\'s correctly deduced that on the day Tsubaki found her sleeping in class in a puddle of drool, he must have tasted it after she left, and, after two weeks without tasting it again, has developed a serious case of ""love sickness"".Tsubaki tries to deny of course, but ultimately admits to his actions at which point Urabe calmly announces that his illness can be cured, and all he needs is another taste of her drool. Tsubaki freaks of course, but eventually relents, allowing Urabe to insert her drool covered finger into his mouth.And sure enough, he\'s immediately cured.This begins their ongoing relationship, and henceforth they meet on a daily basis after school and perform the daily ritual of Urabe providing Tsubaki with a drool covered finger to suck on in order to maintain his equilibrium.Time passes and we see more of Urabe\'s eccentricities, such as her ""panty-scissors"" and uncanny skill with them. We\'re also introduced to some of the supporting cast that make the series so much fun, in the form of Tsubaki\'s best friend, Ueno Kouhei and his adorable, yet quirky girlfriend, Oka Ayuko.Mysterious Girlfriend X is unusual in many ways. The character design is a bit of a throwback to decades past, being nowhere near as pretty as many current series such as Boku wa Tomodachi ga Sukunai or Chuunibyou, but the characters and scenery are definitely attractive.There\'s the whole ""drool"" factor of course, and the implied theme of dependence that comes with Tsubaki\'s withdrawal pains in the first episode.But what I found the most unusual and seemingly contradictory was the comparatively high level of fanservice.  Mysterious Girlfriend X is in so many ways a sweet and innocent story of first love, and the fanservice seemed almost diametrically opposed to that sweetness.Yet somehow it worked.There\'s no denying there\'s a lot of panty-shots (how could you have ""Panty-scissors"" be a recurring and important story element without them?), boob shots ( still can\'t figure out how anime high-school girls can look like skinny 14 year olds in their uniforms, and Playboy center-folds in a bathing suit! lol!), and more sexual allusion and innuendo than you can shake a stick at, yet it never felt gratuitous like it did in Haganai.With very few exceptions, the fanservice was integral to the story-line and made sense being there, and let\'s face it, what 17 year old highschool boy isn\'t obsessed with sex?For all the fanservice and innuendo, Girlfriend was never leering or lecherous.Yeah, there\'s plenty there for those who appreciate fanservice, but really, this anime was incredibly sweet and endearing, and to be honest, gave a pretty accurate portrayal of just how awkward and inept most of us were at that age.So all in all, I\'d highly recommend this series to anyone who loves a sweet and innocent love story. Honestly, people might think I\'m nuts comparing it to Clannad, but despite it\'s brevity (a mere 13 episodes) and admittedly racier aspects, this is still a wonderfully funny and innocent tale of two awkward teenagers falling in love and working through the issues that come with discovering and dealing with some pretty overwhelming new emotions, so man-up and deal with the drool.You\'ll be glad you did! :) and turns his existence upside-down.Urabe Mikoto is that transfer student, and her unorthodox appearance, and curt demeanor immediately set her apart from the rest of the class, a distance which only widens when she displays some of her quirky behaviors, such as sleeping at her desk through lunch, and laughing uproariously, seemingly at nothing during class.And yet Tsubaki can\'t help but find her fascinating...It\'s not too long after Urabe\'s arrival that the weird amps up and we\'re introduced to the concept on which the series is based, and the one that makes this series a little squirmy for a lot of people.Yes, it\'s drool.One day after class, Tsubaki realizes he\'s left something in class and, upon returning to pick it up, he finds Urabe still sleeping at her desk long after everyone else has gone home for the day.Tsubaki can\'t help but notice the puddle of drool Urabe is lying in, and waking her up, sends her on her way, but then finds himself transfixed by the glistening pool of saliva she\'s left behind and...tastes it.This is probably the point where a lot of people make their decision on Mysterious Girlfriend X and choose either to move on to another show, or stick tight to see where this could possibly be heading.

Assuming the people reading this review already read the synopsis on this page, I\'ll go ahead and say this, The synopsis is a little misguiding, but true to a certain extent, It isn\'t just drool but a psychic link that passes on Emotional and Physical changes. That being said.Do not be fooled or disturbed when this mysterious girl ""Urabe Mikoto"" shares her saliva with ""Akira Tsubaki"", Or do not be fully drawn to the plot either, Due to the beauty of this anime lies on the action...of the characters and the true face of romance. This anime carries a very important hidden message, You need to look past the plot, It isn\'t what seems to be.I\'m trying not to spoil anything, But i\'ll say this ""Mysterious Girlfriend X or Nazo no Kanojo X"" It\'s a masterpiece romance message, It shoots straight at our current belief of romance, Or what we believe it\'s structure is and shatters it right on our faces and reveals an inconvenient truth about our perception and marketing of romance. As Romance nowadays is branded with steps and marketed with stereotype conduct to the people.At the end of this anime you\'ll no the difference between ""True Romance"" and  ""Methodical Romance"" You\'ll hopefully know by episode 3, If you don\'t you can message me and i\'ll tell you.Overall i gave this anime a 10, It\'s a true masterpiece. It\'s a well deep thought anime whose beauty lies on perception. I recommend this to anime viewers who always seek to perceive more than the plot or story, or are dazzled or annoyed by visuals.

This by far the best anime I have seen in a long time especially romance. I normally do not watch these types of anime but this has really changed my perspective on the genre itself. The story itself I find very original and before I go into it anymore if you give this anime a try there one thing you will have to get past and I know some folks can not and that is the swapping of drool between the two main characters once see past that you can move on. The art work...and sound I give it a 10 because the voice acting for the Japanese version was outstanding I enjoyed Yoshitani, Ayako as Urabe it was sexy and sweet and Irino, Miyu as Tsubaki was the best compliment  of all. I really felt a connection with the characters as the story developed over the course of the show. I overly enjoyed  myself watching this anime than reading the manga which came to an end in September of 2014 I was really sad to see it end but that also shows how great an anime and manga this was. Give this one a chance I am 29 years old and this anime brought me into this genre which I never really was interested in the first place. Give this one a chance and lets be real the swapping of drool is no different from kissing with tongue so just look past that concept because that what makes this story so unique! and sound I give it a 10 because the voice acting for the Japanese version was outstanding I enjoyed Yoshitani, Ayako as Urabe it was sexy and sweet and Irino, Miyu as Tsubaki was the best compliment  of all.

Fetishes only look worse when they're portrayed in an unattractive manner. Even putting Urabe in a swimsuit is disturbing simply because she is, simply put, ugly. In conclusion, if you don't mind really ugly characters in romance and a drool fetish, this anime should be fine. However, if these things don't sound very attractive, I would stay away from this show. "", ""Looks like everyone already explained from various side of this anime and all good review. But here I want to add my opinion that every romantic comedy anime, you must seen every type of girls (tsundere, kuudere, yandere). But this anime's heroine is unique one, not your typical everydays tsundere girl. Urabe is most sincere and genuine ever if you talking about her feeling to his boyfriend. If you break her heart in spesific ways, she never complain but you can't guess her being okay while the reality its make her hurt. Maybe you think she's weak girl? You make a big mistake. If you...make wrong moves, touch her or wnat to hugs her suddenly, her panty scissor will traumatized you.

But somehow I came across the anime recently and I'm glad that I gave it another try.Let's keep this short & sweet~First of all I have to say that this is not something suitable for the light hearted and narrow minded. The story is very unique and original. It is not your usual high school romance comedy. This is more like mature slice of life. The protagonists are somewhat odd yet interesting. And the situations they go through are sweet and mostly weird.Drool plays a big...part in here. So if you are easily rattled by such things you may not like Nazo no Kanojo X. But drool is just a symbolism used throughout the anime to suggest the bond, our main couple shares. It's more like a passionate kiss. The characters's growth is well depicted and the pinch of humor soothes your mind to the fullest.However one thing that I didn't like in Nazo no Kanojo X was the graphics and visuals. They looked a bit old and outdated. I guess that's a given though. It's not too bad but I have been too accustomed to modern graphics-that's the case.The music in Nazo no Kanojo X is really memorizing. I'm still listening to the OSTs. However I think that it would have been better if they have used a different voice actress to play the female protagonist.In short Nazo no Kanojo X was a great watch. I encourage the daring anime lovers to watch this and travel to a weird new world full of enjoyment. part in here. So if you are easily rattled by such things you may not like Nazo no Kanojo X.

And other people's mouths. Because apparently when you taste someone's spit, it makes you feel what they feel at the moment or something like that, I don't know why, but I'm like 30% sure there's a completely logical scientific explanation behind all that.I liked the way romance works here, licking your fingers and putting them in someone's mouth is the symbol of intimacy instead of kissing, which is pretty much a french kiss, only instead of putting your...tongue in someone's mouth, you put your finger in there, no matter how many times you wiped your a** with them that day, how many times you picked your nose or touched the handles in bus acquiring some healthy dose of hepatitis.

That being said, the context in which I’ve previously made that point is my essay about The Caretaker of Sunahara-sou, which taps into a fairly common fetish. Insofar as that show was concerned, even if you didn’t have an outright MILF fetish, as long as you were a heterosexual male (or homosexual female, I suppose), I submit that you would still get a good to fair amount of, uh, satisfaction from it. The same cannot be said about MGFX, however, for we are talking...about something way, way, way, way, way more niche here.I’m gonna keep it a buck with you, dog. This shit is physically uncomfortable to watch.From clips I had seen of the show, I was reasonably excited to watch a romance about young love portrayed, not like in the movies – where they’re both expert leading ladies and men and shove each other against the wall at every opportunity like seasoned lovers – but rather as precisely as awkward and daunting as young love really is, with all the clumsy hesitation and overdramatic anxiety that comes with it.Now, that’s all fine and dandy, and to be sure, there is some semblance of that here. If I can say one thing to the show’s credit, it’s that it doesn’t beat around the bush establishing its OTP. By the end of episode 1, the protagonist and main heroine are officially boyfriend and girlfriend. The following is nothing more than my own conjecture, but this is probably a consequence of old Japanese studio execs finally wising up to the idea that the endless will-they-won’t-they shpiel they’ve been putting in every God damn show for decades is not as endearing and cute as they seem to think it is, and mostly just ends up irritating and exhausting their audience. Ain’t nobody got time to watch over 200 fucking episodes of Urusei Yatsura and 6 movies to find out whether or not the protagonist ends up with exactly the girl it was blindingly obvious he was always going to end up with since episode 1.However, though MGFX contains at least that one refreshing change for the genre, what it also contains in abundance is… saliva – lots of it. I don’t think you understand. From the first few scenes, I clocked that this would be an unorthodox romance show with a lot of metaphors about sex, particularly images that are supposed to evoke bodily fluids. In the opening scene, we see a kid, presumably the main character in a flashback, peek through the keyhole at a couple having sex, presumably his parents, and the scene cuts to a rose instantly blooming and leaking a honey-like liquid. Then we get introduced to the MC proper in the present day. I don’t know of anyone who pours honey directly on bread, but we get to see our protagonist do that in one of the very first scenes while lost in thought and spilling everywhere, staining the tablecloth, and it’s as thinly veiled a metaphor for semen as they come. Like I said, I clocked it and was prepared for it.Or so I thought.What I was not prepared for was that, rather than an offbeat exploration of sexuality and bodily fluids in general, this show turned out to be something more of a masturbatory therapy session about one bodily fluid in particular. The author transparently has a very specific fetish for spit. Very soon after the introduction of the main heroine, the MC finds her sleeping at her desk, drooling on it. You literally see the leftover drool sparkle like diamonds in the light. After she leaves, he sticks his finger in the drool and licks it. It was one of the most viscerally repulsive scenes I had ever seen in animation. Let me make this quite plain, my revulsion is not coming from a place of Victorian sensibility. I have had a girlfriend spit in my mouth before, and I still found that scene fucking disgusting.Believe me when I say this, it all goes downhill from there. It becomes fucking all about the magic spit. I call it magic because somehow, whenever they drink each other’s saliva, they are able to feel each other’s emotions, have visions of each other’s thoughts, hell, there’s even one scene where actual physical injuries get transferred – main heroine cuts her hand, some other girl drinks her spit, the same cut appears on the other girl’s hand. Oh, yes, the spit fetish gets spread around like a venereal disease to other characters and normalized. What, you thought it was gonna be some bizarre ritual limited only to the main couple? Think again!It’s exactly as odious and weird as it sounds.And that’s the perfect word for it – weird – because to call it depraved is inaccurate. I’m certainly the last person on Earth to complain about depraved content, given the kinds of hentai I’ve been known to enjoy and the kinds of things I’ve had my own characters do in the stories I’ve written myself, but like I said, this didn’t come across as depraved. It was just fucking weird and off-putting, like seeing a drunk taking a piss in public or a hobo jerking off on the bus. It just made me want to look away.Yes, I am kink-shaming. Don’t @ me. Maybe some things don’t need to be made into TV shows and inflicted upon the populace. Maybe it’s okay to keep some things to yourself. I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if you have a scat fetish, please do not make an anime about it. It costs 0 dollars to not make it.Point and case, I gave up about halfway through episode 4 or 5 and watched the rest of the show on 3x speed.As if to add insult to injury, despite being a series full of fucking spit swapping, it’s strangely prudish when it comes to conventional displays of affection. By the end of 14 whole ass episodes, the duo does not end up sharing even one single solitary kiss.Put your time to better use.

I have had a girlfriend spit in my mouth before, and I still found that scene fucking disgusting.Believe me when I say this, it all goes downhill from there. It becomes fucking all about the magic spit. I call it magic because somehow, whenever they drink each other’s saliva, they are able to feel each other’s emotions, have visions of each other’s thoughts, hell, there’s even one scene where actual physical injuries get transferred – main heroine cuts her hand, some other girl drinks her spit, the same cut appears on the other girl’s hand. Oh, yes, the spit fetish gets spread around like a venereal disease to other characters and normalized. What, you thought it was gonna be some bizarre ritual limited only to the main couple? Think again!It’s exactly as odious and weird as it sounds.And that’s the perfect word for it – weird – because to call it depraved is inaccurate. I’m certainly the last person on Earth to complain about depraved content, given the kinds of hentai I’ve been known to enjoy and the kinds of things I’ve had my own characters do in the stories I’ve written myself, but like I said, this didn’t come across as depraved. It was just fucking weird and off-putting, like seeing a drunk taking a piss in public or a hobo jerking off on the bus. It just made me want to look away.Yes, I am kink-shaming. Don’t @ me. Maybe some things don’t need to be made into TV shows and inflicted upon the populace. Maybe it’s okay to keep some things to yourself. I don’t know who needs to hear this, but if you have a scat fetish, please do not make an anime about it. It costs 0 dollars to not make it.Point and case, I gave up about halfway through episode 4 or 5 and watched the rest of the show on 3x speed.As if to add insult to injury, despite being a series full of fucking spit swapping, it’s strangely prudish when it comes to conventional displays of affection. By the end of 14 whole ass episodes, the duo does not end up sharing even one single solitary kiss.Put your time to better use. Listen to your hair grow, for instance.', 'It started out as a very original new and refreshing anime but then it turn out to be one of those ecchi school boy meet girl  and random shit happens anime. I really start to like this anime but after episode four i see that this started to get repetitive with the sexual innuendos. some of the perverseness i can handle but most of the time it is a tat bit boring.The art is very cool it mixes old school art with new school animation which i find interesting. Characters are far from original like this anime. overall its a 3 at best ', ""Having first read the manga back in late 2007, like most people who looked at this, I was put off by the whole 'drool' thing but unlike most people I still gave it a chance because there's the element of curiosity. How can they turn this into a story? Where can this thing possibly go? I had a read I found myself unable to stop. This is a true gem. And the anime adaptation was a special treat to see the characters move and talk.________________________________________________________________________Story:The story revolves around the main characters, Akira Tsubaki and Mikoto Urabe who have relationship where they share a special 'bond'...through the exchange of saliva. This allows them read each others feelings, thoughts, and dreams. In the world of this anime, the 'bond' is determined by the taste of the drool and how one party reacts to it.They go through different issues and that can occur in real life relationships, and because they're young, it gives the feel of 'discovery'.The pacing isn't fast and it's not slow, it always gets to the point so you likely wont sit there being bored to death or missing anything.________________________________________________________________________Art:Unique, looks quite different from most anime series. It's a simplistic look but the characters, particularly Urabe have the element of elegance. The artists clearly try to get the most out of this design without making it look cheap.________________________________________________________________________Sound:The music isn't something I'd want to download and listen to but at the same time it does a great job in setting the mood for each scene.The VA's do a great job. I cannot think of a better cast to play these characters. Especially Urabe, played by newcomer Ayako Yoshitani. She can sound quiet and reserved but when displaying a variety of emotion, she can do it without sounding forced.________________________________________________________________________Character:The characters seen in this anime may come off as familiar, used in butt-loads of anime. Urabe is the quiet depressing girl, Tsubaki is the underconfident male lead. BUT these cliches worked for the story. It took the dull and familiar and made it interesting again and made great use of it.________________________________________________________________________Enjoyment:What may sound sickening to people actually comes off as 'cute' in this anime. It's possible to get used to the drool thing and actually enjoy it. It's great when a show takes such risks, gives it a feel of uniqueness. This series reminded me why I like Japanese comics and animation, they can be weird, they can be odd, they can be cool, they can be ANYTHING. And that's really good every once in a while.________________________________________________________________________Overall:The anime is a great watch, the manga is a great read. Unlike shonen action series that tend to drag on and on and on like Naruto and Bleach, (or seinen in the case of Gantz). My only problem is that the anime is ONLY 13 episodes while the manga is still going and certain events from the manga are left out, probably so as not to leave anything unresolved. But it is loyal to the original work for the most part so you can watch the anime and continue the manga from where it left off.Solid 4/5 through the exchange of saliva.

I m here to give a review on this Very Unpopular and underrated anime. I will go in the order that You MAL users like to read in.Story - 9/10Just like any anime this one starts with a guy and his daily routine and his extremely ordinary fantasies. Then the most cliche anime happening occurs. A female transfer student who apparently gets to sit exactly near our protagonist. Like any other anime character who is supposed to look weird to the audience she tries her best to stand out in every scene. This is done by either making her laugh spontaneously or making...her sleep during recess. But then why did I give a 9 to the story. Well after some point the anime takes a strange/unique turn. This is where drool/saliva comes in.The protagonist licks our heroins drool when she leaves class after sleeping there. And he gets attracted to it and yabdy yabdy yaa something odd happens (which u guys should see urselfs) and they end up as saliva sharing girlfriend-boyfriend.The story goes on to many different happenings around the couple as they try to keep their ""bond"" a secret. We see the usual gags that can be easily seen in any other anime. Then how is this good. You should see that for yourself now shouldnt you.Art 7/10I am no Master of Arts (lol) but the art was like any other anime. I will leave the decision up to you coz i don\'t really like to say things about something i have no idea of. There were drawn people and lots of colours on my computer screen thats it.Sound 4/10Skipped every OP and ED. They were just irritating. The way the singer said ""SECRET LOVE"" was just annoying as hell. Who made her a singer. BGM was almost unnoticeable.Character 8/10Only once a long time there are anime with unique characters. And Nazo no Kanojo was not one of those anime. The characters were your usual Perverted loner with only one friend who is always hanging around him, A mysterious transfer student (Like every second anime has one) etc etc. But the characters never got on your nerves. It was enjoying to see how they go on with the happenings around them. I am not saying they are unique or different but they are not bad either.Enjoyment/Overall 9/10If you are someone that judges anime by their sound/art Then Get lost and never see anime again. You guys disgust me. Anime should be judged by its Enjoyment only. The source of enjoyment is the Story and the Characters. And that is something no one of us can change. Strangely this anime is really fascinating and i enjoyed it very much. I dont have (and i dont need) a particualr reason for enjoying this anime. I dont want to waste time thinking of one but for your sake here goes. You might like this anime if -- You like Rom/com with considerable amount of ecchi- You like the usual anime stuff and the usual comedy stuff- You can take in a little dose of disgusting things along with the story- You like short haired anime females- You like to wait for romance development.Work on these for now.This anime is not unique or different from your everyday anime. Nothing other than Saliva is different here. So don\'t watch if you ae tired of that stuff. I have a different taste in animes than you have so i won\'t say that you will like this anime. But what I say is true for me. If your want unique anime with an original story then please keep looking .See ya her sleep during recess. But then why did I give a 9 to the story.

It has all the moments of excitement, embarrassment, and downright perversion. Yes, the other reviewers are all divided on the unique emphasis and use of saliva in the series, but for me, it\'s just another, yet strange way for the characters to form a bond. I say the series is underrated and is worth the try, but if you are man enough (perverted) to continue, then I assume you won\'t be disappointed and will actually long for more like me. Can\'t wait for more...Story:It\'s a simple story where Tsubaki uncovers...little bits of information about his mysterious girlfriend, Urabe, as he journeys through the life of a high school student. I wish the plot goes deeper, but I guess I\'ll have to wait as the manga is still continuing and there\'s a high chance there will be more episodes to come.Art/Sound:I compliment the technical part of the series. I also really enjoyed their choices for the opening and ending songs, which are catchy and simple romantic songs and sung by the voice actress for the main female character, which I will put to my anime OST collection.Opening - ""Orchestra of Love"" - Ayako YoshitaniEnding - ""Afterschool Promise"" - Ayako YoshitaniCharacter:Ayako Yoshitani (Urabe Mikoto) made the series because her impressive voice match so perfectly with the Urabe who is portrayed as mysterious, awkward, and unpredictable. If I recall correctly, this series might be Yoshitani\'s first role, anyways, she is a very talented voice actress and I hope to follow her career roles. The rest was nothing to complain about because the story and other characters are made to be straightforward.Enjoyment:I picked this series because it was a recommendation from Seto no Hanayome, another excellent series. All I can say is that I can\'t wait for season two, which means I\'m got sold to the product along with all that ecchi moments and fan service.Overall:The series is definitely for young male group. It\'s probably more perverse and less known than other series that similar to this type of genre of a normal school boy having his life changed after meeting someone that is abnormal. So, if you\'re into that type of genre, then you\'re probably going to get hooked on this one. little bits of information about his mysterious girlfriend, Urabe, as he journeys through the life of a high school student.

The relationship between them could be explored so much more and it moved so slowly that I was sure there had to be a second season out there. I guess I will have to read the Manga to see if this was a bad adaptation, or is there really more to the story.It frustrates me that they dont explain WHY she has this power? It is hinted maybe she is an Alien with her spaceship bookbag tag. I don't know what to make of it.Dont get me wrong...I do not completely hate it, I just wont be recommending it to people who are just starting to watch Anime. Definitely a niche title. I do not completely hate it, I just wont be recommending it to people who are just starting to watch Anime. Definitely a niche title."", 'Wait… Did that guy just lick her drool? Why man, why you do this.Upon first look one might be turned away from this anime. The anime style is a bit older, having being published in 2012. And the synopsis of the anime doesn’t give it justice for the amazing anime it actually is. In my opinion, this anime was just shy of becoming a masterpiece. It is a simple romance anime with a strange theme to go around it. And while some parts of the anime are shocking and seems strange at first, they become a core part of the story and becomes key...in how the main characters interact and the progression of the story. I really did get drawn into the anime and while the anime is a bit old, I thought I would do my best to do a review so I can share my thoughts on the anime 5 years later.*BEFORE WE GO FURTHER INTO THE REVIEW - WARNING *Minor Spoilers* Let\'s continue :)STORYLet’s start this review by looking at the story.Urabe Mikoto is a strange 16 old girl who transfers to the same school as Tsubaki Akira. In the classroom she sits right next to Tsubaki and she is labeled someone who is weird by the entire class. She sleeps during most of the day at her desk and sometimes randomly erupts in a fit of laughter. One day Tsubaki returns to the classroom after school to see Urabe asleep at her desk. Once she wakes up, he sees her face for the first time and says she is cute. Once she leaves to go home Tsubaki sees a puddle of her drool on the desk. Curious to know what it tastes like, he picks some up and licks it - to find that her drool is very sweet. This drool starts a ""bond"" between these characters and they begin to form a relationship.My first thoughts of watching the anime I didn’t know how it would play out. As I continued watching the anime I saw the creators of the anime use the bond of drool in a very interesting way and it no longer became weird to see. Something I loved in this anime was seeing Tsubaki and Urabe exchange drool. In the anime there was also an added supernatural element where they could express feelings, thoughts and even sensation through drool. This allowed the two characters - Tsubaki and Urabe - who were in love, to explore each other and understand each other. It was interesting to see the bond between these two characters through drool and that helped them develop a relationship.For example, in the anime Urabe falls over and hurts her knee, when Urabe gives Tsubaki her drool his knee also begins to hurt. So in some supernatural way, they have a bond and are connected by drool.This bond of drool becomes the basis of the story progression as the characters progress in their relationship and grow more deeply in love. At the heart of the story this anime is a romance anime. The romance is very simple: we see jealously, lust, love and the characters being possessive. This very simple romance story is great and is spiced up by the experience drool adds in the anime - making a very interesting anime with a story that pulls in the viewer and provides a very different experience than conventional romance anime. This story, it’s ideas and how it’s displayed in the anime are well crafted, so rightfully I say that the story was a masterpiece.CHARACTERSNow the story had two main characters in it, there was Urabe Mikito and Tsubaki Akira. There are other supporting characters but today I’ll just focus on those two.Tsubaki Akira seems like an average Japanese high-schooler, he finds that Urabe’s drool is very sweet. Other people who have tasted Urabe’s drool did not have a reaction on the same level as Tsubaki. We see his love grow for this girl, we see him succumb to his libido, lust after his girlfriend and become possessive of her when she is noticed by other guys. Most people (wether or not you have been in a relationship before) will be able to understand this. This guy is simply a boy who is in love with a girl. Again we see this idea of a simple romance anime done right. And they really have, in the character of Tsubaki we see by his actions and thoughts. This is a guy in love. And because we can relate to that on some level we enjoy him as a character.Now let’s look at Tsubaki’s other half, and by that I mean let’s talk about Urabe Mikito. Urabe is a mysterious girl. If I were to compare her to character in other anime, she similar in some ways to Rikka Takanashi from Chuunibyou. Urabe is mysterious, withdrawn and seemingly doesn’t know how to reciprocate her feelings to Tsubaki. The bond of drool she has with Tsubaki allows her to convey her feelings, sensation, memories and dreams. This allows Urabe to connect with Tsubaki on a different level. By drool he can feel what she feels. And it’s interesting to see the many different ways she expresses herself to Tsubaki by drool. I feel that this bond between them is a level of connection that I haven’t seen in anime before. This is what spices the romance aspect of the anime, and the nature of Urabe as a character as someone who can express her love for Tsubaki through a bond of drool is something so unique, cute and unconventional - yet is easily understood and meaningful to both Tsubaki and Urabe.So my final thoughts are - for a romance anime - these characters are done simply and right. Made interesting by their bond of drool.ARTNow when it comes to art I wasn’t really turned away by the idea of two people exchanging drool. The anime does a great job in making drool appetising. Drool is made out to be something like honey. It’s a clear, thick and glistening liquid that apparently tastes sweet. Now because drool is one of the most important features in the anime - I think the studios did well to make drool appetising, otherwise the viewers would cringe every-time they exchanged drool. So the art in general was pretty consistent and good throughout the anime. It was good to see Urabe’s character design, where her hair would mask most of her face so she would appear a bit more mysterious. Whenever her hair moved and we saw her eyes, we were able to see that she is actually quite cute. The art style of the scenery was just as good as the character design and captured that high school lifestyle quite well.SOUNDThe sound in the anime was good, the opening and ending songs were catchy, the voice acting was great and they were able to express the characters feelings very well, when they were flustered, nervous or upset, we were able to understand. The voice actors performed to their characters well. Urabe was quite monotone and quiet, but spoke with confidence and with insecurity when the anime called for it. And tsubaki sounded like an average high school boy like in most other Japanese anime. Overall the sound was great, the voice acting, soundtrack, opening and ending. I honestly can’t find fault in the sound for this anime.OVERALL/ENJOYMENTWhile writing this review, I’m struggling to articulate how amazing this anime is. For a romance anime it did all the simple things right. For a school setting it portrayed the high school scene very well. And for a seinen anime, which is targeted at people my age I thought that the themes were interesting and relatable.So what am I’m trying to say? I’m trying to say, if you love simple romance in anime then go watch this anime. The use of drool as a bond between the two main characters is not too strange, and I’ve come to admire and value how drool has bonded them, especially the supernatural elements. It sounds weird coming from me, and of course it is just an anime. But I found it so interesting how drool was used to express feelings and sensation. It’s a level of connection and deepness that is unique to this anime and distinguishes this anime from all other of it’s genre.If you enjoyed other anime like chuunbyou there are some similarities.Both anime have a mysterious girl, who has a bond to the male protagonist, with a school setting. I definitely recommend you give this anime a go and see where it takes you. You’ll be surprised after watching this anime how much you enjoy it.- Oh yeah, i\'d give this anime a 9/10 :) in how the main characters interact and the progression of the story. I really did get drawn into the anime and while the anime is a bit old, I thought I would do my best to do a review so I can share my thoughts on the anime 5 years later.*BEFORE WE GO FURTHER INTO THE REVIEW - WARNING *Minor Spoilers* Let\'s continue :)STORYLet’s start this review by looking at the story.Urabe Mikoto is a strange 16 old girl who transfers to the same school as Tsubaki Akira.

The art style of the scenery was just as good as the character design and captured that high school lifestyle quite well.SOUNDThe sound in the anime was good, the opening and ending songs were catchy, the voice acting was great and they were able to express the characters feelings very well, when they were flustered, nervous or upset, we were able to understand. The voice actors performed to their characters well. Urabe was quite monotone and quiet, but spoke with confidence and with insecurity when the anime called for it. And tsubaki sounded like an average high school boy like in most other Japanese anime. Overall the sound was great, the voice acting, soundtrack, opening and ending. I honestly can’t find fault in the sound for this anime.OVERALL/ENJOYMENTWhile writing this review, I’m struggling to articulate how amazing this anime is. For a romance anime it did all the simple things right. For a school setting it portrayed the high school scene very well. And for a seinen anime, which is targeted at people my age I thought that the themes were interesting and relatable.So what am I’m trying to say? I’m trying to say, if you love simple romance in anime then go watch this anime. The use of drool as a bond between the two main characters is not too strange, and I’ve come to admire and value how drool has bonded them, especially the supernatural elements. It sounds weird coming from me, and of course it is just an anime. But I found it so interesting how drool was used to express feelings and sensation. It’s a level of connection and deepness that is unique to this anime and distinguishes this anime from all other of it’s genre.If you enjoyed other anime like chuunbyou there are some similarities.Both anime have a mysterious girl, who has a bond to the male protagonist, with a school setting. I definitely recommend you give this anime a go and see where it takes you. You’ll be surprised after watching this anime how much you enjoy it.- Oh yeah, i\'d give this anime a 9/10 :)', ""Teenage sexual tension, the show.Girl transfers to school. Girl sleeps at her desk. Boy wakes up girl. Girl walks out. Boy tastes her drool, left on her desk. A saliva induced psychic bond has formed!There is some emphasis on symbolism and dream imagery, but mostly the show revolves around fan service and hand holds teenage boys through some basic elements of teenage romance and expectations.It's an indulgence and a fantasy of meeting the cool/alternative girl and experiencing some excitement, awkwardness, confusion and controversy.I recommend it because the author has an artful way of broaching this topic that you won't really see anywhere else....The fan service is intended to be more intimate and less flamboyant or flippant as it often is in rom-coms, though the obligatory beach scene is featured.It is dirty without being lecherous and pushes edgy sexiness without it being cheap. Emotional investment and interest exists from the start to end.

I nearly threw up, I am literally being serious, i dropped my food and ran to the toilet gagging.All i have to say is, what the hell is wrong with Japanese people, not once in the long years of being with my other half have i ever wanted to purposely suck...her spit, its ******* rancid.... honestly, I know we need some originality in the romance sector of anime but for the love of god at least let it be something that does not make me want to vomit in the literal meaning of the word. her spit, its ******* rancid.... honestly, I know we need some originality in the romance sector of anime but for the love of god at least let it be something that does not make me want to vomit in the literal meaning of the word."", ""Akira meets Mikoto.  Akira just so happens to see a pile of drool laying on Mikotos desk, and like we know everyone would...(just kidding) he takes his finger and slides it threw and tastes it.  He starts getting sick.  After Mikoto meets him and lets him know it's due to her drool they start meeting every day and swapping drool.  Now as disgusting as that sounds the anime is actually turning out to be a cute romance.  Mikoto seems shy, but doesn't know how to convey her feelings properly without sharing her drool.  So Akira happily accepts and gets...to experience her feelings first hand.  They slowly but surely form a bond other than swapping spit.  Akira and Mikoto start to figure out what a relationship means and the things you experience when you are in a relationship.I like this anime because of the bond they form. Even though it was a little slow at first, I am glad I stuck it out.  I enjoy watching Mikoto and Akira slowly figure out what a relationship entails like holding hands or possibly calling each other by their first names.  They make speculations that she may be out of this world, so we'll have to wait and see if there is going to be some twists that soon follow.

But from the first episode I almost stopped watching. If you hate drool or other bodily liquids then I wouldn\'t recommend this anime. It is...mysterious.Story gets a 7. It was good. It doesn\'t really bog you down with over the top fighting scenes or overly gush love scenes, but it has its balance. The story is boy meets girl- boy ingests girls drool- they\'re together. The story is just them developing their unique love- which is different and pretty refreshing from other anime story lines. Again this anime seems like it\'s setting...you up for a major story plot but take this anime for what it is-Comedy/School Romance. Nudity does have some parts to this.Art was difficult to say but if I had to round it, it would be a 7 for me. The backgrounds and characters were exceedingly amazing but taking it for what it is it was well drawn out. Certain scenes with the swapping of saliva gave the clear liquid a shine to it, and details in the characters when they most needed it to help emphasize their actions, mainly focusing on the lips, face, and the body. The dream scenes backgrounds were good, and the ending song\'s art was done in a different style- that was nice. The animation for when the characters ran was actually fun to watch, since it looks slightly awkward but it still fits, and you think- how is that humanly possible?Sound also gets a 7 since the more exaggerated and unique sounds came from Mikoto\'s drool, her scissors actions,  and all the minor sounds that usually extend from Mikoto or Tsubaki\'s actions. The ending and opening sounds are really good, and cute. It does fit the story well.Character also a straight 7. Thankfully they focused on a few set characters and developed them based on what the plot actually gave us from the get go. Of course it is slightly disappointing that not much back stories or more information about the main characters are given, but for this who really needs to know? They were all laughable but again the swapping of drool was a real turn off for me- just...no. But each character has his/her own personality and it\'s cute to see how the main two become so possessive.Overall My Enjoyment were both 6\'s and. Honestly it ranged from 6-7 depending on the episode. The drool thing was a set back and waiting for something ""major"" to happen within the story or to the two main characters was somewhat annoying but it was entertaining, smooth through out the entirety of the series, not as predictable as most would think, and has you leaving curious about certain things and may get you to read the manga- I guess it\'s just that Mysterious. ^.~ you up for a major story plot but take this anime for what it is-Comedy/School Romance.

Despite the very obviously odd premise, Mysterious Girlfriend X can be likened to Urabe\'s drool, very sweet. The first love innocence of this story is very touching and the two main characters are both portrayed as very likeable and sympathetic. While Urabe  seems wise beyond her years, Tsubaki is very average but has enough sense to realize how lucky he is to have such a cute and unique GF and Urabe is definitely the dominant partner in their relationship.While the era  is never...explicitly stated in the anime, the absence of internet and cell phones, combined with the posters on Tsubaki\'s bedroom wall, including Star Wars, suggest it is set in the late \'70s or early \'80s. (The poster actually says ""Star Mars"" and there are a few other jokey details like this thru out the series for the more observant viewer to enjoy!)The general pace of the series is relaxed with each episode showing Urabe and Tsubaki\'s relationship slowly and gradually developing. Supporting characters such as Tsubaki\'s best friend and his GF Ayuko are also likeable and perhaps a little more relatable than the highly mysterious and unusual Urabe. Their more conventional relationship acts as a kind of foil to Urabe and Tsubaki\'s slightly fetishistic spit based bond.Both in form and content there is at times a kind of understated gentleness to the whole experience. Visually the series has a subtle beauty to it. The sunset scenes especially, with Tsubaki and Urabe walking home from school together have a special romantic atmosphere to them. And much of the story telling of their relationship and character development takes place in these scenes.Overall we are treated to a very high quality show that handles its weird, somewhat fetishistic premise in such a classy way that makes what could have either been a bad joke or a complete disaster totally acceptable, suspending any feelings of disbelief. To top off the all round first class quality of the whole experience is the music thru out, which compliments perfectly, including the up beat yet strangely nostalgic feeling to the closing theme.

A few episodes forward, the story has a bit more dept than I initially thought. It's all about teenagers experiencing love for the first time, there is quite a bit of room for character development, which I enjoy. A couple of minor things that bothered me so far:- The main characters not wondering...why sharing saliva leads to some very unnatural effects like getting each other's injuries and stuff. The emotional part is Ok, but the physical aspect could have been toned down a bit.- Not enough care was given to the design of the male character, he is a bit boring in comparison to his GF.Art - 7: Not really the best I have seen.

Tsubaki and Urabe will never be able to do more that a quick kiss if they do end up kissing.  Think about it.  Both have strong emotions, but so far things have been a one way street with \'portion control\'.

Although some people mind find it disgusting and may be turned-off to this Anime, but I assure you that this is a good Anime. Anyway, the story is pretty good.Art/AnimationThe Art and the Animation looks pretty old, like it was an Anime from 2002 - 2005 but even though the art look old, It still looks pretty good. Especially during the Dream sequences. One thing I don\'t like though is that everybody looks like everybody....I\'m not even joking. Tsubaki\'s sister looks like his Middle School crush but with a different hairstyle. I do understand that it would be hard doing that but they could\'ve atleast tried. But eh, It\'s pretty fine I guess.SoundThe OST for this Anime is Amazing! The Opening sequence and the Ending Sequence are superbly catchy. It\'s nice that the Voice Actress of the MC sang both the Opening and the Ending which is pretty cool. Her voice is really great. The Instrumental during the Dream Sequences is Also good. It really fits the setting of the Dream Sequence. Overall, the soundtrack is superbly good. I recommend you download it for osu or something.CharacterUrabe Mikoto is my favorite Female Character in Anime. Even though there\'s not much to be said about her, there\'s just something that I can\'t say that made me attracted to her. Her voice actress is great, Her Art style is awesome and her Personality is awesome and it fits the story.Tsubaki Akira is your Typical Romcom Male Character. Not much to be said about him. He\'s just creepy. But Urabe and Tsubaki are perfect to each other. Their Chemistry is really nice. Although I do have one problem, their character development is really slow. They could\'ve made it at a faster phase since this is a short Anime.EnjoymentI really Enjoyed this Anime. This made it to my Top 5 Animes that I\'ve watched. It\'s really different from most Romance Animes. Most Romance Animes would just go on Dates and do this and do that but that\'s not the case here which is really refreshing because I\'m tired of the cliche Romance format.OverallI enjoyed this anime Overall. Best anime I\'ve watched in a while. It\'s sad that it\'s a ""Read the Manga"" type of ending which I really don\'t mind. Hopefully there will be a season 2, although the chances of a new season is very slim due to the fact the the fan base is really small to the type of Anime. To conclude this review in 1 phrase, all I can say is ""Best Romance Anime Ever""Edit: I was kinda biased making this review 2 years ago. I\'m not even joking. Tsubaki\'s sister looks like his Middle School crush but with a different hairstyle. I do understand that it would be hard doing that but they could\'ve atleast tried. But eh, It\'s pretty fine I guess.SoundThe OST for this Anime is Amazing! The Opening sequence and the Ending Sequence are superbly catchy. It\'s nice that the Voice Actress of the MC sang both the Opening and the Ending which is pretty cool. Her voice is really great. The Instrumental during the Dream Sequences is Also good. It really fits the setting of the Dream Sequence. Overall, the soundtrack is superbly good. I recommend you download it for osu or something.CharacterUrabe Mikoto is my favorite Female Character in Anime. Even though there\'s not much to be said about her, there\'s just something that I can\'t say that made me attracted to her. Her voice actress is great, Her Art style is awesome and her Personality is awesome and it fits the story.Tsubaki Akira is your Typical Romcom Male Character. Not much to be said about him. He\'s just creepy. But Urabe and Tsubaki are perfect to each other. Their Chemistry is really nice. Although I do have one problem, their character development is really slow. They could\'ve made it at a faster phase since this is a short Anime.EnjoymentI really Enjoyed this Anime. This made it to my Top 5 Animes that I\'ve watched. It\'s really different from most Romance Animes.

And by this, I mean not only referencing a real theory on real world, but the show itself might have a theoretical ground, a system inside. I enjoyed this show since it has the both.You must watch the show with a knowledge of psychoanalysis background and a bit of Carl Jung\'s social unconscious. It has a mysterical ground of transfer unconscious state of emotions and thoughts through saliva. And these affecting the real physical world and neurological state is just depends of Carl Jung\'s metaphysical description of social unconscious.==============The story is very good. It is actually a school...anime where the story takes in, but the actions of that ""mysterious girl"" in the story (to achive transferring some emotions through his new boyfriend\'s mind) makes it curious and you were never be able to drop it to understand what exactly the flying fuck is going on there.Art is old-style, that ecchi animes of late of 90\'s and beginning of 2000\'s you\'ll remember. So at least I said ""Yay, I feel as before if I keep watching this show"" and made me feel utterly like that. A stunning old-style.The sounds, OSTs, oh god. Those were really amazing. Especially OSTs will make you inside the chamber of story and you will feel like the observer of whole things. That\'s just great.Character development was good, but the development of our main boy would be better. I know it is a cult to have a sexually unexperienced boy in these kind of series, but it became too mainstream. However, this type of characters make the story develop, I accept. I am just complaining about mainstream and why authors never try the hard way just one single time.I really really enjoyed the series. You must watch it. Instead of being ecchi, it has really soft taste on it.

The story is pretty much about a somewhat perverted guy and his mysterious girlfriend. Throughout the show it made me think, are these two even together? because they didn't do hardly anything that normal couples do like the simple things, cuddling, kissing, or even holding hands. If you're one of those people who are begging for the first kiss to happen, then you're going to be disappointed.First of all we have, Urabe Mikoto. She first appears...as a rather normal, shy type of girl with a rather gothic type of style. In class, she happens to sit next to Tsubaki Akira. And one day, while in the middle of class, she just bursts out laughing for no reason what so ever. You find out what it is later on in the show but at that time, people just thought she was crazy and decided to keep their distance. She was never fazed by this, as you would expect of her character. She always seems like she's trying to hide her emotions as best as she can, which makes it a little sad in some ways.As for Tsubaki Akira, he's just your average high school guy who is presented as a perverted character as well as his best friend. He lives with is older sister who has always been like a mother to him, they have a pretty close relationship. One day, Tsubaki notices that Urabe has left some drool on her classroom desk where she had been sleeping, and he just happened to TASTE IT. That's right. And that's pretty much how there relationship began to bloom. Once he and Urabe started dating, he was always thinking of her in lewd ways, even though that's in his mind and not telling Urabe...she knows exactly when he's thinking it.We see other characters who are important to the show too. One being from his past and another being his friend's girlfriend (they have actually kissed at least) I really think this show deserves a second season, there a still questions that need answers, and a lot of great stuff happens in the manga, but it would be so much better in an anime. I would love to see Tsubaki's and Urabe's relationship grow. as a rather normal, shy type of girl with a rather gothic type of style. In class, she happens to sit next to Tsubaki Akira.

It passes into a fantasy plot line where they share a drool relationship that allows people who taste her drool to 'bond' in a empathetic/telepathic sense.Essentially this is a fun show to watch.  It moves quickly and has such a unique premise that's kind of queer and bizarrely-humorously fascinating.  There's a bit of a learning curve to things, but not so much that you feel lost, more like curious as to how the next-thing is going to...play out.There's definitely an ecchi component to things, but essentially it's just a light romantic comedy that explores young/first love via a different conduit than the typical stalker aspect.I'd actually recommend this show!  It's quick fun and it has a satisfactory ending.  I hate shows that take you on a long scenic drive then push you over the cliff or leave you hanging for a ride that will never show. play out.There's definitely an ecchi component to things, but essentially it's just a light romantic comedy that explores young/first love via a different conduit than the typical stalker aspect.I'd actually recommend this show!

Each episode felt pretty unique/quirky, mysterious, and even suspenseful at times. I found it quite refreshing amongst a backdrop of many other overly clichéd romances out there. Although, it could be better if the characters were a bit older and perhaps more atmospheric music was woven into the background. The tension between the characters doesn't really need to be held up by any more music to be as wonderful as it is though. It definitely earns its R rating though considering some scenes but it...seems to almost have fun/jokes with itself in the process so it's quite entertaining. seems to almost have fun/jokes with itself in the process so it's quite entertaining."", ""On the surface, Mysterious Girlfriend X may seem like a weird take on high school romance, but there is a deeper meaning behind all the madness. When Tsubaki and Urabe exchange drool, they understand each other's feelings. In the real world, there is no magic substance or method like this. Partners have to use words, gifts, or other ways to communicate to each other how they feel. Deep down, Mysterious Girlfriend X is an anime about communication and what it looks like when two people understand each other in the same moment.The art style is unique and animation consistent. All the voice actors conveyed the...characters' emotions well. Personally, Urabe's VA stood out to me a lot and not to mention Kaji Yuuki. Each episode follows a new plot, but with only 13 episodes there is plenty of development between the main couple and even friends. I also enjoyed how there was minimal drama (not zero) but that's just my personal taste. Last but not least, the music was a banger too. Not just the opening and ending music, but the drum roll whenever Urabe used her scissor technique is iconic.Overall, I'm glad I stumbled on this gem on the internet. The unorthodox take on high school romance was refreshing and an anime I'll never forget. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone because there might be some misunderstandings.

Imagine you are asocial guy working from home, that never talked to other people, a genius that never had any form of a social interaction. Can you be author of an anime? The answer is YES! YES! YOU CAN!!! You could be the author of ""Mysterious Girlfriend X"".There are two types of romantic genre in anime. On one side you have an anime series that attempts to reflect a realistic relationship between a boy and a girl. On the other side, there are those, which goes...for what community wants - moe and tsundere characters, that some late teens can associate with their own experience. But ""Mysterious Girlfriend X"" is different. It does not focus on the mainstream things in a relationship like kiss, sex, feelings, emotion, the curiosity of the experience. No, it focus on one thing only, one thing that is more powerful than anything in a relationship - DROOL!!!Story: 1The first episode is the climax of the viewer selection for this anime. If you find that tasting other people\'s drool disgusting, you have no chance to understand the author\'s mental state in the first place. Such weaklings are filtered out in the first half of the episode.The second half of the episode is the main setup. Our protagonist is now sick, due to tasting a girl\'s drool. At this point it seems rational that may be the girl is sick or she has some kind of chemical or something. But then it is confirmed it is not the case. This fever is not normal sickness, it is LOVE SICKNESS. At this point, me, an atheist started praying to all known gods, please, let this girl be an alien, a tentacle monster, a god, a spirit of some kind. Anything supernatural will show that the author is just joking and it does not really express his understanding of how love works. But, no, that is not the anime I was looking for. Apparently the power of DROOL can create relationship between a boy and a girl.Art & Sound: 8Now let\'s talk about art and music. We have a boy and girl into relationship and the boy dreamed to kiss the girl. We have a perfect city sunset, and the boy and the girl watching each other in the eyes. Soft romantic music plays in the background. Their faces getting closer, and then... you FEEL IT, something forms in your chest. A feeling so strong, that you cannot stop it, you must express it. The best LAUGHTER I ever had... wait what? Apparently, if you think that exchanging drool through a kiss is really effective method that would perfectly fit the scene described above, you are too normal for this anime. BECAUSE A DREAM OF A KISS OR SEX EXCHANGED BY DROOL USING YOUR FINGER IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ACTUAL KISS OR SEX. DROOL IS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYTHING. Have you not learned anything from this anime, normie?!And this is the turning point in this anime. If you passed through the first episode and laughed your drool off, while watching a seriously developing relationship between newly created couple, you cannot stop watching. But with every episode the reality (not the anime) becomes darker. You begin to realize the author\'s mental state and his understanding of the relationship between a boy and a girl. How could anyone alive made such an anime?To make the matters worse, it turns out, the author was fan (but completely misunderstood) ""Kill la Kill"". Not only the main female protagonist have resemblance to Ryuuko, but she is supernaturally skilled with scissors, she carry in her pants... (At least they are normal scissors, not a huge ones). However, this only reveals that the author is also part of the anime community.As the relationship Urabe and Tsubake develops, the author reveal that the power of the DROOL really depends on the context. Apparently, if the girl is naked, her sexual desires are expressed through the saliva in her mouth and if you taste that you could experience the thing this genre is forbidden to show (to maintain its rating). DROOL can be used not only to satisfy you sexually, it can be used to make friends (only between girls, though, if it is between boys it would be gay, and between genders would be too sexual, so it would be cheating).By the end of this anime, you can understand clearly the outcome. In order a boy and a girl to have a relationship, they do not need to make actions that the author never ever experienced in his life. No, sex, kissing, hugging, going out, are unnecessary. The only thing you need is drool and dreaming about sex, kissing, hugging, going out, with the girl you like. All emotions are exchanged through drool and you do not need anything else in your life.Enjoyment: 10 -> 1 (average 5)First few episodes is the thing that cling to your soul in this anime. Your hope that what you watch is some kind of parody and you are supposed to laugh is the only thing that keeps your sanity and you would truly enjoy that anime. As the story becomes more complicated and serious, though, the understanding of the author mental state really removes the enjoyment. You become sad and you clearly understand that reality could be so cruel. You start worrying about the author, wondering what kind of misunderstanding about social skills would happen next. At the end you cling to the one and only truth, no matter how bad are your social skills and what tragedy you had in your life, your life is much more worth in comparison to the life of the author. And you are happy that you have discovered the hidden gem of anime, that is so bad, it is actually good. You are happy to never see anime like this before. At this point, anything about the anime community: hentai, ecchi, tsundere, moe, weaboos, waifus, cross-dressers, cosplay orgies, anything feels more normal than this anime. I hope I never see a ""romance"" like this anywhere in real or imaginary worlds ever again. for what community wants - moe and tsundere characters, that some late teens can associate with their own experience.

I hope I never see a ""romance"" like this anywhere in real or imaginary worlds ever again.', 'This anime has a premise that\'s bound to elicit ""only in Japan"" snickers -- our main characters bond through the exchange of drool.While that is about as unrealistic as can be, and there are other aspects of the anime that are extremely unusual for a romantic slice of life high school scenario, when it comes to the relationship between Tsubaki and Urabe, the main characters, it\'s refreshingly different from most high school romances, and probably closer to real teenage feelings than most.Story (6/10):  The premise is kind of ridiculous (though I wonder just how ridiculous it is in Japan where drool appears to have...a special, favoured place in the erotic vocabulary), the story itself is not bad at all for its type -- we don\'t have a dumb harem here where the guy can\'t make up his mind, nor do we have endless episodes of ""will they, won\'t they get together""; no, the girl is the aggressor, these two start dating right away, and while their progress is very slow, it\'s definitely progress, and I love the expectedness of Urabe whenever Tsubaki does something very much expected.  The show is marked as ""ecchi"", but while there is definitely a certain amount of fan service, it\'s actually well-embedded in the story, and doesn\'t consist of ye olde ""oops I fell and you saw my panties"" excuses, and girls grabbing each other\'s boobs. I usually avoid ecchi (I\'m not interested in 2D girls teasing excitable male otaku without an actual sex life), but here it didn\'t bother me.Art (5/10): The show has a very nostalgic look, with an old-school art style that dates back to the 1990s.  I didn\'t like that style much then, and I don\'t like it now, but one\'s got to appreciate how well it evokes that period.  It does wonders with Urabe\'s expressions when the long bangs part.  The animation is ok; there\'s more background animation than usual.  There are some surreal dream sequences in 3D that look at the same time disjointed and interesting, and I\'ve rewound and rewatched quite a bit because there\'s much to see; alas as the series progresses, those disappear.  Every bit of drool glistens and sparkles like treasure.Sound (6/10): I love the voice of Urabe, and unfortunately, that\'s the only thing the voice actress has done.  Shame; it\'s a very distinctive voice, blessedly not cutesy high-pitched, and she does an outstanding job. The other voice talent is average.  The BGM is quirky, evoking a carnival at times, and on occasion being outright creepy, OP and ED are pleasant but forgettable.Character (6/10):  Urabe is a new transfer student in Tsubaki\'s class, she\'s taciturn, antisocial and not shy about telling people off, her eyes are covered by her bangs, she sleeps every available moment, and she has spurts of astonishing honesty with Tsubaki.  She has loads of character, and is indeed mysterious -- there seems to be a supernatural element to her, but nothing ever becomes clear.  She has a bunch of UFO paraphernalia which could be hinting that she is an alien, but by the end I thought maybe it\'s just a metaphor for her being weird, alien among her peers.  She can also transmit feelings and even actual injuries through her drool, and can receive feelings through other people\'s drool, and probably that is a metaphor as well -- it\'s a PG-rated way to stand for X-rated fluid exchanges.  How did she acquire her amazing prowess with scissors?  Nobody knows.  Mysterious girlfriend, indeed (I presume the X stands for her scissors).Tsubaki on the other hand is an open book:  he\'s the usual dense, naive, but naturally horny teenage boy without personality.  He can\'t say no to anyone, but on occasion Urabe gets him to actually be honest with her, and he shows some vestiges of a spine. He is exchangeable with every other clueless git teenage boy in every other romcom.Oka is Tsubaki\'s friend Ueno\'s girlfriend, and she stakes an unusually strong interest in Urabe, managing to get her to stop sleeping and have lunch with her, getting in on the drool action, and egging Urabe on when it comes to sexual matters.  She\'s the only person who knows Urabe and Tsubaki are a couple (by the end there is only one other person).  I feel a vague dislike for Oka; probably because I like Urabe so much in part because she forges her own path, and Oka is trying to make her more ""normal"".  That\'s typical Japanese though; the force to conform is always strong.Enjoyment (5/10):  I would have enjoyed this a lot more had it not been for the copious drool, which was just gross.  I don\'t find drool erotic to begin with, and the drool here was a much more viscous fluid, reminiscent of honey -- and if I could have convinced myself it was honey it would have been fine.  But the word ""drool"" in combination with the texture just looked slimy to me, and I found myself actually gagging at times, and had to look away.  I am deducting 2 points because it was just so damn frequent.Total: 28 for 5 categories, rounding up to 6. a special, favoured place in the erotic vocabulary), the story itself is not bad at all for its type -- we don\'t have a dumb harem here where the guy can\'t make up his mind, nor do we have endless episodes of ""will they, won\'t they get together""; no, the girl is the aggressor, these two start dating right away, and while their progress is very slow, it\'s definitely progress, and I love the expectedness of Urabe whenever Tsubaki does something very much expected.

It’s too bad most potential viewers will casually overlook NnKx for its low MAL score,  ecchi tag, retro artwork or the saliva-swapping theme. I found it to be a charming and unique take on the cliché, slice of life high school romance story.False Cons.Ecchi- This is not an ecchi anime—no harem, no boob shot quota, no sloppily-introduced sexual situations. Urabe is a babe but that’s hardly a reason to slap an ecchi tag onto NnKx.Art-The art is great. It’s a little retro 1980’s but it’s still of great quality. I stopped even noticing it after episode 1....The character designs are pretty cool too, especially Urabe. They did a great job pulling off the “pretty-ugly girl” routine. She can look like an expressionless tangle of matted hair in one shot and super cute chick in the next just by parting her bangs.Drool: I need to devote a paragraph to this topic because the anime’s short description is misleading, tacky and gross, and is bound to either turn viewers off to watching it or turn them on…but for the wrong reason. There is no question that saliva transfer is an integral part of this anime and I think it’s normal to raise one’s eyebrows at that concept. I spent the first few episodes trying to decide if drool was meant to have some deeper, metaphorical meaning, or if I had accidentally stumbled into a niche-fetish anime. I’m pleased to say that this anime surprised me. To my great relief, saliva sharing was portrayed as intimate rather than erotic, tender rather than vulgar, and actually quite dignified rather than disgusting. It was akin to blood in a vampire movie, and a creative way for two ordinarily unexpressive characters to maintain an intimate, supernatural bond.Pros:The Japanese voice actress for Urabe was amazing. Mature, reserved, sincere but not monotone. Just listen to a clip…Urabe’s character was pretty interesting too. Stubborn, mature, eccentric, genuine, vulnerable, mysterious.Real Cons-This anime was too short. It did a thorough job in establishing character growth but just stopped suddenly. It’s still worth watching but just be aware that almost all of your questions will remain unanswered by the end.Overall: I really liked this anime and thought it was a sweet and unique little romance story. The main downside is that you’ll have to go to the manga (which is ongoing) if you want to find out what happens next. I’m always plus-minus with that.

Ecchi, drama, romance; there’s a new approach with these types of genres in the story. Toss aside holding hands, hugging, and kissing; Imagine romantic bond and communication of a couple by sharing their drools. Now, that’s a different kind of romance alright. The very fact that the romance is so different makes the normal romantic moments worth the wait. It’s what makes the series romance aspect still nicely done in its own way. Even the ecchi part is not your typical one. There’s a different stimulation that you definitely rarely see in...your everyday ecchi series. It’s not overly lewd or far-fetched with so much fanservices. It’s just like a little tease but still justifiable.About the CHARACTERSMajority of the characters can be considered as common but the main protagonist is definitely a different story! Have you seen a character that puts scissors on her panty, conveys her true feelings through sharing her drool, and vomits a huge amount of drool when happy? I bet you haven’t! The title couldn’t be perfect for her character. In fact, in every episode there’s a new mystery about her. However, despite her weirdness it is surprising how strong her resolve and beliefs are which makes her still an effective and likeable female protagonist. The main characters are definitely not your ordinary couple. Like, instead of kissing before parting ways they would share drool! Still, the originality of their relationship makes them memorable and interesting.About the ANIMATIONFor some reason, the animation is not particularly that amazing considering it’s a new series. Well, I have a misconception that if its latest then it is given that the animation should be latest or amazing enough. The sounds sometimes would make you feel that the series is a horror one. It has a very creepy feeling to it.About the ENJOYMENTIt is true that there are drools everywhere but the most interesting part is how the writer still able to make a nice storyline out of it. Imagine, “drool” for a key plot of a story. Despite how it sounds, I still can’t help but be in awe on how creative and original it is. The writer is able to make “sharing of drool” still romantic on its own way. With all its differences and uniqueness from other series, it definitely spells “breath of fresh air”. your everyday ecchi series. It’s not overly lewd or far-fetched with so much fanservices.

Perhaps, it's a guilty pleasure anime for me or maybe that's the mystery. Now about the drool. Yes! It's huge factor of the anime. Exchange, swap, just about any way you can think about using drool will be used. I say this because it's a make it or break it for some because this a romance anime after all.Story: 7Akira Tsubaki is our protagonist and is at the stage in high-school where he becomes more interested in girls. Having an odd dream...about finally getting a girlfriend this year. A girl known as Mikoto Urabe transfers into his school that same day. Instantly, she's the center of attention, but becomes an odd-ball or that weird kid that no one wants to be associated with. Laughing out blue in the middle of school lesson and sleeping during lunch hour instead of choosing to chatting with her classmates.Anyhow, she oversleeps until sunset; Tsubaki having forgotten his bags in his class makes his way back to the class to find fast asleep Urabe, eventually tugging on her arm he wakes Urabe up. After that he catches a glimpse of Urabe face for the first time, since having so much hair conceal it. As she arises from her desk she, leaves a drool stain is left on the desk.After Urabe's depature, Tsubaki decides to pick up the drool with his fingertip and suck on it. This is start of something odd and the beginning of their relationship.Art & Sound: 9 | 8The studio is known for only producing 'Hentai', but as far this anime goes is ecchi. It's art-style is very unique and consistent throughout the anime. Nice shading is wonderful. It looks and feel like an old school anime. The soundtrack ' A Magical Dream' ost is so wonderful catchy.Characters: 8The mysterious girlfriend known as Mikoto Urabe is a particular odd girl, has all the right intentions just like Akira Tsubaki. Always insisting in of carrying scissors in her panties. She has very unique approach to their relationship from others.Akira Tsubaki, is a very possessive guy that only wants Urube from himself, wanting to the common stuff that couple would actually do. It's fantastic seeing their relationship unfold right before someone's eye. You can't help but see these to grow and better themselves for one another.Ueno Kouehi is Tsubaki befriend and his guide to being a boyfriend as well as bit of pervert. Ueno is dating Ayuko Oya which is only girl in school that actually tries to befriend Urabe.Enjoyment: 10It's a guilty pleasure anime, what more can I say. Maybe I'm just a hopeless romantic, but after are watching it I still enjoy this anime every bit.Final Thoughts/Overall: 9Having seen the anime, I went out of my way to read the manga. It's really faithful adaption. However, not a complete one since it produced to gain more popularity for the manga. It's a great anime doesn't do anything different from other romance anime but it does have small addition that makes it so much different from other romances which is the make it or break it factor 'drool' about finally getting a girlfriend this year.

Haunting theme that crescendos into a whimsical waltz aong with the opening and ending themes that are grounded more in the slice-of-life genre pleasing to the ears.Negatives:* Obvious...wish-fulfilment where various fetishes are highlighted.* Unequal social roles difficult to ignore. Only females are seen in sexually provocative positions, a perpetuation of prominent male attitudes in Japanese culture.* Lacks character development. A second or further seasons are needed to delve deeper into these characters.Conclusion:An intriguing show, which depicts the growth of intimacy between teenagers in a unique fashion, but may put off certain viewers by its unbalanced fan service and slightly masochistic tendencies. wish-fulfilment where various fetishes are highlighted.* Unequal social roles difficult to ignore.

She\'s just crazy, that\'s all.Drool magic is explained as being just a common part of the setting, it\'s not special in any way.So it all comes to yet another ""a boy and his tsundere"", except that tsundere is often acting like kudere and some times like...chuni.The art looks actually nice when it does. There are a lot of visible cheap budget cuts, but there also are a lot of very nice looking scenes and animations. And the naked girls do look great (hate you for censoring though). If only there was something other than the art.The main characters are as empty as they can be and I am thankful for the fact that they do not take all the screen time. But they do take more than enough to start boring you.So overall it\'s a somewhat boring weird fetish anime with nice looking naked girls, but those are censored and there is nothing else worth watching. There\'s also nothing else bad enough to make it worse than it is.If you\'re into drool, it\'s a must; and if you\'re not, don\'t waste your time. chuni.The art looks actually nice when it does.

', ""This was such a strange one...Okay, so to start. Yes, this is an anime that revolves around saliva. Yes, this is really weird during the first few episodes. However I can say that you likely will get desensitized to it as you progress.Story: 9/10The story begins with a boy tasting the drool left on a girl's desk. Not your typical romantic decision, but that's apparently somewhat normal in this universe (given that other characters also share spit in this show). This leads to our MC getting into a relationship with the girl, though it starts as pretty much just him tasting her drool every...day. This is the point where I feel most people would drop the show. It's just such a strange idea to wrap your head around, not to mention how gross most people think it is. However, the story progresses into a quite healthy romance (for an anime), and since I'm a sucker for good romances, I'm giving it a 9.Art: 7/10The art is alright, but not amazing given that this was released in 2012. The art looks more like one would see from the early 2000s. Not awful, not amazing.Sound: 10/10Personally, I love the way the soundtrack and background music adds to the feel of an anime. This show does a wonderful job in this regard, with a musical accompaniment that seems to come out of the opening to a -- get this -- mystery movie. It's all very Tim Burton-esque, as if we're playing with Victorian-era dolls in an abandoned mansion. This all makes the story run so well, especially in the beginning of the show.Character: 9/10The characters were wonderful and all had their own place in the show. Urabe especially, was an excellently made character, though at first it seems as if she was randomly thought up.Enjoyment: 10/10After I got through the first three episodes or so, it was all uphill. Every interaction we got between the MC and his love interest felt so realistic (apart from the spit of course), and it was a fairly healthy relationship where the couple understood their limits and did their best not to rush anything or cross lines. The communication shown was also something not often seen in romances (though there's one episode where this is not the case, but I will not say which).Overall, a solid 9/10 for an extremely original idea that the creators managed not only to not mess up, but to make it into one of my top 5 romances.

surprisingly months down the line I find this and once again it had a weird concept, but ended up being very entertaining.The story concentrates on Mikoto Urabe and Akira Tsubaki, they have a special relationship that consists of them tasting each others drool, even though this a weird thing to do it has a special meaning to this mysterious couple.Yes the story for this anime couple is centred around them tasting their own drool, now at first I thought it was weird, but the more I watched...the show the more intriguing it got because there was actually a special meaning to this and it was interesting to see that they could feel each others feelings if they tasted each others drool and this would be a major part to their relationship and overtime it would also be a reason to test their relationship, this is another one of those anime's that relies on random intervals to keep the show going so it doesn't really have a major plot, but it is mainly about the development between Urabe and Tsubaki which in my opinion was actually very interesting and enjoyable to watch.I really enjoyed the characters especially Urabe and Tsubaki because despite both of these characters having a weird side to them like Urabe would carry scissors under her skirt and rip something whenever Tsubaki did something that made her uncomfortable and Tsubaki is weird just by the fact he tasted Urabe's drool while she was sleeping, but these two when they are together was really sweet at times because there are moments in their relationship that hits a bump like when Tsubaki takes advantage of Urabe in a situation, but then realises his mistake and not just apologises, but also asks her to slap him, Urabe also thinks of Tsubaki a lot when she experiences something that she hasn't before and wants to experience it with him and this shows that both of them generally care for each other a lot and it was a relationship I could definitely get behind despite the drool tasting, but that seemed more normal (well for this show) over time.There are also two supporting characters Oka and Ueno who are both in a relationship as well and are best friends with Tsubaki and Urabe, Oka gives Urabe relationship advice to her and teases her from time to time because of her shy side and it shows she wanted to help her plus she also had a weird obsession with wrapping foods with bacon and Ueno was Tsubaki's best friend and would sometimes be the cause of some incidents between Urabe and Tsubaki, but he felt like a good friend nonetheless.The Artstyle reminded me of older anime's from the early 2000's so it gave off a nostalgic feel, but probably the most interesting part of the artstyle was Tsubaki's dreams now it was mostly CGI however it looked incredibly weird in a good way and seemed so strange to make me think that dreams could look like this.The Romance was really good the relationship between Urabe and Tsubaki was weird yet really sweet and it was definitely put to the test a lot like when Tsubaki wanted to kiss Urabe or when Tsubaki encountered an old crush who also had feelings for him so a standoff between her and Urabe happened which was certainly and an interesting way of how it went down, certainly different compared to other Romance anime's.Overall I thought this was a great show that shows another weird perspective in the Romance genre that turned out to be really good, so if you're someone looking for a weird, but wonderful show then this will definitely be a good watch for you. the show the more intriguing it got because there was actually a special meaning

With that I'll end.You are free to figure it out for yourself."", 'boy oh boy, do i have a review for you!let me start by saying in overall i did enjoy this anime simply for the fact that it was unique and original but i do not let guilt pleasure to stray me from objectivity!let\'s talk about the positives:1)i actually find it great that it wasn\'t some cheat ""let\'s have anal sex tomorrow"" kind of a relationship, they actually moved forward step by step2)i enjoyed the art, she looked really cute in some shots3)i\'m happy there was no NTR in the story......now let\'s talk about the negatives:1) Drools and spit! now don\'t get me wrong if your girlfriend is a little bit kinky and every now and then asks you to suck on her finger covered with her spit, you shouldn\'t get mad imhoBUT if she threatens you with break up (like this anime did) or asks you to do it every single day (like this anime did!)that\'s a red fucking flag okay, it\'s time for break up2) there is a thin line between being cutely assertive and being a total asshole, she did cross the line, in one instance the poor guy asked her can i take a photo of you please and she told him to fuck off, there is no explanation here she was just being an asshole3)do you remember the first positive thing i said? yeah that can fall from the other side of the bridge too, i mean if after 2 years ""a fucking hug"" is all you get you might wanna add chastity belt to your shop item, i mean seriously the guy couldn\'t hold her hand, couldn\'t touch her, couldn\'t hug her, couldn\'t kiss her, you might as well forbid him from masturbating to other girls4)that scissor thing would have been cute if it wasn\'t a rip off from bakemonotagari5)the whole idea of transferring emotions through spit and drools was kinda...6)the MC,what a pathetic loser, imagine licking the drool of a girl you don\'t even know! and getting turned on by it7) at the last episode you will feel a little angry, it\'s like getting your dick sucked for 12 episode just to see yourself getting blue-balled in the 13!i mean there\'s so much room for growth in this relationship it was too soon to end itbut since guilt pleasure plays a role in my rating system, i will actually give it a 9/10 now let\'s talk about the negatives:1) Drools and spit! now don\'t get me wrong if your girlfriend is a little bit kinky and every now and then asks you to suck on her finger covered with her spit, you shouldn\'t get mad imhoBUT if she threatens you with break up (like this anime did) or asks you to do it every single day (like this anime did!)that\'s a red fucking flag okay, it\'s time for break up2) there is a thin line between being cutely assertive and being a total asshole, she did cross the line, in one instance the poor guy asked her can i take a photo of you please and she told him to fuck off, there is no explanation here she was just being an asshole3)do you remember the first positive thing i said? yeah that can fall from the other side of the bridge too, i mean if after 2 years ""a fucking hug"" is all you get you might wanna add chastity belt to your shop item, i mean seriously the guy couldn\'t hold her hand, couldn\'t touch her, couldn\'t hug her, couldn\'t kiss her, you might as well forbid him from masturbating to other girls4)that scissor thing would have been cute if it wasn\'t a rip off from bakemonotagari5)the whole idea of transferring emotions through spit and drools was kinda...6)the MC,what a pathetic loser, imagine licking the drool of a girl you don\'t even know! and getting turned on by it7) at the last episode you will feel a little angry, it\'s like getting your dick sucked for 12 episode just to see yourself getting blue-balled in the 13!i mean there\'s so much room for growth in this relationship it was too soon to end itbut since guilt pleasure plays a role in my rating system, i will actually give it a 9/10', 'I’ve seen people who say romance is the most boring anime genre. And yes, sometimes it does get boring. The most generic romance I can imagine is a boy who acts like he’s never actually communicated with a female before (trust me lots of male high school protagonists are boring like that), and a tsundere girl who gets pissed most of the time. They meet at school and start dating, and they start adding annoying characters like the girl’s friends or classmates. It might be cute, but it gets boring after a while. Also, this review is gonna be safe of spoilers, so don’t worry...if you haven’t seen the show.Nazo no Kanojo X is definitely not generic or average. Sure, the protagonist, Tsubaki, is an average high school boy like in most romance anime. He begins dating a girl by the name of Mikoto Urabe, but they never kiss or do things that most couples do. They exchange drool.Yes, you read that right. Drool. Spit. It might seem gross, and this anime definitely isn’t for everyone.Urabe is the very definition of weird. She carries scissors in her panties and uses them to shred objects at very high speed whenever she gets annoyed. She seems to be tired most of the time as she’s mainly seen sleeping in class. She doesn’t let Tsubaki touch her or do things to her that most couples do. If you ask her why, she’ll just respond with “I’m just like that”. Her bond with Tsubaki is drool. I would explain how they even got together or started a “drool bond”, but you should just see the first episode for yourself.Urabe tends to intimidate Tsubaki and she’s in full control of the relationship. A very eccentric girl with an average male protagonist. Make Urabe an eccentric male and Tsubaki a generic female, and the score for this show would be even lower than it is right now, because there’s going to be people who consider a guy scaring a female with scissors sexual harassment.And no, the show isn’t just a couple exchanging drool all the time. That would just be seen as weird, but also repetitive, and boring. The very antisocial Urabe actually befriends an extroverted girl named Oka despite her claims of not needing any friends. Of course you need more characters in a story, so add her, another character by the name of Hayakawa who could be seen as an antagonist later on in the story, and several obstacles the bizarre couple experience in their relationship. They even have their own world in their dreams.I’m not forcing people to watch it; if you get grossed out by the first episode then you probably shouldn’t watch the rest, as they continue to share drool. They don’t do it just to stay together, Tsubaki will get sick if he doesn’t taste her drool for an extended period of time. It’s basically what keeps them to actually communicate with each other, and they get closer as the story goes on. Overall the show is an 8/10, it has minor flaws, but I found them easy to overlook. if you haven’t seen the show.Nazo no Kanojo X is definitely not generic or average.

The show hits you in the heart as well as occasionally in the stomach. The romantic elemets are the show are done in a very creative and effective way, so much that even as a Berserk fan it left me smiling like an idiot at times at the sheer amount of cuteness I was witnessing. The characters are all very enjoyable and you all see them as real people you can learn to love as the show goes along. I recommend this show to anyone wanting to enjoy somr good ol adorbale moments and have a...good laugh along the way (just make sure a LITTLE drool doesn't get to you ;) ). good laugh along the way (just make sure a LITTLE drool doesn't get to you ;) )."", '""Mysterious Girlfriend is weird."" A line I feel has become all too synonymous with the series. It feels like it heavily under plays the beauty of it all, the beauty of love and youth.The production for this anime is incredible, especially for such a niche Manga. The animation is set to higher standards than most anime airing today, and it\'s soundtrack masterfully accompanies the atmosphere and tone of the series. Riichi\'s artstyle is magical on moving pictures, and that alone is enough for any ""anime-fan"" to have this on their radar.Mysterious Girlfriend X is more of an experience than it is a conclusive narrative. Afterall...it\'s been a decade since the first season, and with no sign of a season two, it\'s missing more than half the series. It\'s one of those joyous Comic book strips you\'d receive weekly, and while there was no sense of structured narrative, it still establishes a strong connection with you. Having you wait excitingly for next week\'s fun adventure.While it\'s fair to conclude that Mysterious Girlfriend X is an episodic tale, it would be unfair to undermine the depth the series brings, all the overarching developments and character relations that gives Mysterious Girlfriend X it\'s supremacy over others attempting at doing the same.The elephant in the room is the kinky bonds found in the series, the bond of drool is something most people won\'t be overtly nostalgic about in their youth, let alone in their present state. The series intentionally takes the socially taboo subjects to shun the light on the pairs journey throughout Sexuality, and Love, it\'s beautiful, it\'s alive, calling it weird, or just ""odd"" would be a disservice. The show doesn\'t use these subjects to be quirky or to reel in a strange fanbase, it uses them as plot points, it pushes the story down at a smooth pace, like a raft on a river, just replace the rivers water with saliva!No matter how strange or odd Mysterious girlfriend X seems from an outside perspective (even whilst watching/reading) when the scenes form into unbelievable imagery, this is when Mysterious Girlfriend X Is showing you just how real it is. Our bonds and connections with our loved ones, it may be as strange as drool, or as simple as touch. it\'s been a decade since the first season, and with no sign of a season two, it\'s missing more than half the series.

I\'m still learning.Your average cliché romcom follows the basic formula of your main character being either a shy and introverted person or someone courageous accompanied with an aptitude of maximum determination and perseverance, however either personality trait(s) would constitute to the male protagonist being surrounded by the entire female cast.Nazo no Kanojo X or Mysterious Girlfriend X (MGX) basically disposes all of those tropes and archetypes to the trash can and makes its own principles. Tsubaki Akira, our MC isn\'t the type of person that would be instantly surrounded by...a herd of women, begging for his attention. No, none of that. Instead, we have your average highschool boy that possesses none of the aforementioned qualities. He doesn\'t have any unique abilities and he isn\'t really your type of person that would stand out from the rest. He\'s just a young boy who goes to his day-to-day highschool life.Then, we have our other main character, Mikoto Urabe. Unlike the average love interests of other anime that fall under the category of romcoms especially the ones that are based on the environment of a school. Urabe is quite an odd and eccentric lady, mysterious if you will. Though above that, she doesn\'t really possess any mannerism of that of a woman who is of proper etiquettes and has caught the eyes of the other male casts surrounding her. She\'s not your average tsundere or the submissive type, no. She\'s just your average young girl that is surrounded in a rather innocuous mystery.You might ask to yourself: ""If that\'s the case, then what makes this anime special? And how come did you rate it at such a high score?"" If that\'s the case, I\'m glad you asked.The main storyline of Nazo no Kanojo X is a rather unique one and is presented properly to its viewers. What makes it unique is how the Urabe and Tsubaki share their bond with one another, though it has a rather grotesque method of presenting how they develop their emotions and feelings for one another. The anime is also paced in a slow and steady manner, not having anything to rush anything and taking a mellow approach to new encounters as they progress. However, it isn\'t necessarily slow enough to make you bored and would rather have you begging for more. The series would have you at the edge of your seat after every episode, wanting to uncover the mystery that shrouds our main cast, peeling off each layer one-by-one as the story moves on with its plot discovering more things that would make you more captivated towards the series and would overall attach you until you\'ve met the end of the road.Tsubaki really deserves a pat on the back sometimes, as we see the story progress, so does he. While other anime already have a perfect mc equipped with magical powers or superhuman abilities, he\'s merely a flawed human who we see develops more as a person and a partner as the story goes on. Learning more from past mistakes and different encounters.On the other side, we have Urabe. Ah, where do I start? It sure is a neat tool to have something that can indicate someone\'s thought or emotions through a medium of some sort that can be used to make understanding another person easier. Though ultimately, this does not represent the actual emotion of a human. It\'s up to the user (specifically Urabe) to decipher one\'s thought or to reiterate that feeling (specifically Tsubaki\'s). With that in mind, the anime represents their ""bond"" in an aberrate manner. Urabe reflects upon Tsubaki\'s emotions and tries to get a comprehensive grasp as to why he does things as the way he does. This bridges the gap between the two having them develop a better relationship in a relatively slow manner, both having good and bad experiences. Though, in spite of having differences from time-to-time, both of them find a way to settle it in a matured manner where they could both reach to an understanding. Setting aside their arguments and continuing their days peacefully. In which, would eventually make them learn more about each other and themselves. Developing into an acquaint relationship.Moving on, we have its ""Sound"" aspect. If there\'s one thing not to dismiss about this series, it would be the music and composition. It is absolutely SUBLIME. The opening theme and the ending theme both possess a rather melancholic tune that is really memorable and iconic. One OST in particular would be the ""Dream Theme"" or OST 4 of 12. Which is perfectly accompanied by a mystique and unfamiliar environment, shrouded in a bewitching guise.Some of you may also notice that the anime has an ""ecchi"" tag. HOWEVER. Do not let this stop you from having to watch it. I know that at most times ecchi anime can have a rather bitter aftertaste in your mouth after having to sit through an unrealistic harem of women possessing ludicrously large breasts that are greater in size than of their cerebrum and your MC incessantly indulging in all of the frivolities. Yeah, Tsubaki MAY get a tad bit aroused at times however MGX\'s ecchi scenes are relegated to a scale that does not take it to the extremities. Nothing really too explicit, though in the end, is still ecchi.To sum things up:MGX is a story that follows Tsubaki and Urabe as they live their mundane highschool life and maintaining their relationship in a reasonably slow pace, having to learn and understand one another piece by piece in a unique and original presentation. With a cast that actually seem like real people and not some one dimensional character.OVERALL ENJOYMENT: 9/10I recommend reading the manga if the anime ever left you seeking for more from the series. a herd of women, begging for his attention.

This anime rightfully earned its place as my #1 favourite anime. I remember finding it in the most unique way, I was just aimlessly searching the web on my phone when a title caught my eye, something along the lines of girls who fight using unique weapons. The website had Urabe listed under scissors of course which at the time I found quite perplexing so I decided to check out the anime. After watching the first episode I thought it was a...tiny bit weird but still decided to continue watching (best decision ever) this anime was a joy to watch and the manga itself was even better. If I could re-live the experience of watching this anime for the first time again I would. Overall 10/10 masterpiece tiny bit weird but still decided to continue watching (best decision ever) this anime was a joy to watch and the manga itself was even better. If I could re-live the experience of watching this anime for the first time again I would. Overall 10/10 masterpiece', ""Mysterious girlfriend, what can I say? I don't think it's for everyone, as the show often contains not very appropiated interactions. If your'e fine with them though, you're gonna have quite the wild ride. Saliva, wet dreams, and much more things revolving the mysterious girlfriend. Watching it alone is an experience, buf if you watch with with your boyfriend/girlfirend I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselves plenty. Of course, if they're into the same anime you're into. No matter how far they go with the ecchi, ti's a very cute show overall.  I'm surprised they pull up the writing and concept pretty well, since it often...fails when they only focus on the ecchi (Just kidding, that's mainly only because of harem elements). So, if you're looking for a show with only a bit of cliches but good character interactions and interesting situations. This show is for you. Overall? I want a mysterious girlfriend, and maybe you will too. fails when they only focus on the ecchi (Just kidding, that's mainly only because of harem elements).

I watched through the anime, thinking some divine revelation would come, as to why people react to saliva swapping for nothing.   As much of it tried to hint with visual clues mermaid, alien. it gave no real answer, and I feel I wasted my time with this whole anime.All you know is somehow is emotional bonds via drool, as of course, is the thing everyone does, swap drool/saliva with each other, without being disgusted, or worrying what or who they had in their mouth.We add on to that when we see...Akira screw up, with no real punishment.   With the insecurities around young people especially, this just felt unrealistic whether when he pounces on her at the apartment or meeting the girl he was in love with.Then we finish with a relationship pretty much based on saliva swapping, they don't do anything together really, and nor have been in a relationship previously, they don't even eat lunch together, as his best friend's girlfriend has some sort of emotional girl crush on her.   It just felt too slow, too unrealistic, and were no mysteries around Urabe given, and as we see in the OVA, the hint with fox yokai and tear tasting or her Edo period kimono, is known something isn't normal.So to me what could be a great romance, with depth, wasn't really, was more like fetish saliva swapping kink. with no known reason for the impossible emotional reaction.   It just felt trashy, it turned what could be an interesting story to me into nonsenseThe arts are not the greatest, it gives an 18+ warning, but I have seen more in animes without them, the sound is mediocre, and most of the depth is on Akira, where Urabe's so mysterious or short for failed to really develop the character's background.

Once you get past the weird, the anime is really damn boring. Both the lead characters have the charisma and libido of rocks.  Tsubaki is the kind of guy that won\'t do anything with his gir unless he gets her signature in triplicate and notorized. Urabe might as well be a Vulcan with some odd kinks, and the need to dispense boring platitudes. Together they add up to not much at all.In way of contrast the supporting characters aren\'t all that interesting, but they...really do show just how bad the main characters are. Oka, Ueno and Hayakawa  are all just better than the leads. They are all one dimensional as well but at least it\'s interesting dimensions and relatable. Hayakawa and Oka were actually fun to watch as they were going about their plans, it would have improved the story incredibly to have them driving it more instead of the placeholder of a relationship that was Tsubaki and UrabeIf there were an actual story it might have been able to save this, but there isn\'t.  Mysterious Girlfriend goes from nowhere to no place at a really slow rate When what little that does happen, finally happens there\'s no reason to care.The only connection between the characters is the drool.TL:DR Decent presentation for a boring story. really do show just how bad the main characters are.

I am convinced, it\'s just an excuse to potray spit fetish. It\'s totally fine if you like it, i just think the story seems more like a Hentai plot rather than an ecchi anime one.Riichi\'s other works and why this one get too much credit:As said before most of Riichi\'s work have some sort of fetish included in it, acting like this one is any different from the others would be wrong. In one manga Ookumo-chan it\'s about Minoru getting flashbacks from his mom...as a high school student, not going in too much detail but yes it is a mom complex manga. You could argue there is a reason for it but in the end there is a fetish included as a mayor part of the plot just like this one. I believe he made a manga about girls turning into robots (Yume Tsukai) just don\'t read it tbh.Therefore saying this is an outstanding plot is just not correct, he has made so many similiar fetish ""based"" works before this one and even though the plot can be interesting in itself it\'s rooted in a fetish. To me it just sounds like that one ""hentai"" you watched and then remember how weird it was. Worse of all is that some of his works would actually have great potential if he did make the story some sort of fetish work.Unlikable MC for me at least. Tsubaki looks are average all though i understand the ""relatable and easy to put yourself in"" MC idea. It often disappoint me and is extremely overused at this point. As i said i understand the context of the plain male MC, it just often fail to deliever for me. It make them seem kind of boring and have a personality of a microwave. They all have the same exact personality, which i think is strange based on the fact that the ""plain"" or ""average"" guy is different in all ages and in all cultures. Sometimes this trope works out perfectly this just isn\'t the case.People seem to forget that this guy went overline and then played the ""victim card"" when he got consequences being that after he went over Urabe comfortzone and didn\'t feel like having contact with him. We were suppose to feel bad for him and him feeling bad but in reailty he should feel bad he did something wrong? I don\'t feel bad for him at all. I have no more thoughts to add.Thanks for reading,have a good day/night/morning! as a high school student, not going in too much detail but yes it is a mom complex manga.

Worse of all is that some of his works would actually have great potential if he did make the story some sort of fetish work.Unlikable MC for me at least. Tsubaki looks are average all though i understand the ""relatable and easy to put yourself in"" MC idea. It often disappoint me and is extremely overused at this point. As i said i understand the context of the plain male MC, it just often fail to deliever for me. It make them seem kind of boring and have a personality of a microwave. They all have the same exact personality, which i think is strange based on the fact that the ""plain"" or ""average"" guy is different in all ages and in all cultures. Sometimes this trope works out perfectly this just isn\'t the case.People seem to forget that this guy went overline and then played the ""victim card"" when he got consequences being that after he went over Urabe comfortzone and didn\'t feel like having contact with him. We were suppose to feel bad for him and him feeling bad but in reailty he should feel bad he did something wrong? I don\'t feel bad for him at all. I have no more thoughts to add.Thanks for reading,have a good day/night/morning!', ""it has a nice story,the end disappointed me a little,but i'm sure they left it that way to make part 2 "", 'Enjoyable anime, although its really weird but that\'s one of the factors that makes this anime interesting. When i first started watching it, i was like 0.o ""Ok..."" because of the weird turn of events, but it gets soo interesting you wanna keep on watching. ', 'Here\'s what I think precipitated the premise of the manga/anime:After a long night at the bar slamming drinks, the manga artist starts thinking about sex like any red-blooded Japanese guy would. ""Hey,"" he says to his inebriated buddy as they stagger to the train station, ""kissing is pretty disgusting when you think about it, isn\'t it? I mean, you\'re licking someone else\'s saliva, and come to think of it, you use your fingers when--"" ""Hey,"" his buddy interrupts with a slight slur in his words, ""don\'t you think it\'d be cool if school girls carried some kind of weapon in their panties? I mean, it\'s...not like those uniforms have pockets."" ""What kind of weapon?"" ""I dunno, a pair of scissors? You know how they say, never run with scissors."" (Disclaimer: These are 2 fictitious drunk men in my imagination. And I imagine most guys have no idea whether sailor-suit dresses have pockets or not.)Yes, I firmly believe that some form of intoxication, or a really crazy dream, would need to be involved to come up with premises as crazy and hilarious as these. Obliquely, this show\'s about a guy who learns how to behave around girls in a time before cell phones were ubiquitous, it\'s just the methods chosen are, shall we say, unusual.As far as the story is concerned, well, it\'s probably best not to take it seriously. Personally I found the ""relationship Calvinball"" aspect of it funny, but if bodily fluids is not your thing, well, at least you have something in common with at least 1 US president and 1 German chancellor (it\'s not much of a compliment)-- this is one show that might make the squeamish run away screaming. If the character of Mikoto doesn\'t appeal to you, find another show, stat. Without her, the show is excruciatingly dull, and Akira most of all, because he, like fans of the show/manga, are wondering just WTF is up with Mikoto. Other than her 2 quirks, she is written as an assertive, yet reserved, young woman, defensive of her boundaries and yet very much a high school girl with the insecurities and fears that entails. I\'m not as keen on the rival girls-- one just wants Akira because she wants to take him away from Mikoto, and the other just wants to mess with him. Not a whole lot of depth until the closing episodes.Visually, the production reproduces the manga\'s general character design. Some of the dream sequences are very well done-- the symbolism and imagery are some of the best in anime outside of Miyazaki films and Shaft productions. There was a ""sunset"" scene that overdid the color grading in the broadcast (I don\'t remember if it was toned down in the disc release)-- it looked like the Sun was in red giant phase. Otherwise the sunsets (a recurring visual theme) are rendered well, flooding background and characters with orange light. It\'ll look a bit intense if you watch at night and use a color temperature altering app like f.lux.The soundtrack is a bit like a Tim Burton film (Edward Scissorhands?), at times accompanying the animation with a waltz, at times a simple march with a string orchestra + piano in the style of Prokofiev, or atmospheric riffs reminiscent of radio drama; while simply arranged, the music was a great background to the show. Edit: Oh, right, the drum solo during Mikoto Scissorhands scenes. That was hilarious.The opening theme is one of my favorite anime songs, this one reminiscent of mid-1990s anime songs, and the accompanying animation completes a catchy music video. Not as keen on the ending theme, but at least the stills of the girls in the show drooling while sleeping is funny. Well, to me at least.This romcom had me laughing pretty hard, and I found the pairing of Mikoto and Akira adorable.

I lowered my overall rating for this show because I felt that there was so much more that could have been done to elaborate and continue the story. But in the end it was a wonderful portrail of relationships and the idealistic thought prossesses of both genders. I would recommend this but be prepared for some moments where you feel like WTF?? well that was weird.. as well as a feeling of wanting more out...of the characters and plot. of the characters and plot.', 'This Anime is by far one of the few who have me talking to myself. For example.""No don\'t do it!"" That kind of example. It had a great ending, I recommend everyone who like those moments of suspense to watch this anime. It was organized perfectly. I wish most animes\' end like this piece of artwork did. ', ""Warning if you can't get past weird stuff like drool and people wanting to taste it then this show might not be for you. But for the uninitiated mysterious girlfriend x is about a girl named mikoto who moves to a new school who is quite mysterious and starts having a relationship with our young protagonist Akira, with a slight twist he likes to taste her drool and not through the kissing way through a finger in the mouth way.. I know kinda weird but stay with me.The show has symbolic and metaphorical messaging all throughout this anime and it makes you wonder in the...beginning anyways if they are just swapping spit or if this is a meaning for making out and just flat out sex at times. Which i feel keeps you interested enough and isn't just an average slice of life romance show.The show is very character driven and succeeds in some regards. Akira is our main character and he is honestly a generic main character which could be replaced with another generic male lead and the story would be the exact same now this isn't all bad because this show is about adolescents growing up and the weird spit swapping is telling us these kids don't really understand how relationships work like at all. And seeing akiras dreams which can somewhat be seen as wet dreams or him trying to get over his jealousy or guilt or heartache.Which brings us to mikoto the main girl love interest to mikoto who is very mysterious and makes you believe she has all the answers to relationships but she's just as clueless as akira. The first 3 episodes kind of make you feel like she could be a alien and maybe that's cause she had a little toy UFO or that she spits up 20 gallons of spit if she gets excited… like wtf. She's very shy and basically the way she conveys her emotions is through giving people her spit which in turn lets them feel what she is feeling at that time. Again it's very weird but on a level it works for this show all the way through and adds to her opening up towards the end of the show. And i just dont mean those pantie scissors. I felt as if there was another reason why she wasn't open with people but it was never really addressed. Her not opening up and the show show not wanting to move forward with their relationship at times makes the pacing kind of slow and hard to get through at times when in turn it also a somewhat episodic show.The show really tries to focus just on the main 2 characters which in turn leads to a bad supporting cast. The best of the supporting cast is okay who is mikoto's best friend and helps her with her relationships and when i say help i really mean mess it up half time which in turn has her keeping the episodes more lively and interesting at times. Also through the metaphor of spit it's unclear if her and mikoto had lesbian experiences together or not. Akiras best friend is pretty generic and doesn't add much to the plot and the sister of akira also is just a generic sister.Music is really repetitive but isnt bad its just kind of generic and unforgettable and the art and animation are good but nothing special honestly. I also watched this show in English and the 2 main characters were done pretty well while the rest of the cast varies from annoying to ok to flat out garbage.The score i would give this anime is a 6.5though most of the show is a generic romance What i think stands out is that you can look at the spit swapping as a straightforward kind of thing or you can look deeper and see what this show is trying to imply like mikoto and okas lesbian experiences or mikoto taking off her clothes and giving her “spit” to akira if you get what i mean. And this sometimes gets in the way of character development and just uses characters as a conduit to advance the themes of the show. But leads to a pretty good ending for the show.If you're looking for recommendations of shows like this then check out B gata H kei it has ecchi stuff and has a pretty funny plot about a girl who want to have sex a lot.

It\'s almost trying to advertise itself beginning by a challenge : ""Will you be able to get past what we\'re showing you to get what we want to tell ?""Technically speaking, the saliva bits aren\'t all that gross. For the thing called a ""french kiss"" by some people is exactly that : a saliva exchange. Well, ok, granted ... we don\'t (usually) use our fingers as an intermediate device for the exchange (since the previously mentionned kiss is a more efficient and direct approach).But still, don\'t sell yourself short. You can get used to it, you can get...past that. And there lies a somewhat strange and beautiful anime, with some very nice scenes... Some that can wreck your heart onto a wall very slowly (you were thinking full speed right ? think again), or others, soothing, calming episodes full of truths to be told.It\'s not perfect for sure. A perfect anime would have been able to reach this point without relying on the spit trick, but still the saliva exchange is in itself a good way to turn things over, asks questions, and for you to search for answers.As the story goes, it\'s quite simple and not that original. It\'s pratically the weakest point of the whole show (which makes it still a lot better than a lot of others romcom). Art and sound seems just fair enough, but considering the way it emphasizes certain things, some will found these quite good (and I\'m pretty sure I can\'t prove them wrong). But in my opinion, one of the best aspect of this anime comes from the characters. Their behavior is somewhat estranged, yet close, to someone you know. And not all their actions are carefully explained to you. This will give you something to think about, and I\'ve found myself pausing the anime numerous times wondering myself ""but why the hell is she/he acting this way ?!!""Actually, this anime is all about YOU. I will not try to explain this, but I would share that : whether you give a damn about it or adversely decide to drop it immediately can already tell a lot about you, these two choices bearing an equal amount of interesting things about you ... past that.

However, I say go for it, because personally I thought it was a masterpiece and I will tell you why.Let's start with the Story:10/10There is not really much to say about the story that the synopsis on this website hasn't already given you, so I will talk about the elements: This is...an incredibly original romance genre anime. The main plot that revolved around Akira Tsubaki tasting the drool of a the new female transfer student Mikoto Urabe is absolutely fascinating and at first a little weird. But that is the beauty of the story in itself, it's almost like a symbolic act that represents how awkward your first relationship can be. I have seen some strange anime before, but the story is so strange that it makes you want to watch more and more as you follow a very well written story about two people who really don't know much about how to convey their feelings, and in the most creative original way find a way to reach each other on almost a supernatural level.Art:10Why do I give the art a 10/10? For me, the hand drawn backgrounds was phenomenal, something I have not felt since watching Serial Experiments Lain for the first time. The beautiful sunset pieces in this anime were incredibly and really sets the mood. Also a quick little weird thing I noticed: The sun is progressively higher in the sky during the evening as the story progresses and the characters relationships develop, which I thought was such a nice fit to complement the story and the characters as well as the art. The characters were well drawn and their hair was exceptionally well detailed, and the fact that this anime was made in 2012, it gives us a surprisingly refreshing 1990's feel to it which was great. The art added to the mystery of the characters as well as the beautiful scenery. I was taken away by this kind of scenery to tell you the truth.Sound:10It's very hard for an anime to get a 10 in sound to tell you the truth. The OST for this anime is actually incredible. It is very light and heavy on the piano. The music definitely works well and matches with the mood of the characters and the situation. In a way I can say that the art kind of amplifies how good the music is too. In terms of the animation sounds, I'd say they were perfectly done and not dragged out or over-used in any way. The sound was crisp and very pleasant on the ears.Character:10This is the sweetest element of Nazo no Kanojo X. Urabe and Tsubaki are both very likable characters from the start and even with this short 13 episodes series, you get quite a lot of character development out of them and even the supporting characters get some well deserved development, but not a lot where it overshadows the main characters. Tsubaki isn't a scared high school kid, but rather just as nervous and awkward as all of us were in High school. You will find enjoyment out of Tsubaki wondering about what it is to be in a relationship, and it's refreshing that as close as Urabe and Tsubaki are, they are opposites when it comes to relationships. Tsubaki wonders about what being in a relationship means and what should they do to be a normal couple. Tsuabki's goals reflect a more rational and normal relationship which differ's greatly from Urabe. Mikoto Urabe is a fairly shy but mysterious girl. Although she is proficient in sports such as running and swimming, she mostly keeps to her self and enjoys passing out on her desk most of the time without really desiring to have friends. Mikoto is freakishly accurate when it comes to cutting things with scissors which really adds to this mysterious way about her. However, the most mysterious thing about Urabe? Her perception of a relationship. Urabe wants everything that is not common about a relationship, she is spontaneous and not very good at voicing her emotions in the beginning, but she shines as a character that when she does voice her emotions, it sticks with you as the viewer and you find yourself waiting to see in what way she develops next. Tsuabki and Urabe as a couple are made for each other. In a strange way it seems like in the beginning they both have different ideas about what it is to be in a relationship, but as the story progresses, their relationship becomes one idea, rather than two. The characters are both crazy about each other and the show does a very good job at making a heartwarming story with a strange plot.Enjoyment:10I watched all 13 episodes in a single sitting, and I have not binged an anime in a while but this one got me. I was dying to see what happens in the next episode and even after the show was done, I watched it a second time because it was just that good to me. The show is more on the serious level but there are definitely more than a few laughs that I had while watching the show and they were placed very well to set the scene and the mood.Overall:10I loved every second of this show.  I loved the art, the sound, the characters and the story. I highly recommend this show to people who want to try something different out and watch a very original romance piece. In my opinion, it is my favorite anime of all time. Do not let the plot mislead you, don't throw this show away after the first episode because it definitely gets better and I think you will be amazed at how much you wish there were more than 13 episodes after its all over.Thank you very much for taking the time to read my first review. I apologize that it was fairly long, but I loved the show so much I thought I would throw in all the general ideas I could without spoiling anything. I want this show to be just as mysterious to you as Urabe is to Tsubaki an incredibly original romance genre anime.

It instantly blew me away.Mind it, romance is something I'll watch regardless of good nor bad, but Mysterious Girlfriend X is different. It's unique in so many way. Tsubaki (Male MC) isn't a Gary Stu and actually has a really good personality that's interesting. Urabe (Female MC) isn't a JAne Doe and she might be the most unique character I've seen in quite some time. It's just smething kinda uncommon these days.One of my favorite things was Character design. Urabe is one of my favorite designs for a...character of all time. I love how she's portrayed and love the weird girl persoanlity to compliment how she looks. I also think most of the female designs in this anime were top tier as well. They all looked unique in there own way, and they all were pleasing to the eye.I'll admit, the series is weird to someone watching it first, but it gets so much more in depth and enjoyable after a few episodes, mainly because you understand why stuff happens in a sense. the bond between Tsubaki  and Urabe is between Drool. That's weird, but it's unique and done correctly. They're not making it disgusting or overdoing it. It's a fine balance of everything right.Honestly loved this anime to death. It's easily in my top 5 of all time. I'll probably re-watch it a bit after this review LOL. I'm kinda disheartened that there never was a season 2 though. There was a manga (which is what the anime is obviously based off of) that ran for like 10 years and ended in 2014, but I hear it was really a dissatisfactory ending, so I'm personally not going to read the manga because I'd like to keep the series in high esteem to myself. Sadly, if you want more Mysterious Girlfriend X, FanFiction might be the only thing you have.Either way, amazing anime. I give it a 10 honestly. This anime is almost one of a kind. Must watch if you love romance. character of all time. I love how she's portrayed and love the weird girl persoanlity to compliment how she looks. I also think most of the female designs in this anime were top tier as well. They all looked unique in there own way, and they all were pleasing to the eye.I'll admit, the series is weird to someone watching it first, but it gets so much more in depth and enjoyable after a few episodes, mainly because you understand why stuff happens in a sense. the bond between Tsubaki  and Urabe is between Drool. That's weird, but it's unique and done correctly. They're not making it disgusting or overdoing it. It's a fine balance of everything right.Honestly loved this anime to death. It's easily in my top 5 of all time. I'll probably re-watch it a bit after this review LOL. I'm kinda disheartened that there never was a season 2 though. There was a manga (which is what the anime is obviously based off of) that ran for like 10 years and ended in 2014, but I hear it was really a dissatisfactory ending, so I'm personally not going to read the manga because I'd like to keep the series in high esteem to myself. Sadly, if you want more Mysterious Girlfriend X, FanFiction might be the only thing you have.Either way, amazing anime. I give it a 10 honestly. This anime is almost one of a kind. Must watch if you love romance."", 'Name of anime: Mysterious Girlfriend XGenre: Romance, Comedy, EcchiNumber of episodes: 13Review: Before you say anything else, I’m gonna warn you guys. If you think that you are a hardcore anime lover and won’t stop watching an anime until you finish it, THEN ONLY watch this anime. If you survive for the first three episodes, then this anime is sure to leave a big impact on your heart. The only problem is that….. It’s gross. Yup, you heard it right, this anime’s one scene is pretty gross, but surprisingly, after a few episodes, that scene becomes perfectly normal, interesting isn’t it? The story focuses on...Tsubaki and a girl named Urabe. Urabe is a transfer student, who gets tagged as a weirdo on the very first day due to her unusual attitude of sleeping in the class and being a loner. One day, Tsubaki wakes Urabe up when everyone has already gone home and tells her to go too. When she went home, Tsubaki sucked (Be careful here) Urabe’s drool which was left on the desk (Ewwwwwwww!) After that incident, somehow, his condition started deteorating. Lastly, Urabe said that he has became so attached to that drool that now if he doesn’t tastes it, then his body will start becoming sick. From that day, Tsubaki started tasting her drool every day, and somehow, he becomes the boyfriend of Urabe. This anime is something special. I just can’t understand that what is so special about it that it has left such a deep impact over me. So, you guys watch this anime, if you too feel the same connection then tell me why you liked it.Weakness: These weaknesses have made this anime weak to gain the first spot. But if a second season is created, then this anime is pretty sure to gain the first spot and overthrow Toradora from my list.1) The drool exchange, even though is a pretty important part of the anime, is pretty gross. As a result, many anime viewers stop watching it thinking it to be one of those, Ewww, anime.2) It was not clearified why they can sense each other’s feeling just by tasting the drools. That’s actually a big question.3) Is the girl an alien? I dunno, but everytime I saw her behavior and that drool thing made me believe that she is an alien. What’s more? She even has an UFO shaped key chain. I’m pretty sure that she is. Well, we will see that if a new season is created.Rating: With so many faults, without any kissing or hugging scene and having a big doubt of a second season, this anime was sure to be at the bottom of my list. But magically, it stands as the second best anime of my choice. I give it 8 out of 10. Still can’t understand why. Tsubaki and a girl named Urabe.

The problem I had was the character built in the anime was quite different from the manga. Tsubaki was fine, but Mikoto especially in the beginning was a lot more expression-able. This is a major plot point in the manga that she was hard to read the entire time, and her smile was a rarity. This was something I definitely missed in the anime. However on a brighter note I was expecting the art to be severely diminished in the anime (specifically dreams), but I was...definitely not disappointed, in fact I was delighted, the scenes I loved in the manga were I would say even better in the anime. All in all a definite must watch for all the weirdos out there. definitely not disappointed, in fact I was delighted, the scenes I loved in the manga were I would say even better in the anime. All in all a definite must watch for all the weirdos out there.', ""[Spoiler Alert]Nazo no Kanojo X (2012)I can honestly say so far on my journey thus far I have not stumbled across a romance that used drool and let alone in the way it does. Especially since it seems to be a bit more mysterious in its use than the show ever explains. I do like that about the show as it keeps you going. It does have a few moments especially towards the end I felt a bit uneasy. The uneasiness was more aimed towards the actions of Akira and how they were dealt with. It does have a happy ending that is great to...see. I did read on a bit to know it goes as you would hope at least in the immediate.The art of the show is alright. It has not aged as well as many shows of the same age or older. Some shows are much worse so I would say it is about average. Even when it was on live broadcast it would have felt equally not quite touched up. That said it does a great job of portrayal throughout. The one thing that was a bit hard to see was the drool, mainly the colour made it a bit off-putting.The OP and ED are both nice, especially with the art. The sounds are generally really nicely done and the voice actors did a great job.Character does develop throughout and we get the main couple and a secondary with interaction from supporting characters in developing the main couple. You see the characters grow but also go through some questionable actions.Akira during episode 10 effectively is enticed to cheat to which he does actually do by going out with another girl even as a pretend boyfriend. If he had consulted his girlfriend and not hidden it then it wouldn't have been so bad. It is the fact he hid it and also he had remorse before anything happened. Ep 11 then dealt with the situation but not in a great way. It turned into a competition and was laughed off as he is 'such a guy'. It was disappointing to see as kind of runs a bad vibe.Hayakawa in episode 10 gives a bad feeling off, when you actually get to know her a bit more you do see she is surprisingly lonely. Considering she is attractive it was a surprise to hear her time was hard with relationships. I would also say her and Akira are so alike it was amazing they never got together in the first place.Ep12 gives us a great girl randomly out of nowhere and just as quickly Suwano is gone again.Ep13 I honestly thought the anime was going to change suddenly and abruptly with that starting situation with the sister.The dream world that both Akira and Mikoto delve into is amazing.I would say the show is great overall but has a few areas that let it down.

But I'll say that it peaked my curiosity enough to watch it all the way through. "", ""OBLIGATORY SPOILER WARNING-So before I say anything else I just want to point out the hook of this show. Drool. Yes, lots and lots of drool. Let's everybody eat each others drool and have dreams and nose bleeds and experience each others emotions through drool.-The hook of this show is quite strange which is why I kept watching it since I am typically not a big fan of slice of life animes and for the most part it did not disappoint. The idea of using drool to convey plot points and characters emotions may seem strange but it works well in the framework of the...show. If you wanted to you could even say it symbolizes being intimate with another human being, kissing, etc. If you are a person who simply hates drool well then you will probably end up grossed out by the end of the first episode since it is a constant theme.-I enjoyed the fact that we got to see the two main characters develop into more mature human beings throughout the show and I genuinely cared about the characters.  My main problem is that the show isn't long enough. I would have loved to have seen how the characters would have reacted to being intimate for the first time, going on more dates, graduating, etc.-The music does its part fine but there really aren't any memorable tunes from the show in my opinion.-For whatever reason this show is classified as an ecchi....which I simply do not understand since while there is a beach bikini episode and drool eating the fan service is by no means any worse than 90% of most other popular animes these days and if you are turned off to the idea of watching it because it is classified as such I would suggest ignoring that label and giving it a chance anyway (it is by no means graphic).-Overall I feel like it is worth a watch if you are into watching a couple overcome real problems, particularly those experienced by high schoolers and adolescences when they first start dating. I know that I personally could relate to the characters in several of their situations based off of my own life and I feel like that makes a slice of life show far more enjoyable when you can actually relate to at least one of the characters. show.

So I'm not the type of person that usually takes the time out of the day to make a review about a show but this anime changed that. As a couple of people that have written reviews have stated, this anime is about as real as they come aside from the drool, which I honestly didn't find disturbing. I actually enjoyed the abnormality. People If you want to see a real relationship please watch this. The only thing that threw me for a loop was the fact that they... well I suppose i cant really tell you. Guess you'll have to watch for yourselves. "", 'So the plot device, the exchanging of drool, is actually somewhat interesting of a mechanism. Although initially a moment of explorative perversion from a growing boy, it becomes something of a persistent medium for the characters to communicate their emotions when words fail them. The ability itself is really played down so it never becomes something overtly magical, it\'s never really explained how this happens and it\'s probably best this way as pinning it down would force the story away from a more non-fantasy based foundation. The consistent casual depiction of it makes it feel almost natural so it never really feels cognitively bothersome. The...characters confess that it\'s weird and strange, but it never really goes beyond this and is somehow just casually accepted rather than settled.The narrative is a quintessential boy meets girl story with a kink for a twist. It\'s cute because they\'re both first lovers and it\'s quite nostalgic in terms of how it reminds one of the anxieties involved with everything that comes with that. Particularly from the male perspective. There\'s nothing that really sets this story apart, kink not with standing, besides how well paced it is and consolidated the characters are. There\'s no real tropes involved here which is very refreshing, it\'s a classic, homely \'slice of life\' that\'s just an overall pleasure to watch for the honest characters alone. There\'s no real ""ecchi"" beyond the drool, yes there are some panty shots, but they\'re not glorified; the service is in watching the main characters develop their relationship in real terms and not set piece tropes (like walking in on a girl naked, or the guy falling on the girl and accidentally groping a boob or two, etc).The art style is quaint. There\'s not a huge focus on the stylisation for the eyes or hair which makes it feel a little older than the show actually is, but it\'s not too much of a turn off. In fact the animation is so well rounded, the animated faces more than make up for the lack of aesthetic we otherwise usually see these days.The sound is nothing to write home about and at times the lack of background sound/music makes the show feel a little empty, but the voice acting is actually really good (sub) and incredibly natural. It actually feels like people having real conversations and not people reading off a script.I think the majority of the enjoyment here was nostalgia in respects to how it felt having ones first girlfriend in our school days, and also being a little bit weird and confused in our sexual expression. Along with how believable/relatable the characters were and acted. Besides the overt plot hole regarding how the girl, Urabe could possibly know Tsubaki was ""love sick"" as a result of the drool, despite having no experience in these things. The show runs pretty smoothly from start to finish and this should explain my high marks for something that would otherwise be a remarkably average show. characters confess that it\'s weird and strange, but it never really goes beyond this and is somehow just casually accepted rather than settled.The narrative is a quintessential boy meets girl story with a kink for a twist.

Its soundtrack, characters, art and the story are something new to discover in this masterpiece of anime. Especially the soundtracks. I love the soundtracks so much.

Urabe is a character that I want to know more about. She's intriguing and I like her.The show starts off pretty strongly and sets up a lot of questions that we'll hopefully get the answers to... but we don't. Nothing really happens through the show, apart from some very light character development.The draw of the show is unraveling the mysteries of Urabe and seeing how the two main characters will eventually reach her predicted future.That's what they set up at the beginning, and we get some of that through the show, but there's...really very little that we get by the end of it.I wish I could rate this higher because I like the premise, the mood of the show, and Urabe a lot, but it just ends up as wasted potential.

I was immediately stunned by the sheer quality of the animation, strength of the art direction, complexity of the soundtrack, and speed at which I was invested in this unique and passionate love story which captures all the sumptuous and tender awkwardness of love at that age. This anime could have ranked at an easy 8 or perhaps even 9 out of 10, if it weren't for one particularly challenging and ubiquitous hurdle; The fact that this entire anime, from start to finish, is a thinly veiled vehicle for someone's spit fetish. At one moment the show...will be exploring the complexities of interpersonal vulnerability in the context of a relationship, then they'll snap to someone vividly slurping saliva off a finger, or spit literally bursting from their mouth. The quality of everything else is undeniable, but the spit thing just takes the wind out of its sails at every opportunity, and robs it of the quality it could have achieved. I might have even forgiven that if it had any restraint, but this anime gets in the way of its own story to pursue drool-themed fetish scenarios that feel like they've been shoehorned-in, even for an anime upon which that peculiar oral preoccupation is the very crux of the plot. What's most infuriating above all here is that this was a simple fix. Instead of having the magic telepathy spit be transferred via finger or scooped off desks, just have it be transferred by kissing! But no, this otherwise excellent anime had to go with the strangest option possible, and then proceed to trip over itself and ruin the pacing in order to make more room for spitty fanservice. I could go on forever, but it's about time to get down to specifics. The story is, as I said earlier, unique and compelling from the opening moments of episode 1. The arc of the story has you on the very edge of your seat, watching with bated breath as the relationship between the two main characters grows and develops, incorporating side characters and folding them into the story with seamless skill, imbuing them with essential functions within the story which result in the full realization of their characters. Even the drama, from the smallest misunderstandings to the most mischievous of plots, draws in the viewer with no effort at all. But of course, all of this is broken up and interrupted by saliva fetishism, which itself is accompanied by the breakdown of story structure, characterization, and common sense. These scenes aren't just strange, they're bad, and feel as though they come from an entirely different anime, as no pacing or writing skill makes its way to them, which is an unforgivable flaw, as these scenes easily make up at least a quarter of the total runtime. I count this as a personal loss. The art was incredible from start to finish, seemingly blending the crisp fluidity of modern anime with the warm and detailed aesthetic of 90s anime, resulting in something that I would even wager to call some of the best art and animation in a TV anime from its time. Its appeal, especially to me personally, is off the charts, and will be a standard to which I hold other shows in terms of animation, character design, and aesthetic drive. Even the spit scenes, of which I have already made clear I do not care for, are animated with the finest skill and down to the most minute physical detail. The sound is similarly excellent, ranging from soaring orchestral scores to lithe and mystical tunes that carry you along the threads of tension and fate weaved by the story it accompanies. The characters are also quite good, and while not as perfect as the art and sound, regardless stand their ground as very solid subjects for the story to focus on, and they manage this by maintaining believable and interesting motivations throughout. It's hard to choose favorites, but the three main characters Urabe, Tsubaki, and Oka are probably the best. Overall, I am upset. This is by all accounts a great anime, but it ruins itself. It's like having a friend or relative that is an excellent pianist, and it is a joy to hear them play, but they have no sense of decorum, and bring up their favorite fetish at every opportunity, sometimes mid-performance. You try to ignore it, as they really are talented, after all it's just one thing that's wrong and it could be worse, but when you realize this is just a part of who they are you resign yourself to the fact your friends can never hear them play, and if you talk about them in public you have to reference them obliquely, omitting that major and persistent flaw. Give it a shot if you can overlook this for the other aspects of the show, or if you're just into that kind of thing. will be exploring the complexities of interpersonal vulnerability in the context of a relationship, then they'll snap to someone vividly slurping saliva off a finger, or spit literally bursting from their mouth.

It's hard to choose favorites, but the three main characters Urabe, Tsubaki, and Oka are probably the best. Overall, I am upset. This is by all accounts a great anime, but it ruins itself. It's like having a friend or relative that is an excellent pianist, and it is a joy to hear them play, but they have no sense of decorum, and bring up their favorite fetish at every opportunity, sometimes mid-performance. You try to ignore it, as they really are talented, after all it's just one thing that's wrong and it could be worse, but when you realize this is just a part of who they are you resign yourself to the fact your friends can never hear them play, and if you talk about them in public you have to reference them obliquely, omitting that major and persistent flaw. Give it a shot if you can overlook this for the other aspects of the show, or if you're just into that kind of thing."", 'I am going to keep this review short for those who really want to give the anime a try. If you cannot cope with a little bit of disgusting, weird or even ecchi stuff, please don\'t watch the anime as you will only find it suffering to watch, especially the drool scene.The anime is romance but with a twist, yes, the drool. To be honest, I think it added a lot of uniqueness to the anime and I personally find it interesting and funny, though some don\'t like it. Overall, The anime is pretty wholesome, with Urabe being quite ""mysterious"", while having a pair of...scissors in her panty and most of the time hiding her true feeling. Welp, that\'s why the anime\'s called ""Mysterious Girlfriend X"".I quite like the bold mc, Tsubaki, who don\'t even bother to hug or say some lovely stuff to his girlfriend, which added a lot of ""sweetness"" to the show. Being a slow paced anime lover, this show do satisfies me. With the suitable amount of events happening, it makes you feel relaxed.Last but no least, I do recommend everyone to watch the anime (if you accept a little bit of ecchiness). Most importantly, not to give up one episode 1 as you will soon find a hidden gem of a romance anime.My overall score is 10, masterpiece since I want to pull up the average score of the anime as I gather it quite underrated. If you ask my true score, it will be about 8.8 scissors in her panty and most of the time hiding her true feeling.

I found a trailer for the series by chance but got a very good feeling and decided to watch it. However, it must be said right from the start: The series has what you could call a fetish for saliva (and the exchange of saliva). If you have a problem with THAT, it can probably be a threshold that makes it difficult to appreciate the series. 😇😅I for one didn\'t have much of a problem with it anyway. I quickly realized that...my gut feeling about this anime was just as right as usual. 😁 The drawing style itself is right up my alley (it doesn\'t really follow the mainstream art style for that era) and then we have the extremely ""original"" story - odd in a good way, I would say.One of the reasons for my praise is that the characters feel really believable and that the characters actually DISCUSS relationship problems and personal boundaries - what\'s okay and not okay in a relationship. Problems are not ""solved"" as easily as they can sometimes be in romantic anime. And in some odd way, the series feels really sensual even though the ""hottest"" thing that happens is that a couple who aren\'t even the main characters kiss each other. And last but not least: there is a lot of humor. And a little element pf fantasy (which revolves around this with the saliva).In conclusion, it was probably - in all its oddness - one of the finest animes about youth love I\'ve seen to date. It had a little bit of everything - AND (apart from the fantasy element about the saliva) everything still felt genuine and very believable. I am SO glad I found this gem of a series. I think more people should give it a chance. ❤️🙂P.S. A special shutout to Ayako Yoshitani who does the voice of the FL in this anime. It\'s out of the ordinary in a very positive way and makes the character extra interesting.❤️ my gut feeling about this anime was just as right as usual. 😁 The drawing style itself is right up my alley (it doesn\'t really follow the mainstream art style for that era) and then we have the extremely ""original"" story - odd in a good way, I would say.One of the reasons for my praise is that the characters feel really believable and that the characters actually DISCUSS relationship problems and personal boundaries - what\'s okay and not okay in a relationship.

I apologize for how I am going to write this because I am to loco (drugged).

So plz correct me if I make any mistakes. And also a warning that there\'s gonna be a tiny bit of spoilers in my reviewAn anime that has the word kanojo in the title, so ofc I instinctively thought that this was going to be some sort of supper ecchi anime that will have no good plot at all but my I still give it a try anyways.So start of from the very beginning. How do I say this...It was bizzare and shockingly unexpected. Like I did not expect the first few...episodes to be something like that. I think I had to put my phone down for about 15 minutes to comprehend what sort of bizzare act that I\'ve witness.To briefly explain, it\'s a boy (Tsubaki) who drinks the drool of a cute short haired girl named Urabe, and basically what happened was he got some sort of love fever and the girl came to his house and transmit her drool via her finger to Tsubakis mouth and he\'s cured from the illness then Urabe explained that it has to do something with drool and love sick sort of thing. And then they became lovers. And I was there like: ""this isn\'t scientifically possible.""And then they did this for the whole entirety of the season to ""exchange one\'s feelings"", and I\'m not gonna spoil any further. But... There are some things that I wanna get let it out of my chest.First being the drool.. I really wanna know what\'s the story and legend behind of this mythical drool power, but they didn\'t really explain the true power and potential of the drool, and it kinda left me confuzzle and perplexed.Second, is how the characters aren\'t that really surprised by this drool power, and they didn\'t even question how this drool power works even once.Overall voice acting, soundtrack, characters are pretty good. It has that old school anime style that looks neat too. If you\'re into bizzare romance anime then I recommend you go and watch this. It really is a bizzare experience and I think you\'re gonna like it (except if you don\'t like drools cause there\'s an excessive amount of drools included in this anime). episodes to be something like that.

We have one about peeping toms of pantsu (Colorful), one about clubbing girls to the head, to the point they pee themselves (Fight Ippatsu! Juuden-Chan), one about necrophilia (Sankarea), and now one about licking other people’s drool. Yes, sounds disgusting as hell but supposed there is an anime for all tastes and these are supposed to cover those reeeeeally particular ones. The problem of course lies in the fact they are soooo...specific at what they are about, they are extremely hard to be enjoyed by anyone who is not into that sort of fetish. And surely, you must have some really sick mind to enjoy licking other people’s spit. YUUUUUCK!Ok, the truth is that there is reasoning behind all this deviance and if you somehow manage to get into its insane mindset you may even appreciate the show for what it’s all about. In this case it is pure sexual frustration to the point you find stimulation with substitutes rather that the actual thing. The rest of the paragraph is psychological mambo jumbo so skip it if you feel bored. When you believe you are incapable to please a woman in bed (something commonplace amongst virgins, people with low esteem, those who are mocked and bullied a lot, or simply all Japanese people, lol) you may end up feeling incapable of being horny at all so you find pleasure in fantasizing you are great in bed with several sex toys. And to help that illusion to work better you need some of her personal belongings that have her scent on them. The most usual fetishes are underwear and shoes but in this particular show it is body fluids, and more specifically saliva. Since intercourse involves the exchange of body fluids, in the mind of the subject licking them is a fine way to fantasize they are doing a deep tongue technique to the owner of those fluids.Now about the actual anime, it starts in a most direct way by telling you the main characters are weird. Nothing unexpected from teenagers (especially Japanese characters) but these definitely have a few more loose screws than most. The lead boy has that low esteem virgins do and the lead girl is a plain psycho, so they end up in a weird relationship where he gets addicted to her drool and she is more than willing to provide him with it because … um, she is weird; the end. The premise is indeed out there and I guess that is what would attract most people to give it a shot. It sure sounds more interesting than some run of the mill ecchi or romance anime, that’s for sure.The above of course counts for the premise of a show and not about the plot. Although the initial hook of ecchis and romances is usually very strong, their fishing lines tend to break up easily after a few episodes, since almost always there isn’t any progress in the initial idea of the story. They lay it out, they promise you great things to come out of it, they excite you to watch further, and then … nothing happens. Typical to ecchis and harems the relationships go nowhere and they sure as hell don’t show sex, something of which was even promised in the end of the first episode. That’s how it is with typical anime, they are so polarized to either hentai where you get non-stop sex scenes or a long winded story of romance where you get nothing but blushing and a few kisses at best. In this case you get neither, since the drool ends up being the substitute for both sex AND kisses. That’s right, sucking up fingers full of saliva is all you get. Supposed because kissing too simple and boring so there is no reason to do it.So basically you will be enjoying this show for as long as the drooling jokes are still funny to you and you are not bothered by the complete lack of actual progress. Because that is the only thing that makes the main couple to feel a little bit different than pretty much any standard romance out there. Furthermore they are constantly trying to present Urabe as a mysterious girl that needs to be studied and see what she thinks of the lead guy. Sometimes she will be acting like an alien, others like a black ops agent, others as crazy, and others as simply a girl with a crush on him. You are never given a clear picture and because of the non-existent development any hints that are offered mean absolutely nothing. They are there to keep you guessing but never really offer anything. As soon as the feeling of deza vu starts to kick in though, you will start to like it progressively less and chances are you will lose interest before you even get to the second half.Of course if you try to find some deeper meanings you might find out how the show’s main focus is not deviance but rather a slow procedure towards understanding one another. Subtle hints about the saliva making you see the thoughts of the other one, or the reasons behind Urabe’s weirdness seem to weight a lot more than waiting for them to kiss. But as I said it is all way too basic and even disgusting for most to bother looking for those deeper meanings. Do you think there will be many who will consider this an unorthodox show around two lovers trying to communicate? They will see saliva, a promise for sex that will never come, otaku baits, and that’s it. The hook of the show ends up overshadowing its attempt to be anything more than sick entertainment. Take for example Kare Kano, a show with much similar themes that doesn’t try to lure you in with deviance. Its appeal was purely artistic and despite its simplicity in plot and eventual degradation in the second half, it is still a far more likable and interesting show to this one.Other than that, the production values have a very retro feeling to them, as if the original manga was made in the 80’s. This seems to fit with the style of the director, since Watanabe Ayumu has only made old style shows, such as Doraemon movies and Space Brothers. The characters are drawn in a simple way and the backgrounds have basic outlay but colored in a way to feel almost elegiac and fitting to the theme of the show. The music themes are following a similar feeling by being soft and nostalgic. It looks nice to look at coming from a minor animation studio such as Gansis. I also liked Urabe’s voice actress; this is her debut work and she sounds really special and fresh compared to the tired rehashes we get from the so called veterans.In all, it is definitely not your average ecchi comedy or school romance but it fails to keep you interested for more than a few episodes, and the whole drool thing can easily turn you off. A distinctive show thanks to its hidden themes but far from great for messing up its priorities. The themes end up being more important than both the characters and the story, thus it is very easy to be bored and drop it midway.And now for some excused scorings.ART SECTION: 6/10General Artwork 1/2 (generic)Character Figures 1/2 (generic)Backgrounds 1/2 (basic)Animation 1/2 (basic)Visual Effects 2/2 (nice colouring to make it look elegiac)SOUND SECTION: 6/10Voice Acting 2/3 (corny but fitting with the feeling of the series)Music Themes 2/4 (typical)Sound Effects 2/3 (ok I guess)STORY SECTION: 3/10Premise 2/2 (interesting)Pacing 0/2 (very loose)Complexity 1/2 (not much)Plausibility 0/2 (none)Conclusion 0/2 (doesn’t exist)CHARACTER SECTION: 4/10Presence 1/2 (generic)Personality 2/2 (rather cheesy but well founded)Backdrop 1/2 (generic and simplistic but it’s there)Development 0/2 (none)Catharsis 0/2 (none)VALUE SECTION: 3/10Historical Value 0/2 (none)Rewatchability 1/3 (low because of too little plot)Memorability 2/4 (the drool thing makes it a bit memorable but otherwise nothing much)ENJOYMENT SECTION: 1/10Art 0/1 (looks typical)Sound 0/2 (sounds typical)Story 1/3 (an interesting premise that heads nowhere)Characters 0/4 (they are typical and don’t develop)VERDICT: 4/10 specific at what they are about, they are extremely hard to be enjoyed by anyone who is not into that sort of fetish.

Along with other basic information. Also this is my first review, and I don't know how to write them at all.]Although the premise of this anime may seem off-putting and repulsive, especially when taking into account that frequent saliva swapping takes place, this anime surprisingly takes these otherwise strange and obnoxious points and turns them into something that can be viewed in a less revolting way.If anything, it makes these respective weird aspects enjoyable and entertaining, if you try to overlook the spit sharing and focus on the rest of the show. (Which may seem just as...weird and obnoxious, yet I find those parts of the show to play into the whole mysterious and out of the ordinary feel of Nazo No Kanojo.)Personally, I might be slightly biased towards this anime as it holds a special place in my heart. (Nostalgia from watching it at a young age, and/or my affinity with the soundtrack featured in it.) I personally adore the characters, although Akira Tsubaki may seem like your average romance anime protagonist, and although he might be quite bland, and boring, and all the other traits that you might expect in a romcom anime protagonist, his character ultimately makes following along with the whole story a fun journey to partake in as the viewer.When it comes to these sorts of anime, a lovable and attractive female lead is a must have for it to be enjoyable. Nazo No Kanojo X is not short of attractive anime girls, with characters like Mikoto Urabe and a small assortment of other side characters for the viewer to enjoy.Mikoto Urabe is one of the main reasons why I love Nazo No Kanojo X so much, these kinds of quirky emo looking anime characters are not necessarily RARE per se in anime, but it's just the way that Mikoto Urabe doesn't fit a certain category that I love so much. She's weird, she's mysterious, she looks cool (opinionated) and I enjoy her character. She doesn't lean towards any sort of type to a T, and I enjoy how unique she is because of that. One of my favourite characters in all honesty. (Then again, this is all opinionated and she COULD fit some sort of label but I just can't think of any at the moment, although I still do view her as unique when compared to other characters.)When looking at the romance aspect of Nazo No Kanojo X, I especially enjoy how the two main characters mingle with each other and how their relationship progresses through the show. With the perfect balance of ecchi and romance, the pairing create an entertaining play for the viewer.From what I remember, there are some ecchi scenes present, but judging and looking at Nazo No Kanojo X as a whole, I wouldn't really describe the anime as 'ecchi' as the ecchi scenes are not the main focus of the series.With extreme ecchi anime-like situations here and there, I would regard this anime as ecchi to a degree. When compared with other anime, Nazo No Kanojo's ecchi aspect does not really affect how one may view the show, although those who are not ecchi fans may find these scenes uncomfortable to watch. This series really crosses a lot of boundaries in terms of social norms and other things like basic common sense, although I won't name which specific things I am talking about... Nazo No Kanojo X expresses these ecchi scenes in a sublime way, but in the end it really all boils down to personal preference.I think that the ecchi scenes are quite uncomfortable at some points of the show, but I still enjoy it nonetheless as I choose to overlook the things that might be a bit strange to watch. (Either that or I just have a high tolerance for these sorts of things.) But in the end, the romance sort of overpowers the ecchi sense and helps it balance out the series in a great way which helps the show become more palatable for the faint-hearted.Nazo No Kanojo X fills you with nothing but questions, with certain things seeming unexplainable, and some things just seeming downright weird. These aspects of the anime are things that can be found quite loveable in a strange sense. The weirdness is something that can't be found in many places, as these sorts of obscure seeming anime are things that never sort of land in the anime industry. (Seeing that Nazo No Kanojo X never really became mainstream.) But this strangeness gives a unique touch to the anime anyway, not only that but the nostalgic 90s anime art style and beautiful soundtrack are things that can't really be found anywhere else. Or, well, what I mean by that is that there isn't really anything that captures the same vibe as Nazo No Kanojo X. I'm sure many can agree on that one.The soundtrack is also another thing that makes Nazo No Kanojo X so amazing, the memorable and gorgeous ost that plays during each episode just amplifies the experience. The opening and ending songs both sung by Ayako Yoshitani (voice of Mikoto Urabe) are both favourites of mine, most wouldn't see the opening and ending songs of an anime as important, but in this case they just add so much to the anime. The ending and opening songs are songs that I would never skip, both are great in my opinion.The art style is also another thing that I have an affinity with, the 90s like style (slightly) similar to manga artist Rumiko Takahashi's artstyle is nostalgic and easy on the eyes. Although it's not for everyone, and it's not as modern and spunky as some might prefer, the old school art style adds to the overall vibe and aesthetic of Nazo No Kanojo X.To bring this messy review to an end, Nazo No Kanojo X isn't for everyone, but it can be enjoyed by those who take a liking to it. It's definitely worth watching, but it all depends on what the viewer prefers. If you're looking for something out of the ordinary and strange, but also looking for cheesy high school romance and awkward teenage relationships, then this is the show for you ! Nazo No Kanojo is a one of a kind anime, with unique characters and storyline, gorgeous art and ost, and interesting plot paired with a fun little journey to follow along with.Overall, Nazo No Kanojo is a hard 9/10 from me ! (∩^o^)⊃━☆ weird and obnoxious, yet I find those parts of the show to play into the whole mysterious and out of the ordinary feel of Nazo No Kanojo.)Personally, I might be slightly biased towards this anime as it holds a special place in my heart. (Nostalgia from watching it at a young age, and/or my affinity with the soundtrack featured in it.) I personally adore the characters, although Akira Tsubaki may seem like your average romance anime protagonist, and although he might be quite bland, and boring, and all the other traits that you might expect in a romcom anime protagonist, his character ultimately makes following along with the whole story a fun journey to partake in as the viewer.When it comes to these sorts of anime, a lovable and attractive female lead is a must have for it to be enjoyable. Nazo No Kanojo X is not short of attractive anime girls, with characters like Mikoto Urabe and a small assortment of other side characters for the viewer to enjoy.Mikoto Urabe is one of the main reasons why I love Nazo No Kanojo X so much, these kinds of quirky emo looking anime characters are not necessarily RARE per se in anime, but it's just the way that Mikoto Urabe doesn't fit a certain category that I love so much. She's weird, she's mysterious, she looks cool (opinionated) and I enjoy her character. She doesn't lean towards any sort of type to a T, and I enjoy how unique she is because of that. One of my favourite characters in all honesty. (Then again, this is all opinionated and she COULD fit some sort of label but I just can't think of any at the moment, although I still do view her as unique when compared to other characters.)When looking at the romance aspect of Nazo No Kanojo X, I especially enjoy how the two main characters mingle with each other and how their relationship progresses through the show. With the perfect balance of ecchi and romance, the pairing create an entertaining play for the viewer.From what I remember, there are some ecchi scenes present, but judging and looking at Nazo No Kanojo X as a whole, I wouldn't really describe the anime as 'ecchi' as the ecchi scenes are not the main focus of the series.With extreme ecchi anime-like situations here and there, I would regard this anime as ecchi to a degree.

The way Urabe and Tsubaki's relationship develops, how Urabe is concerned when her uncomfortableness with physical contact leads to Tsubaki getting hurt, you can see in Urabe's voice and face just how sad she is and their relationship yet again develops in a meaningful way.I also liked the dream sequences and how Tsubaki is constantly enamoured and turned on by Urabe. I am absolutely sick of whiny little brats...that bitch and moan about getting no attention from girls then are thick as loggerheads when the girls DO INFACT give them attention in anime and it's a nice change of pace for the MC to know what's up. I'd rate him favourably with MCs I like; Miyamura, Araragi and Sakuta.The side characters are very likeable too. I specially liked the OTHER couple in the show, Mr and Mrs Megane. They're cute and their interaction with Tsubaki and Urabe are quite important towards their development as characters as the main couple are hopeless in some aspects.anyways good show, I highly recommend it. And the drool stuff imo isn't really that gross, but very odd and very VERY erotic. Some of the lewdest stuff on mainline shows I've seen. that bitch and moan about getting no attention from girls then are thick as loggerheads when the girls DO INFACT give them attention in anime and it's a nice change of pace for the MC to know what's up.

If focuses far too heavily on a saliva based kink (which involves 0 kissing) and if you aren't interested in that kink it can be hard to watch. The story and characters themselves seem interesting enough however if you aren't interested in the kink I would recommend just staying clear of it because the anime traps you in to thinking there is growth but there never comes any.So let's get in to it, I stumbled upon this anime through the random function of a site and the first episode is fairly interesting and leads...you wondering what exactly is going on. At some point we see the fetish rear its ugly head as the main character who's alone at school decides to lick the drool of a fellow classmates desk.This show then takes a weird turn as the female classmate knows he licked her drool because he's sick, and the reason he's been sick? Because he's in love and hasn't tasted her spit in 2 weeks. Wait, what? So this must have some type of mythical aspects to it, interesting.  Each others spit also allows each other to feel/see each others memories, dreams, feelings. She then starts swapping spit with another female in their class. When they first swap spit the female gains the same injuries of the other. Very mysterious indeed.... the problem is that the anime never actually elaborates on this, everyone else is normal, there is nothing mysterious at all going on other some very weird things that are never explained and have no reason to be in the anime other than just being there.The main character in this anime ends up just being very creepy; he essentially stalked his middle school crush, he saves her hair, he licked drool off of a desk, and essentially se*ually assaults his girlfriend. He's controlling and jealous and doesn't actually show any real redeeming qualities.On the other side his girlfriend also makes no sense. She doesnt allow him to touch her; no hand holding, hugging, kissing, hand around shoulders, etc... but she openly allows him to grab her breast in an episode no big deal. Early on she tells him she had a dream about how they will have sex and they start dating, but soon after they start dating a guy in their class asks her out and they start swapping spit, no big deal.In general, the entire show is a complete mess that makes absolutely no sense and even though the anime could have been good, the amount of spit swapping and talking of drool largely holds back this anime for anyone who doesn't have this fetish, the ridiculous situations that aren't explained at all, and the fact there's essentially no character growth hold this back from being good. you wondering what exactly is going on.

This anime is a villainess, time travel, drama, comedy anime. Short premise is basically the MC got executed due to revolution because of the failure that the royal family made, but then got revive and time travel back to fix her and her empire\'s problem and avoid the same faith.The interesting aspect about this is not just by the premise alone, but the fact that the protag while got the chance to fix her and her...empire\'s mistake, she does it still in her ""selfish"" personality ways but to the outsider now view her as good. What I mean is that the show doesn\'t completely just flip her personality on its head and just turn her from evil to good, they still retained her personality but now change her train of thought since she know that she need to change.The big part of this anime, the comedy and drama, is also what make this anime good. The comedy is quite enjoyable and not repetitive, and the drama require you to still think and enjoy through the show in the lenses of the protag eye.Overall, this is such an enjoyable show, nothing much stands out other than it premise, so still enjoyable, fun, and funny anime to enjoy! :). I rated this 9/10 (for comedy fantasy) empire\'s mistake, she does it still in her ""selfish"" personality ways but to the outsider now view her as good.

That is, until Silver Link\'s adaptation this year came around this season, which gave me the perfect chance to experience the LN/manga in anime form, and I have to say that despite the clash...of similar themed works, it delivered on so many levels, that this is hands down one of the best non-attention-grabbing low-key shows of Fall 2023.The one thing that you should be aware of about Tearmoon Empire is that it\'s very inspired by the French Revolution and medieval Europe, on top of the already near-guillotine-executing ""I must reverse time and undo all my mistakes!"" premise that combines so many genres to a near-flawless execution, being a time-travelling fantasy comedy with a villainess MC that likes to get into the political drama, all in a venture to restore that which is lost: the reputation of the Tearmoon Empire and its proclaimed princess: Mia Luna Tearmoon. Having already driven her empire to the ground, a revolution sees the 20-year-old being captured and tortured by the servants that the selfish princess once belittled, as time counts down till her public execution. And when that time came, there was no hope for Mia to ever see the light of her day...that is, until said execution mysteriously brought her 8 years back to her 12-year-old self. Free from the constraints of the execution, along with the ""Death Note"" diary that logs each and every account of her misdemeanors towards the people close to her that leads to the execution, Mia hopes to resettle her empire by restoring her relations with her offenders with her ""Mia First"" policy, on top of her already selfish nature that turns people\'s heads towards her, giving her a precious second chance to make things right...by turning things into the 3rd person perspective, along with the narrator to play with her expressions.If you understand the expression ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend,"" then you\'ll understand Mia to a T. Mia\'s role as the frenemy — it\'s not an easy task trying to recruit those whom she simply shrugged off to one side in her previous life. Mia constantly has to weigh her options and act against those specified in the diary that could lead to her downfall, the simplest actions of which would determine her distance to the fated guillotine (who always likes to play with Mia if she is on the cusp of doing something wrong to cheer her to it, that\'s a hilarious recurring gag). Besides, given Mia\'s previous epitaph as ""The Selfish Princess who Ruined Tearmoon,"" which is eventually replaced as ""The Great Sage of the Empire,"" they couldn\'t be more different from each other, being one and the same at her very core, with her hilarity point being the delusions surrounding an arrogant, cowardly, and slightly selfish persona that hides a lovable idiot even further below, despite her flaws that she tries to hide to the best of her abilities.Over the course of her renewed tenure, Mia wins and gains her once-frenemies, and here are a few examples:- Mia\'s personal maid-in-waiting, Anne Littstein, who previously served her as one of her most loyal subjects during her execution phase, was thankful for her loyalty. Alongside her sick and frail sister Eris to complete her self-written novel and serve as the official author of her documented biography;- Mia\'s finance head, Ludwig Hewitt, who once worked as a government official trying to resolve the old Tearmoon Empire\'s economic collapse, being thankful that he spared her life;- Mia\'s friends of princes Abel Remno and Sion Sol Sunkland, and the lesser noble Tiona Rudolvon. Speaking of Abel first, his former life was not so great, being a playboy and gambler, one who always hides in the shadows of his brother Gain. But in the new timeline, after meeting Mia, he humbles his heart and gets his act together to have a relationship with her. As for Sion, he\'s linked with Tiona; both were the leaders of the revolution that took Mia down, and with the subtlety changes, he now protects Mia as one of their beloved friends. Tiona especially, since Mia\'s time at Saint Noel Academy wasn\'t the best, and she would become the princess\'s best ally.- Mia\'s BIGGEST enemy is Rafina Orca Belluga, the daughter of Duke Belluga, which is where Saint Noel Academy is located. Rafina\'s functionally princess position basically equals and rivals that of Mia, since she helped both Sion and Tiona bring the old Mia down, and she remains the threat that the new Mia must avoid...though with some misinterpretations, Rafina begins to clear things up, which solidifies their friendship.Of all of the frenemies that Mia reconciled, Rafina is definitely the most unkempt friendship sequence, considering her reputation and power enough that Mia could edge closer to the guilotine. But still, you\'ve gotta do what you\'ve gotta do, and the Tearmoon princess eventually did her forgiving deed, all in the plight to run away from the knife\'s edge as far as possible. That said, the story itself has a few timelines, so if that rouses your interest, have fun navigating through the many events surrounding each timeline.Out of all the roles that the fan favourite VA Sumire Uesaka has performed this year, she continues to dominate the VA anime scene with returning favourites like Ijiranaide, Nagatoro-san, Isekai wa Smartphone to Tomo ni. and ToniKawa, to new favourites like 100 Girlfriends\' with Hahari Hanazono, and now with this show serving as Mia\'s VA, which she aced perfectly. Needless to say, if you\'re not stoked for the anime adaptation of RoshiDere coming Spring next year with the titular main girl, Alisa Mikhailovna Kujo (because Sumipe actually learned the Russian language enough to score the role), then I don\'t know what to say as a convincing measure.For Silver Link, 2023 has been somewhat of a mediocre year, from subpar sequel follow-ups to last season\'s Lv1 Maou to One Room Yuusha a.k.a Level 1 Demon Lord and One Room Hero, which is a decent chunk of change. However, this Fall, this show, and Ragna Crimson, apart from being directed by people who\'ve been trained in assistant roles to be promoted to full-on directorialship, certainly looked like Silver Link was taking a rather long rest while waiting for their Fall shows to come out guns blazing. For his debut directorial role, Yushi Ibe might not have come out strong, but the quality of his staff team has been kept very consistent, so well done. And for the sum of the entire show as a whole, the studio finally delivered with great production and vibrant colours, definitely A+++ quality.For the music, Sumipe\'s OP song is great. It\'s full of Mia\'s infused personalities and idiosyncrasies that make for a bopping song. KanoeRana\'s ED song, on the other hand, is decently mellow but by no means bad.I\'ve really enjoyed Tearmoon Empire for what it is and its themes, which work so well together, and it should emit the same level of magical energy to you for its brilliance.

Wonderful.', ""The show is really a mixed bag. From the get-go I found it quite hard to believe Mia should be behaving in such a childish and immature way when she returned back to her 12 year-old self. She went through 3 years of horrible suffering imprisoned in horrible conditions before getting killed, yet she still acts like a kid who seems to be trying to avoid death by guillotine the same way a kid tries to avoid eating his vegetables. There is no intense fear or trauma, or anything that would really be ingrained in someone after such long suffering. I’ve been personally told that...in the story (light novel?) she has selective memory or slight amnesia after going back in time, but not only does the anime not explain that in any way, it’s very hard to believe that kind of setting when she clearly can remember faces, voices, names, smells and conversations (word for word even) from that timeline. Being a pampered princess who knew no better isn’t an excuse, not with such a long period of hardship.Honestly, the background story doesn’t have to be deep, nor does it really need to be detailed when the main highlight of this show is for the gags and funny situations that happen where Mia’s intentions and thoughts differ from the people around her. It’s the classic misinterpreting someone’s actions to be grander than it actually is and everyone but the main character are aware, thus the reason behind things happening isn’t as important as just letting those things actually happen for the sake of showing this gag. But if you start with such a strong and serious setting, it is very hard to brush off the expected maturity of the character. If the setting was just a 12 year-old finding a book that foretold her demise that would sound more believable; she would not have the experience of having so many years of suffering and the hardships of trying to run away. Her acting like a childish kid (which she does here) would fit as she is just someone who has some extra information obtained from a book and not someone who actually has lived through it and she would only be able to try and resolve it through trial and error. As to why I am so bothered by the setting, it’s really just because it set the wrong mood right from the start and made it frustrating to see how ridiculously immature she acted as at times, she even goes as far as to boast about her maturity and being older because of those years she lived in that timeline, with nothing to show for it. Why would you avoid people who played a part in going against you instead of trying to get them to know a good side of you? That's a risky way to try to avoid death when it is more unclear what they would do if you leave them to their own devices. Sounds like something a child would do, instead of a princess who suffered 3 years in prison if you asked me. Where are the strong emotions or attachments that would develop in those hard times? There is none to show off, which is really disappointing.Ignoring all that, poor Mia though, even after all the suffering she is still dumb after returning back in time. She is lucky for some reason people come to conclusions way off the actual mark. In the end I wish her all the best, but that setting was just not it. in the story (light novel?) she has selective memory or slight amnesia after going back in time, but not only does the anime not explain that in any way, it’s very hard to believe that kind of setting when she clearly can remember faces, voices, names, smells and conversations (word for word even) from that timeline.

In the end I wish her all the best, but that setting was just not it."", 'I really love these animes where the MC gets a second chance in life whether it be figuring out to escape the “dead end” or the guillotine.In Mia’s previous life, she was a bratty, entitled princess. Everyone around her shivered in fear. It wasn’t until she was sentenced to death, experienced terrible living conditions and the guillotine she decide to change.Overall, the show is pretty funny. Mia’s inner monologue cracks me up especially when the guillotine animation is involved. You can see that she really grows as a character to be kinder to those around her and the least fortunate.Sure, she changes...her behavior for her own selfish reason, she’s scared of the guillotine, but she also does care about people such as Anne, who was there for her even when Mia treated her poorly.I’d recommend this show for people that like this type of genre. Something lighthearted and fun. Tearmoon Empire ended up being better than expected her behavior for her own selfish reason, she’s scared of the guillotine, but she also does care about people such as Anne, who was there for her even when Mia treated her poorly.I’d recommend this show for people that like this type of genre. Something lighthearted and fun. Tearmoon Empire ended up being better than expected', 'If the Tearmoon Kingdom novel series is a 10/10, then I\'d give the anime adaption a 5/10, thus the score.Seriously, I haven\'t seen such a bad adaptation that tries to adapt faithfully to the novels. Indeed, the anime only covers two volumes, and it covers every single story point. However--and I am absolutely shocked--the anime still just sucks so much.If I had to describe one thing about this show, it\'d be cheap. It\'s not just the obvious telltale signs too, but down to the roots of the show. First of all, is the art. The art is extremely generic. I won\'t really go into Silver...Link, the studio that animated this, but damn does this show\'s art style look like the most generic and boring isekai anime ever. But it\'s not just generic, it\'s also terrible. Each character looks the same, aside from Mia of course. Every person\'s facial structure and expression are so similar that the only thing separating them from each other is their hairstyle and clothing. Of course, this is just because each character is copy-pasted with minimal facial expressions being animated. This really takes away from the show. A great example of this is Dion, a battle-weary captain in the novel, but in the anime, he just looks like a generic salaryman. His tone and inflection are supposed to be more rough, a bit rugged, like a commoner\'s. Because he obviously is one. He\'s supposed to be more wary of Mia at the beginning, trusting, and finally loyal. In this show, none of those stages are expressed in either character development, art, or facial expressions.In contrast, look at Mia\'s facial expressions in comedic moments. It feels vibrant because Mia is constantly changing her expression to match her mood and feelings. When she\'s put in the spotlight, the anime highlights that in her face. Now look at other characters. Even when they\'re fighting to the death, they have the most generic stoic facial expressions like they\'re talking about the weather. Their voice acting, again, is just absolutely terrible. Only Mia\'s is fine, but all of the other characters have such lacking ranges of emotion in their voices it\'s pathetic. It\'s like they were instructed to talk in a monotone or something.This genericness and cheapness extend to the focus on character development as well. While Mia gets adequate monologues in the anime, the other characters are sorely lacking. The novel does focus on Mia a large portion of the time and she IS the main character, but the novel also does a lot of character development and world-building from the perspective of other characters. This is cut out completely. The reason why the novel series is fun is because the misunderstanding is between a well-developed character and Mia, but in this show, it\'s basically like some generic archetypal character that you barely know about engaging with Mia. Even with Mia\'s love interests, like Sion and Abel, they are completely lacking any sort of actual character in the anime compared to the novel. The main charm point of the novel becomes completely neglected in the anime. I feel like I\'m watching some generic Otome game reincarnation anime since I see characters that barely get introduced influencing the story.Then comes the misunderstandings themselves. First and foremost, Tearmoon Kingdom is a comedic misunderstanding novel. This gets expanded upon of course, but misunderstandings are what the novel excels at creating. And this anime butchers it. You can see it even in the storyboarding itself. Comedic pacing is extremely important, and the show just does not have that level of finesse when adapting comedic scenes. Monologues are done lazily in frozen frames where the person talking has a spotlight on them and everyone is idle. Sometimes, the monologuing is cut completely. There doesn\'t seem to be any flow of conversation despite there being one because of these awkward freeze-frame cuts. There isn\'t any pacing. The characters just force their monologues into a conversation and that\'s about it. It doesn\'t feel like things are moving in real-time, and as a result, almost all of the comedy is just gotten rid of.It\'s not just the comedic pacing and delivery that\'s awful, though, it\'s just the storyboarding themselves. Manga adaptations are so much easier to animate since they already have a storyboard readily made for animators. For novels, studios have to create their own from scratch. And it\'s painfully made aware here, where Silver Link decides to create the most cheap storyboards possible. First of all, there\'s a lack of spatial awareness. Each character stands still. Everyone stands still, or they\'re standing really far away and talking, or nothing is happening on screen. This is, of course, to reduce animation costs. People just ""wait"" on the screen for someone to make their move or talk. There\'s a lack of tension in scenes that have fighting. Scenes that should have much more impact are trivialized and made a mockery in the anime. Pride, rage, embarrassment, guilt, and spite are all shown in the anime, but rarely are these emotions actually transmitted to the viewer due to the extremely lacking pacing, scenes, and storyboard. Let\'s not even talk about fights. They might as well not exist for how poorly they are all animated.If I had to make a closing remark, this show is the opposite of shows like Konosuba or to be the Power in the Shadows, where they completely elevate the novel by making full use of the animation medium. Konosuba has vibrant tsukkomi through their brilliant comedic pacing, simple but good animation, and large ranges of facial expressions and interactions. To be the Power in the Shadows makes full use of its storyboarding capabilities by adding atmostphere to serious scenes despite the novel being full of comedic monologue.

Unlike other time slip stories, MC does not try to be good but behaves selfish to avoid beheading. However it is perfectly misunderstood by other characters to bring the best result. Narration and personified guillotine (from comicalized one) gives more fun to those situations.The show itself is funny enough, above average. However referring to original novel, animated part is only beginning and more chapters are coming. Animation rushed too much to finish it within one cour, so we're missing more serious stories...behind the curtain. Also some of heroine's selfish thoughts and actions were omitted. So if you want to see the full story, I strongly recommend original novel. (Comics is slower than animation now.) behind the curtain. Also some of heroine's selfish thoughts and actions were omitted. So if you want to see the full story, I strongly recommend original novel. (Comics is slower than animation now.)"", '(There is only a minor ""spoiler""  ahead but nothing concrete.)Ever since Bakarina (especially the second season) it feels like Anime where the Main Heroine who is going to die because she\'s a bad person becomes good because someone other got reincarnated in their bodies and want to change their fate seems to be quite popular (you can find way more of such stories in Manga and Manwha). So especially if you saw some Anime of those kind, you may ask yourself ""So why should I watch another one of those? Isn\'t it the same as always?"" - So let me answer: ""No, not at...all!""There are some mayor things which make this Anime so enjoyable and create enough differences to other stories like that.The very very first thing even before the first is the fact that there is no reincarnation of an Isekai-typ, it\'s Mia herself and no one other - and I love that!First, instead of showing a small piece of how the character would end while the Main Heroine has an inner monologue about that, we see what awaits our main Girl Mia as she\'s imprisoned, gets abused (not in a sexual way or at least there is no mention of such things) and killed of by the Guillotine. In other words,we can see and kinda feel her pain, what makes her motives understandable.Second is that after her timetravel she doesn\'t have immedeatly a change of heart and becomes a good person. No. She\'s the same as always and keeps her egoistic attitude, BUT she changes more and more over time while getting more fleshed out (which is a realism I appreciate)Third one is the logical continue of that. Because she knows what awaits her, she behaves other than before - and that is where the comedy kicks in right away!On the one hand you get really funny moments everytime Guillotine-kun shows up in Mias imagination (seriously, the idea of creating this ""character"" is so damn great!), while on the other hand her behaviour always getting misunderstood in a way everyone thinks she would be full of wisdom. Yeah, that\'s kinda hilarious, but it\'s way more understandable and entertaining than in an other Anime beginning with ""O"" and ending with ""verlord"" - at least in my opinion.Other characters getting fleshed out as well, but unfortunately not as good as Mia-chan. However, Anne is second best character of this Anime for me, especially because of her inner thoughts which are kinda hilarious while also showing her sweet heart.I cannot complain about the music, OP and ED both fit well, even though the OP is a bit better in my opinion. The art is kinda basic but still good, nothing to complain about - however, the scenes with Guillotine-kun as well as Mias and Annes inner thoughts are my highlights.All in all, it\'s an enjoyable Anime with a lot of humor and some glimpses of darkness here and there.

It takes what is the standard formula and executes it well.Even though the story may feel 'standard' and you can predict certain aspects, it actually sets up those plot points in the story, which probably aids in the audience predicting where things will go, there is no random ass-pull or deus ex moment, we're not throwing in a random amnesia plotline, or putting in literal gods for a shocking twist, and characters actually follow an internal logic that actually makes sense.The series is well paced, and also doesn't have any obvious plot holes,Which brings me to the characters, which is the strong point of this series, the characters are actually given depth, they get to grow. The characters, like real people have well preconceived ideas, and they all have reasons for having those ideas, after all preconceived ideas often don't come out of no where, but when those ideas are challenged, they have to slowly change their way of thinking.Of cause Mia takes the biggest journey and undergoes the biggest change without realising it, but she's had more time to reflect on things.However it is satisfying to see see Sion's growth, because it wasn't just something that happened at the end, but because we had Mia challenging his notions of justice for a while.If you like the genre then you can't go far wrong with this entry, for me it sets a standard baseline that the genre should be looking to achieve. Hamefura is still the GOAT though. start strong, but then tend to lose their way, usually ending with you feeling unsatisfied with how it ended.This is in my opinion one of the better entries in the genre, while it doesn't do too much special and certain things are easily predictable, it's strengths lie with its consistency.

Princess Hina is a unique blend of Katarina Claes from an otome game and Momonga Ainz from Overlord.What sets this anime apart is that it's not overly cringe-worthy. It features a reverse harem element, but its focus is more on the storyline and the understandable political conflicts and their outcomes.The 'Book' is also a significant aspect of the anime. Even though the plot has been altered, there are always new plotlines, as if alternate worlds truly exist. Furthermore, the reincarnation factor brings...all the knowledge from the past into the current self.The opening song is catchy and pleasant to listen to. And one of the most distinctive features is DESU WAAAAA~~ all the knowledge from the past into the current self.The opening song is catchy and pleasant to listen to. And one of the most distinctive features is DESU WAAAAA~~"", 'In my opinion, this anime is severely underrated. Personally, I think it’s a hidden gem of this seasonThe premise is nothing new: a “villainess” gets reincarnated with knowledge of the future and strives to avert her unfortunate fate. However, this is where this title does things a bit differently. Mia - the princess in question - just goes back through time with her memories intact. And that means that she’s still the same person inside. She’s still selfish, arrogant and bratty, but her past experiences taught her at least some humility and warned her about the problems she was oblivious to.So there’s the first...thing that I really like about the show. I just can’t help but love Mia for her personality. She’s not your typical goody-two-shoes isekai protagonist. She’s a complex character with her fair share of flaws, but she tries her best to change. That’s what makes Mia so likable and relatable. Calling her a “villainess” in the first place would, in my opinion, do a major disservice to her character.The second thing that I really like is the comedy. I think it’s done really well. Mia is an average girl and while she really tries to educate herself on how to fix her empire, it’s an impossible task for her alone. And so she does the sensible thing and recruits actually capable and smart people to assist her. But thanks to to her knowledge of the future events and various misunderstandings, people around Mia start to see her as some sort of divine visionary with infinite wisdom and benevolence. And every time there’s a comedy bit like that, it’s done pretty well with all the music and visual gags. I rarely laugh when watching an anime labeled as “comedy”, but here I’ve laughed plenty of timesThe third thing is overall plot and side characters. They are well done too, in my opinion. The plot does a good enough job to keep you engaged, but the show’s main strengths are still its characters and comedy. If you like Mia and her interactions with the side characters, you’re in for the best time. If not, then the overarching plot won’t be enough to make the show interesting for you.In conclusion, I think it’s a very well done anime and I’m a bit embarrassed to admit how much I’ve enjoyed it. It made me pick up the light novels, which is a first for me as I usually just don’t bother. So far I’ve read 5 volumes and it’s really good. If you like the anime, I highly recommend reading its source material too. It has more details and events that make you love the cast even more, but I’d still say that anime does a good job at adapting the LN.Overall, I give this show a 9.

However, beneath the surface there are interesting undertones of ethical philosophy. While princess Mia’s actions are (mostly) motivated by her own interests she is making the world a better place. Can her actions be said to be morally right? A consequentialist would answer yes while others might argue that a “good deed” motivated by selfish desire isn’t truly good and that Mia hasn’t truly changed until she embraces true selflessness.So far, the anime hasn’t explicitly delved deeply into these topics, which is refreshing as the alternative would risk being too on the nose. It...remains to be seen what direction the anime will take, but there is potential for great character development and exploration of moral philosophy in a wholesome and light-hearted format.

Apart from that, it was a very good, fun, funny anime, which I'm glad I watched.The character development is good. I mean, for the first 6(?)-8 episodes, the protagonist must get her affairs in order due to her book being updated every time she does something good and it changes her future, which is an unique, I think, and from there it's just her and her thoughts and her things...and she's no longer constrained to the book.I recommend this anime. and she's no longer constrained to the book.I recommend this anime."", 'It tells the story of the 20-year-old princess Mia who was sentenced to death and was reborn as a 12-year-old cute loli after being beheaded.

Reincarnation fantasy with shades of French Revolution satire? It sounded like a recipe for either campy melodrama or heavy-handed political allegory. But, to my pleasant surprise, Tearmoon Empire turned out to be a delightfully engaging blend of humor, intrigue, and genuine character growth.The premise is intriguing: Princess Mia, executed for her opulent lifestyle and obliviousness to her people's plight, gets a do-over eight years in the past. Now a pre-teen, she has a second chance to avoid her empire's downfall...and, hopefully, become a better ruler. Mia, however, is far from a saint. She's still vain, manipulative, and prone to indulging her sweet tooth. But it's this flawed and relatable protagonist that makes her journey so compelling. We see her genuinely struggle with her past mistakes, grapple with the weight of responsibility, and, yes, occasionally sneak a bite of cake when no one's looking.The supporting characters are equally well-drawn, from Mia's loyal maid Anne all the way to the stoic Sion. The dynamics between all the character's are full of humor and heart, with plenty of witty banter and heartwarming moments. The show's comedy is another strong point, seamlessly weaving slapstick and sharp satire into the narrative without sacrificing the emotional core.However, Tearmoon Empire isn't just a laugh riot. The political intrigue is surprisingly complex, exploring themes of class inequality, corruption, and the challenges of reforming a crumbling society. The show doesn't shy away from the harsh realities of Mia's world, but it also balances them with moments of hope and progress.While the animation and action sequences are decent, they don't quite reach the level of some other recent anime. However, the strong voice acting and catchy soundtrack more than make up for it.Tearmoon Empire is not perfect. The plot can sometimes be predictable, and some character motivations remain ambiguous. But its refreshing take on the reincarnation trope, strong character development, and blend of humor and political intrigue make it a thoroughly enjoyable watch. If you're looking for something different and engaging, give Tearmoon Empire a chance. You might be surprised at how much you enjoy it. and, hopefully, become a better ruler.

It’s got one of the more unique premises in the genre and doesn’t take itself too seriously, making for a really funny and relaxing watch.Tearmoon Empire is a little different from most villainess stories. Instead of an isekai, we’ve got a time travel/do over style set up inspired by the French Revolution where the MC, Mia, is executed for failing to properly manage her kingdom and gets a second chance at life. She wants to make sure she doesn’t get executed again and her kingdom doesn’t fall into ruin, but...not because she’s a changed person, she just doesn’t want to die again. Mia is purely out for self preservation and to avoid the pain she went through at the end of her last life. I found this to be a nice change up on the usual gimmick with these shows as Mia isn’t out to save the world, but is usually thrown into situations that make her look better than she actually is.The big gimmick in the story is that characters misinterpret everything Mia does as part of some grand benevolent scheme and that she’s got it all figured out, which couldn’t be further from the truth. These misunderstandings, usually accompanied by the narrator’s commentary and the characters’ inner monologue are absolutely hilarious. If you’re a fan of eminence in shadow, overlord or youjo senki, you’ll know exactly what I’m talking about. This might be the wildest example of this trope though. Mia literally just breathing will get misunderstood by her supporters as some grand plan and they’ll completely overreact. I really enjoyed seeing her just make things up as she went along.Speaking of characters, I loved the side characters in this one. All are very relevant and add a lot to the story as is the case in most villainess series. You do have your romantic interest who Mia tries to impress and wants to be closer with, another prince vying for her, the loyal maid, advisors etc., it’s all one big wacky loveable family.Production values are pretty solid. Nothing crazy, but nice looking for sure. The big draw here is the characters and Mia, though.I had a ton of fun with this anime. It doesn’t take itself too seriously, is genuinely hilarious and has one of the silliest and most entertaining MCs out there. It’s one of those stories that doesn’t do much new, but just does things right. I think comedy and otome fans will enjoy this one a lot.Tearmoon Empire gets 8, out of 10 not because she’s a changed person, she just doesn’t want to die again.

Especially a little bit of dark elements gives it a better flavour and makes it unique in comedy genre.Characters: main character is perfect; little stupid and mischievous, but overall good, helpful and ,most important, entertaining. She's the only reason you watch the show, seeing every single thing she does by accident turn into miracle of saint is whole base of show. Rest of characters? There's not enough time to give them proper personalities, but they...aren't annoying and that's all you nedd.Graphic: characters look simple and generic, but still good. Background, clothes etc. looks very fine.Music: in every scene it fits great, wonderful job on that part.Recommendation:Read light novel. That's best recommendation I can give. Anime is too short to tell whole tale of story and to give characters some complex emotions. So read a few chapters of light novel, have really good time with it, then maybe read some more and then you can go back to enjoy an anime understanding full story. If you want to watch anime without reading LN you can, but I would say it will give you 20-30% of satisfaction you could have.

Tearmoon Empire averts this. Sure main protagonist Princess Mia Luna Tearmoon isn\'t exactly card carryingly evil, but she is refreshingly selfish. Not so much so that she looses sympathy but enough that the main appeal of the idea, namely, that the villainess is the main protagonist, is maintained. The result is the delightfully selfish and Marie Antoinette like Princess...Mia trying to save herself and make the most of her second chance at life. It\'s a premise that the show takes full advantage off. Something a lot of villainess shows don\'t do. Unlike many such stories, Mia isn\'t a Japanese woman reincarnated in a game but an actual real princess (the og princess), who was executed by guillotine after her family was overthrown. Mia is then transported back in time to before her execution where she does her best to avoid the fate she has already experienced by using her future knowledge. What follows is light hearted, mostly comedic story focused on a selfishly motivated Mia trying to save herself whilst others around her mistakenly interpret this as benevolence and Genius. This dichotomy between Mia\'s real selfish intentions and everyone else\'s benevolent interpretation is something I never got tired off. However behind that, is a slightly darker tale of a woman traumatised by her past fate and its something that the show does not forget and this results in a more compelling and engaging story.The rest of the characters are fairly fun but a bit typical form this particular genre. However, overall, Tearmoon Empire is a well written and enjoyable story and one of the best reincarnated as a villainess stories I\'ve seen yet as it actually takes advantage of and uses its main premise well.

Accordingly, I was looking forward to ""Tearmoon Empire"".It\'s about the crown princess who perishes in the ""French Revolution"" and is reborn. Thanks to her worn, bloodstained diary, she remembers her last life and wants to prevent her undignified, cruel demise.I was shocked at how little I liked this anime. After two episodes, I had to force myself to watch the third and it didn\'t convince me either.Princess Mia is an idiot who stumbles into one situation after another because of the mystical...PLOT, which prevents the downfall of the kingdom and thus also her death. What seemed at least a little intentional at the beginning soon develops into a story where Mia has no idea what\'s going on, always makes the wrong decisions but thanks to a big pinch of PLOT, everything is always saved. One character after another is lovelessly thrown into the story, just as the story is quickly shot through due to timeskips and more and more stupid jokes are made about Mia\'s cluelessness and how she always misjudges the situations.As someone who started the show for strategy, I found this cluelessness - obviously - not funny at all. Because of the timeskips, we don\'t even get to see how her mistakes really affect things, but always get to hear from characters about how great her last action was without ever getting to see much of it. We know how it started - in her death and rebirth - and we know how it ends - she becomes everyone\'s beloved next empress - and the anime doesn\'t give us a chance to follow along the way, as half of it has to be skipped through timeskips.Accordingly, it may be surprising how I can still give 5 stars after this review, but because I really, really like this type of story, there\'s still a large portion of naive hope in my rating that the three episodes are just the introduction and it will get better - please let it get better.Edit: Plus we have some of the ugliest CGI animation I\'ve ever seen, even if it\'s very rare - watch out for the carriages and horses.Edit 2: No, the anime is not getting better. But after you get used to it, it\'s bearable, but boring enough to fall asleep at the end. PLOT, which prevents the downfall of the kingdom and thus also her death.

This show revolves around its gimmick that Mia is acting selfishly and childishly to prevent dying again and people misunderstand her and think she’s some kind of mastermind. This moves all of the comedy and plot progression forward, and gets a bit stale by the end. While Mia does get some character development from the relationships she gains, because everything revolves around the premise that Mia happens to do the right thing by accident, she remains largely the same by the end of the show. Normally this wouldn’t matter too much for a strict comedy, but the anime...handles its plot seriously enough to where Mia’s ineptitude comes off as annoying when there are high stakes.It’s not bad, and if the synopsis sounds appealing to you I say go for it, but personally I wish the show did a little more. handles its plot seriously enough to where Mia’s ineptitude comes off as annoying when there are high stakes.It’s not bad, and if the synopsis sounds appealing to you I say go for it, but personally I wish the show did a little more.', 'Thing is, the story starts out great! You quickly get the sense that this is basically going to be ""Sassuga Mia-sama!"": The Series. And they really work the joke, while making FMC believably flawed. Just because her personality got her killed once, doesn\'t mean she\'s suddenly going to pull a 180. She\'s mean, childish, and manipulative, and this time around, she has her execution as a fantastic excuse to be that way. The issue is that somehow the show peters out as time goes on, with issues coming to a head in Episode 8. I can\'t put my finger on it, but after seeing her...failing upwards for three quarters of the series, I\'m not invested enough in seeing her do the same for five more episodes in even less believable circumstances. If this series had ended at episode 7, I\'d give it a 5 and move on happily. failing upwards for three quarters of the series, I\'m not invested enough in seeing her do the same for five more episodes in even less believable circumstances.

(For the first half of the anime atleast)Unlike other Villainess stories, this MC is actually pretty shellfish. She does everything for herself; to avoid the guillotine. But everyone around her perceives her action as a selfless and heroic act. Very funny, yes.Soon however, the funny trope quickly feels repeated and boring to watch.I even appreciated the writing and scene composition of this one. Why does it have to become so shit in the second half?Mainly because the girl finished her goal.She\'d worked so hard to avoid the fate of the guillotine and now they...stir up new conflict just to continue it? Unbelievable. Just the thought of doing something after your life purpose has been completed is revulsive. Every anime character shouldn\'t be three dimensional creatures. They should remain in the lower dimension and when their life purpose is filled, kill the character off or if that\'s not possible. Just end the show right there.JK! That\'s not reason. I\'ve first hand experienced working so hard for a goal for so long that when you\'ve achieved the goal... You kinda feel lost, you know? It\'s unnatural to think that you\'d be ""OK IM OFF TO SNEAK---"" No bro. I\'ve never found any anime or LN/WN portray this aspect.

I watched this to take something out of my mind, and it definitely did the job. The story is about the redemption about a selfish princess that got a second chance in life. It's a fun plot, but the execution is a bit messy.The thing that makes this anime so messy is the lack of character development. you would think that an anime about a selfish princess trying...to redeem herself, there would be a ton of character development, but WRONG. The only reason Mia makes any decisions is to avoid the death of herself, not the literal starving people. At first it made sense to make her this way, because she is still a selfish princess, but after episode 6 it gets repetitive, and annoying.The art and animation are pretty good though. I really like the designs of the characters as well. It's not out of this world but I do want to give some credit where it deserves.Finally, the most important thing, the humor. I hate to say it but they completley missed the mark. I watched this with a complete straight face. the narrator roasting Mia was probably one of the funny things, but still, it wasn't giggle worthy.Keep in mind when I watched this, I was trying to get something off my mind, so my feelings on the show might be tied in with the emotional state I was in at the time too lol, sorry for the Grammer mistakes. to redeem herself, there would be a ton of character development, but WRONG.

Both good as bad.The main character is Mia, a princess that is selfish and completely messed up which ends up with her head getting chopped off. Yet she gets a second chance which allows her in the end to correct most problems. Yet her selfish self and having no clue really what she\'s doing remains to the end. Oddly enough, this time around it will help her to some extend to turn her enemies in her former life to her side. This while a bigger plot seems...to be behind her initial fall instead (surprise oh surprise, didn\'t see that coming!)Now, don\'t get me wrong as the concept isn\'t bad at all but it has been used before. So that copy/paste thing is clearly there, I suspect this story to be used before in it\'s entirety even but I wouldn\'t know where to start naming the original in this case. Regardless, there is enough there to make a half decent anime that is good enough to waste your time in if you have any to spare.For the characters there isn\'t really much depth in any of them. Not a single one is even remotely decent so to speak if it comes to that. The level of learning for the characters, improving that is, is limited which does make me wonder. I guess a second season, which was indirectly hinted at, would really need to bring a better idea about this anime. I however would stick this more in the mid-range anime to be honest. to be behind her initial fall instead (surprise oh surprise, didn\'t see that coming!)Now, don\'t get me wrong as the concept isn\'t bad at all but it has been used before.

I really enjoyed everything up until the point when the diary disappeared. I felt everything fell off after that. There was near-ZERO character development for the princess after all that, and it felt bland afterward. Not even the comedy aspect worked anymore for me after that point, which is a shame as I felt it had so much potential to be more fun and just a little bit deeper story-wise. I should've just dropped it after that. "", ""Please note this review is intended to be read by those that had finished watching Tearmoon Empire and while care has been taken to minimized story related spoilers there may still exist within character analysis. You have been warned.Based upon a popular light novel series of the same name Tearmoon Empire is a comedy and fantasy genre anime that elevates itself above its peers by a combination of featuring a setting that we seldom have seen within the anime medium and combing this with a fresh new take on the classic time travel troupe in an effort to bring something fresh to the comfan genre...of anime.Taking place in a fictional representation of the ancient kingdom of Franch in the form of the powerful Tearmoon empire one that while boasting an impressive military, economy, land area and population was nonetheless one that found itself divided between the needs of its selfish rulers and their whimsical desires for greed and wastage of resources and the needs of the common folk who require food, jobs and a stable economy to which they can live safely in and in the process help the country grow.What would happen if one day this carefully maintained balance is shattered forever when the nobles at the top get it in their heads that their needs are far more important than the needs of the people that they are supposed to be ruling. As peaceful protests make way for armed rebellion do the nobles realize how badly calculated their moves had been but by then it was far too late and one by one as their mansions were stormed and burned did, they came face to face with the anger of the people that they were sworn to serve the interests off.One fateful day after the nobles that had in the eyes of the people had ruined the empire had justice visited upon their necks by the rebellions' new friend Mr G the mastermind that they saw as the one being responsible for this turn of events the one nicknamed the Selfish princess who ruined Tearmoon is led out to her final journey towards the embrace of Mr G. As she takes her last fateful steps towards her impending death under the hateful eyes and jeers of people that she once counted as her subjects and the stone-faced soldiers that had once been the guardians that had protected her from harm the princess laments on her fate and prepares to bravely face her fate.But alas thanks to divine intervention from the heavens our princess was given a reprieve and a chance to go back and re-walk the path that had led her to this point in time but now armed with all the knowledge of the consequences that had befallen her in the present.Armed with this precious knowledge and the painful memories of seeing all that you loved and cherished in your empire being turned and used against you would our little princess be able to turn things around and bring the Tearmoon empire back from the brink? Or would she be destined to have an encore with the likes of Mr G who so eagerly awaits in the shadows?Mia Luna TearmoonMia Luna Tearmoon is one of the main characters of the series narrative and serves as its main protagonist. The only daughter of the King of the Tearmoon empire and thus both the empire’s sole princess and heir apparent to the throne. In this guise as the princess of a powerful land-based power Mia was shown to be someone who showcased well the typical personality traits of nobles in that she was not only a supremely arrogant person but was also overconfident and believed strongly in the fact that she as the empire’s princess was able to act however, she wants and that anyone other than herself was a nobody that she can treat however she wants. As a result of this Mia in this guise while having all the resources that her country provided her was seen to not make the most of it being totally ignorant of not just basic human courtesy and kindness that should be shown to others but also subjects that were vital to the ruling of a country in the form of finances, diplomacy and being able to understand and empathize the needs and fears of her subjects. Indeed, in this guise she was quite capable of ordering the immediate execution of a chef should her needs not be satisfied such was her tyranny. Suffice to say this tyranny along with the gross mismanagement of the country by her and her yolk served to ensure that not only did the people that she treated so harshly grew to despise and eventually with the aid of her former friends decide that in the interest of justice that the tyrant and her yolk must be relieved of their roles as leaders of the empire and given a fast-tracked appointment with Mr G so that justice can be achieved for everyone that had suffered under her tyranny. That is until the lord of heavens in his infinite wisdom decided to allow her to take on a new mission that if she chooses to accept it would allow her a new chance in life.In her new guise Mia as a result of possessing knowledge of her previous life was seen to be a very different person entirely. While Mia largely retains her confident nature the experiences that she inherited from her past life had while instilling a level of PTSD within her on account of her interactions with Mr G had also served to make her realize the importance of not acting rashly towards others and to without discourse to always be kind and courteous towards people that she encounters no matter who they are. Without the shadow of arrogance and treating others like trash that she previously possessed Mia’s intelligence and quick-thinking nature traits that she always possessed but overshadowed were able to finally reveal themselves. When combined with her desperate desire to avoid death flags via serious cramming sessions on subjects that a princess should know this served to make her not only a valuable font of information on how the country should be run but also serve to create the foundation for which her fight to change her fate by rebuilding the country can be started in earnest and in doing so pave the way for erasing the grim title that had been bestowed upon her by her detractors that of The Selfish princess who ruined Tearmoon and instead replace it with the much more radiant one of the Great sage of  the Empire.Working in conjunction with Mia’s focus on brushing up on her studies in her quest to change her fate was her desire to not only show kindness towards those around her but also take the time to observe the events around her much more closely and deal with them calmly when possible. This not only allowed Mia to deduce the many minor events around her that escalated into potential flashpoints in her previous life but in doing so early be able to deescalate them before they could become problems with notable events within the narrative being stopping the potential of a plague by building better healthcare facilities and standing by minor nobles to stop them from being bullied. However, while Mia’s focus on using her newfound knowledge to improve the living conditions of her subjects served to endear her in the eyes of her subjects and secure their loyalty it was Mia’s bonding with her allies and converting those former friends that in her past life had been on the opposing side into allies and friends that she can trust wholeheartedly that I felt showed best both Mia’s desire to change her fate by converting them from potential enemies to allies as well as her own desire to get to know them not as assets that can be called upon when needed as most nobles would but rather as people that she can have fun with, read together and be able to enjoy delicious tea and cake together somewhere and more importantly be able to convey and exchange info when one of their numbers requires their aid. This aspect of forging genuine bonds of friendship with her peers within the nobility I felt while symbolizing well Mia’s desire to avoid her dead end also likewise showed well the level of kindness and determination to help others around her as well that allowed her to change the fate of not just herself but those of friends as well a fact that all of which she had a hand in helping were no doubt thankful for and in doing so serving to further enhance the image of the great sage of the empire in the eyes of the people.AnneAnne Littstein is one of the main supporting characters of the series and is one of the servants that attend to Mia. Serving as Mia’s personal maid in waiting Anne from her initial appearances was shown to be a kind, caring and friendly person by nature who while certainly clumsy and ditsy at times was someone who was shown to be exceedingly loyal to Mia irrespective of timelines involved. While Anne was certainly not the sharpest maid in the book her loyalty and sincerity towards Mia combined with her desire to always support her to her utmost, I felt served to complement Mia’s character perfectly and allowed her to be someone that Mia could count upon for support when needed at the right times provided that they aren’t romance related matters.As a character Anne I felt was an interesting character that within the series represented well the concept of loyalty as no matter which timeline of Mia she served the loyalty that she showed them was absolute. Indeed this loyalty when used in conjunction with her expressive nature, honest and friendly nature which was rare in matters of the nobility of that time period fictional or not served to allow Anne to be the rock that her mistress could always count upon when she needed a fact that past Mia was foolish not to heed but Mia reborn was shown to rely upon as not simply a maid but as a dear treasured friend and a loyal member of her band of retainers that would stand side by side with their mistress as she sought to rebuild her kingdom.AMVAnimation-wise wise I felt that the series overall animation featured excellent detail and colour usage that served well to enhance the character designs for the series main cast. In particular the usage of contrasting colour palettes to showcase the situations that the two versions of Mia faced in their timelines served in my opinion to showcase the different sense of tone that characterized the two with the darker colours symbolizing the grimmer fate that awaited past Mia as she came to finally understand all the injustices that she and her ilk had inflicted on her charges that led her to walk down the path for her own execution while the lighter ones symbolized the sense of rebirth and bonds forged anew and where choices can be redone thanks to the merciful intervention of god. The usage of facial expressions to allow the core cast members to convey their surprise at developments within the narrative especially in the case of Mia I felt really served to inject an extra layer of comedy into it thanks to her often-contrasting inner thoughts when reacting to events that she encounters versus her surface reactions to them.Music-wise wise the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Happy End Princess which was performed by Mia’s assigned seiyuu Sumire Uesaka and Queen of the Night that was performed by KanoeRana respectively. These two songs while exceeding catchy in the case of the former I felt conveyed a very different sense of feelings and emotions when presented with the former conveying a sense of a new beginning granted by god that is allowing our little princess to not only change the grim fate that she had achieved in her original timeline but also in the process discover precious along the way in the form of friends, love and being able to live her life without having to look over her shoulders every two minutes for Mr G. The usage of transitions within the opening’s visuals that conveyed the changes that Mia’s bonding with her former enemies and converting them to friends and allies I felt really served to enhance the underlying meaning of that song while hinting on what was to come in Mia’s little crusade.The series ending theme Queen of the Night on the other hand I felt conveyed a very different sense of feelings and emotions when listened to with this song conveying a sense of unexpected encounters, revelations, acceptance of a timeline where her kingdom is very different to the one that she was familiar with and finally trusting that unlike in her own timeline that new Mia in this one is able to run her kingdom correctly and keep its people happy and the empire prospering. Like the opening theme the visuals used for the ending theme, I felt served to enhance the underlying emotions that the song conveyed with the meeting of the two Mia’s in that star-scaped backdrop and the two having sweets together as they discussed the respective kingdoms being an excellent complement to it. Not many people can after all get second chances after having their own people turn on them after all and despite all that’s happened to her seeing old Mia smile at hearing new Mia be able to undo her mistakes and live the life that she had forfeited I felt was something that she had earned in that moment.Voice acting-wise wise I felt that overall, the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or supporting characters. In particular, I felt that Sumire Uesaka, Tomori Kusunoki and Yoshitsugu Matsuoka all did an excellent job at portraying the key characters of Mia, Anne, and Abel respectively. Of the supporting cast, I really liked Kanon Takao and Nao Toyama’s portrayal of the characters Tiona and Rafina though I wished that the latter had much a larger role in the latter part of the narrative. Though only used sparingly within the series narrative I felt that Yuichiro Umehara and Makoto Furukawa also served admirably at portraying Mia’s head of finances Ludwig Hewitt and the commander of the princess guard Dion Alaia respectively roles that were just as important to Mia and the empire as she herself was to them. It was such a breath of fresh air to see Yuichiro step away from hunting down goblins and take up the mantle of managing numbers in an empire I have to say.Overall conclusionIn overall Tearmoon Empire I felt was an excellent anime that had among its main strong points an interesting premise, setting, characters, story and a very creative paring of not just a fictional representation of a time period that we seldom see within the anime medium in the form of the French revolution but also a cunningly wrought out what-if scenario as well that shows us what could potentially have happened if those at the top were able to redo their worst failings and not only stop their own death but also those that were dearest to them as well. While the time travel troupe in its current form is not one that’s used often within the anime medium its usage here, I felt proved to be an effective vehicle when it was paired with the series overall narrative that while making effective usage of the setting and the what if scenario was also overlaid with the genuine heartwarming bonding between Mia and her former enemies as she sought to change her fate by converting them to become her friends and allies that she can count upon.These bonding moments between Mia and the cast while sweet and fun to watch I felt was also complemented by the sense of tightrope walking that Mia had to contend with due to both the serious issues that she had to navigate in the form of the many crisis that she had to head off in her kingdom as well as choosing the best way to interact with the cast lest doom flags appear once more a balance that I felt was pretty well thought out as it forced Mia to use both her knowledge and the aid of her allies to make any kind of headway and in doing so simultaneously improving herself and her image to her allies while advancing forward on the plan. One aspect of the narrative that I felt was handled well was the exploration of flashpoints both within and outside of the empire that while relating well with regards to international diplomacy also served as an excellent way to expand the world and highlight their potential for trouble if left unchecked. These flashpoints I felt also served well to showcase the level of bonds of trust that had been forged between Mia and her peers in this timeline and through this show just how much had changed in this timeline as a result of Mia’s hard work.As a final overall score, I would say that Tearmoon Empire easily deserves an 8/10 for while on the surface it may look like your average fantasy themed anime with comedy elements what served to elevate this series above its peers in my eyes was not just its strong narrative that made creative usage of the combo of time travel and redoing of one’s life as Mia sought to change her fate by fixing her empire but its pairing with Mia’s battle on the emotional front as she sought to reforge the bonds of friendship and trust that had once connected her with her friends and former enemies for Mia knows full well the fell consequences of what would happen if she fails. This pairing of trying to achieve the practical goals and trying to avoid retreading the path of a tyrant with Mia’s desperate desire to convert her many former enemies into powerful new allies I felt within the narrative also synergized well with the comedy moments within the series. That while providing a nice contrast to Mia’s quest also provided us with the opportunity realize that despite this and her unique knowledge, she was still for all intents a 12-year-old girl that was trying her utmost to avoid taking the same grim path that would haunt a women twice her age. Being able to see Mia act more her age by having such silly thoughts and moments I felt provided a nice sense of reprieve from her goals and quests however brief they were. of anime.Taking place in a fictional representation of the ancient kingdom of Franch in the form of the powerful Tearmoon empire one that while boasting an impressive military, economy, land area and population was nonetheless one that found itself divided between the needs of its selfish rulers and their whimsical desires for greed and wastage of resources and the needs of the common folk who require food, jobs and a stable economy to which they can live safely in and in the process help the country grow.What would happen if one day this carefully maintained balance is shattered forever when the nobles at the top get it in their heads that their needs are far more important than the needs of the people that they are supposed to be ruling.

The show focuses heavier on comedy than anything else, but it has enough sprinkles of strategy, politics, drama and other things we would expect from a princess show.The real strength of this show is that it is a fun delve into these things rather than a serious one, but that may also serve as it's weakness. Tearmoon does not get too caught up in any big arcs or large plots. However, it is quite nice to see what happens, as because of the nature of Princess Mia, things do not always go quite...as planned, or as you may of thought.I think it's important to note that this will not be a show most people will give a 9 or 10, and it does not have amazing production value, but it is still a fun delve into this genre, and if you have been binging similar shows, or the otome/villainess genre, this one will be a fun watch. as planned, or as you may of thought.I think it's important to note that this will not be a show most people will give a 9 or 10, and it does not have amazing production value, but it is still a fun delve into this genre, and if you have been binging similar shows, or the otome/villainess genre, this one will be a fun watch."", ""An anime masterpiece!

MCs relationship with all of them also keeps growing with the story. We even have a normal and sweet romance track.In terms of story, i would say its just a little better than your average isekai. The setting is the usual middle ages europe kingdoms with aristocracy. Its the comedy and ridiculousness of MC, which keep us entertained.The first episode is mostly establishing the setup. So, i would recommend watching atleast three episodes before determining if you like this style of comedy. If not, then drop it.

But they slowly start growing on you as they all go through a lot of character development. They have their own convictions, beliefs and are continuously influenced by our MC\'s actions. MCs relationship with all of them also keeps growing with the story. We even have a normal and sweet romance track.In terms of story, i would say its just a little better than your average isekai. The setting is the usual middle ages europe kingdoms with aristocracy. Its the comedy and ridiculousness of MC, which keep us entertained.The first episode is mostly establishing the setup. So, i would recommend watching atleast three episodes before determining if you like this style of comedy. If not, then drop it. Although there is a ""greater"" plot going on in the background, its the comedy that always remains in focus.', 'These days, reincarnation stories are a dime a dozen. They\'ve become especially prevalent in the light novel scene, and seriously, so many of them are just bad, generic power fantasy isekai that are there to pander to the lowest common denominator. Luckily, while Tearmoon Empire is yet another reincarnation story, its not an isekai, instead taking inspiration from the tale of Marie Antoinette and asking the question ""What if a Marie Antoinette proxy had the chance to go back in time and remedy her mistakes?"" And thus, with this, Tearmoon Empire is born...though if my rating didn\'t clue you in, a good idea is nothing...if you don\'t execute it well, and in all honesty, Tearmoon Empire got off to a good start, but just became more and more generic by the end.20-year-old Mia Luna Tearmoon is set to die by the guillotine. Her selfishness has resulted in her empire falling to ruin at the hands of the citizens\' revolution. At this point, Mia is resigned to her fate, allowing death to take her...only the next thing she knows, she wakes up having gone back to being 12 years old. At first, Mia thinks the whole thing was just a bad dream, but seeing a bloody diary and all that her old self wrote in it confirms that it was indeed real. Not wanting to have her head chopped off yet again, armed with the knowledge that her old memories bestowed upon her, Mia decides to devote herself to rebuilding her empire and avoiding the mistakes she made in her old life...but not out of genuine kindness towards her citizens and peers. In Mia\'s mind, self-preservation and avoiding that damn guillotine is way more important! Thus, the once selfish, useless, cowardly princess works towards bettering the empire, and eventually herself, in the great struggle to save herself from death a second time.Obviously, the best part of the anime is Mia. The entire anime starts because of her flaws, and the entire series is about her overcoming her personality flaws and remedying the mistakes she made in her old life, even if her ulterior motives are still fairly self-centered. Furthermore, she doesn\'t magically become a better person the second she wakes up as a 12-year-old either: She has to really unlearn a lot of her old habits and is capable of regressing back to her old vain, haughty self, but her time in prison has given her some much needed perspective. Isn\'t that so much more interesting than yet another generic potato-kun who is so perfect that everybody worships the ground he walks on just because he exists? Or an irredeemable jackass who stays that way? Mia as a character carries the entire show because her previous actions inform the story\'s entire conflict, and even if she has moments where she acts like a cutesy anime girl, the fact that she does have tangible character flaws she needs to deal with makes her far more compelling than most.I wish that care had been extended to...well, the rest of the show. Oh, and I should inform you: If you\'re going into this show expecting it to be an all serious fantasy drama, you\'re just going to be disappointed because while it does have some serious moments, Tearmoon Empire is mainly a comedy. A lot of said comedy hinges on all the characters being too stupid to question Mia\'s actions or overthinking things too much, which, while it starts off funny at first, does get repetitive and tiring after three episodes. But even the comedy manages to be somewhat funny, because Tearmoon Empire utterly fails at delivering serious drama, mainly because not only is its animation too stiff, stagnant, and static to really convey the weight of its source material, relying way too much on still images and talking heads spouting political monologues, but none of the other characters are even remotely as compelling, interesting, or three-dimensional as Mia is. All of them are little more than bland, stock stereotypes that have been done way better in other media before this. Basically, Tearmoon Empire thinks its as good as Rose of Versailles when it really isn\'t. Oh, and did I mention that the show throws in God-awful CGI horses every chance it gets?! Seriously, those things are an abomination from Hell. Not to mention the CGI models used for ballroom dance sequences. Seriously, Tearmoon, you really ought to take a page from Frieren: Beyond Journey\'s End if you want to animate two people dancing. Or its animation in general. Also, Tearmoon, did we really need extended sequences of a naked 12-year-old using the bath?So in the end, Tearmoon Empire is an anime adaptation whose staff was just too immature and inexperienced to make this work. Mia is a great protagonist here, but I doubt anyone looking for anything more substantial will want to watch Tearmoon Empire just for Mia alone.

OVERALL I really enjoyed this film and would recommend it to anyone.', 'EDIT: This is an older review and my reviewing skills were pretty meh back then so take this with a grain of saltI was interested in this movie since I am a Tibetan myself, so I watched it with my family yesterday.Story: 7/10Nothing really new, just the same tale of a lad meeting a dog that changes his life. It was interesting that there was a ""devil"" killing many people thoughArt: 8/10The art style reminds me of a Ghibli film. It\'s charming and approachable. I also really think the landscapes were especially well designed...Sound: 6/10It was alright. Had some traditional Tibetan music but nothing really else. The VA\'s were decentCharacter: 6/10The characters were decent as well.Enjoyment: 8/10It was fun seeing all the Tibetan cultural references.

I would definitely recommend this.Score: 8.3/10 (rounded to 8/10)', 'Tibet Inu Monogatari\xa0is a Madhouse film from 2011. Yes, Madhouse. The studio that can make things as good as Rainbow and Monster but also things as rubbish as anime X-men or Highschool of the Dead. I never know what to expect from them just because their quality does vary so greatly that I can honestly say they\'ve made some of the best and some of the worst anime I\'ve ever seen.Story:Our narrative opens with a youngster named Tianjin being moved up to the mountains of Tibet as his mother just passed and that\'s where his father is. He quickly forms a bond with a golden-furred...Tibetan Mastiff that he calls Duoji Yongzhi. Things become complicated for the duo when Duoji is accused of being responsible for a string of attacks against villagers and animals.The biggest down side of the film is just that the climax gets a bit ridiculous, almost imbuing Douji with supernatural abilities. The arc is also going to be really obvious for adults. Which I\'ll mostly excuse because it is a family film.On the positive side, the whole emphasis on the bond between this young boy and his dog does work well. It leads to some strong, heart-warming moments. When the adult characters are arguing about what they should do, they do bring up some solid points that makes it feel like a legitimate discussion. The film also does take some risks and ends up involving a lot more death than you\'d see in most family films. It may not be enough to make the narrative surprising, but it does make it a bit different and it\'s nice to see Madhouse execute something like that in a subdued fashion.Characters:For the most part, the main characters are a bit shallow but kind of endearing and the side characters are very much there for a function.\xa0There are some interesting character dynamics. Like the tension betwixt Tianjin and his dad or the rivalry between his dad and the old woman who sells snake oil. Which do serve to elevate some of the cast so they\'re above the regular archetypes.The biggest problem is that there\'s a particular character who loses all sense of reason and perspective at the climax of the film so that he can go full antagonist. His actions before that point all make sense even if they\'re misguided but at the climax he just says ""I\'m not going to pay any attention to what I\'m seeing here because I stubbornly refuse to be redeemable.""Art:The artwork is pretty great. The nature scenes look great. The animals are really detailed and look like what they\'re supposed to. Which means the dogs are super cute. The characters look good. About the one complaint I have is that the monster they\'re chasing down kind of just looks like a big, black blob with teeth and eyes. A stronger, more detailed design would have worked wonders, I think.Sound:The acting is well handled. It is in Mandarin, which is an odd choice on Madhouse\'s part. Maybe they were going for that sweet Chinese market that\'s so lucrative for media developers. The music is well done. There are some really nice scenes with flute playing.Ho-yay:There isn\'t any to be had.Areas of Improvement:1. Tone down the climax to fit better in with the rest of the film. Seriously, most of the film seems like it could take place in a real world setting. Then we get supernatural elements and absurdities in the climax.2. Have the particular character I\'ve already talked about actually believe his own senses.3. Give your monster a stronger design.Final Thoughts:Tibet Inu Monogatari\xa0is a pretty solid, enjoyable film. It has a few issues, but they don\'t detract from it too much.

The sound was pretty decent, nothing to special in my opinion.Now onto the story, overall it was a pretty realistic story, we got  a bond between a dog and Tenzin. Halfway through the movie the realism slowly fades away as the big evil appears, without having any purpose for being evil. The setup for certain things were great, such as showing the strained relation between Tenzin and his dad, but we never delved much into these as they are either...left open or never told at all. There are also some nice moments where we see some bonding between dogs but also between the dog and Tenzin.We got a wide variarity of characters. While this may sound good, it is in my opinion not fully fleshed out. At the start of the movie we clearly see Tenzin and his dad acting like complete strangers where big evil suddenly appears we never delve much further into this. The bond of our main dog and Tenzin felt a bit short despite them having grown a great relation where they would risk their lives for each other. We also got some bandits who were just temporary evil.The animation for this movie was really impressive, nice scenery fitting the naritive, the characters are all unique despite their being so many. This definitely holds up to modern standards.If you love movies about dogs, then this is definitely a movie for you. I you want a realistic movie without any fantasy creatures, then I must warn you that there will be one in this movie.

But more credit goes to the antagonist like Enigma whom I\'m glad he got what he deserve, Jin whom at first we though was the victim but turned out to be  Orpheus and Ratsel who played as a very formidable opponent of Kaito, which in the end she got saved by the latter.Enjoyment: very enjoyable and that all I have to say.Puzzle time is over.', 'Puzzle Time...Let\'s begin.1.

Ok no more fucking around, here are my ratings for each of this anime\'s category:Outstanding 10:Story: Despite of the usual protagonist has to solve puzzle king of thing , it was still outstanding since in every plot things get leveled up, as if the anime itself get renewed with the twist that come around as the protagonist gets to faced different adversary. Also, the story itself is a puzzle as to which we the audience empathize with the characters predicament of solving puzzles, there is also the part that it gives us audience such desire that the adversary goes down with the puzzle, but in this third sequel the plot thickens as the protagonist has to go against the person he cares about, which basically adds to this anime\'s excitement.Overall: I\'d probably say, that this anime is way too outstanding since it did end in a good note.Poor 3.Art: I\'d never understand as to what\'s with Kaito\'s gangsta look? He kind of looks like a delinquent who always has a bad hair day.

Ok no more fucking around, here are my ratings for each of this anime\'s category:Outstanding 10:Story: Despite of the usual protagonist has to solve puzzle king of thing , it was still outstanding since in every plot things get leveled up, as if the anime itself get renewed with the twist that come around as the protagonist gets to faced different adversary. Also, the story itself is a puzzle as to which we the audience empathize with the characters predicament of solving puzzles, there is also the part that it gives us audience such desire that the adversary goes down with the puzzle, but in this third sequel the plot thickens as the protagonist has to go against the person he cares about, which basically adds to this anime\'s excitement.Overall: I\'d probably say, that this anime is way too outstanding since it did end in a good note.Poor 3.Art: I\'d never understand as to what\'s with Kaito\'s gangsta look? He kind of looks like a delinquent who always has a bad hair day. Gamon, on the other hand looks like some biker dude who has an S & M fetish, Nonoha, though she looks hot in her school uniform, her hair style is horrible. You know what, whoever is the illustrator of this series probably has a hair problem as well, co\'z nearly every main character in this ""Phi Brain"" serial looks like they\'re having a bad hair day. Also Ratsel outfit, I just don\'t know what to make of it, she kind look  more like a circus performer than anything else.Mediocre 5.I just don\'t have anything to comment about the VA\'s nor the opening and closing songs.Very Good 8.Character: though, Kaito is great, he kinda annoys me since he never notices Nonoha\'s feelings for him, also, though I like his ""can do"" attitude, his fashion sense is horrible, then again his character is outstanding as he plays as to what was expected of him. About Nonoha, I kind like that she plays like a mom figure to Kaito despite of being the same age as he is, now only if Kaito would notice her feelings for him, Gamon.....well he is ok, and so as Cubik,  Ana, Rook, Freecell, Elena, the Principal and Souji. But more credit goes to the antagonist like Enigma whom I\'m glad he got what he deserve, Jin whom at first we though was the victim but turned out to be  Orpheus and Ratsel who played as a very formidable opponent of Kaito, which in the end she got saved by the latter.Enjoyment: very enjoyable and that all I have to say.Puzzle time is over.', 'Puzzle Time...Let\'s begin.1. What kind of pillar that moves?2. Why is 6 afraid of 7?3. What is the only letter in the alphabet that you can drink either hot or with lemon and ice?4.

Also Ratsel outfit, I just don\'t know what to make of it, she kind look  more like a circus performer than anything else.Mediocre 5.I just don\'t have anything to comment about the VA\'s nor the opening and closing songs.Very Good 8.Character: though, Kaito is great, he kinda annoys me since he never notices Nonoha\'s feelings for him, also, though I like his ""can do"" attitude, his fashion sense is horrible, then again his character is outstanding as he plays as to what was expected of him. About Nonoha, I kind like that she plays like a mom figure to Kaito despite of being the same age as he is, now only if Kaito would notice her feelings for him, Gamon.....well he is ok, and so as Cubik,  Ana, Rook, Freecell, Elena, the Principal and Souji. But more credit goes to the antagonist like Enigma whom I\'m glad he got what he deserve, Jin whom at first we though was the victim but turned out to be  Orpheus and Ratsel who played as a very formidable opponent of Kaito, which in the end she got saved by the latter.Enjoyment: very enjoyable and that all I have to say.Puzzle time is over. Ok, so enough of that, before I get accuse of trolling, but if anybody who\'s reading this is smart enough then he\'s one heck of a smart guy. So the third sequel of Phi Brain has ended, and for sure this would be the last sequel, unless studio Sunrise and NHK changes their mind....which I highly doubt, since it would conflict as to what has already transpired. Ok no more fucking around, here are my ratings for each of this anime\'s category:Outstanding 10:Story: Despite of the usual protagonist has to solve puzzle king of thing , it was still outstanding since in every plot things get leveled up, as if the anime itself get renewed with the twist that come around as the protagonist gets to faced different adversary. Also, the story itself is a puzzle as to which we the audience empathize with the characters predicament of solving puzzles, there is also the part that it gives us audience such desire that the adversary goes down with the puzzle, but in this third sequel the plot thickens as the protagonist has to go against the person he cares about, which basically adds to this anime\'s excitement.Overall: I\'d probably say, that this anime is way too outstanding since it did end in a good note.Poor 3.Art: I\'d never understand as to what\'s with Kaito\'s gangsta look? He kind of looks like a delinquent who always has a bad hair day.
