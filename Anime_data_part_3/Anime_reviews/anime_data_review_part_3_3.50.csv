Devils Line: Anytime Anywhere,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37997/Devils_Line__Anytime_Anywhere,"[""First of all: if you don't know the background to this OVA, i.e. if you haven't watched the Devils Line series, it's utterly pointless to start with this one since you just won't understand it. This is nothing but an extra episode which barely develops the plot and adds almost nothing to the continuation of the story. It is not a stand-alone, but it's basically made of several flashbacks which are very useful to explain and elaborate Anzai's past, a topic which isn't well covered in the regular series.The general quality (animation, art, etc.) is the same as the previous episodes. It's a good,...enjoyable OVA that develops the almost untold story of the main character and it's nice to have something more from a 12 episodes anime like this that helps you understand what happened before the events shown in the main series. Recommended if you liked Devils Line and you want a little bit more of it. enjoyable OVA that develops the almost untold story of the main character and it's nice to have something more from a 12 episodes anime like this that helps you understand what happened before the events shown in the main series.

Huo Feng Liao Yuan,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41220/Huo_Feng_Liao_Yuan,"[""HUO FENG LIAO YUAN/THE RAVAGES OF TIME/火鳳燎原 IS AN ACCLAIMED TRUE MASTERPIECE !!!!!Watch in on Bilibili official youtube channel. The Caption subs on youtube are much better than the fansubs this time.I have so much feeling for it being an ROTK story (Romance of the Three Kingdoms). Chan Mou took on Luo Guanzhong himself, when he rewrote and recreated this most beloved, long and interesting, part of Chinese history in his manhua. Chan Mou’s writing of Three Kingdoms in The Ravages of Time is absolutely BRILLIANT !!!!!!It is wise to learn more about the Three Kingdoms and people of that time whether with Dynasty...Warriors, ROTK (TV Series), The Novel, an ROTK background video, or reading about ROTK online. The Three Kingdoms is a period during the late Han dynasty in China of massive internal conflicts and war between warlords.The tide of this era in the Ravages of Time goes into motion as Yuan Shao and the Coalition battles Dong Zhuo and his forces. The Ravages of Time while based on ROTK has also very original content and characters. It opens with Liaoyuan Huo, leader of the Handicapped Warriors, an assassin group. The assassin group working for Sima Yi destroys Xu Lin, the number 1 strategist in Dong Zhuo’s army. Lu Bu swears revenge on the person who killed his friend Xu Lin. Liaoyuan Huo is the raging storm. His fighting strength to take on Lu Bu, they would be classified as monsters.By the character visions, you really understand much more to the characters and there are more than meets the eyes. To Yuan Shao, people are trodding into the mire because Dong Zhuo wrecked the country. Dong Zhuo’s ideology is supremely good. Traitor? What is a traitor? The country is weak because of high-position corrupt officials building up power for themselves. To cleanse them is to save the country. Dong Zhuo is precisely who we need, I like this Dong Zhuo and root for him. Dong Zhuo has historically been a treacherous man that wants to take everything for himself. While following his character in history, he surfaces more than just power and ambition here. Dong Zhuo brings a deep profound stance to defending why the world needs him.Lu Bu I thought I knew the person Lu Bu was. I am well understood Lu Bu was ambitious and a capricious man, greed and power buys him. In the Ravages of Time, it’s not enough to know the enemy cause you don’t know the enemy. Lu Bu is the hype and upcoming. As the audience, we are not ready for this Lu Bu. Lu Bu is ready to kill and leaves nothing undone. Rumors of this legend is face him and be killed. That’s what we know. Rumors have not said about Lu Bu, the amounts of feints in him in a mystery. The strongest warrior with a swing of his halberd and unpredictable intellect makes him so fearsome. He is a champion that can back it.From the facts of history, I can't imagine how it would be to see Dong Zhuo and Lu Bu's inevitable downfall in the Ravages of Time.Hua Xiong was a strong warrior loyal to Dong Zhuo. The human nature of Lu Bu, Hua Xiong never gave this thought in the ROTK novels. We know what he really feels in the Ravages of Time. Dong Zhuo, I think you're nurturing a snake in your bosom. (Which is different from ROTK, Dong Zhuo here knows about Lu Bu BTW LOL) Wen Chou, another character was really expanded on and his heroic fight to charge and break the siege for Yuan Shao when surrounded and fight Lu Bu (which never happened in ROTK).The story is so amazing and the donghua adapted the first Dong Zhuo/Lu Bu section immaculately. The 3D art designs and animation are so crisp, perfect epic badass looking, and cinematically beautiful. Whoever complaining, has obviously not seen the prototype promotional video LOL The action fights and politics are definitely a win.The opening has taken me aback by just how epic it is, the song with the choice of clips. The ending is also a fantastic song. I LOVE THE VOICE ACTING especially Lu Bu and Dong Zhuo.The Ravages of Time is in the same lore with ROTK. The Ravages of Time was done for you people who want to experience ROTK from the start again.We need more people seeing this MASTERPIECE !!!!!! THE DONGHUA IS ALSO EPIC TO WATCH !!!!!!!!

Well not bad exactly, but definitely as average as many other 3D donghua out there. Compared to other 2D action donghua that has gained some fame in recent years like Wu Shan Wu Xing, these visuals will surely be underwhelming. It’s even worse when compared with the action anime that were airing at the same time that this series...came out, like Jigokuraku, Kimetsu no Yaiba or Jujutsu Kaisen, to name a few. Heck, Aiyou de Mishi is a non-action 2D donghua that aired at the same time as this and it looked way better. When paired with all those competitors out there, and even with its own source material, which doesn’t look exactly great either but it’s visually still pretty good, this show ranks at the very bottom when it comes to visuals, as it looks like the cinematics from a PS3 videogame.Everything from its artwork, backgrounds, special effects and not very expressive and quite stiff and similarly looking character models, looks rather fake. Better than anime with bad CGI but certainly way worse than anime with good CGI. The motions during fights are not bad actually, and the choreography of those battles are quite good, but the shaky angles don’t let you see what’s happening in the clearest way either.Not to say that there aren’t any visually good and interestingly directed moments in it, especially in the last episode, but those are very few in a pile of mediocrity. Normally I wouldn’t pay much attention to that, but The Ravages of Time is a heavy action work, especially in its beginning, and action needs good production and presentation, something that isn’t present here and makes for an important flaw.As for the sound, the sound effects also range from weak to quite good, resulting in another just mediocre result. The voice acting also comes off as average, although I blame it a little on what the script is like at the beginning of the manhua, not allowing to show much more of the characters other than everyone coming off as a badasss. With that said, still, almost every character sounds very similar to the others within an age the same or close to theirs, with the only exception being the feminine looking characters, that still sound alike as well, thus this aspect is also mediocre. The music in the other hand is quite good and fitting for its series, even the opening and ending, an epic song and a ballad respectively, both with traditional Chinese music vibes. That is also important when dealing with an historical show, and a detail that anime pay less and less attention as time passes it seems (Golden Kamuy, Vinland Saga, Rurouni Kenshin remake, for examples), but this is not the place to talk about that.Even if you strip it of its dressing, the meat is not the best thing in this series either. What you probably heard or read about The Ravages of Time during all these years is that it is a super detailed and smart look at The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, focusing on highlights and equal time dedicated for every major character, strong characterization for everyone, military strategies and tactics, mind games and very well written sociopolitical and ideological discussions, while still being an overall faithful adaptation, even if it still has its new twists and dimensions for the characters on its own. And the thing is, all of that is present within the manhua, yes, but not so much in the beginning, and even less in the donghua, where the subtitles of the adaptation are simplified and not as detailed as what you can find when you read the source material.Not to say that the series so far is poorly written, and it has some of that good elements, while also building up and anticipating plot points and character dynamics that will be important later on, but it also suffers strongly from two major issues that remain present during the entirety of the original work, although not as much as what has been shown here. The first one is that, although necessary for the coherent and cohesive whole and for future events, some of its chapters and now also episodes are simply not as interesting nor as packed as others. Not a major problem, but one worth mentioning.The other bigger issue is how in the beginning, The Ravages of Time is full of something that never goes completely away and that works against it in its intention of portraying a serious and detailed look at these historical events, which is the dick measuring, especially in the beginning. This aspect is present on two forms, with the first one being the excessive amount of rule of cool. Although every character is presented as cool and badass, and has good enough highlights, spotlight and their time to shine, thus seemingly being presented fairly and equally, this also results on way too much spectacle, to the point where the series stops being believable. This is particularly true for the heavily plot armored Huo Liaoyuan, one of the two main characters and protagonists, who is so un-killable he might as well be a supernatural being in a setting where everyone else is an overpowered human, but still feels like a human.The other form of dick measuring is the many HAHA GOTCHA moments present in the beginning of the story, affecting even the credibility of the many plans within plans and strategies within strategies of the characters, because of both how sometimes they are explained as they happen, instead of before their execution, and for how much the characters are able to see far ahead, somehow even manipulating circumstances they don’t have any control of.Anyways, here are the important aspects of this particular season:-The story begins somewhere between the end of the Yellow Turban rebellion and the rise of Dong Zhuo, his coup d’état and tyrannical government.-This first season doesn’t have an ending, the conclusion of the former point should be shown on a possible continuation.-Although important, none of the main characters of the novel and other adaptations are the protagonists here. The series is shown primarily from the perspective of Sima Yi, who plans events and manipulate others for the sake of what he thinks is right and to make profits out of the conflict, and Huo Liaoyuan, an assassin and both a friend and underling of the former.-Some characters are presented differently than in many other adaptations of the same events and novel: Dong Zhuo is not a goofy senile old man or an impulsive and easy to fool madman, Liu Bei is not a saint, as he is willing to do questionable things for what he thinks is the greater good, Zhang Fei and Lu Bu are not just brutes, they are quite smart, the latter is even put on the same level as the main tacticians of the conflict, and Zhao Zilong and Diaochan are just two alternative names of two major characters in this show.-Although this season only shown them just in name, a big part of the whole story is dedicated to a group of students of Sima Hui and future military advisors that work for the major generals, referred as The Eight Geniuses. The only one highlighted so far was the first, Yuan Fang, an original character working for and related to Yuan Shao.-An important original character that stands out enough to be worth mentioning on his own is Xiao Meng, an eunuch, assassin, and the best archer out of the whole cast. If the adaptation keeps going on, he will become one of the best cross-dressing and androgynous characters in the whole medium.-Cao Cao was teased but he did not appear yet, he might in a possible next season.In conclusion, this first season of the adaptation of one of the most praised manhuas is great in ideas but just decent in execution. The production, presentation, aesthetics and atmosphere range just from mediocre to decent at best, the characters are more imposing and cool than deep or very well written, the core story is good but there is too much silliness for the sake of spectacle in it, and it feels like a setup for future events with no form of conclusion in any way. Even the possible continuation will have many of this issues as well. Worth checking out for being the starting point and a promise for something far bigger and better to possibly come out who knows when, if even, which makes it look like the usual overhype of the fanboys of a fighting shounen that say that it is average or slightly above average in the beginning, yet it becomes much better later on. If you are not willing to go through that for this season and even the hypothetical next one, I suggest checking out the source material if you haven’t, it is very long, very detailed, quite the challenging read, and very anti mainstream in its approach, but very rewarding for those who are patient with it, but only after a while, as it is the seinen and true version of “IT GETS VERY GOOD AFTER 40 CHAPTERS AND ALL OF ITS ALMOST 600 (so far, and still far from over) CHAPTERS ARE IMPORTANT GUYS, I SWEAR”. came out, like Jigokuraku, Kimetsu no Yaiba or Jujutsu Kaisen, to name a few. Heck, Aiyou de Mishi is a non-action 2D donghua that aired at the same time as this and it looked way better.

Furusato Saisei: Nippon no Mukashibanashi,https://myanimelist.net/anime/13163/Furusato_Saisei__Nippon_no_Mukashibanashi,"[""If like to learn about other culture tales, and in this case Japanese Folktales, you will probably enjoy this show.The first thing you must have in mind is that the target public of this show is children. So if are expecting for something very elaborated that's not your show. With that in mind, let's go to the review.The tales are like Aesop's fables, with a strong allegoric and moral background. But at the same time are simple. This simplicity is reinforced by the way the story is told, with clear and direct language since the narrator to characters.The sound goes well with the animation,...and if you decide just to listen to it you can 'see' what is going on. Both OP and ED are kind of sad and doesn't match with the show.The art is also simple and clearly directed to children, but it is still beautiful and full of very well selected colors. Each character has a different design. The animation  is economic, but fits the purposes of the show.If you like folktales and learn about Japanese culture you will enjoy very much watching Furusato. And even this childish style of the whole series will seem very appropriate to you. and if you decide just to listen to it you can 'see' what is going on.

And even this childish style of the whole series will seem very appropriate to you."", ""This has the feel of a show for young children. Similar to an adaptation of Aesop's fables for westerners, this anime tells traditional Japanese stories that have a strong moral aspect.The art is unusual and reminds me of My Neighbours the Yamadas (Studio Ghibli). The sound also emphasises the children's show aspect with 'noises' for walking and so forth. The opening and ending songs are sugary and nothing special.Each episode consists of two or three tales and I think that character development is good for such a short delivery time. These are excellent stories told by a narrator in the style of bed-time story,...so sometimes the animation can feel unnecessary.All that said, this anime is very enjoyable and I'm sure that many of these tales are referenced in other anime and manga. It is interesting to draw cultural comparisons between various culture's moral tales, and I am looking forward to learning more, despite the fact that this is a show for young children.PS:Excellent if you are learning Japanese, as the language seems much simpler. so sometimes the animation can feel unnecessary.All that said, this anime is very enjoyable and I'm sure that many of these tales are referenced in other anime and manga.

Sometimes 2 but usually 3.Each story uses a different art style. Some look similar but they're almost always different....The art styles range from striking to bizarre.Sound wise the show uses the same music thoughout and the voices are provided by the same cast (sometimes the narrator). It's easy to learn some Japanese from the show as it uses repetition since its aimed at children.The stories involve Azuchi (1400s) and Edo period (1500s-1600s) Japan usually sometimes even earlier. Usually involving poor peasants or naughty children.The stories range from well known and popular such as Urashima Taro to obscure such as the rat in the city.They almost always contain a moral and happy ending.The narrators vary between an old man and a woman.The stories are always PG as they're aimed at children but there are demons and dark elements like cannibalism involved. Nothing graphic but suggested.As Japan is very Buddhist, Buddhism as well as Shintoism is incorporated into the stories often.If you enjoy Japanese culture and history and want something light but also interestingI recommend it. However there is no English dub availableSo if you can't read or dislike it then you're out of luck.And once again, this IS aimed at children so don't expect any violence or anything graphic.It's a cute and charming series that I suggest you watch if you're interested in Japanese folklore or mythology.

D.C.S.S: Da Capo Second Season,https://myanimelist.net/anime/291/DCSS__Da_Capo_Second_Season,"[""This is the review for Da Capo second season, the second of the DC series...I write this review based on the knowledge that people have seen Da Capo, but i'll try my best not to spoil anything from the first season.(For this review i'll refer to Da capo as DC and Da Capo Second season as DCSS)Story (8):I'd say the storyline is pretty average. DCSS's storyline can be split into two halves. first half of DCSS focuses on character building and linking the 2 seasons together. Pretty much filler episodes.The second half is pumped with drama.While I reckon the second half was awesome,...I can't deny that the first half was pretty boring. So can't really give the full score here.Art (8):The art is decent quality. Possibly due to the change in animators, the animation from DC and DCSS was a bit different and maybe a bit hard to get use to at the start, but dosen't really matter. The animation is nothing special, not much GC and simple 2D styled.Sound (10):The background music wasn't exactly special, but it suited the anime. The OP was awesome (downloaded it after the 1st episode) and the ED is not bad. Didn't actually listen to the second ED so can't really comment on that...Character (9)the return of the original cast of characters was a good. The new main bishoujo (Aisia), which was pretty much the head of the series, was a bit painful to watch at the first half but redeemed herself during the second half. The new cast of Haremettes were a bit too stereotype for my liking and their identity lacked depth, possibly due to the lack of airing time they have.Due to the new haremetts, it feels like there were too much deredere in the series so the balance of characters weren't as good as DC.Enjoyment: (8)The start was a bit painful to watch, but the end turned out to be really good.Some might argue that the drama is not evenly distributed, but I enjoyed it.This one is definitely for those that are die-hard idealized romance fans. (raise hand) I can't deny that the first half was pretty boring. So can't really give the full score here.Art (8):The art is decent quality.

The new main bishoujo (Aisia), which was pretty much the head of the series, was a bit painful to watch at the first half but redeemed herself during the second half. The new cast of Haremettes were a bit too stereotype for my liking and their identity lacked depth, possibly due to the lack of airing time they have.Due to the new haremetts, it feels like there were too much deredere in the series so the balance of characters weren't as good as DC.Enjoyment: (8)The start was a bit painful to watch, but the end turned out to be really good.Some might argue that the drama is not evenly distributed, but I enjoyed it.This one is definitely for those that are die-hard idealized romance fans. (raise hand)"", ""D.C.S.S. is a good sequel for the first season. The drama here is a bit better and some good surprises await the first season viewers, but the fun was disappointingly decreased. It's not much of a comedy anymore, still, it's definitely a must watch, specially for people who liked Da Capo.The story is very good. Although some things were disappointingly removed from the first season, It still starts out fine and then ends very well. Eventhough a bit boring, it's also plotted with surprises to make up for it.The art was disappointing since some characters were remodeled. The main character did look better but his...looks were completely changed that it felt weird like he was a completely different character. Another complaint is Mako, she definitely looked worse in this season and also Kotori and Miharu and Moe. I think almost all the character drawings degraded, same goes for the petal wither animation. Anyway, everything still looked fine and it was able to cling to the good side.The sounds were okay. The sounds are not that appealing but it's still good. The characters still had same, nice voices.The characters are not much but they do the job. There were some unnecessary support character additions, and the inadequate presentation for them made it worse. They don't even have a decent introduction. However, there are a few behavior improvements on the previous main characters which makes them more mature and less annoying. And Suginami still evades Mako's punches impressively. Plus, the new girl Aisia gives more story background, and further widens the world of Da Capo despite her clueless and annoyingly stubborn character. All in all, the overall cast is still fine at the very least.The second season is definitely not funny anymore but it focused more on having better drama and some surprises are setup to make viewers watch more.

The last one I hated this badly was Maburaho and that was a long time ago, so you can tell I am very open-minded of most anime as I say I am. But, unlike that, this one gave me NOTHING to work with and I\'m sorry if you are a fan of this anime going through reviews, thinking all of them will be peachy-keen. But, this one won\'t be and, sadly, I can not find a single thing good about it. And here is...why.WARNING: The entirety of this review is mainly one big spoiler, so read at your own risk. Almost entirely similar to the last one, except it has no moments that any casual newcomer can read.Right off the bat, this website NOW puts this anime into Comedy. But, it is NOT at all; for the most part. And, it\'s delivery of comedy was really stale in comparison to the first. But, let me get segregate this review into two sections. Firstly, the characters. Oh man, I wanted this to be saved for last, but I can not hold it off, as it does effect those who watched the first season. And, know the word ""cliché""? Get used to it for now.Remember Junichi, that guy with the hazel hair? That guy that had the soft personality, was really funny and had a generally different atmosphere from most male protagonists? Well, say goodbye to that, because he was retooled to match the hair color of his comedic friend, Suginami, and was given a cliché male protagonist personality where he can literally not explain a misunderstanding like his life depends on it, is constantly smacked around and only is respected in the serious moments. However, he had his moments in this one, but they were far from often like his hazel haired counterpart. He was also given a light facelift that ruined the soft nature of his look that he had before. Despite all this, he had the funniest parts in the anime, for the very little comedy it had; and his character didn\'t dilute nearly as much as the next one I\'m about to bring up.This time, not Sakura; oh no. We are talking about NEMU. Now, this cuts right into my next section altogether, due to how much I hate this girl. Nemu single-handedly hogged Junichi for herself through the entire anime...and no, I don\'t mean they just hungout a lot.If you remembered from my last review, she is Junichi\'s ""sister"" which means she grew up with him and, well, hogged him. I am not going to lie, I hate this more than most hate (...) because, well (...), they didn\'t meet until much later in their lives. So, they did not have the bond that normal siblings have. Don\'t really want to list the anime name or any references to it, due to its controversial nature. It does unfortunately make my review look a big lop-sided here, but it is just too significant to bring up.However, to regress back to the prior topic, Junichi and Nemu pretty much WERE siblings, even if they weren\'t by blood. I know they said that cheesy line where they were ""hiding their love by being siblings"" but, can\'t any pair of siblings say that? No, they were siblings; I don\'t care how they phrase it. Sibling love is still too different from normal love. It is true that sibling love is actually one step away from normal love, given it is all of the benefits (in a good relationship) without the sex. So, just stepping up one more pretty much qualifies as lovers.However, Nemu\'s ill behavior towards Junichi really stirred some anger in my heart and reminded me they felt like siblings trying to have a family of their own. If you couldn\'t tell already, this season gave us THREE new female leads to, once again, fall in love with Junichi; seemingly out of nowhere as it seems, and pretty much turned it into a generic harem. But, tried to balance it with at least one new male, though he is significantly less important than Suginami in the end. He is definitely filler at best, since he has no altercations to the story; of which, Suginami hogs that spotlight himself in a few major points. Speaking of, I like how his character is nearly untouched from his season one counterpart.Anyway, to further bag on Nemu, you can tell both her and Junichi have a sibling relationship. I know in some anime the lovers have a hate period, but Nemu hates him the ENTIRE time. Their kind moments are only in the serious ones, but Nemu effectively treats him badly for the most part. Take into consideration how any other girl would do the same, for now I will list Kotori as she seemed to be the most competitive to Junichi\'s affection, and Nemu is not hot stuff anymore.In my opinion, that OVA was the TRUE ending to this anime. Kotori deserved to be with Junichi and it shows. She treats him nicely, is not a total bitch to him like Nemu and is more deserving of his love. Nemu is the kind of nice person that assumes her nice deeds should always be re-payed. And, well that isn\'t necessarily bad, if you think someone has to pay you for EVERY nice deed you do for them, then that is just you being selfish and not nice at all.But, to not put all this pressure on Nemu, I will say this much about Junichi himself. He is a lazy slob, had to have the help of his friends to get to school on time EVERY day and forgets things a lot. However, he is a very innocent male lead that, if given less pressure to explain things, does so very well. And, well, he usually never lies about it. He has been shown to be much more perverted in this anime, to add yet another cliché to the mix; but they only did the one time for some comedy with Aisia. I would dedicate a portion here to Aisia herself, but I don\'t want to write about this anime for long.But, I should probably bring up Sakura, shouldn\'t I? Well, the reason I didn\'t is because, well, the anime does something similar. She doesn\'t show up until the anime is almost over and her significance to the story is to just add another wizard to the mix to give Aisia some guilt about her magic. But, she is left unchanged, which plays a MAJOR role in the story if you are a very in-depth listener.I\'m just going to come clean and say it, though. I will dedicate just a LITTLE bit of this review to Aisia, but only towards her main goal. Halfway through the anime, she notices that Kotori liked Junichi, but was baffled that Nemu had him all to herself; similar to me. So, she wished as hard as she could to the withered cherry tree that Junichi and Nemu would remain in a sibling relationship. In the end, this was the ending I wanted and so I was cheering Aisia on the ENTIRE time and was happy that this anime might have a good ending. Sakura tried to stop her, but failed (and I was just living it up right there) miserably.Why? Well, you remember how Sakura was not a grown women? Tick, tick, tick, DING! That\'s right, the magic in that cherry tree is STILL there because Sakura is not a grown women as she should have became after the tree withered; hinting it still had a breadth of life left within. She even references this herself to Junichi because she thought ""he would like her better that way"" or something, which means that she never let go of it entirely herself. I picked up on it right away, which horrified me because the story did get to me in a way. I didn\'t think I would have caught onto a reference that wasn\'t even brought up until one of the last episodes. In fact, I don\'t think it was ever brought up, hinting that you really just had to be listening to the anime to know for sure. I did, and was right, as the tree was saved.To summarize everything, though, I have no good merits for this anime as it was Cliché City the ENTIRE time. The guy ends up with the main girl, whom is the bitchiest of all the girls; the plan of the opposing protagonist failed and so forth. I can only recommend this to first time anime viewers, as you wouldn\'t catch onto its nature. But, if you are an anime veteran and have been watching many for years, this one won\'t be good at all. It also forces down a lot of ""sad"" moments at you that don\'t do it justice as well as the first season did.Well I already said this review would be all spoilers, there is one in particular that I do not wish to reveal for season one fans that want to finish up the anime. So, I will mask it with a warning, as I enjoyed it a lot; one of the few things I actually DID like about the anime.(SPOILER BEGIN)If I had to pick the one thing I enjoyed most about this anime, Misaki was it. It was the perfect reference to season one and only those that watched it will know who this girl is right away. I loved it so much because this girl was so subtle in her dialogue, but she was so discrete with who she was that it was hard for me to pick up the pieces. But, when I did, I realized she had the SAME last name as Yoriko.So, yes, Misaki is the girl that Yoriko explored the world for. You know, that girl in the window from the VERY first episode of Da Capo. It was truly heartwarming to see her again, and that she remembered everything about Junichi. I never knew why she didn\'t greet him again, but perhaps it might have been because that would require, you know, GOOD writing to achieve. I wish she did, but it was very nice to see her again either way. It warmed my heart.(SPOILER END)So, I would stay away from this one at all costs. It\'s not even worth it to watch this season, as it will end the way you expect it to. You know, where Junichi and Nemu get MARRIED. Oh, and apparently, a little baby boy grew up to be a little girl. I never understood that at all, but it made me laugh. One of the few moments of this anime that was funny WASN\'T during an intended comedy scene, how quaint. why.WARNING: The entirety of this review is mainly one big spoiler, so read at your own risk.

We've got a new main character - Aisia, who fits well into the Da Capo universe.  At the same time some of the secondary characters from the first season take a more prominent role.  The first half introduces characters and ties it together with the first season, the second half is more drama and story related.So it sounds like a great recipe for success but yet i feel disappointed.  The dramatic parts dont work nearly as well as the first season whilst the...drama and story are simply too predictable.  You'll find more romance in this season, which is surprising as DCSS also takes on a more harem style - the girls dote over Junichi a little too much, Junichi on the other hand is more useless than ever.  On the positive side though, our new character Aisia works well, and whilst she's not perfect she holds this anime together.  What i liked most though was that this season helped me to understand the concept of Da Capo's first season much better.The animation is ok.  The OP, ED, inserts and voices are all fantastic.  The characters are difficult to judge as some of them are excellent, others seem to exist for the sole purpose of having a running gag and others get some character building and are then more or less forgotten.  But that said they are all quite likeable.Overall DCSS is good, it's easy to watch and will keep you interested but really it's just standard fare and all too predictable.

The first couple of episodes put a mysterious girl into Junichi\'s household and were interesting. Once her arc was completed, the standard development for each new character introduced started.

It is set on an island with perpetual spring cherry blossoms, where strange things occur. The second season is set two years later and narrates about Asakura Junichi who lives by himself and has several female friends that look after him. One day, a new girl named Aisia arrives and things start to get interesting.Animation is the best part of this anime. It generally looks good although on some occasions the characters’ mouths will move without being in sync with their dialogue. The designs of...the new characters, however, didn’t appeal to me very much although they were not bad in general.The music in the anime wasn’t great. Both the opening and closing themes failed to capture my interest, and the soundtrack was forgettable. However, the voice actors performed well.The plot and characters were a letdown.

Overall, the show was decent enough."", 'D.C.S.S. is a fairly interesting sequel which introduces many new characters and features a roller coaster of a plot sequence. It tells a story of what happens two years after D.C when a young magician named Aisia goes to the island in search of Jun\'ichi\'s grandmother. The series won\'t make sense unless you watched D.C. but unfortunately it also isn\'t as good.Animation:The animation is done slightly better than the original with Jun\'ichi getting a complete makeover, which bothered me at first but I eventually got used to it.Sound:The OP/first ED were fairly average and I didn\'t really like the second ED. Expect the same BGM...quality from the first series but with a lot of insert songs. Kotori gets a longer role so expect more Yoi Horie. Voice actors carry over from the first series and there are a lot of new voices with the addition of a lot of new cast.Story:While in D.C. you have a plot which continuously gets more intricate until you hit a climax, D.C.S.S. showcases two peaks, one very early on when Nemu returns and the second one right before the end.Basically, Nemu left after the end of D.C. to study to become a nurse, leaving Jun\'ichi all alone. Thus, the other girls of D.C. work together to form a ""support unit"" to make sure he is well without Nemu, with Kotori taking the lead. Nemu\'s absence was very glaring and I welcomed her eventual return. But then, plot twist! You\'ll find yourself with many of these in the show.Many episodes are dedicated to introducing the new characters, especially Aisia, and her desire to ""make everyone happy"". There is a lot of foreshadow as to what is going to happen near the end and the path to the end is pretty linear. As for the conclusion, it was nice but the climax and falling action seemed needlessly crunched into only a few short episodes, which I found quite disappointing. I also found a few plot holes which confounded me, such as the fact that Yoshiko\'s master, who was confined to her room for the first series, suddenly appears outdoors and gives Aisia advice.Character:One of the faults IMO in this series is the fact that there are several new side characters in addition to Aisia who all seem to happen to like Jun\'ichi and don\'t really contribute to the plot sequence. The only real point was to show how unrealistically popular Jun\'ichi is.Aisia is also as idealistic as they come, unnaturally so considering her age. She constantly seems to believe that magic exists as a way to make things easier in sharp contrast with Sakura\'s belief that magic is a shortcut that should be avoided if possible do to unforeseen side effects. She seems overly blithe in her day to day life and use of magic and in the end decides to make choices for others when it is not her place. She is a character to hate and I still harbor a strong distaste for her character.The main characters from the first series return and play important roles. They have all come to recognize and accept Jun\'ichi\'s relationship with his sister. However, Nemu and Juni\'chi\'s relationship always seemed to be lackluster in comparison with the first series. Also, Sakura gets a much more positive role in this series. While she was the cause of Nemu\'s suffering and all in the first series, she now serves as the guide, trying to direct Aisia in the proper direction.Value:This is an interesting addition to D.C. but unlike the first series, it doesn\'t stand on it\'s own. If you didn\'t like the first series, don\'t watch this. However, if you liked the first series, watch this with lower expectation. It was still a decent watch nonetheless. quality from the first series but with a lot of insert songs. Kotori gets a longer role so expect more Yoi Horie.

Takahashi Kotarou is a reporter who doesn't really care about whisky but slowly comes around to it after spending time with Rui.The plot is fine, but I didn't connect with the characters much, feel like it would have been better...as a series instead of a movie. The character development of Kotarou is just to quick for me to really engage with him, while Rui needed some more on her backstory. The plot kind of has the same tropes as Japanese dramas about work (no problem can't be fixed with a UNHEALTHY AMOUNT of overtime work). Also it's quite nerdy about whisky but at the same time I would have liked it to be nerdier. I felt it ran the line of being nerdy enough it may put off people not into whisky (some people were asleep in the screening I watched) but not really nerdy enough to appeal to hardcore whisky fans.Give me a 12 episode series with an episode on pot still design and selection, one on cask types, one on barley types, one on peat levels, one on yeast, etc. with maybe Kotarou learning about these things with the audience and why this matters. That would be my perfect whisky anime!As it is it's enjoyable and definitely needs to be enjoyed with a dram. Slainte!! as a series instead of a movie.

A heart-warming and fun story about a Japanese family-run whiskey manufacture.During the screening at Anilogue International Animation Festival, the audience laughed at so many of the little details that the creators added. We were laughing hard even after 20 minutes with my friend on how Japanese some of the jokes were.The direction and editing were solid, it felt like you were watching a really well done documentary style drama movie with some animated flair....The animation for a drama was nice, there were even sakuga shots of whiskey.

The visuals depict the distillery\'s scenes and objects in great detail. Additionally, the film references many real-world landscapes, giving viewers a sense of being there. The story is also heartwarming and healing. Although the Komata family has experienced a series of difficulties, they have all worked hard to overcome them, and finally successfully revived the ""Dokuroku"" whiskey.However, there are also some flaws. First, the characters are somewhat thin. Although their personalities are distinctive, they lack sufficient depth, making it difficult to understand their inner world truly. Without enough emotional twists, it is difficult...to resonate or sympathize with them.In addition, the explanations and introductions of alcohol, whiskey, and distilleries are also somewhat insufficient. The film mentions the process of making whiskey, but does not delve into the history, culture, and tasting methods of whiskey. This may be a bit of a disappointment for viewers interested in whiskey.Overall, it is a well-made animated film. Although it needs to be strengthened in terms of character design, the heartwarming and healing story, and the realistic and detailed visuals are still worth watching. to resonate or sympathize with them.In addition, the explanations and introductions of alcohol, whiskey, and distilleries are also somewhat insufficient.

It's the combination of excellent vintage animation, sound, retro- style, and over-all originality that makes it such an amazing series. There's plenty of character development along with great story telling. Even the characters make the series such a great work. Gatchaman was the series that played a huge roll in the creation and boom of Henshin tv shows. My advice to anyone is to check out this series, especially if your an old-school anime fan. "", ""When I heard that ADV had released G-Force/Battle of the Planets in it's entirety of all original 105 episodes completely unedited and under the original name, Gatchaman, I was overjoyed! Battle of the Planets [BOTP] was certainly all that and a bag of chips back in the day. Funny thing is, a couple of years back I attempted to revisit my childhood memories by watching Battle of the Planets again for old times sake and to my abject horror and dismay, I saw now with my adult eyes how absolutely putrid BOTP was....feel free to read my review of BOTP. Now that it's fully restored...I am going to give it another shot and see if this show is really good or not and just how much of it was butchered by Sandy Frank and the  other American production companies.~ The ArtPretty darn old looking! There's no mistaking that this show was 100% hand-drawn! Lot's of errors and glitches in movement, little foreign objects and dust specs on the film [or art cells] Also the people looking all sorts of deformed due to disproportionate body ratios and incorrect angling. Tons and tons of looped and reused scenes. All of which I would find forgivable considering the show was made in 1972. It's still a pretty decent show visually and compared to many 80's show like Voltron, ThunderCats or Saber Riders, Gatchaman can still hold it's own. Also considering it's date once again it was still superior to it's US equivalent of show from that same era such as Scooby-Doo, Magilla Gorilla and Hong Kong Phooey [although I did think Super-Friends was the shit]~The SoundThank Zeus, they re-did the voice cast! The biggest reason I decided to watch this show again. Listening to Casey Kasem's voice [on BOTP really got on my nerves, he sounds like he gargles with broken glass everyday....and in no way shape or form does he posses the voice of a teenager. He was the main reason I dropped the show.The new English voices are OK, it's nothing I would normally go raving about but it's a drastic improvement from the original cast. Although this re-dubbing must have occurred fairly recently after 2000, the actors do playfully interject a lot of Groovy-Speak and Jive Talk which I thought was very funny.What I also found funny were some of the voices of the bad guys....Like that one German villainous pilot that scene when he said “Auf Weidersehen” and disappeared into his mecha was a laugh riot. And forget about Berg Katse, I live for Berg Katse [He acts and talks like a villain from Batman [60's Adam West version] which was also pure camp.Stright up tho, the songs for the OP and ED blow some serious chunks. The guy singing the Gatchaman Theme song sound like he's amped up on too much Mountain Dew....he's all like “YUKEEE!!! Yuke yuke GATCHAMAN!” it's so terrible it's kinda funny, check it out on youtube, you'll see what I mean and laugh too.~The StoryOK so this being an old ass anime from the Paleolithic Era, you can expect things to be rather simplistic, repetitive and somewhat hokey. I no longer look at this show with the wonder and amazement as I did as a kid, but the show is still fun to watch [in small doses...as a marathon it fails] The basic premise for this show is that the Gatchaman team are these 5 teens who go around trying to stop the pollution of the Earth, which consequently and repeatedly they end up foiling the plans of the Galactor who are these aliens intent on screwing up the planet for some odd reason. I find this funny because the tremendous irony that apparently goes unnoticed is that the whole time Gatchaman fights and blows up these giant enemy mecha they become equally culpable for the destruction and pollution of whichever the site they are trying to defend [Edit: Actually in ep. 96 someone FINALLY tells them they are equally guilty in taking part in the destruction]. So I'm a little lost on the eco-friendly thing. Also they're not too animal friendly either because in one particular episode one of the good-guys Joe, blasts a whale straight in the mouth, just like that....I know it's not funny, but I had to laugh.The downside to all of this is that Gatchaman is a whopping 105 episodes. By episode 25 I was getting a little tired and bored because it's all basically the same story with different monsters and different members of Gatchaman being the focus for that episode....after a while it just ran in the background while I did other stuff. The last few episodes at the end of the series, like maybe after episode 90, become a bit more interesting again.~ The CharactersYou know something, when it comes to the latest controversial debate about whether anime characters look more Anglo rather than Asian....I kinda have to agree, because these guys are as Anglo-American looking as it gets. Not that I'm trying to say much about that on here so controversial topic aside, it must also be said that their overall designs were fantastic, each character was unique looking and easily distinguishable. You could easily tell who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. I also love the wardrobe and costumes of the characters. I especially like how the 5 main characters look when they are not dressed up in “Bird Mode” I love the long hair, wide belts and striped bell-bottom pants; it's a good look.My best character award goes to two characters this time: Jinpei, the youngest member of the Gatchaman team and of course to Berg Katse the commander of the evil Galactor force. I really like Jinpei the Swallow, I think he's adorable with his little match-stick body and giant round head. He's young but he's got guts and will take on adults twice his size. He does a lot of things he's not supposed to and gets in too deep many times but once he gets that determined look on his face you know he means business and most of the time he can hold his own and doesn't need to be bailed out. Jinpei also has the coolest [IMHO] and most versatile vehicle in the group. He has a fully armored mini-tank/submarine that has robotic arms and can fly but also dig underground.The other award goes to Berg Katse [like I said] this guy is hilarious! The words that comes out of his mouth are a trip [I really should give credit to the VA]. Also he's very clever and disguises himself as anything and anyone. The funniest things about him are the fact that he always abandons his subordinates whenever the battle goes south and they are facing oblivion also I love when he gets abusive and smacks people but he's also funny when he's groveling to his superior....which is that floating demonic head-thing [X, I think he's called]Bishounen Hunter hottie alert: Ken the Eagle and Joe the Condor [sometimes, when the angle is right] they have that vintage 70s look with the sideburns and long hair. Ken's eyes are cute but Joe's eyes are kinda feral looking.~ The VerdictCompared to BOTP, Gatchaman is not too bad of a show to watch, I just think 105 episodes is a bit too much for a series that does not have a continuous story like most anime shows nowadays. The fact that the stories are rather simplistic and repetitive with most of everything being resolved at the end of an episode makes having to endure 105 episodes kinda tedious.This is a show I would maybe recommend viewing in an episode-a-day format, but it's definitely not something to watch as a marathon, because it's too long of a series and some of the stories [and scenes] repeat frequently. But the new voice cast makes this show a hell of a lot better to watch. I am going to give it another shot and see if this show is really good or not and just how much of it was butchered by Sandy Frank and the  other American production companies.~ The ArtPretty darn old looking!

The last few episodes at the end of the series, like maybe after episode 90, become a bit more interesting again.~ The CharactersYou know something, when it comes to the latest controversial debate about whether anime characters look more Anglo rather than Asian....I kinda have to agree, because these guys are as Anglo-American looking as it gets. Not that I'm trying to say much about that on here so controversial topic aside, it must also be said that their overall designs were fantastic, each character was unique looking and easily distinguishable. You could easily tell who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. I also love the wardrobe and costumes of the characters. I especially like how the 5 main characters look when they are not dressed up in “Bird Mode” I love the long hair, wide belts and striped bell-bottom pants; it's a good look.My best character award goes to two characters this time: Jinpei, the youngest member of the Gatchaman team and of course to Berg Katse the commander of the evil Galactor force. I really like Jinpei the Swallow, I think he's adorable with his little match-stick body and giant round head. He's young but he's got guts and will take on adults twice his size. He does a lot of things he's not supposed to and gets in too deep many times but once he gets that determined look on his face you know he means business and most of the time he can hold his own and doesn't need to be bailed out. Jinpei also has the coolest [IMHO] and most versatile vehicle in the group. He has a fully armored mini-tank/submarine that has robotic arms and can fly but also dig underground.The other award goes to Berg Katse [like I said] this guy is hilarious! The words that comes out of his mouth are a trip [I really should give credit to the VA]. Also he's very clever and disguises himself as anything and anyone. The funniest things about him are the fact that he always abandons his subordinates whenever the battle goes south and they are facing oblivion also I love when he gets abusive and smacks people but he's also funny when he's groveling to his superior....which is that floating demonic head-thing [X, I think he's called]Bishounen Hunter hottie alert: Ken the Eagle and Joe the Condor [sometimes, when the angle is right] they have that vintage 70s look with the sideburns and long hair. Ken's eyes are cute but Joe's eyes are kinda feral looking.~ The VerdictCompared to BOTP, Gatchaman is not too bad of a show to watch, I just think 105 episodes is a bit too much for a series that does not have a continuous story like most anime shows nowadays. The fact that the stories are rather simplistic and repetitive with most of everything being resolved at the end of an episode makes having to endure 105 episodes kinda tedious.This is a show I would maybe recommend viewing in an episode-a-day format, but it's definitely not something to watch as a marathon, because it's too long of a series and some of the stories [and scenes] repeat frequently. But the new voice cast makes this show a hell of a lot better to watch."", 'One of the first anime I ever saw... all the way back in the 1970\'s.  It is important to compare this to anime of the era in terms of art and storytelling.  A fun romp with a lot of action. Still the entire run has an overarching story and an environmental message.  The ""Battle of the Planets"" version is much more child directed than the original with huge cuts to avoid issues here in the United States. I own DVD versions of many anime titles but this is one of the few long run series purchased; along with Space Battleship Yamato.

It\'s a rather enjoyable show due in large part to the campy dub which is entertainingly bad, but also the characters and world-building so far is quite good; I expect it to progress nicely if rather slowly. Speaking of which, this is a very slow, episodic show. You\'re going to want to watch this as an episode every so often rather than any sort of binging. This doesn\'t work as the main show you\'re watching, only as a side show. But, as a side show, it\'s quite entertaining and I recommend it, dubbed of course.

Well with a class of 31, it's obvious this problem could not be avoided.Personally, I enjoyed Mahou Sensei Negima. It was fun and entertaining to watch and it took away most of my boredom.

Love Hina was adapted by Xebec, and subjected to a not-particularly-great adaptation. Negima is almost the same in that respect, except that rather than a not-particularly-great adaptation, here we are presented with an appalling one.For starters, this series came out several years sooner than it should have done. The manga is, to this day, still running, and promises to be around 40-50 volumes in length by its completion. This, however, was...made when they were still only few volumes in. When Akamatsu was going to make this series, he wanted to make a Shonen manga, but was forced to make a harem manga in an attempt to repeat the success of Love Hina. As a result, he kicked off with a blatant harem setup, and gradually shifted away to becoming a Shonen series instead. In the process, it eventually became something of a Shonen manga for Harem fans.Of course, while battle Shonen series are increasingly becoming a patch on the anime industry, with repetitive fights, contrived plots, one-dimensional characters, and optimal capability to be completely recycled by another series with a quick, unconvincing makeover, the Negima manga is absolutely none of those. Negima knows what it is, and gleefully runs through all the battle shonen tropes and harem tropes in hilarious tongue-in-cheek fashion. But even while happily resigning itself to being a generic shonen series, it manages to be utterly exemplary as one, building three-dimensional characters, rich fantasy worlds, plots that skilfully manage god knows how many characters and still manage to make most of them interesting an memorable, fights that are well-constructed and compelling, and humour that is outright hilarious. In effect, Negima is something that every shonen series should strive to be.That is, however, something this series decides to completely ignore. It kicks off mostly faithful to the first part of the series, but promptly decides to deviate whenever any of the story arcs pop up. Yes, rather than actually following the plot of Negima, regarding Negi's exploits to find his long-lost father, they just decide to do... well, pretty much nothing. All the series ever focuses on are the protagonist Negi Springfield's day-to-day activities as the teacher of an all-girl high school. In a nutshell, what this is series has done is taken every piece of filler from the manga and put it together into a series. The only time they really touch on any of the manga's story arcs is the Kyoto arc, which took about 3 volumes of the manga to cover. They then proceed to dedicate about 2 episodes on this, cutting out pretty much everything of importance, and cutting a major character (Kotaro) out of the story altogether. The end result is a rushed and butchered version of what was previously a good story arc.Of course, Negima is a character-driven series, which it would really have to be considering that it starts off with around 35 characters, and in the current arc of the manga it must be nearing 100. Problem is that the series stops at around 45, and only remembers to make a handful or two remotely interesting. The only ones that are really worth mentioning are as follows: Negi, our protagonist, a ten year old Welsh magician. As part of their training, young wizards are sent off to work to test their abilities, with Negi's test being to teach a school of Japanese students who are older than he is. He has a fantastic backstory that spans childhood horrors, parental abandonment, and a crippling need to become a great wizard for reason I won't dare spoil. This adaptation covers approximately none of it.We also see his first of many sidekicks, Asuna Kagurazaka, whose backstory digs so far back that I can't even say a word of it without spoiling anybody. But naturally, not a single bit of it was adapted, so we are left with a one-dimensional character who is bossy and annoying. It's worth noting that even in the manga she's not particularly likeable. We also have Evangeline A.K. McDowell, a vampire who was imprisoned in the school by Negi's father and needs Negi's blood to escape, Nodoka Miyazaki, the clumsy, hyper-moe bookworm girl and primary love interest, and Yue Ayase, friend of Nodoka and general deadpan snarker. Other than that, most of the remaining 40-something cast members aren't used much. Some of them get their episodes in the spotlight, but none of them ever really shine as a result. Several cast members get as many as one or two lines in the entire series. Some others are also quite out of character, in particular Sayo Aisaka, the ghost.On the technical side of things, Negima is as poor as it is anywhere else. The animation is awful, littered with animation mistakes absolutely everywhere, and the colouring is horribly bland and undersaturated. The music is all either annoying J-pop or completely forgettable. Negima was a series I watched before I was in the habit of watching subbed series, so I regretfully sat through the horrible dubbing. Don't get me wrong, I actually like dubs, but this is a really bad one. Greg Ayres as Negi is the highlight of how bad it gets. Effectively, Ayres is the Michael Cera of English dubbed anime. He has a distinctive, whiny voice, that can either be amusing, loveable and endearing, or horribly annoying. And the absolute pinnacle of just how annoying Greg Ayres can be when casted poorly is Negi Springfield. His voice is, in addition to its usual nasally whine, made considerable higher and given something of a British accent. To simulate the experience of hearing this, find your nearest chalkboard and scrape your nails down it. Despite the large cast, there are very few decent performances here (Brina Palencia as Yue Ayase and Laura Bailey as Evangeline A.K. McDowell are the only good ones in here), as well as several other irritating ones such as Leah Clark (Nodoka) and Monica Rial (Konoka) both putting in extremely shrill voices, with the remainder of the cast simply being either poor or unremarkable.At this point I'm sure that several readers are annoyed at how much I've prattled on about the differences in the adaptation, but the thing is that when you take that away there is very little to talk about. When depleted of all the manga's positives, what we are left with is a series that is honestly lifeless. The comedy is mostly absent, and when it does it falls flat. None of the characters are enjoyable in the least. The plot is almost nonexistent. This series doesn't even have any fanservice to carry it for the lowest common denominator (ecchi fans).Being an ongoing series, Negima of course had an anime-exclusive ending. While it was very contrived and the drama was laid on awfully thick, the plot itself honestly wasn't that bad and at least saves this anime from being absolutely, 100% terrible, alongside a very small handful of funny moments.Thankfully, Negima has since left the hands of Xebec, and moves into those of Shaft. Shaft have gone on to make a TV series that is essentially Negima in name only, although it is still a damn sight better than this, two random filler OVAs, and most likely due to complaints, two series of OVAs covering later arcs in the manga, which are easily the best animated chunks of Negima. Sadly, this pretty much rules out any kind of full series adaptation.Thanks,  Xebec. You ruined it.Final Words: For the love of god, buy the manga first.Animation/Graphics: 1/10Story/Plot: 2/10Characters; 3/10Music/Background: 4/10English Dub: 2/10Overall: 2/10For Fans Of: Love Hina, Harry Potter. made when they were still only few volumes in. When Akamatsu was going to make this series, he wanted to make a Shonen manga, but was forced to make a harem manga in an attempt to repeat the success of Love Hina. As a result, he kicked off with a blatant harem setup, and gradually shifted away to becoming a Shonen series instead. In the process, it eventually became something of a Shonen manga for Harem fans.Of course, while battle Shonen series are increasingly becoming a patch on the anime industry, with repetitive fights, contrived plots, one-dimensional characters, and optimal capability to be completely recycled by another series with a quick, unconvincing makeover, the Negima manga is absolutely none of those. Negima knows what it is, and gleefully runs through all the battle shonen tropes and harem tropes in hilarious tongue-in-cheek fashion. But even while happily resigning itself to being a generic shonen series, it manages to be utterly exemplary as one, building three-dimensional characters, rich fantasy worlds, plots that skilfully manage god knows how many characters and still manage to make most of them interesting an memorable, fights that are well-constructed and compelling, and humour that is outright hilarious. In effect, Negima is something that every shonen series should strive to be.That is, however, something this series decides to completely ignore. It kicks off mostly faithful to the first part of the series, but promptly decides to deviate whenever any of the story arcs pop up. Yes, rather than actually following the plot of Negima, regarding Negi's exploits to find his long-lost father, they just decide to do... well, pretty much nothing. All the series ever focuses on are the protagonist Negi Springfield's day-to-day activities as the teacher of an all-girl high school. In a nutshell, what this is series has done is taken every piece of filler from the manga and put it together into a series. The only time they really touch on any of the manga's story arcs is the Kyoto arc, which took about 3 volumes of the manga to cover. They then proceed to dedicate about 2 episodes on this, cutting out pretty much everything of importance, and cutting a major character (Kotaro) out of the story altogether. The end result is a rushed and butchered version of what was previously a good story arc.Of course, Negima is a character-driven series, which it would really have to be considering that it starts off with around 35 characters, and in the current arc of the manga it must be nearing 100. Problem is that the series stops at around 45, and only remembers to make a handful or two remotely interesting. The only ones that are really worth mentioning are as follows: Negi, our protagonist, a ten year old Welsh magician. As part of their training, young wizards are sent off to work to test their abilities, with Negi's test being to teach a school of Japanese students who are older than he is. He has a fantastic backstory that spans childhood horrors, parental abandonment, and a crippling need to become a great wizard for reason I won't dare spoil. This adaptation covers approximately none of it.We also see his first of many sidekicks, Asuna Kagurazaka, whose backstory digs so far back that I can't even say a word of it without spoiling anybody. But naturally, not a single bit of it was adapted, so we are left with a one-dimensional character who is bossy and annoying. It's worth noting that even in the manga she's not particularly likeable. We also have Evangeline A.K. McDowell, a vampire who was imprisoned in the school by Negi's father and needs Negi's blood to escape, Nodoka Miyazaki, the clumsy, hyper-moe bookworm girl and primary love interest, and Yue Ayase, friend of Nodoka and general deadpan snarker. Other than that, most of the remaining 40-something cast members aren't used much. Some of them get their episodes in the spotlight, but none of them ever really shine as a result. Several cast members get as many as one or two lines in the entire series. Some others are also quite out of character, in particular Sayo Aisaka, the ghost.On the technical side of things, Negima is as poor as it is anywhere else. The animation is awful, littered with animation mistakes absolutely everywhere, and the colouring is horribly bland and undersaturated. The music is all either annoying J-pop or completely forgettable. Negima was a series I watched before I was in the habit of watching subbed series, so I regretfully sat through the horrible dubbing.

There is almost no real storyline because almost all the episodes are fillers from the manga.The only thing I really liked about this anime was the opening song and the music. ', ""Watch episode 19, then pretend the rest of the series doesn't exist. Rarely does the series succeed in rising above the mark of generic in any aspect, more often taking advantage of being an adaptation of a work by Ken Akamatsu and assuming fans will mindlessly race to hand over money (which they did).Many fans laud the anime for originality because it features a harem surrounding a preteen teacher who happens to be a wizard. However, the magical aspect is used only infrequently, as are the child-teacher jokes. The preteen harem lead aspect is used fairly often, but is of limited improvement over the typical...spineless loser harem lead.Negima's most obvious problem is the visual. The art is unpleasing, and the animation is lackluster. For all the vibrant colors, the characters look flat and lack dynamic. The action scenes are done so lazily, such as Negi's battle with Eva in episode 8, that they are almost painful to watch. The quality was so bad that Xebec had to change the entire animation team about halfway through the series and reanimated the earlier episodes for DVD release. While this was an improvement, it is akin to stating that dog food tastes better than chalk; much of the series only matches the quality of shows ten years older. Also, while generally a rainbow of hair colors is common to distinguish characters who look similar among a large cast, how many other series make fun of that point in the actual dub.The dub cast was not really a strong point of the show either. While there weren't any bad performances, unless you couldn't stand Greg Ayres attempt to speak in a pitch several octaves above normal to play Negi, the number of characters required several actresses to play multiple roles. This in itself is not exactly a problem, except that in many cases the drastic efforts they made to sound distinctly different did not match the character. The Japanese audio track would be preferable, except that the English script took liberties with the dialogue that made the series if not interesting, more tolerable.The music - background, OP, ED, all of it - was like audio cotton candy: light, fluffy, and sugary. A perfect, borderline obnoxious, match for the visual pallet of the series.I've mentioned before that the cast of the show is rather large, and that is another of its failings. It is unreasonable to assume that over 30 characters could be properly fleshed out and given interesting backgrounds, but the anime was unwilling to concede screen time from the ensemble to allow individual characters to be given their 15 minutes of fame. Ayaka's story, for instance, had potential to be touching and personal, but the animators felt compelled to include the generic madcap hijinx of the rest of class 3-A. Such an inclusion did nothing to expand the personalities of any other characters, as the only character-specific goofy antics were based around the one-dimensional stereotypes the girls were slotted into. Seeing a robot go on an accidental rampage because someone pushed the wrong button is barely amusing the first time it happens, but in Negima it serves to undermine the nature of the character because lazy writers can only think in cliches.Much of the series lacks an ongoing narrative. This wouldn't necessarily be a problem, but that few of the episodes are truly amusing or interesting. To make matters worse, the drastic rearrangement of the chronology of events adapted from the manga to the anime eliminates significant plot arcs and, at least once, undermines character growth. For example, in the manga, the dodgeball arc was Negi's first real trial as a teacher, requiring him to demonstrate leadership and competence. In the anime, this is placed after the vampire arc, in which Negi had to muster his courage and work with some of his students to defeat a powerful opponent, thus reducing its importance to filler material.The closing arc of the anime, an original plot line, was well enough done that it evoked genuine emotion, but unfortunately created a number of plot holes and required a deus ex machina to complete.The one truly bright spot of the series was episode 19. Interestingly, the best episode of this harem comedy romp is an episode that features very little of the harem, and almost no comedy. Also, the episode is not adapted from a corresponding manga chapter, demonstrating that the writers were capable of creativity, and the series could have benefited greatly had they attempted to use it more often (like in parts of the last four episodes). The story revolves around Sayo, the ghost girl that nobody notices, and how the class reporter looks into the circumstances of her death. The tale is tender and tearful, and it manages this by following only two characters and resisting the urge to cheapen the plot with the silly games of the rest.Negima has its shining moments, but they are few and far between.

There is always something new happening. I believe this is one of those originals that isn't really a knock off of something. Very Unique with a small twist every now and again. I know I said it once but I must say it again. It is HALARIOUS! "", 'I\'ll start off by saying the original manga is one of my current favorites and I went into this one with high expectations for the first anime adaptation, so this review is in the perpective of person who is already a fan of the series.STORY: If you know plot of the beginning-*10 year old child prodigy magician Negi Springfield becomes a teacher for an all girls school of a class of about 30 girls with each one having their own unique and some what quirky traits and has to keep the fact about him being a magician a secret while the genre slowly evolves into...an actual shounen story while retaining it\'s other genres*-then I guess this adaptation does ""follow"" the source material, but only just a very limited amount of the original\'s story.The majority of the episodes tend to mostly spend time trying to introduce each girl by doing seemingly non cannon wacky episodes with Negi and several other characters (And his perverted mascot pet, Chamo) pretending to be the main characters with no actual plot going on (Yeah it\'s episodic as hell).In fact, all it really just felt like they did was simply pick random chapters from the manga, stuff them with filler, and called it a day, but it\'s not necessarily a bad thing, the episode\'s can be little enjoyable as light harem entertainment, and the whole filler-ed up episodes is pretty normal since the majority of long running manga series tend to get the filler treatment all the time (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, etc).However, I would go as far as to say these episodes are very pointless, besides the few episode arcs, these episodes have almost nothing to actually do with any sort of story build up, but even with those arcs, the adaption still manages to screw it all up.Especially for one arc in particular towards the end, which was done in about roughly 2 to 3 episodes, literally butchering the story at that point with this anime skipping events, rushing through important story elements, and even cuts one of the characters out completly, which stops any source for certain future events from the source material (Although the anime is only 26 episodes).So what does an anime company normally do when they seriously tamper with important elements to the original story? They pull the old anime only ending routine.The plot of the final episodes is about (the main female character) Asuna Kagurasaki, being killed off out of no where and Negi has to try to bring her back to life by stopping an event in Asuna\'s past that would cause her random death in the future by traveling back in time. with his whole class coming along for the ride (For a surprising lack of any kind of fun or zanyness from the early episodes had).The end result has Negi\'s entire class of girls gaining magical powers to fight an army of demons led by, what the plot strongly suggests, the devil himself, with the fights ending up being very silly and comical.Pretty much ends it out of no where with the mood going from happy and wacky school days to gloomy plot shredding, mood killing, and even a little depressing.ANIMATION: Very poor, the animators even had to redraw some of the frames (One of the characters head disappears for a couple of frames and apparently also had six fingers). And I can\'t imagine this anime looking worse than it does.Though it kinda recaptures the look of the early manga art style with the character designs, it\'s shoddy and pathetic overall.SOUND: I watched the dubbed version by Funimation and I have to say; this is honestly one the better dubs I\'ve heard from them.Luci Christian is well suited for her role as Asuna, and I enjoyed Chris Carson as the perverted mascot, Chamo. However, Greg Ayres who played the lead, Negi, sound like he had cancer or something. While the rest of the cast range from great to good enough.Happy Material, the opening theme song which gets a remix mutiple times throughout the anime, is an okay song but not really something thats in my taste and I would rather skip (Especially because pf how repetitive it is).OVERALL:The Good:+ Light and fun+ Good english dubThe Bad:- Wastes a lot of time with filler- Several story arcs are poorly done with little source material covered- Crap-tastic animation- Repetitive theme music- The overall mood of the anime derails at the endFINAL WORD: I for one was very disappointed with the end result, but at the very least I enjoyed some of events from the manga that were (poorly) animated, so in the end it\'s not an absolute let down (Though, I feel like I\'m being lenient), but it should have been done much better in my opinion. an actual shounen story while retaining it\'s other genres*-then I guess this adaptation does ""follow"" the source material, but only just a very limited amount of the original\'s story.The majority of the episodes tend to mostly spend time trying to introduce each girl by doing seemingly non cannon wacky episodes with Negi and several other characters (And his perverted mascot pet, Chamo) pretending to be the main characters with no actual plot going on (Yeah it\'s episodic as hell).In fact, all it really just felt like they did was simply pick random chapters from the manga, stuff them with filler, and called it a day, but it\'s not necessarily a bad thing, the episode\'s can be little enjoyable as light harem entertainment, and the whole filler-ed up episodes is pretty normal since the majority of long running manga series tend to get the filler treatment all the time (Naruto, Bleach, One Piece, etc).However, I would go as far as to say these episodes are very pointless, besides the few episode arcs, these episodes have almost nothing to actually do with any sort of story build up, but even with those arcs, the adaption still manages to screw it all up.Especially for one arc in particular towards the end, which was done in about roughly 2 to 3 episodes, literally butchering the story at that point with this anime skipping events, rushing through important story elements, and even cuts one of the characters out completly, which stops any source for certain future events from the source material (Although the anime is only 26 episodes).So what does an anime company normally do when they seriously tamper with important elements to the original story?

Now, the next thing I am going to say is that Xebec did not do ""Negima"" the justice it deserves. Why? There are several reasons.For starters, the character designs throw you off right at the get go. Any Akamatsu character, more specifically females, have a sensual feel to them. Xebec\'s designs lacked that. The cheacters looks stiff and unnatural.This leads me to my second point, there was no fan service. An story from Ken Akamatsu without fan...service is like a cold bowl of ramen, it\'s just damn disappointing. What\'s worse is they include Negi\'s sneezes that reveal Asuna\'s panties but leave out said panties. When I first saw this I thought it was edited and actually e-mailed Funi to learn it was uncut.The Japanese dub was very well done. All the girls sounded very natural and like what i imagine a class of Japanese jr high students would sound like. The English dub however, I cannot say the same. No usually I hold Greg Ayres in good standing i believe he did poorly with Negi. He spoke so quietly taht at points i couldn\'t understand him and the accent sounded ridiculously fake. I couldn\'t get enough of the opening song though, however I have a bias toward that type of music.So you may ask yourself why i gave the series an \'8\' if I had so many quarrels with it. Well, the truth is it was still the story and characters that I love. Also, the ending was done very well, even if the rest of the story wasn\'t, and proobablly made the overall difference of a \'7\' and an \'8\'. The last five or six episodes are a very intense watch.Overall though it\'s not hard to see why SHAFT was able to remake the series. I recently saw the trailer for the second version and actually watched two of the OVA\'s that go along with it. It looks like an improvement so I\'m very anxious to see how it turns out.

I give you...Asuna\'s panties!', '""Success has a thousand fathers but failure is an orphan""When it comes to Negima this isn\'t true at all. It\'s failure has more family than you can shake a stick at.  You have lazy writing taking the part of the father. A difficult concept failed in its execution the mother. Poorly animated art is the c airhead of a little sister, while ridiculous and unrelatable characters are the bratty brothers. Finally very good music used for nothing but obvious emotional manipulation is the older sister trying to hold it together but being ground down into dust.  Negima is no orphan but its family...makes the Bundy\'s from married with children look good.Lets start with older sister music. She\'s beautiful and if she could get out of this family could really be something on her own, instead she is trying to carry her family on her back and suffers for it. The music really may be the best part of Negima. It\'s a bit schmaltzy which isn\'t surprising seeing as it\'s used to try and carry scenes that the writing and art just can\'t pull off.Little sister Art, how she dreams of seeing her work in the Louvre, but even mom has trouble hanging her work on the refrigerator. She may do better one day but today isn\'t that day.Time for the match made in hell that birthed this family. Lazy Writing that took on a project far too large and characters were just not there. The source material for this anime is large far larger than can be fit into a single season of an anime, and therein lies the problem. If the story is to be told well, parts have to be left out, unfortunately instead of biting the bullet and doing the job Lazy Writer dad just makes a hash of everything. This is doubly so for the characters, who have plenty of change but no development.***************Spoilers Ahead******************How lazy is your writing ? Let me count the ways.Lazy as retroactively mindwiping characters.Lazy as bringing in time travel at the last moment to solve everythingLazy as filler episodes that contribute nothing while the plot and characters languish.Lazy as characters that act for no reason at allLazy as completely unresolved plot lines.Lazy as characters who can\'t recognize their friends when they put on a hat.Lazy as just being told what\'s happening instead of having the characters figure it out for themselves.Lazy as I want to kill you becoming, I want to serve you for the rest of my life for no reason.Lazy as turning death into something vanquished at whim.Lazy as endlessly interrupting people whenever they try to say something important.And as lazy you are, you fail in being funny. makes the Bundy\'s from married with children look good.Lets start with older sister music.

This review contains spoilers, if you are someone who has not yet seen this anime but plan too, do not read any further than this.What can I say, this is about a 10 year old wizard prodogy from Wales, who ends up getting chosen to finnish the rest of his wizarding training in Japan as an English teacher for an all girls acadamy.... Adventure Ho! All the possible hijinks ang hillarious sexual tension take action in this very enjoyable anime. It follows a story that sticks some what close to the manga but still has quite a few differences. It also had to...create its own ending because the manga was being produced more slowly than the anime. I had read the first volume of the manga series, discovering how much I enjoyed it, I decided to check out the anime adaptation. The first i noticed different was the begining, instead of starting with the main character, Negi Springfield, getting his assignment to teach at an all girls academy in Japan, it start of with the female protagonist, Asuna Kagurazaka, trying to cast a spell to make a teacher she has a crush on teach her class again. sooo the anime sorta vaguely makes it about her instead of Negi. Next thing I noticed was the animation, It was slightly lower grade than the manga and just slightly a step up from anverage flash video on newgrounds.com. For example most of the hair color for the characters were nothing like that of the manga and there was a slight lack of detail.After about 4 minutes of anticipation, I finally get to hear the voice of Negi. It isn't quite what you'd expect it to be, its not that bad it just catches you by surprise then after a while you kinda get use to it. (by th way, his name is not pronounced Neji). If you are able to get past the wierdness of the relation with Negi and his 14 year old female students and more into the story its very fun to watch, but if you also like the wierdness then cool.There is a some what funny gag that goes on in the show, whenever Negi sneezes it creates a strong and powerful gust of wind, and most of the time Asuna is in front of him when this happens and practically all of her clothes get blown off, this causes uneeded embarasment for Asuna, thus causing a constant quaral between these two characters. Over the course of the series these characters are able to form a special bond between eachother, as well as a first kiss, but the kiss was a crucial event that needed to happen otherwise Negi would've died at the hands of a vampire named Evangalene A.K. McDowell. It turns out that in order for negi to have a gaurdian to help him in a time of need it needs to made official by a kiss. Negi ends up making this deal with all of his students. I dont know whats wierder, that fact that he is there teacher, or the fact the he is 4 to 6 years younger than they are.Any way, for my review I definitely recomend this anime. The last few episodes are really sad, but at the very last episode has a very touching conclusion that leaves you satisfied. However, there are some slight unanswered question that are left in the the air but thank god we have the upcoming ova's to tie those up. I myself am very satisfied with this anime, it was funny, akward, touching and enjoyable. My only suggestion is that you first read the first 3 volumes of the manga then watch the entire anime. When your done with that continue reading the manga for a much better story arc. create its own ending because the manga was being produced more slowly than the anime.

SHAFT also made a borderline gag series (Negima!?) that somehow worked really well. However the first anime, made by XEBEC, is, by far, the worst version of Akamatsu\'s weird magic harem fighting manga. Yes, even worse than Neo.As for the story, you all know the drill. 10 year old mage becomes a teacher at an all-girls junior high. Hilarity ensues. Now, adapting an ongoing manga into 26 episodes is, well, impossible, (which is why I applaud SHAFT for coming up with their own plot in their version) so a premature, anime-only ending was inevitable....I accept this.However, the ending arc here is complete nonsense, and has some of the most ridiculous mood whiplash of all time, complete with a handy Deus Ex Machina to save the day. Joy.Now, if there\'s any aspect in which Negima! absolutely fails, it\'s animation, which doesn\'t bode well, to say the least. Off model shots are common, and the character designs look ugly, blocky, and very much unlike Akamatsu\'s designs. The last few episodes look better, though, with better looking characters and more fluid, less jerky animation. Not to mention the fact that the animation lacks any sort of detail, which the manga and Negima!? were overflowing with.Also, the opening animation, with all its fantastic music, is one of the most hideous displays of gratuitous, er, ""fanservice"" I have ever seen.Now, if there\'s any aspect in which Negima! actually succeeds in, it\'s sound. I\'ve never seen the dub, so I can\'t judge that, but the voice acting is absolutely top-notch. The background music, while not quite at the level of Negima!?, is at least memorable.However, the real success is Happy Material, the opening song. Really, the opening is the only reason I\'m not pretending this anime doesn\'t exist. It\'s iPod worthy.Character development is more akin to character derailment, as the rather huge cast is nothing but mere shadows of their former selves. Really boring, really obnoxious shadows. I mean, Negima!? successfully quirked them up to the maximum without making them annoying, or derailing them.If you\'re looking to get into Negima, skip this. Just skip this. Read the manga, watch Negima!?, and check out the OVAs. Hell, even Negima Neo is at least worth a read.When your series is worse than Negima Neo, there\'s a problem.A big problem.

When I first heard about the show, its concept really attracts me to go and watch it. The first thing you\'ll need to understand is that this isn\'t some fast-paced science fiction. The shows really takes it time to show us the aspect of each character\'s life, and in the end, making me care more about them as time passes. The show has 31 characters (I\'m not even counting the staffs in the school). This could be a huge turn off to some people. It certainly made me feel a bit hesitant when going in. However, the...show does a descent job in introducing the huge cast. But, honesty, I felt like I cared for only 6 characters, which is not necessary a bad thing, since the show mostly focus on them anyway. Nevertheless, sometimes the show seems to be trying too hard, dragging the main characters along side with the minor characters so that the viewers won\'t forget about them. This happens a lot with Asuna. I the show can certainly sometimes get boring (especially the 4-mid-episodes of the show), but it was not too mundane to put me off. Sometimes I found my self wondering, ""why the fuck are they dicking around instead of doing some shit relating to magic."" But towards the last half of the series, I felt that this is a wonderful story about how a group of students had gone through trails and tribulation and became friends. In the end, I could say that I enjoyed the show. This show is for those of you who like a moderately paced slice of life show, with some element of fantasy sprinkled into it. show does a descent job in introducing the huge cast.

It is kind of like if you take a harem, made the girl population about thirty times the boy population, and then made the boy, like, four years younger than the girls. Actually, that pretty much sums up this series. Ken Akamatsu, who created the show's manga, is also rather well known for his previous series, Love Hina. In my opinion, this show far surpasses Love Hina, and here's why.Story 8/10The story of Negima starts off like your typical harem, but gradually evolves to become so much more.

It has tracks that provide good atmosphere, but nothing more. What I do have to give props for, however, is the dub. The dub was done by Funimation, and quite frankly, it sounds amazing. Memorable performances include Luci Christian, Laura Bailey, and Caitlin Glass.

It entertains the viewer enough as to keep them watching.It includes comedy, drama, fantasy, and a bit of action. The comedy is just fine, like any other average comedy serie; drama is a bit tacky since it relies on the average romantic plot where two characters meet but do not accept their feelings until the very end of the serie; fantasy doesn't even needs to be explained i guess (Negi, the main character, is a wizard; I think that's enough explanation); and the action part is just above the borderline of being acceptable.The...show is missing a definite storyline throughout the whole series, it seems just like a whole bunch of different things put together in each episode (except, maybe, in the last few episodes).

Orphan boy...wizard wants to become a great wizard like his father was.  It gets original when he\'s chosen to be a teacher at an all girls middle school to complete his wizardry training, but he must do it while keeping his mage status secret (which he repeatedly fails at).  The fact that many of the girls are outright Shota-cons is a little silly, but it ups the fun quotient at the same time.The story moves along but some of the episodes are silly, like the ""dramatic"" dodgeball fight.The anime\'s original ending is quite emotional, but really hooks you into it.Art: The art is simplistic, even compared to the sequel series.  The drawing is almost minimalist and they didn\'t go to any special efforts to wow the viewer.  The art was pretty forgettable.Sound: This anime\'s weakest link.  It was never inappropriate or ill-fitting; but it was entirely forgettable and the opening was almost trite in it\'s childishness.Character: It\'s the characters that drive this show and make it fun.  The main character Negi has a class of 31 students, all of them interesting and unique.  They all have different hobbies, histories, motivations, and secrets (a WHOLE lot of secrets).I can\'t go into too much detail since I could take up pages.Negi and Asuna (the boy wizard and the student who first finds out about his abilities) are the primary protagonists.  Negi is well written, but rather simplistic (he\'s only 10) as well.  Most of the humor of the series is him getting into trouble either through magic or through the attentions (not always appropriate) of his students.Asuna is the type of character who doesn\'t exist outside of animes.  Overhyper, super fast and strong, and hot-tempered.  She develops more character as time goes on and gains more backstory.One can\'t mention characters in Negima without a huge shoutout to an early antagonist turned protagonist, Evangeline Anastasia ""Kitty"" McDowell.  Vampire Girls are nothing new to anime.  Even vampire girls who dress in (even called this by the character herself in the manga) ""Goth Loli"" are nothing new (disturbing).Yet you never see one have as much fun playing the villain.  Naturally in an anime like this she secretly is a sweet girl, but she outright enjoys being one of the badguys.  She doesn\'t bring the usual skycap of vampire angst to  the party; making no excuses for who she is and what she has done.  The only sappy part is her crush on Negi\'s father, but even their interaction was humorous.Enjoyment: Despite a few ""dud"" episodes, this show is very enjoyable.  With a lot of humor and some satisfying action at times; the overall experience is very positive and emotional at times.Overall: I highly recommend this series.  Though it can get a little sappy at times, it\'s a fun watch with something for everyone.Pros: Huge cast with great storylines and they are all unique and even poke fun at some classic stereotypes.  Very funny in places but can get serious at times; giving a good mix of humor, drama, and action.Cons: Follows the manga which developed slowly and you are left wanting more that is never delivered (sequel series is an original script with more comedy).  The artwork is nothing amazing and the soundtrack is a dud.Lastly the ending episodes is an emotional cartwheel, with some of the saddest scenes I\'ve ever seen in an anime, followed by a dramatic reversal for the expected happy ending.If one is looking for a similar story with a lighter plot, I recommend the sequel ""Negima!?"" which has a lot more comedy while sacrificing character development. wizard wants to become a great wizard like his father was.

Back in early 2008, i think. This anime was broadcasted in my place, and its really extremely censored, probably this was broadcaster fault for showing ecchi anime.But after watch whole episodes back then, I fully regret the whole of it.The main reason maybe this occurs is when :1 + You read the manga before watching anime.2 + You watched the anime then after done, read manga.""Ecchi"". Isn`t. Do not mistakes ""Ecchi"" and non ""Ecchi"" in thiis anime, conpared to manga which completely ecchi genre. Probably this is because the anime fix to Shounen...anime, which to make appeal to younger children rather than teen. Yeah.Plot are much butchered in this anime, trying to create original plot rather than manga plot, of course no need to follow manga completely. But when anime stays into that plot, while manga already go further, well anime stays dead on that scenes, unless reboot occurs.And while to look at the arts, arts are really pale and blant. Probably because its 2005, but I seen there`s more 2005 anime that has good animation back then.But hey, I don`t really cons this anime, there`s still good points through. Such as numerous characters with different personality but memoriable characters. Voice acting was pretty solid, even through music isn`t great in whole anime. OP was good.Then again. Like I said.I prefer manga than anime. I read the whole chapter. This anime devoid most of its charming. It makes coffee taste like drainage. anime, which to make appeal to younger children rather than teen.

It makes coffee taste like drainage.', ""I knew exactly what i was in for when i saw the first few minutes of the first episode of this anime. The beginning of the show has a girl in a fish suit dancing, floods of school girls running towards their school in an empty city, and a bear panty flip skirt scene, and all this sets the mood for most of the show. I still continued on mostly for the fact the this series is having a sequel (in some sense) coming out soon, and i just had to see what it was all about. I just wanted to know what would allow...for this show to have a spinoff, 3 separate ovas, and a sequel 13 years later.The anime follows Negi, a 9 year old kid who is a mage and is also the newest teacher in an all girls school, i think. Because you see, the setting takes place in this school/city that has different areas for different schools, and is pretty much why there was a lot of girls running in the beginning since that is there section of the town. Why is this such a thing? I really don't know, and they really don't delve into it. Anyway Negi is assigned to a all girl middle school for his mage training although i don't see how any of this connects together other than that the principle, and some of the staff are mages or at least connected to the magical world. It's never delved into as well. It's mostly just a setup for the school harem that will take place with a teacher , but it's ok now since the the teacher is a kid. Well it's easy to say that all the girls take a liking to him due to how cute he is, and it could have been left just as girls liking a cute kid. However the show goes beyond that and has some of the girls having romantic feelings for him, and even setting out to get a kiss from him.Nothing really interesting happens in the show with most episodes focusing on a character. While there are “story arcs” in the show it still for the most part focusing on a character or two. There is action and tension in the show, but it  falls flat most of the time because it tries to set out to be something else but it still maintains the same tone. There’s also no buildup to anything which allow things to happen without any proper reasoning. It does later in the story shift tone pretty well, but when it gets there, it gets absurdly over dramatic until finally going back to status quo. For much of a story it was at least easily digestible, but mostly for the part that there wasn’t a lot of meat in it.31! That’s how many students are in the class and given that this is only 26 episodes long be unamazed that many of them are glossed over. Not only them but all the other characters as well from the staffs of the school, and even the antagonists. All these girls are defined mostly by a quirk or hobby that they have, and that’s about it. However some of the girls do get an episode of their own, and they sure do leave an impression on the viewers, but once it’s done they usually go back into the background. There are really three characters that have more relevance in the show than anyone else. First is negi the young welsh mage who is sent to teach at  school for no apparent reason other than just because. Negi was never supposed to reveal that he was a mage or else he would be kicked out of the school, but that’s kicked to the wayside when more than ⅖ figures him out but no consequences ever happen to him.  Next is Asuna who is more of the main girl since the show really does focus on her a lot more than anyone else. She basically a tsundere who has a crush on one of the teachers, and was one of the first to figure out negi was a mage because of her special ability that’s never really explained. Finally is Nodoka who is a shy girl who gets more screen time than for her own good with her defining characteristic is liking negi and her character development being have the courage to confess.The art looks pretty basic. The character designs are basic and sometimes some characters look like each other, the background designs are basic, and the color palette doesn’t look any special. The animation is also just as basic but it really shows how substandard it is when anything worth of action occurs, and it just feels so underwhelming. Everything is still easy to put up with, but nothing really stands out. The soundtrack to the anime is decent for the most part although there are probably only two tracks that really stand out, and even they are forgettable. Everything else is standard fare when it comes to a comedic school story. The voice acting is ok as well, it’s rather diverse with each character sounding unique but not much else.This show was dumb which was pretty much what i expected from it. I had a decent time, and there was nothing really wrong with how the show played out even though it was quite dumb. However it was the last few episodes that made the show less enjoyable to watch.Overall it is a really forgettable show, and nothing really stand out that makes this anime any special. for this show to have a spinoff, 3 separate ovas, and a sequel 13 years later.The anime follows Negi, a 9 year old kid who is a mage and is also the newest teacher in an all girls school, i think.

It's far too cutesy, it doesn't have any of the more serious elements of the original manga and they even portray the characters differently. I think they should have relabeled the anime as a spin off rather than the anime interpretation of the manga.That aside (I'm going to pretend that i haven't read most of the manga.It's a great anime, very cutesy,...a little, slightly disturbing romance, some good fight scenes and some moments that will make you cry. If it wasn't negima, I probably would have watched anyway, as it does have a good storyline and makes quite a change to the usual high school romance and supernatural scene.Taking the manga into consideration, I'd give it a 4/10, but if you haven't read the manga, I'd say 9/10 and definitely worth watching.

I also loved the opening song ""Happy Material"". This anime is about Negi who is with 31 girls, I couldn\'t name a few. Negi guides those girls on how to make good use of magic.I also realised that if there are too many characters then the development most likely will diminish. However, I don\'t think that\'s the case in this anime. What makes an anime enjoyable to me is the character that I can relate well with.There are 2 characters which I like and enjoy:#1: Evangeline McdowellA vampire who...is ageless. Very mysterious and badass even in episode 21, she saved Negi from the evil guy. In fact, she is a very unique vampire not like Yuki Cross from Vampire Knight and the Twilight characters who have no personality. She is also intelligent. By the way, Yuki Cross is a crybaby.#2: Setsuna SakurazakiA badass swordswoman who is mysterious, calm and collected. She also cares deeply or Konoka.Without these 2 characters, I wouldn\'t enjoy this anime. I also know that this anime couldn\'t possibly cover all the back story of all the characters due to limited time of episodes. But it doesn\'t matter, as long as the characters are not annoying, that is fine. The rest of the cast, I cannot say much.The ending of the anime implied that Asuna was really crying for Negi\'s help. I don\'t understand why did she do such a thing? I feel dissappointed about the ending. Why did she become a crying mess in the end?I feel that my most disliked character in this anime is Asuna, who is stubborn and a damsel in distress. Not only that she is a tsundere, who gets violent easily. And yet, Negi has feelings for her. I also don\'t care if people say that she is princess-like. There are people who are princess-like and yet show me good attitudes in anime eg. Feena EarthlightOk. Never mind. I have to say that it was all right but not great. My rating was toned down due to the pacing and the ending. Not to mention some annoying characters like Asuna. The good thing about the show is the action scenes and likable characters like Evangeline & Setsuna.I give this show a 6 out of 10. That\'s all. is ageless.

Rather than following the typical &quot;take a guy and throw him in a house full of girls&quot; ala Shuffle or Sister Princess, Negima takes a guy and throws him in a school filled with girls. Negi, the main character, is a 10 year old genius who has graduated college at the age of 10 and is teaching at an all girls middle school. He also happens to be a young British wizard, which helps pull in the Harry-Potter-watching demographic I suppose.Many of the episodes unfold like a typical date-sim turned into an anime series, where there will be a concentration on...one of the girls in the class. The whole series remains pretty fluffy and lighthearted until episode 21 or so, and then becomes a bit serious so there can be some form of conflict and climax to end the series. I could pretty easily watch 100s of Negima episodes, as it's a good way to wind down at the end of the day, but those of you looking for more serious fare or something less cookie-cutter should look elsewhere.

This used to be one of my favorite mangas. I remember hearing that it had a anime adaptation, wait MULTIPLE adaptations 2 of them being almost nothing like the manga. But I didnt know that at the time so i peeped it. Disappointment hit like a fucking 100 pound rock. If you want to start this series, read the manga, no matter what. This is a similar situation to Fullmetal Alchemist (2003) where the anime cut corners and made up their own ending. Manga is a 10/10 imo purely because of the magic fights.

Magister Negi Magi in the US [Or was that Japan? I dunno, doesn't matter which name you use]) as I have already stated, is one of the best mangas I have read to date and probably my favorite manga. I have different opinions about the anime though, despite Ken Akamatsu's genius manga.Negima!? (what I will call it for now on during this review) is one of the worst adaptations of a manga I have ever seen. The art is...ATROCIOUS! I only gave it a four because it is an......aged...... show so the graphics won't be as good as the modern day graphics in anime. My problem is not only with the art. The story in the beginning is loose, not making sense to me, but in the end it kinda gets better (I guess) and pieces start coming together. I'm trying to break this into as many paragraphs as possible so I will come back to the flaws later. On to the good stuff.Despite those other flaws I was talking about, the rest of the show is kinda good. I can particularly note how much I binge watched this show. After watching the second adaptation (I like calling the first Mahou Sensei and the second Magister Negi Magi), Negima!? Magister Negi Magi, which was made by a different studio, resulting in different graphics, you realize how bad Mahou Sensei was and how much better Magister Negi Magi was. I binged both.The characters in this show are developed well, but the less relevant characters (Misora, Madoka, Satsuki) get less story time than the more relevant like Asuna, Chachamaru, and Chamo (who me and my friend got in a heated argument about how to pronounce his name. Is it Camo [as in military camo] or Chamo [as in Chamo but pronounced how it looks: Cha-Ammo, now put it together. Chamo. Note: I say Camo]). My personal favorite is Asuna (Not pronounced the same as SAO Asuna), mainly because she is my waifu. There aren't really any main characters (Other than Asuna and Negi) because most of the critical characters get the most story time (Example: Evangeline, although she has a part in almost every episode) but aren't classified as main characters during the anime.I can't really rate sound. It is okay I guess. The voice actors can play the part. The thing I just HAVE to mention before the end of this review. The story tries to make something the manga is not. This is partly why it got another adaptation. The story gets derailed after the first few episodes and it kinda becomes crap after a while.

The story was good and easy to follow but it didnt exactly follow the manga which i was really dissapointed with since i loved the manga. Take the school trip episodes for instance...they had the battles and all but they left ou some people, like Kotaro Inugami where was he? he plays a massive role in the manga so where is he in the anime? It also didnt help that he was my Fave charater in the manga so i got so p****d when i found out he wasnt in it.An interesting point about the story though was Asuna Kagurazaka's death, that i was not expecting. It was one hell of a twist. I think this is easily the most upsetting part of the entire series. When you see the class and how upset everyone is, epsecial her best friend Konoka Konoe its so touching, but it was great to see she came back thanks to choas time machine.The Art/Graphics of this anime are stunning all the spells and such cast are beautiful, as well as the scenery.The characters where great had every main character in it, except Kotaro... I honestly think that some of the voices (english dub) where kinda bad, like Negi Springfields voice, i know hes ten and all but still why did they have to make it so squeeky?The whole anime put together was amazing, to be honest i think it is better if you watched the anime then the books because you dont get to attached to the story, characters etc of the manga then get dissapointed that the anime left alot out.

I've watched the entirety of the Remake, and i honestly felt that the remake turned the Harem aspect to its side. In this one, Negi is having to worry about all of the girls flling in love with him.

The story was well done and at times delightful.I especially loved the characters and how they developed over the course of the show. Negi is portrayed well in terms of the balance between having to be the teacher and authority figure in the classroom, and being a boy younger than the class he teaches. Asuna is...flawed yet likeable as the lead female character, and Chomo is amusing as the comic relief ermine. Something that especially impressed me is that all 31 of the girls in Negi's class had faces and names, and most of them had a significant supporting role in at least one or two episodes of the series. By contrast, most series in a setting like this would focus on no more than about 8 or so characters while the rest become nameless background characters, whereas this one does a surprisingly good job of making the whole class look real without distracting too much from the primary characters.The music is kind of odd-sounding at times, yet oddly fitting. The art generally very good, though not particularly exemplary or stylistically notable.Let me also address that ecchi tag. There are a few instances of characters in their undergarments, or even portraying them nude in such places as public baths, but they generally have a sort of youthful innocence about them. There is little if any of the sexual innuendo or eroticism commonly seen in ecchi portraying characters a few years older. What relationships develop between characters are reasonably in keeping with the ages of the characters - middle school crushes and such.The final story arc has some heavier drama in it than the rest of the series up to that point, and I felt uncertain going into the last couple of episodes. Let it suffice to say that the final episode has a couple of surprises that some might say are over the top but I thought they worked well and were a pleasant turn of events to see. It ended well and left me liking it more than I expected to, or thought I would even a few episodes in. flawed yet likeable as the lead female character, and Chomo is amusing as the comic relief ermine.

""How does that add up"" you ask. No clue, but still sounds fun. As far as the story goes, the anime pretty much is just one huge set up for the remainder of the series. It...sucks that in the beginning of this series, nothing really happens and everything that does happen is just the tip of the iceberg of something very important later in the series that you will never see in the anime. For example the introduction to the character Fate Averruncus (If you had read the manga, you know how much of a big deal he is). The anime is underwhelming due to this problem. Another problem I have with this anime is the action is just awful. It\'s just a bunch of still images that are panned, tilted, or both.  Whereas in the manga, many of the fight scenes that anime does depict, are intense and entertaining. The anime fails to live up to the standards of the manga in that regard and does genuinely disappoint me.Art: The art is rather standard and does have a little charm to it, but it\'s also very boring to stare at. It was created by Funimation, so that may be a huge factor into why it looks like every other anime that came out from 2000 to 2007. It\'s not like the art is bad, but it\'s so generic to its time period that if you were to throw any character into the world of Chobits, you wouldn\'t be thrown off that something was off.Sound/Music: The sounds all made sense in this series. The voice acting in both the sub and dub are actually pretty good. The dub is better than expected especially for when it came out. The soundtrack is very nice and used very appropriately. Don\'t even get me started on the opening and ending theme.Character: Let\'s talk about Negi, he\'s okay. I don\'t really have high expectations out of him because he\'s only 10. Yes, he\'s a genius, but still lacks maturity which makes sense. As for the anime goes, his character development isn\'t to bad and is actually done in a proper manner and so do the other characters as well. Asuna is your typical Tsundere like character who has no romantic interest in Negi which is rather refreshing; rather she takes on the big sister role since she looks similar to Negi\'s actual sister. The main love interest, Nodoka, also had pretty decent character development as well. I wish I could go about and talk about the other characters properly, but unfortunately the anime doesn\'t really have the time to go through the cast and to give the development each student deserves. It doesn\'t help that the anime changed a few things from the manga which drastically reduced a lot of other character\'s development.Enjoyment: I enjoyed the show, but after reading the manga then coming back to it, I was really bummed out with how many changes Funimation Studios made and had a realization with how lazy the studio was producing this. It\'s one of the few shows I\'m embarrassed to admit that I used to love growing up. Don\'t get me wrong, it\'s not bad, but it\'s a show that was done so dirty in my opinion. It had so much potential and it just got he shaft because of who it was handed to to do the work for it. If it was another company that had worked on it, I\'m confident that the show would get the justice it deserves.Overall this show is straight down the middle and just okay. I can\'t recommend this show to anyone unless you want to look at a bunch of cute girls trying to decide who\'s wifey af (btw the most wifey character is Satsuki Yotsuba. Don\'t agree? Fight me). The fan service is also very tamed, it\'s basically softcore ecchi, which makes sense because dude, it\'s a bunch of middle schoolers. You can only do oh so much with them before we look at you in a negative light. In conclusion, this series is painfully average. Just read the manga, it handles the characters and story much better. The action will always keep you at the edge of your seat and you\'ll be glad you went for the ride.

The main eight-or-so characters are adorable, and there is good character development on them, we eventually learn a little about all the students.  The story is pretty light for awhile, with a lot of comedy and slice-of-life episodes that help you to understand the characters better, and build up an overall story line.The most surprising thing about this series is what...happens in the last few episodes. The story line takes a sudden turn towards the serious, and the drama that unfolds is riveting and heart-rending and will keep you pressing ""play"" long past your bedtime.

Overall, I think it is one of the best light-hearted animes out there, even if it is in the harem category.', 'Akamatsu Ken is a very familiar name to many anime and manga followers. He is the author of Love Hina that has been adapted into an anime. Negima is the spiritual successor of Love Hina. Firstly, I want to share some of my thoughts on the manga before we get into the anime.This style is the signature of Akamatsu Ken , characterized by highly actionable narratives coupled with characterizations that enjoy their time in the harem. Alas, the Negima may be oversaturated with fanservice where girls who barely look over ten to twelve years appear despite being 14-16 years. The proliferation of nudity and panty...shots, along with more than thirty female characters, drives the number of such instances too high. Negima has slight similarities with Harry Potter but the comparison is a bit off base.Negima anime has less fanservice than that of the manga and therefore makes it more appealing to younger viewers. The graphics quality is inadequate, especially during action sequences where construction seems rigid and insubstantial. Despite its shortcomings, the music in Negima is unparalleled, except for that featured by the opening and ending themes.For instance, the anime deviates from the manga, thus simplifying stories while disclosing foreshadowing prematurely and hence takes away potential story plot twists. Problems with characterization also appear – there are strange decisions in the development of the characters such as Asuna who changes in an unclear way. The anime unfortunately adds some meaningless elements that take away from the nature of source material, such as Asuna in a fish costume and several scenes of characters performing senseless feats.Issues relating to character archetypes, such as jealousy from Love Hina and Asuna’s initial aggressive behavior toward Negi; a ten-year old boy also came up again. However, such concerns were eased as Asuna grew into one of Negi’s closest confidants and showed that the anime had weaknesses concerning character development.In conclusion, I would find it hard to suggest the Negima anime adaptation even for those who are fans of Negima or Akamatsu Ken. The speed is very slow and the deviations from the essence of manga are much more than too much fanservice reduced. The better choice for a more rewarding one would be to continue reading the manga, despite its rather dubious use of fanservice. shots, along with more than thirty female characters, drives the number of such instances too high.

While the anime is good enough when it is watched alone, it doesn't follow the manga's storyline at all, has a lot of fillers and leaves stuff out. A disappointing thing if all you want to see is the manga fights being shown more awesomely in the anime. Not even close. All the fight as ridiculously shortened, the characters' overall power is greatly reduced and with everything being heavily censored so even the comic parts that bring some ecci filled relief to story is reduced to some badly executed perverted stuff.Another thing that...really annoyed me was the way that the character were drawn, not up to standard and with some color happy person applying a different hair color to the characters which are utterly ridiculous. Takes some time to get used to if you read the manga. Also the voices do not match the person and no trace of any accent other than Japanese. Pretty bad when you consider an English person speaking English in a Japanese accent (teaches English).All in all it is good, but the manga is much better. Watch only if you haven't seen the manga or if you can't get enough of the series and is able to bear much of the disappointment just to see some of the parts that were enjoyed in an animated way, if they are included or still resemble how they were in manga. really annoyed me was the way that the character were drawn, not up to standard and with some color happy person applying a different hair color to the characters which are utterly ridiculous.

Nagagutsu wo Haita Neko,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2279/Nagagutsu_wo_Haita_Neko,"[""The premise of this movie is similar to that of the Three Musketeers. I personally believe that I would have loved this movie if I saw it as a child. It is very clear it is for younger audiences with the way the plot progresses, but that doesn't stop you enjoying it as an adult!The art style for this is VERY dated, but for a 1969 movie, it flows nicely. The animation is a lot smoother than most movies around that time and the errors in the end outcome are very little (only minor missing details that would be hard to even see with the...video quality anyway).The music is VERY addicting and is easy to sing along to.

Like many early anime movies this one is also very influenced by early Disney animation mixing comedy, songs and a morale to teh story.The art is fine for the year it was made but not the best compared to some of its contemporaries, the music nothing memorable but it does it's job represnting the situations and characters in a musical movie style.The story mostly follows the main plot of...the tale with some added elements such as booted cat being an outlaw among the cats for saving a mouse so between the movie we see him being pursued by the Three Blunderers which adds some comedy and action to the original story.I suppose it was a successful movie in its time since it were mede a follow up movie and a TV series which explains becoming the mascot of Toei.I recommend it to watch for young kids since the story, action and comedy are well fitted for them. the tale with some added elements such as booted cat being an outlaw among the cats for saving a mouse so between the movie we see him being pursued by the Three Blunderers which adds some comedy and action to the original story.I suppose it was a successful movie in its time since it were mede a follow up movie and a TV series which explains becoming the mascot of Toei.I recommend it to watch for young kids since the story, action and comedy are well fitted for them."", ""As a young child, I used to watch this movie all the time and loved it. Even today, I like to watch it and as an old anime-style movie, it is is a classic to me. The catchy main song is still stuck in my head to this day.I had the English dub version of the movie on DVD and didn't watch the original Japanese version but I still think that the voice actors did pretty well, especially for the time period it was made in.Made from TOEI Animation, was a crisp animation with a good plot/story and fun characters. I don't know if...many people even watched the movie because it is old but I recommend that everyone watch it!*FUN FACT: TOEI Animation's mascot is one of the main characters of this movie!!! many people even watched the movie because it is old but I recommend that everyone watch it!*FUN FACT: TOEI Animation's mascot is one of the main characters of this movie!!!"", ""Here's the question that i want to ask you guys: You know that mascot that appears in a Toei Animation logo anytime a show made by Toei Animation is shown? Like One Piece, Dragon Ball, GeGeGe No Kitaro or even Precure? You know that Puss-In-Boots cat that's shown every single time?You know that character, right? Well, what if i told you that this well-known mascot nowadays actually has not one, not two, but THREE animated feature films made in the 60s and 70s?You heard me right. Three films about the mascot himself. and this film is one of them.Nagagutsu wo Haita Neko is an animated...feature film made and released in 1969 by Toei Animation (Originally Toei Doga). This is the 15th feature-length they've producedThe movie became an instant hit and it was even placed in a list of 150 animated films and series of all time by Tokyo's Laputa Animation Festival in 2003.So just by hearing this, this must be a good movie, right? Well, yes. It is a pretty good movie! And here's why:The story is about a cat named Pero. Who wears boots (obviously) and a musketeer clothes and a very gentle swordman who's willing to help people out whenever he can with his brilliant plans up his sleeves.However, he got into trouble because he was sentenced to death because... Well, he just spared a mouse's life. Yep, and the cats really hates that. Luckily, Pero found his way to escape his execution and embarked on a journey. From there, he meets a boy named Pierre, a gentle orphan who got kicked out the house from the people he worked for.With theses two together, Pero would help out Pierre whenever he can. When Pero learns about the news of the Princess named Rose, who's looking for a husband, Pero became determined to make sure that Pierre is the one who will become hers.But there's a problem, Lucifer (And no it's not the devil himself), the big and tall ogre wants to get his hands on her and force her to be his wife. If she don't, he will threatens her father to a terrifying demonstration of the darkness that will befall his country in three days.Pero, was dumbfounded when he heard this conversation that he decided to do what it takes to prevent him from getting his hands on her and make Pierre as Rosa's husband.As you can see, the story is pretty good so far. It tells the story about Pero's willingness to help a person whenever he can and Pierre, who must face his fears and doubts and become a man.It definitely has that same magical charm that many old Disney films usually have back in the 30s, 40s, 50s and even the 60s. A fun and lovely adventure that it's easy to watch and fun to see.The same thing can be said about the animation. For a 1969 film, it looks fantastic! You see alot love and efforts put into this movie. Many of the animations were done by many of the key animators who worked on certain scenes. Such as Yoichi Kotabe, Yasuo Otsuka, Reiko Okuyama and the most interesting of them all, Hayao Miyazaki. The most famous anime director in animation industry who co-founded Studio Ghibli and brought us many of the best animated feature-length films such as Laputa: The Castle In the Sky, Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.So seeing how much smooth and nice looking the animation and the backgrounds look is pretty impressive!For the characters, they are also very well written and well developed. First you got the main character, Pero. What i love about this cat is how gentle he is and always determined to help out people with his plans he can come up with. Even the voice actor, Susumu Ishikawa (Who's known for being a well-known anime singer) gives out a wonderful performance that makes the character shine even more than it already needs to.Then there's Pierre, who's a very shy boy who becomes friends with Pero along the way. Even though he's not easy to talk to girls, he does what he can to take a step forward and become the man who will marry a girl. You also have Princess Rose, who serves as a love interest for Pierre to talk with. She's not much of a interesting character as the others, but she can be cute as well.There's also the bandit rats, who also appear alongside with Pero and Pierre, who also helps out them in certain situations they're on. They are funny, cute and can be useful to take on some problems that Pero, Pierre and the mouses come along the way.There's also three cats who serve as Pero's enemies that he has to avoid from being captured and sentenced to death. They don't have names, but they are quite funny. Especially the little one who gave me laughs anytime he tries to attack Pero.And finally, you have the main villain, Lucifer. The main villain of the movie, who wants to marry Rose, but can't due to his nature, attitude and appearance. Which he gets frustrated easily when she keeps refusing his proposal. He's quite a goofball, as he tries to entertain her with his powers to transform into animals, but none of them works. The guy can also bring me lots of laughs as well.For the sound, while there can be some audio hiccups, it still gets the job done with the quality that it got.The music is wonderful, you have many background musics that kept me loving it. But then you have the songs, which makes me believe that it's a musical anime film (somehow). They are not bad by all means, but they're nothing special, either. Although the opening sequence's song is pretty catchy. Sang by Pero's seiyuu, it gives a wonderful song that still keeps inside of my head.For the seiyuus, they all did a good job as well. Like i said, Susumu Ishikawa gives an wonderful performance for Pero. As well as the others such as Toshiko Fujita as Pierre, Kazuo Kumokuro (GeGeGe No Kitaro's singer) as the boss mouse, Asao Koike as Lucifer and more.If there's anything about this film that i can say about it is that i still cannot believe that it's not a Disney film! I had a great time watching this film even as an adult and a fan of japanese animation in general.Not only this is a wonderful film that kids and Adults can enjoy, this is also a wonderful film that definitely deserves the praise that it got in Japan.Though it's just a shame that nobody has seen this film outside of Japan and people nowadays when they think of Pero, they now think of him as a evil cat who always abuse the copyrights infrigement. Which can be understandable, but we have to just blame mostly the company that does this and not the animators or the staff that works on theses movies and TV shows.But i'm not going deep into that kind of crap, i'm just giving my review on this film.But overall, this is indeed a pretty good movie in it's own way. The story is simple to follow, but still pretty good, the characters are very memorable, the sound is good as well, the animation is fantastic and i had a good time watching this anime.SO i can give this anime an 8 out of 10. If you're a fan of japanese animation or japanese films in general and you're looking for a good old fun movie with your kids, then i'd say, watch this film. It's worth it.Anyway, my name's Diogo and this has been my review on Nagagutsu wo Haita Neko.

If she don't, he will threatens her father to a terrifying demonstration of the darkness that will befall his country in three days.Pero, was dumbfounded when he heard this conversation that he decided to do what it takes to prevent him from getting his hands on her and make Pierre as Rosa's husband.As you can see, the story is pretty good so far. It tells the story about Pero's willingness to help a person whenever he can and Pierre, who must face his fears and doubts and become a man.It definitely has that same magical charm that many old Disney films usually have back in the 30s, 40s, 50s and even the 60s. A fun and lovely adventure that it's easy to watch and fun to see.The same thing can be said about the animation. For a 1969 film, it looks fantastic! You see alot love and efforts put into this movie. Many of the animations were done by many of the key animators who worked on certain scenes. Such as Yoichi Kotabe, Yasuo Otsuka, Reiko Okuyama and the most interesting of them all, Hayao Miyazaki. The most famous anime director in animation industry who co-founded Studio Ghibli and brought us many of the best animated feature-length films such as Laputa: The Castle In the Sky, Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.So seeing how much smooth and nice looking the animation and the backgrounds look is pretty impressive!For the characters, they are also very well written and well developed. First you got the main character, Pero. What i love about this cat is how gentle he is and always determined to help out people with his plans he can come up with. Even the voice actor, Susumu Ishikawa (Who's known for being a well-known anime singer) gives out a wonderful performance that makes the character shine even more than it already needs to.Then there's Pierre, who's a very shy boy who becomes friends with Pero along the way. Even though he's not easy to talk to girls, he does what he can to take a step forward and become the man who will marry a girl. You also have Princess Rose, who serves as a love interest for Pierre to talk with. She's not much of a interesting character as the others, but she can be cute as well.There's also the bandit rats, who also appear alongside with Pero and Pierre, who also helps out them in certain situations they're on. They are funny, cute and can be useful to take on some problems that Pero, Pierre and the mouses come along the way.There's also three cats who serve as Pero's enemies that he has to avoid from being captured and sentenced to death. They don't have names, but they are quite funny. Especially the little one who gave me laughs anytime he tries to attack Pero.And finally, you have the main villain, Lucifer. The main villain of the movie, who wants to marry Rose, but can't due to his nature, attitude and appearance. Which he gets frustrated easily when she keeps refusing his proposal. He's quite a goofball, as he tries to entertain her with his powers to transform into animals, but none of them works. The guy can also bring me lots of laughs as well.For the sound, while there can be some audio hiccups, it still gets the job done with the quality that it got.The music is wonderful, you have many background musics that kept me loving it. But then you have the songs, which makes me believe that it's a musical anime film (somehow). They are not bad by all means, but they're nothing special, either. Although the opening sequence's song is pretty catchy. Sang by Pero's seiyuu, it gives a wonderful song that still keeps inside of my head.For the seiyuus, they all did a good job as well. Like i said, Susumu Ishikawa gives an wonderful performance for Pero. As well as the others such as Toshiko Fujita as Pierre, Kazuo Kumokuro (GeGeGe No Kitaro's singer) as the boss mouse, Asao Koike as Lucifer and more.If there's anything about this film that i can say about it is that i still cannot believe that it's not a Disney film! I had a great time watching this film even as an adult and a fan of japanese animation in general.Not only this is a wonderful film that kids and Adults can enjoy, this is also a wonderful film that definitely deserves the praise that it got in Japan.Though it's just a shame that nobody has seen this film outside of Japan and people nowadays when they think of Pero, they now think of him as a evil cat who always abuse the copyrights infrigement. Which can be understandable, but we have to just blame mostly the company that does this and not the animators or the staff that works on theses movies and TV shows.But i'm not going deep into that kind of crap, i'm just giving my review on this film.But overall, this is indeed a pretty good movie in it's own way. The story is simple to follow, but still pretty good, the characters are very memorable, the sound is good as well, the animation is fantastic and i had a good time watching this anime.SO i can give this anime an 8 out of 10. If you're a fan of japanese animation or japanese films in general and you're looking for a good old fun movie with your kids, then i'd say, watch this film. It's worth it.Anyway, my name's Diogo and this has been my review on Nagagutsu wo Haita Neko. Thank you for reading my review and have a great day.""]"
Monochrome Factor,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3656/Monochrome_Factor,"['If this show were a video game it would be terrible.  Thank your Wii\'s it\'s not.  Basically the story revolves around a typical guy, Akira, as he and his friends try to stop the onslaught of ""Kokuchi"" or shadow monsters from invading Japan and ultimately the world.  As you can guess, it can get pretty repetitive.  That\'s not to say, however, that you won\'t enjoy it, as humor seems to substitute for plot most of the time, which, in this case was a good thing.Story- 4Let me first say the pacing of this anime was awful.  As a...common rule enemies are supposed to get stronger as the show goes on, but halfway through it I realized that nothing was going to change- thus my video game analogy.  Sure, there\'s plenty of action to go around if you\'re okay with transformation sequences longer than the actual battle.  There were a few interesting battles scenes though the enemies were very, very generic.Like I said humor plays a very big role.  Expect to laugh even when Akira is slicing and dicing some Kokuchi.  Unfortunately, the humor does nothing to further the plot of the anime, though it does make up for it.  You would hardly guess that it was time for the finale to come around because of an utterly humorous go-lucky ending from the episode before it, which again is due to horrible pacing.  Luckily, the story, when it finally did pick up, was pretty satisfying and DIDN\'T have me thinking ""I waited twenty-somethn\' episodes for this?""Art- 6Nothing special.  Kind of generic.  There isn\'t a lot of blood and the effects are mostly an embellished digital.  I found some of the transformations laughable, but for the most part the art is consistent and mostly simple.  The character designs are okay, though you really have to decide for yourself if some characters are really that beautiful or if you\'re okay with Akira\'s mullet (IMO- I just wanted to chop it off!).Sound- 6Hits and misses.  Some pieces seemed like they belonged in the 90s while others conveyed the scene very well through piano.Characters-  7A very enjoyable bunch of character, albeit, shallow.  The basic characters are here: the bossy girl, the dumb blond, the ambiguous guy, the badass, the genius kid, the guy who can do everything, I could go on.  If you\'re annoyed by ditzy horny and/or violent women with high pitched voices you shouldn\'t watch this- but then again you\'re an anime fan so it\'s like you practically signed up for that kind of stuff anyway.  Still, the characters try their hardest with chibi scenes to put a smile on your face, so you can live with them.The series is also very ambiguous with relationships.  They had it all almost- shounen-ai, shoujo-ai and even shota.  Though none of them were expounded upon a great deal most of them had something to do with the plot, which can\'t be said for many other anime with these types of relationships.Enjoyment- 9Chances are you\'ll either be bothered by the pace or the character\'s antics, but that\'s exactly what makes this show fun to watch.  It\'s a fun little ride for fans of the actions genre (and doubly fun for those who squee at shounen-ai).  I found myself fully enjoying it and in the end humor won over the weak story.  That can\'t really be done for most action anime  which take themselves too seriously, so consider this a rare treat- at least where enjoyment is concerned.  Overall, it\'s a fair 6 for me. common rule enemies are supposed to get stronger as the show goes on, but halfway through it I realized that nothing was going to change- thus my video game analogy.

During the episodes, I still waited for something--anything at all to make it a good series. The only good thing about it is Shirogane. He was the only one in the entire series that had potential to be the shining gem. However he just became annoying along with the rest of the shallow and unpolished characters. I have to admit though, for making such uninteresting characters, they sure did know how to make them all equally annoying.The novelty of BL in this show would be the only reason it...might attract a few viewers but the actual content of it (none) irks many away unfortunately too late as they are usually mostly through with the series.The actual story is the old classic: ""This is a complete accident but hey you\'re the chosen one anyhow so it\'s okay!"". Oh and guess what, some of the characters get their own \'transformation sequence\' and I guess the producers wanted you to damn well know how they do it because it happens in each episode all the way through. On a side note I would like to say how utterly pointless the scenes before the actual story line (a few episodes in, you\'ll understand). They are neither funny nor amusing, or anything close to having wit.Now, the opening and ending credits are actually very beautiful. They were very well done and it may have been the only thing keeping me going throughout the series, that along with the soundtrack. For those of you fans of music, you may want to look around for the OST.Last but not least, the art. As I mentioned before, the opening and ending credits are beautiful, and I can actually say that the art style was fairly decent, however, side views are still--erm--odd. In front view, none of the characters have noses.Overall the series gets a 2. Instead of watching this series, I would suggest watching (or re-watching) Loveless. might attract a few viewers but the actual content of it (none) irks many away unfortunately too late as they are usually mostly through with the series.The actual story is the old classic: ""This is a complete accident but hey you\'re the chosen one anyhow so it\'s okay!"".

And I'll start with this one. OK so, I picked up this title because most sites have this series pegged as a “shounen-ai” anime. But really? Is it really Shounen-Ai AKA Boy's Love? Because I don't see much “LOVE” in this series...at all. What I do see is one character, the lanky fem [and it's always a fem] character endlessly throwing himself at the main character, with no reciprocation whatsoever. This show has as much BL elements in it as X/1999 [X-TV] by CLAMP does And if no one views X [X/1999] as shounen-ai, then Monochrome Factor isn't...really shounen-ai either because it doesn't offer any true BL for anyone who appreciates that genre to enjoy. And once you remove this from the series, what have we got left, really?~ARTConsidering that this show was made in 2008, only THREE years ago! I would have to give the animation for this series pretty low marks. There are anime from the 80s with much better, much more impressive and innovative animation [Akira, Macross just to name a few] than what Monochrome Factor has to offer. The art looks very flat, cheap, low-budget...at least to me. Then you have the choppy animation sequences and frequent drops to the even cheaper looking chibi-mode with plain backgrounds, a lot of still frames with the blurred backgrounds [used for the fighting scenes] and of course the recycled changing sequences [which are totally unnecessary after the first 3-4 times we've seen it]. Monochrome Factor doesn't really give you a lot of scenery to look at either. They tried to do an Beach/Island Paradise episode and they might have well have been at a backyard pool party.~SOUNDCan't say that I recall if there was any music during the series beyond the OP and ED themes....and those were both pretty generic. I watched the show in Japanese dub, it was OK. Just OK, though.~STORYOMG what story??? Each episode was basically the same thing!!! Don't get me wrong, I can totally appreciate the concept that they were probably aiming for, perhaps something of a BL series that really wasn't centered around the angst and turmoil of being attracted to the same sex or being gay. I can appreciate the intention at least, but if this is supposed to be the finished product.....then no, not so much. For all sakes and purposes this show might as well have been an American cartoon, There is an overall theme, yes, which is  much like G.I. Joe or Teen Titans, but what lies beyond that theme? Not a whole lot.There always seems to be hints of a bigger story popping up here and there but the series never delivers on the promise. Like most anime shows, the source is probably a manga and I'm sure the characters have more depth and dimension there but I'm only scoring the anime at this point, which again gets a low score, because of the dumbness. Another example, the Butler episode was just as dumb, if the rich boy, Haruka—isn't that a girl's name—didn't like the idea of the Butler's friend getting fired....then why didn't he just hire him as a second butler for his own house....or for one of his many houses? And there are many many episodes like this that grates on my nerves a bit.Even though this show has some moderately good points, namely the comedy and the hint of BL elements, Monochrome could have been hacked down to 12 episodes....Maybe even a 4-part OVA easily!~CharacterPretty one-dimensional if you ask me. I can see why a lot of people got irritated by these characters. They have no depth, no meaning: Akira = anti-social/rebel guy, Ken = Dumb Jock guy, Aya = the bitch, Shirogane = the flaming goth-guy...etc. etc, bleh! Homer and Marge Simpson have more layers than these guys. And yet, the anime is steadily fixated around these guys. You don't see secondary characters unless they are going to be possessed by those shadowy centipede looking demons. Even when the world is ending in episode 22, with all the huge tornadoes and red lighting, absolutely NO ONE is seen running out of the buildings or cars, you only see the main characters. And that's all you'll ever see: the good guys, the bad guys and the victim to be possessed per episode.The characters were nice looking, but poorly coloured and shaded, which is why I think they look so cheap to me, because not a lot of effort went into the colouring and shading and it pretty safe to say that the character design came from the manga....tho I've never seen it. I also hate the fact that they're always wearing the same clothes, I know I'm being kinda petty at this point, but it still bugs me, if the show was any better I might have overlooked it.~VerdictSometimes I can feel an underlying irritation when I watch anime, and I'm not quite sure what it is exactly but it mostly comes up with shows like this one. Where there's no plot, but not only is there no plot, the art is underwhelming....and then there's all the Euro-pandering going on, ie., big western-styled homes and this “aristocratic” behaviour which is NOT common to Japanese people whatsoever. And WTF with the whole butler thing....like, really? Frankly I was intrigued in the beginning and and then mildly interested again by the end, around episode 22....but all that shit in the middle I could have done without, they could have used all those episodes to develop the characters, maybe create a deeper bond between Akira and Shirogane or maybe an Akira X Kendo storyline. Something to make this anime interesting, but no...they didn't, so the only thing that's really “awesome” about this series is the title itself: Monochrome Factor. really shounen-ai either because it doesn't offer any true BL for anyone who appreciates that genre to enjoy.

Both of them, together with Akira\'s peers, fights to defeat darkness which are mostly in the form of kokuchis. However, It\'s somewhat predictable as to what might happen in the first 15 episodes of this anime?[spoiler]A character will appear in that particular episode. Wallow in sadness for their whichever reasons. And suddenly, taking...advantage of their situation, someone will appear and plant kokuchi(s) in their body hence, making them transform into a monster. However, they\'ll definitely transform back to normal with the help of Akira and Gang.There was a twist to the story but unfortunately, the most exciting part of the story came to an abrupt halt at the final episode. It kind of leaves you hanging there. Perhaps, there might be a second season to this. [/spoiler]Characters (6.5):Don\'t get me wrong that the characters are boring. The reason as to why I\'d give the characters a 6~7 score is because i felt that there was a lack of development in relationship between Akira and Shirogane. If you\'re a yaoi/shounen-ai fan like me, you will most probably be disappointed by this anime. Yes, I\'m here because I\'m into shounen-ai/yaoi and therefore, I\'m here to warn of those who might be cheated to watch this anime cause of its genre.The main character, Akira, is surrounded by a group of friends that\'s got extremely interesting personalities. They\'ve got really laughable actions that gives this a Humour level of (7) to me. Watch this anime not for the un-promising shounen-ai genre but more for the foolish things that these group of youths will do and how they will save the world from ""darkness"".  (-. -) I felt that the bond between all of them as friends were much stronger than that of ShiroXAkira. As for the Antogonists, there was only a small amount of them. Therefore, I was hoping for them to posess more powers. I was also looking forward to more actions and less setting up of booby traps (kokuchis. kokuchis. kokuchis.) to defeat Akira and gang.Overall (6.5)I\'d give it a 6.5 in overall for the humorous studs & cranky female characters and the drawings of the character. The sound was okay - nothing amazing in particular. If you\'re those that\'s for light-BL anime, you can go for it. Don\'t expect too much of this anime but just enjoy the humor and see how this group of friends come together to save the day from being engulfed by darkness. advantage of their situation, someone will appear and plant kokuchi(s) in their body hence, making them transform into a monster.

I had high hopes for Monochrome Factor when I read the synopsis, but unfortunately the experience turned out to be mediocre at best.The story was weak and predictable. It had all of the elements it needed to succeed, but anything they could have developed and used to their benefit, they completely ignored. Above all though, what destroyed this show can be narrowed down to one horrible mistake.The comic relief. And really, it can\'t even be called relief, because they never left it to begin with.

In the series there's some episodes that are alike, when they just have to fight the shadow monsters, but the ending was very good. The character Shirogane was the most interesting person. I think it's a good story, allthough in the middle it gets boring, but you just have to watch it till the ending. "", ""*NOTE* I know some of you may enjoy Shounen-Ai, and I have nothing against you, but I hated seeing one of my favorite mangas of all time reduced to this... shit.Story (7) : Like I said I totally LOVED the original plot. Fighting kokochis to save the world from darkness? Check. Akira being pissed at Shirogane? Check. Oh and let's not forget Akira falling in love with Shirogane, even though they pretty much despise each other, and Haruka. WTF?! That ain't in the manga. And they COMPLETELY MISSED RYUUKO AND HIS RELATIONSHIP WITH SHIROGANE!!! That was my favorite part of the manga and they completely...THREW IT OUT THE FUCKING WINDOW. Oh sure, Ryuuko appears at the end, but for those who didn't read the manga, they don't even know why the fuck he's there. The plot was killed once they met Haruka, no, maybe even before that. Maybe the kiss scene? AGH.Art (7) : Well I don't have too many complaints here. I just put a 7 cuz I just like the manga style better. The chibis are especially funny and the other scenes... well their okay.Sound (3) : Alright, I may be wrong here, cuz of my suckish headphones, but the sound is so... mechanical, and it sounds like robots.Character (5) : Now I have a fight to pick here. Haruka. WHO THE FUCK IS HARUKA?! He is a crybaby rich boy who doesn't do ANYTHING except whine and drag the plot down. HE'S NOT EVEN IN THE MANGA. Also, Ryuuko didn't have much time to shine, and you don't even hear his name! >:T Akira hates Shirogane, then in the end kisses him. WTFAREWRONGWITHANIMATIONCOMPANIESTODAY?!Ahem.

Fortunately excellent voice acting, nice artwork and hilarious characters are all able to save the series from a complete failure.Story - 6/10The story is a common one. Ordinary highschooler meets mysterious stranger and gains mighty powers with which he has to save the universe. Of course, his friends join him in the quest. And we can\'t forget that he has a destiny.As if the plot wasn\'t bad enough, the entire series seemed to drag on, especially when it came to...the fights. Not even half of the episodes had any real relation to the plot and the ""real"" evil was only revealed in the last episode, where it all seemed awfully rushed. This could have been done a LOT better!The major downside of Monochrome Factor is, that the manga was not finished by the time that the anime was made. Therefore what we get is something that can be compared to the first Fullmetal Alchemist series; it starts out promising, but takes a wrong turn.Art - 8/10As a fan of this genre, I liked the artwork of the characters. The artwork was slightly different than other shonen-ai series I had been watching and it was really nice. The background art was a bit generic though, but I like the way the characters were drawn, as at least that point stayed true to the manga. I found the transformation scenes rather silly, but overall, the artwork was just as I liked it.Sound - 8/10I do not remember much of the background music in this series, which drags this down to an 9, but the ending themes and voice acting was top-notch:Daisuke Ono as Akira, Hiroshi Kamiya as Kengo, Junichi Suwabe as Shirogane and Katsuyuki Konishi as Kou. Those are just the voice actors that I can remember. The entire cast of this series was absolutely wonderful. And the ending, oh the ending! I absolutely adored the first ending, sung by Ono and Kamiya. Overall, wonderful.Character - 8/10Apart from being a bit flat, the characters where humorous. You have a wide range of characters with each its own personality. I especially enjoyed the interaction between Akira and Kengo, the childhood friends and between Akira and Kou, who has also have a relationship from far back (no spoilers!).Unfortunately, this once again leaves me wanting more. I want to know more, especially about Akira\'s past and how he and Kengo first met Kou (which is a rather important part of the manga). Also, I slightly dislike the personality of Shirogane as he constantly flirts with Akira, something which I found non-existant in the manga.Enjoyment - 9/10Apart from dragging on too long, Monochrome Factor was able to keep my attention with its constant joking. Also, the appearance of Kou in the opening left me wanting to know who he was (funny how much 5 seconds can leave you wanting more).Through the first half of the series, it was mostly the funny shonen-ai moments between Akira and Shirogane that kept my interest, as well as Kengo\'s silly personality. During the second half, it was mainly the flirty Kou, who kept my interest up.Again, the reason I can enjoy the series so much is because I always enjoy series with good voice acting which can leave me watching it over and over again. So far, I have watched Monochrome Factor from beginning to end 4 times and I still have not grown tired of it.Overall - 8/10Despite the shallow and rather ridiculous plot, the series is saved by a wonderful cast of characters and a good dose of shonen-ai hints for the fangirls. This is not a series for people who wants a deep plot and serious characters, but rather for girls who likes a lighthearted and funny story with lovable characters.As a last recommendation, for those who enjoyed the series and wishes to know more about the series, read the manga!

It's been a while since I've looked for anime that'd be capable of pulling me thoroughly into its realm, alas this disappointed me.

"", ""I watched this a few years ago, but the fact that I still remember the plot and characters is something to comment on.Story~ 6/7Monochrome Factor is one of those animes with a decent set up for a plot, but the build up to the end is rather tedious. For the first 4 episodes or so, you get a real feel for the kinds of characters you're going to be with for the next 20. Unfortunately, despite this solid beginning, the following episodes do tend to be predictable; the protagonist fighting the bad guys, except there's a twist in how he does it, or maybe they'll...span it over two episodes instead.That was one of the bigger let downs, because I did fall in love with the characters. They did contribute a lot to the comedy of the show, which did compensate somewhat for the dryer episodes.Characters ~ 8The gang of 4 (plus 1 in later episodes) are an epic team with different strengths and weaknesses, which makes them so effective together, and you really can't imagine them without each other. Akira is a kid with attitude and gives a whole new meaning to leading a double life. I adore the concept of him switching between a normal and shadow form, though it's not a new idea. It's more than just changing outfits and new hair colours, but you can see the differences between his two forms without losing his character. The others all contribute to a fantastic four; the best friend, Kengo, doubles up with Akira, and is the comedy behind the show. Shirogane certainly spices the show up, with his near-yaoi nature and his quirky personality. He can also get a bit dark, which is refreshing to see. And we can't have an anime without a girl, right? Aya fills in that role, and fortunately she's not one of those chicks lavishing in this harem, but she has a real kick-ass side to her. The character development for all of them is definitely noticeable, although subtle for some.Art~ 7You know, it's just generic anime style, right? Nothing as impacting as the fight scenes in Sword Art Online, or characters as cleanly designed as Hyouka, but it's a solid art style to be appreciated.Sound~ 7I for one, loved the opening track, but that is all that left a significant mark. The instrumental throughout wasn't memorable, but they did fit the scenes relatively well. Nothing to be overly praised, but certainly acceptable.Enjoyment~ 8Overall, despite the somewhat disappointing carry of the plot and the plain animation, I did enjoy the anime and didn't regret finishing it.

Most of the battles were the same, and while exciting in the beginning got boring quickly. This anime's strong suit would be comedy though. It was quite funny most of the time, and the characters were pretty good. Plenty of bishonen to oogle at too, but that's where the positives end. I don't regret watching it but it definitely wasn't the best series I've seen. "", ""Let me first state, the manga is better. I haven't even gotten halfway in the manga and it's much better than this. Review time.Story - 6 - The story...was a little neglected. There were bits and pieces that were like the original story of the manga but other than that, it was mostly filled with fillers. The anime actually resolves mostly around a character that was made just for the anime. He did appear at all in the manga, so, most of the manga was left out and a lot was added in. It was actually a poor job of substation.Art - 8 - I...liked the art, it had a nice and clean look to it as well as stayed consistent, quality wise. All the characters looks were like how they were in the manga, even the style was like the manga. So they get good points for that. They somehow made the completely new character seem like they could belong to the manga.Sound - 9 - The opening and ending fit well with the anime and the story. Even if that story was completely made up from the manga. I actually would find myself singing along with the opening. The voices also all suit the personalities and looks of the characters, I have to say that all the voices matched. And the sound effects fit well with the visual effects. So, at least the sound was well thought out.Character - 9 - Since most of the character traits were from the manga, I have to say that I liked them. Each person was their own and nothing seemed of the norm when it came to characters, except one or two. It rarely showed side characters who appeared more than once in an episode. Most of the characters shown were all of the main or supporting class. The interactions between the characters was genuine and settled well with the mood and plot.Enjoyment - 7 - Like I said before, the manga is better. So my enjoyment with the anime was a little on the low. I liked watched it at some points and others, it lost me and took me a few days to get back into it. I eventually did get bored with the repetitiveness of the different scenarios. The only time something exciting happened was when Shirogane was involved, and that was often rare. Those events usually happened near the end of the show. Personally...it lost my enjoyment about halfway through.Overall - 8 - I personally did not like the anime, now that I am finished with it, I am eager to continue the manga to I can know what REALLY happened. So, to those who are fans of the manga, I recommend just ignoring this anime, for it will not be like the manga and will just bore you. To those who have not yet read the manga but are looking to watch the anime, I suggest you forget about the anime and just go read the manga, for it is much better and contains a lot more information than the anime provides.There is my review. I hope this is helpful to those who are looking to watch this, cause really, I don't want you to waste your time on this when you could spend it on the manga. liked the art, it had a nice and clean look to it as well as stayed consistent, quality wise.

Good v Evil, Light v Dark, MC must prevent the impending destruction of the world. Nothing exactly groundbreaking and easy to swallow. However this show fails massively with the pacing of the story. Monochrome Factor is a 24 episode anime however if you actually look in detail only really about 8...of the 24 eps actually move the story forward and the rest are filler eps. The filler eps follow a generic pattern of the MC encountering an issue for the first half of the episode then have the other half fighting monsters. There ARE so many eps which you could've missed all together and not missed anything important story wise -_-Also if you're watching for the shounen-ai aspect, don't bother with Monochrome Factor unless you're like really desperate. You'll get jokes about it, but the actual Shounen ai is very very light.ART = 7Monochrome Factor actually has nice character design. There are a lot of characters in this anime so you do see a lot of well drawn characters. The artwork for the background are nice as well and there are a lot of different settings which is nice. There are a lot of comical scenes and they are really done well with the art style in Monochrome FactorSOUND = 6Nothing really that special, quite a generic soundtrack. Fast paced dramatic music for action sequences and comedic music for the more comical scenes.CHARACTER = 8This was actually a strong point of Monochrome Factor. The characters you are introduced in Monochrome Factor are fun and lighthearted. You have the Tsundere like MC, the tomboyish girl of the group, the idiotic best friend, the mysterious cool guy, the hot guy and of course the kid genius. The characters interact really well together and the voice acting of the characters is quite good. As I mentioned before the series is 24 eps so you do meet a large variety of other characters and some of these characters are more well written than others but still great in their own way.ENJOYMENT = 6I love to watch anime and I love to marathon many episodes in one night, however in the case of Monochrome Factor I could not. It actually took me more than 2 weeks to finish Monochrome Factor. After watching 2 filler episodes I had to take a break and watch something else. It was simply too boring and repetitive. The final few eps did capture my attention and I did watching in suspense so the story did have it strong point at time.. The comedic scenes are another saving grace of this series, they do make you laugh and are genuinely funny.OVERALL = 6Overall this anime IMO is disappointing. I did have high hopes considering the amount of perfect 10 I saw before but for me this show did not deliver.

The anime shares this basis of action and supernatural elements with the manga. Unfortunately, the adaptation differs considerably in many ways from the manga by Sorano, Kaili.Story: Poor pacing, too focused on comedy and the plot is often unnecessarily stretched (4/10)The student Akira loves to get through his school day relaxed. But fate already has other plans for him. The fact that his classmate Aya teases him with lectures and uses him as a bodyguard for a night-time visit to the school is rather harmless. However,...with the arrival of Shirogane-sama, his life suddenly becomes more turbulent. The balance between light and shadow seems to be out of whack. The lower beings from the shadow realm (Kokuchi) increasingly threaten the people. So a small group gathers around the two protagonists and takes on the fight against the shadows. Unfortunately, the deviations from the original are not very beneficial for the anime. The first episodes are exciting and even the ending can be called satisfactory. But the entire middle section, roughly 16-17 episodes, is quite boring due to predictability, and even some good and subtle jokes and comedy can\'t mitigate that. The plot and the anime as a whole lacks a good balance. The comedy almost comes across as self-deprecating due to its preponderance and the plot only manages to build up tension as a counterpoint at the beginning and towards the end. The manga is passably average and for fans perhaps a little more. The anime adaptation, on the other hand, is simply badly written, as it takes over and even reinforces negative aspects of the manga, especially plot holes. In addition, a lot of time is wasted on superfluous things and as a result the characters\' portrayals suffer. As is so often the case, the end is a matter of opinion. There are arguments that call it both appropriate and unsatisfactory. However, the latter tends to prevail in the context of the overall impression.Characters: Good at first, but lacking background & substance given the number of episodes (4/10).The cast is more extensive than in the original. Since the story was changed, something had to be added. The characters are typical of the genre and basically not bad, but the villains in particular lack the depth one might expect from 24 episodes.Nikaido Akira:Actually a gifted teenager but he prefers to relax on what he thinks is a boring day at school. Therefore, he takes every opportunity to play hooky and avoids getting involved in anything whenever possible. His cool ""it\'s none of my business"" mentality, however, is severely disrupted when a mysterious man enters his life.Shirogane-sama:Cool character somewhat mysterious, eloquent and likeable. The little exchanges with Akira, when Shirogane-sama teases the young man eloquently, refreshingly direct and yet charming, are an entertaining and successful part of the comedy. Since it stays with allusions, it is basically too little to classify as ""yaoi"" or ""shounen-ai"", it remains more funny than serious. However, this part of the comedy is sure to put off many viewers.Suzuno Aya:She is the head of the school disciplinary committee and tends to use a kendo sword to emphasise her sense of justice. She is believable with the katana, but her character portrayal and development suffers because her role is overloaded with comedy elements.Asamura Kengo:Kengo\'s story has been revised. In the manga, he had a background and a twist that made him interesting. In the anime, however, he\'s sadly degraded to the usual comedy goof.Wagatsuma Shūichi (Master):The ""Still Bar"" (or ""Aging Bar"" for the manga readers) is the realm of the Master. Shūichi is the bartender and a very pleasant character (appearance and behaviour are very reminiscent of Sasakura Ryuu from the anime Bartender). He is friendly, helpful and his special abilities make him the healer of the small group. Unfortunately, his background is poorly sketched in the adaptation, so the manga is preferable in this regard as well.Kujō Haruka:Haruka was added for the realisation of the anime adaptation. His character is not a complete disappointment and fits well into the changed plot. Regardless, anyone familiar with the manga is right to wonder why the story was changed and this character added.Nanaya:Not the most colourful Shin, but not bad at all as a villain!LuLu:Cute but a bit colourless.Homurabi:A villain with style, unfortunately with too little screen time.Visuals: Art is okay, the animation is not, so overall not good enough to improve the rating (6/10)The drawing style of mangaka Sorano Kaili was well adopted by Suga Shigeyuki in the character design of the anime. However, due to the changes in the plot, some visual changes have been made. An example of this is the character design of Shirogane. His appearance and especially the facial features have been made slimmer and more feminine through various accents. This added beauty and attractiveness, also combined with the character\'s behaviour, certainly appeals to a larger female audience, but causes resentment like ""shounen-ai or yaoi"" among other parts of the fan base. The overall design of the characters is good and nice to look at, although I personally prefer the design in the manga.However, the animation by Studio A.C.G.T does not impress me. The animation is not bad in principle, the colour palette and the light and shadow effects are good for an anime from 2008, but several aspects lower the overall rating. On the one hand, the blurring as a frequently used technique is disturbing, especially in the action sequences. On the other hand, the constant super-deformation is distracting because it is simply used too often. Personally, I found the fights somewhat monotonous overall.Sound: BGM & OP are good, but the EDs are not, so overall only average (5/10)The background music was composed by Abo Takeshi and is well adapted to the plot. Unfortunately, this is precisely why the music is hardly perceived positively and therefore cannot improve the overall rating despite a good performance.The OP ""Metamorphosis"" by the indie metal band Asriel is a cool musical arrangement, the first bars calm and then continue with great rock sound and the beautiful voice of KOKOMI. This track was the breakthrough for the band, consisting of composer Kurose Keisuke and singer KOKOMI. The track is accompanied by a decent animation, matching the music! Unfortunately, the only bright spot.""Awake - my everything"" by the seiyū Ono Daisuke & Kamiya Hiroshi is used as ED in episodes 1-12 and 24. The animation is well done in black and white, but the sound is just too ""easy listening music"" and doesn\'t impress me at all.The second ED in episodes 13 to 23 is ""Kakusei - Light and Dark"", sung by the other two Seiyū Suwabe Junichi & Konishi Katsuyuki and is overall no better than the first ED.As always, I would like to conclude the sound section by talking a little about the seiyū, especially the second row. Among the male voice actors, I noticed Okiayu, Ryoutarou, who voices Homurabi. He has a great versatile voice, which he has already shown impressively in many anime. As an example, the role of Akio Furukawa in the anime Clannad immediately comes to mind.Among the female dubbing actors, I particularly enjoyed the voice of the charakter Aya Suzuno, who is spoken by Asano Masumi. She has a clear and direct pronunciation that suits the role well, and yet you don\'t miss the feminine charm. All in all, a very good performance.The anime has its moments, but the many plot holes lead to confusion. Furthermore, the content shown is simply dragged out too much by a multitude of fillers and superfluous chibi comedy. If you are looking for good or at least passable entertainment, you will surely be disappointed by this anime. Nevertheless, if you like the idea and the character design, I would recommend the manga, which is not excellent but better than the anime.As always, thanks for reading. with the arrival of Shirogane-sama, his life suddenly becomes more turbulent.

According to the dictionary, ""monochrome"" is an adjective that means a product produced in black in white. This explains the entire story. It is believed that everything that has been created has the opposite, black - white, good - bad, heaven - hell and light - shadow. The story deals with this belief and the main characters tries to balance it. With these so called monsters of darkness, the ""kokuchis"", Akira join forces with Shirogane to fight these monsters.Despite the fact the world is about the end because darkness will be taking...over the light, they still make it into a hilarious show. Even when u stop watching it, you could be still laughing considering the priceless jokes and amusing acts! This makes everything worth watching. The characters builds this atmosphere when everything goes wrong, somehow, they seem have to have the energy left to make things funnier.Overall, everything seems to be okay, there\'s a twist which seems to be quite interesting and makes the viewer to watch further, yet since there\'s only 24 episodes, the only thing we can do is to read the manga. over the light, they still make it into a hilarious show.

It could have been much more complex and diverse.The characters didn't have a real purpose or were undertaken random changes. Especially the main character Akira lacked a certain motivation for why he was fighting and randomly accepted things as they are, or at least only questioned things for a short time. Strange was the other side to Shirogane, which was introduced in the center of the story but it was never really picked up again. There weren't any significant development within any of the characters (maybe except for one)....Overall, the anime wasn't very enjoyable. It lacked suspense and the plot seemed to be somewhat made up on the way. If you've got better things to do, don't waste your time watching it. If you're really bored, it's fine to watch it.

I thought both of them definitely were a match made in heaven as a couple. I liked how Akira has his own dark ego to kick every bad guys ass he manages to get and it's like Shirogane is rooting for him to do his best. Im not gonna say what happened towards the end but damn my tea spilled with tears and anguish lol. I was so annoyed at the ending man, I want more goddammit!...Pretty decent shounen ai anime if you ask me!

My favorite character is Kengo. When I started watching the first episode, there was Akira and Aya I thought that they might become a pair but soon enough Shirogane comes and it was intriguing...his appearance and what he said. So I wanted to find out what this is about. Later that day Kengo arrives and drags Akira to the arcade. That moment itself I thought that he is a fun, funny and lovable person. I decided to watch the anime...and I did. I enjoyed all the 24 episodes like savoring a juicy fruit. In my opinion, this anime is better than its manga version. and I did.

It is not great writing, objectively, not a spectacular anime. Still rated it a 9 because of how much I love it and enjoy watching it, and rewatching it, and rewatching it to show it to others. I could not rate it a 10 and keep my dignity but I wanted to.It has that classic nostalgic feel of a slightly campy, cheesy, and cringey shonen-ai that wasn't Quite Brave Enough to actually canonize the main relationship in the anime. (There are kisses though! And the two main characters are insanely cute and funny when they interact!)...The main draw is NOT the romance though. It is, as far as I can identify, 3 things. 1. The gender envy I feel for Shirogane. 2. The comedy. 3. Surprisingly the plot??? Look. It has a simple outline right from the start. There are some plot holes. It's not the *best* writing. But. It really went hard on the character development and how it interacted with the plot specifically. AND it tied into the big twist (that I actually did not see coming btw even though I was Suspicious TM it wasn't too soon before the actual reveal, well, I thought it was Suspicious at first, and then the character development actually CHANGED MY MIND AND LULLED ME INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY, and then it made me cry.) Mega found family trope. The best (slight spoilers skip this sentence) redemption arc I've ever seen in anime. Reliably gave me Overwhelming Feelings. Now, this may be because it was exactly the content I needed at the particular points in my life that I watched this (when I was terrified of being unlovable and irredeemable) but like Wow That Is Some Effective Storytelling. The characters and their relationships are really what makes it though. And now I'm realizing I barely even talked about the comedy which is what initially hooked me on this series. It's funny. Like an endorphin flood.I am 20 by the way and not an overexcited 12 year old, which is what I realize I sounded like in this review. I just really love this terrible anime, okay? Please watch it, it is my precious comfort media I want to hug it like a stuffed animal and scold it for making me cry. The main draw is NOT the romance though.

Try Junjou Romantica, Haru wo Daite Ita, or Ikoku Irokoi Romantan.If you’re more into intriguing endings (for better or worse), try Mirage of Blaze (+OVA) or Ai no Kusabi (1992).And if you’re into tear-jerkers, I couldn’t recommend Fuyu no Semi more, which haunted me enough to watch Haru wo Daite Ita.But for the love of god, don’t get your hopes up with this thing.STORY: 5/10. Really nice, really interesting, really. The idea of working together to restore balance to light and darkness (of which kokuchi reside) was nice—but what would have given it more merit is if the execution...was better. Really. The pace at first was fast, introducing Shirogane in this mystic, borderline creepy way. He pops up in convenient moments wherever the main (bratty) character, Akira, is, and thrusts him into a pretty dangerous situation with a gentle smile and some flowery words about trusting him. But it quickly becomes formulaic, and with the lack of Shirogane/Akira moments, I quickly found myself skipping to the last episode, sadly.Which, although there was ONE new face, the ending was pretty much as unsatisfying as I feared. Which, I’d accept that from Loveless, given that there were 13 episodes or so, and the manga isn’t even complete. This thing had twice the number of episodes to get it right. Instead, it filled up the series with these episodic fillers that added absolutely nothing to the story and the real villain. All we had was his lackey who had—to varying degrees—the same song-and-dance every few episodes. But I get it. The manga didn’t finish until 2011, and this series was from 2008.The biggest offense was probably too-tsundere-for-my-shirt’s unnecessary magical transformation. Even if it’s just 15 seconds each episode…just why.CHARACTERS: 3/10. I smell 00s antics with this. Almost everyone fits into some stereotype. The brashly innocent-yet-unnecessarily-violent-almost-but-not-quite tsundere who feels the need to beat up anyone who either insults or embarrasses her, the ditzy-drunk too boy-crazy for her own good, the hapless guy who is almost always the butt of every joke and is the first to get taken advantage of, beaten, or otherwise incapacitated, the rich kid who knows nothing and wants to know more about the world, and the badazz MC with his devil-may-care attitude. Even the antagonists fit into some box, and just…it drags.The only character of interest to me was Shirogane, who played a balancing act between flirting and teasing Akira and remaining the only one dedicated to actually saving the world. Of course, when your allies are a bunch of high school kids, they can have only so much maturity, I suppose… (Although, that didn’t stop Ichigo from becoming a proper Shinigami in his own right, but anyways.)I’d love to include the bartender, but his role was strictly supportive. And, unfortunately, the shenanigans in the beginning of each episode were an excuse to fill him up on the latest ongoings. Which was more of a waste of precious space. Sigh.ART: 6/10. Probably this anime’s most redeeming quality, other than Daisuke Ono having a lead role. For the time period it was in, it wasn’t bad. (Of course, I’ve seen better (Case in point: 07-Ghost, Serial Experiments Lain, Read or Die, see above for BL), but there’s consistency, and the characters aren’t poorly drawn. They move nicely, and when it comes to Shirogane especially, the fine detail between the shimmer when he’s a “ghost” and the lack of shimmer when viewed in the company of spiritually attuned people is a nice touch. Still, it’s about average for early 00s anime.MUSIC: 5/10. Nothing to write home to grandma about. There might have been a moment or two when the OST stuck out at me, but it mostly blended with the episode. It also didn’t retract (or clash), which is a plus. The OP brought nostalgia, but I wouldn’t want to go out listening to it on Spotify.Overall: 5/10. Despite my harsh critic, it isn’t bad per se, it’s just…really, really not good. There’s a few moments where I felt satisfied or was startled into laughing, but as the series dragged on, so did my patience. Had the ending had some incredible development, or if Shirogane and Akira’s relationship grew stronger and/or more complicated, I would have gladly recommended it even if the plot didn’t progress much. But well.Let’s put it this way: it’s a good time waster. I’ve been trying to dip into the pool of nostalgia and watch all the BL animes from my childhood.

Murenase! Seton Gakuen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/40483/Murenase_Seton_Gakuen,"['----SPOILER FREE REVIEW----A T-rex professor, a homo girafe, an exhibitionist mole-rat, a hermaphrodite hyena, an unbreakable badger, a star panda, an ever-dying sloth and a pero-pero obsessed cute loli wolf. That’s just a little part of the mess that you can find in this hilarious and smooth anime.Murenase! Seton Gakuen or Seton Academy: Join the pack! has finally finished airing and damn, it was a blast all along.If you think that’s an uninteresting furry anime, you are missing something big time. Throughout my review I hope you will see this anime in a clearer light which is absolutely well-deserved.First a quick resume: Seton...Gakuen is a slice of life, comedy, school anime. Classic. Except there are only 2 humans in the entire school. Yes, all the other students are animals in the true sense of the word.The story follows Jin Mazama, our lonely human, as he enrolls into Seton Gakuen as a sophomore. Jin despite all animals (quite the height if you ask me), so what is his surprise when he encounters Hitomi Hino the beautiful second human-girl in the school. As his desires and dreams keep getting wilder, he stumbled across the path of a little pink ball of furry. That’s Ookami Ranka, our cute loli wolf whose dream is to build her own pack…starting with Jin!Now, let’s break out the different aspects:Story:The story itself is quite simple as most of the comedy/school anime. While the story is simple, the show stays quite entertaining because once in a while, when a new animal is introduced or do their “specific animal things”, the narrator explains the “Did you know…?” in a funny way with instructive chibby drawings. Still good to take that general knowledge while laughing and be like “Wtf…?” ^^’ You will have some good anecdote to tell your friends who wouldn’t have known that their friend is an animal expert.Not much left to say about the story but you do have quite some surprises along the anime that you wouldn’t have think of.  – 8/10Characters:The characters design is quite simple for the animals, but they hit right on the spot. If you have followed your biology courses in school and watched 1 or 2 animal documentary you should be able to recognize most of the species shown (“And what if I watched Interspecies reviewers?” -Keep your mouth shut, pervert)Frequently it’s just the head and the body design in the uniform that are representative of the animal. From time to time it’s a human figure but with an animal part (ears or tail for example) and occasionally the whole body is shown.All the cast is well written, they are faithful to their specific and respective animals’ characteristics, so it brings many elements of humor throughout the show. – 8/10Animation:Now that’s the point I want to bring up. Seton Gakuen’s animation is clean af. The backgrounds are okay but what strikes the most is the details and the diversity of the animations of the cast. Just go take a glimpse at the opening to give you an idea. Did you ever see a more animated opening? Just be careful if you are epileptic. At first look, it seems like a giant mess (which is quite right to depict the f big zoo that is Seton’s school) but once you look closer you can see all the little things that proves that some work had been put into it. A lot of work.The movements are fluid and it’s simply great. The faces of the member of the casts are very expressive and can display a wide range of emotions. Studio Gokami which has done anime such as Tsurezure Children and Kiniro Mosaic did a great job for this anime.One thing I also want to point out is the fan-service. Maaaan there is little fan-service in this anime, but it’s done damn good. Trust me when I say that soon enough there will be Hitomi doujinshis popping out faster than the coronavirus cases.– 9/10Sound:The opening song is very catchy, that’s what you expect for this type of show and it’s done good! Meanwhile the ending song is a little troll (ever wondered what a crying wolf sound like?).The VA are on-point, they really fit their character. Sometimes they try to make their own animal noises which is really funny to listen. (Watch the previews!) – 9/10Enjoyment:Overall, I loved Seton Gakuen. Watching it with my friends got us bursts of laughter and we just simply had a really great time.  – 10/10Conclusion:To conclude, Seton Gakuen is breath of fresh air in the comedy type of anime.  If you wanna have a fun time watching a short (but educational!) comedy filled with joy, love and drool from Ranka-Chan, why not grab your confinement kit and simply Join the Pack!!Thanks for reading!~ Walpurgies Gakuen is a slice of life, comedy, school anime. Classic. Except there are only 2 humans in the entire school. Yes, all the other students are animals in the true sense of the word.The story follows Jin Mazama, our lonely human, as he enrolls into Seton Gakuen as a sophomore. Jin despite all animals (quite the height if you ask me), so what is his surprise when he encounters Hitomi Hino the beautiful second human-girl in the school. As his desires and dreams keep getting wilder, he stumbled across the path of a little pink ball of furry. That’s Ookami Ranka, our cute loli wolf whose dream is to build her own pack…starting with Jin!Now, let’s break out the different aspects:Story:The story itself is quite simple as most of the comedy/school anime. While the story is simple, the show stays quite entertaining because once in a while, when a new animal is introduced or do their “specific animal things”, the narrator explains the “Did you know…?” in a funny way with instructive chibby drawings. Still good to take that general knowledge while laughing and be like “Wtf…?” ^^’ You will have some good anecdote to tell your friends who wouldn’t have known that their friend is an animal expert.Not much left to say about the story but you do have quite some surprises along the anime that you wouldn’t have think of.  – 8/10Characters:The characters design is quite simple for the animals, but they hit right on the spot. If you have followed your biology courses in school and watched 1 or 2 animal documentary you should be able to recognize most of the species shown (“And what if I watched Interspecies reviewers?” -Keep your mouth shut, pervert)Frequently it’s just the head and the body design in the uniform that are representative of the animal.

Besides, we’ve had other anime about the animal society in recent years such as Beastars. The problem about Seton Academy lies in its story execution and character cast. People may see this just another genre cliché milked by school academy tropes. When you combine that with an academy of animals, there’s hardly anything original about the storytelling. And you’d be right. When the audience first meets animal hater, Mazama Jin,...he’s nothing more special than an average teenager with a teenage crush on Hino Hitomi, who happens to also be a human. The story tries to adapt and evolve from its initial premise but never chooses an opportunity for development. That’s because his life is now gotten more chaotic than ever after being involved with an animal pack, led by the overenergetic wolf, Ranka.I really wish this anime had an auto-mute whenever Ranka opens her mouth. Being a wolf and fiercely protective of her territory, Ranka explifies just about everything I hate about children: loud, annoying, impulsive, and always tries to have her way. Watching her character behavior equates to watching a 5-year old fighting over food with their sibling. Unfortunately for Jin, he has to deal with her behavior on a daily basis. And that doesn’t even count the fact that she is a living object getting in the way of Jin professing his feelings to Hino. Speaking of which, Hino is thrown into the show as a nice type of girl; think of the ‘girl next door type’. It doesn’t take long for Hino to somehow also get entangled into the Ranka’s daily misadventures. To add fuel to the fire, the show somehow manages to throw her into embarrassing situations without batting an eye. The show doesn’t take time to truly develop either character or their relationship. It instead recycles the endless clichés over and over until it milks it dry.Honestly, I’m not particularly sure what type of audience this anime is aimed at. With minimal story direction, you’d think this appeals to slice of life fans looking for an extra dose of popcorn entertainment. But no, that’s not where the appeals lies. The show lacks the realism of a human storyteller. It puts overemphasis on the animal society that there’s no time to find life quality. Watching the series feels like the author wanted us to believe in this animal society, taking place in an academy. The animals takes on human roles such as the students and staff. But in reality, these character roles are deconstructed that results in an insufferable character cast. It challenged me to name one character that truly felt worth investing time into and in the end, I came up none.Then, there’s the problem with character relationships. Let’s start with the most normal, being the pair of Jin and Hitomi. This is nothing more than a fantasy daydream saturated with character delusions and idiotic fantasies. While many anime of similar genre follows the trend, this show somehow manages to add them without a shred of shame at any chance it gets. The more this show aired, the more these delusions became more like a way of adding extra TV time for each episode. On the animal front, delusions sometimes gets raunchy and suggestive as we have to remember that they behave just like animals. The anime also takes pleasure to show as much as fan service as possible when given the chance, such as with Ranka’s impulsive licking or Miki’s near naked outfits. The character relationship between Jin and Ranka is like compared to a babysitter and a baby. Jin literally has to hold her back sometimes to avoid public problems. Why? That’s because Ranka seems to have the mentality of a kindergartener. Oh and I’m afraid the rest of the cast isn’t any better. For instance, the female koala Shisho has the animal behavior of a sloth and you likely won’t remember a single dialogue in the episodes she’s in. Others such as Komori or Mei Mei fails to capitalize on their own character personalities to be something unique. When I watch either of them interact with others, it reminds me of elementary school, the days where children behave like annoying children. Even some of the more fierce and masculine characters such as the lions aren’t what I pictured them to be. It’s too bad really because this could have been a somewhat entertaining educational exploration of an animal society. But instead, the creators made this look like a horrible meme with unfunny gags and endless amount of idiocy.Somehow, I made it through this anime without smashing my TV screen. This show looked like one written by a zoo fanatic but completely fails to mesmerize the audience with their ideas. With little to no story direction and an absolutely insufferable character cast, it truly deserves the score it gets.

It's fun from start to finish. Always giving me a number of laughs throughout each episode. You can say for sure. 'I've joined the pack.' You should too!While it might be weird in some sense, seeing the characters the way they are. With males looking like the animals, and the females looking like humanoid versions of them. But I see that as something different and to stand out. As for the characters themselves. Ranka is just a delight, she's so energetic, and protective wolf. A loveable dumbass. The sloth is just pure laughs really. so is Yukari for...that matter. Hitomi is an angel, bless her. While poor Jin has to deal with all this, he's a good guy, but the way he reacts to things will always be funny to me.What I like about this show too, is that it stays true to animals in general, as in what real animals are like in sense of what they like and what not. I feel like that's a nice touch.The opening of the show is so catchy too, and it's a great listen. One of my favorite openings of the season for sure. It's so upbeat and great. Plus the opening itself is a laugh too. Ranka is speedy lol.The art is really great and well detailed. It really is good looking. The colours are bright and lovely to look at.Overall, you should check out this show! It's a bundle of laughs, and many more to come! that matter. Hitomi is an angel, bless her.

If I had to describe it in one word, I’d call it “dumb fun for smart people with refined taste and appreciation for wit.” Here’s what a comedy series should do to be a 10:- Out of all the animal-factoids-applied-to-a-humanoid-society shows of the last few years this one is easily the most ingenious in the way, well, in the way the animal trivia is applied to the humanoid societal circumstances and situations (taking into account that the end-goal here is making gags).- The comedy is consistently funny, again, because the gags are artfully built on the trivia...foundation. I repeat the same thing multiple times because it really deserves to be emphasized: THIS SHOW IS VERY, VERY CLEVER IN TURNING THE NATURE DOCUMENTARY MATERIAL INTO HUMAN SOCIAL INTERACTIONS. On top of that, it does not concern itself in the slightest with the pedantical adhering to reality (have I mentioned the comedy here is “absurdist”? Because the comedy here is absurdist). Instead, it liberally mixes scientific facts and urban legends based on whichever will be funnier in a given moment, and this unfettered approach works wonders. Yet, the show never fails to point out when a piece of trivia it uses is not real, which is also important for keeping it dapper.- The characters are likeable and their relationships are “investment-worthy” (believable and interesting to follow). Same deal as in the paragraph above, the characters’ personalities are based on either the real or the folklore traits of their corresponding animal base, and the exact degree of their “animalness” changes arbitrarily based on the necessities of a good joke. While the story’s format and the sheer number of the cast members doesn’t exactly allow for the super complex character arcs, everyone has a clearly defined personality, interacts with the other cast members in a logical way based on how their personalities match, and has some goals and aspirations that steadily progress as the plot progresses.- High-effort anime adaptation. The easy place to point this out is the OP/ED. The OP manages to convey every major character’s role in the story in just a few short seconds, while playing thematically fitting jungle music. The ED is simply a work of art. Things like these are your flags - whether you are familiar with the source material or not, they let you know that the anime adaptation’s creative team have put some actual effort and passion into their work. The source material here isn’t mindlessly copy-pasted or mindlessly abridged - things are reshuffled, rewritten and repurposed in order to work better in a different medium that has different strengths and limitations, while preserving the soul of the work. There is more than one case of an episode being stitched together from the parts of five different non-consecutive manga chapters (and I mean “different story arcs” kind of non-consecutive) and it looks completely seamless to a naked eye.9.5/10 for a consistently funny, thought-provoking, and high production values comedy series. foundation.

Interspecies Reviewers, RikeKoi, Eizouken, Oshi ga Budoukan, Bofuri and now Murenase! Seton Gakuen. This anime is by no means an absolute masterpiece, but it is really damn fun.The story follows Jin who lives in a world full of humanoid animals while himself being a human. Sadly, Jin absolutely despairs animals. It becomes even more complicated when Ranka, the cheerful wolf, wants Jin to join her pack. Jin at first refuses, but after the other human Hitomi creates a cooking club which Ranka calls her pack, Jin reluctantly joins. And with that, a bunch of...antics ensue, featuring dinosaurs, lion love stories and naked mole rat-girls.The characters are pretty okay. There is a wild variety of characters and the anime constantly adds new ones so that the character cast doesn't feel stale, but the main ones are pretty weak imo. Ranka can be whiny and Jin waaaay too synical, but both have fun remarks from time to time.The art okay, the sound is pretty good (the ED is so cute), but the thing that makes me love this anime so much is the charm. This anime is incredibly charming. Along with the fun cast, the anime also features plenty of animal facts. These animal facts then also aply to this anime which creates characters and a lot of good punchlines. The anime also does a bunch of extra little things to make the anime just a little bit special, like how the sloth is present but barely talks or else she loses too much energy, or how we constantly keep up with a lion love story, or when a speech buble appear the characters break the fourth wall and actually interact with the speech bubble, there was so much love put into this anime.So yeah, this anime is definition of fun. It does have some flaws here and there (like the annoying main characters), but those can be easily ignored for how charming this anime is.If you like highschool comedies, this will be right up your alley. antics ensue, featuring dinosaurs, lion love stories and naked mole rat-girls.The characters are pretty okay.

Seton Gakuen is a lighthearted school comedy, but in order to set it apart from the countless others of its genre, it needed a twist. So...the entire academy with the exception of the protagonist and his love interest are animals! Therefore I'm obligated to use awful animal puns. The show is simplistic but actually really howlarious, I'm not lion! It's a solid easygoing show and I ended up wolfing down each episode's classy comedy content.I had initially thought that this anime would lack depth and that it would slowly trudge on like a sloth, but it's littered with cute episodic stories that highlight each...of the characters. There's also some deeper meaty substance when it comes to the portrayal of the relationship between the animal hater Jin and the energetic wolf girl Ranka. I was surprised at how much I had fun with each episode and how they would even occasionally bring some depth to some of the characters. The show gets bonus points for actually bringing up some fun facts about animals from time to time. I have no idea if they're always valid, but I respect shows that can incorporate a bit of educational knowledge into their story without it being a hindrance to the actual narrative. And the way that the anime included some of the more humorous animal characteristics such as female hyenas having...*ahem*...BOTH privates really elevated the anime further. There's just a lot of koalaty to be found in Seton Academy!The cast of characters are a colorful bunch that really breath life into the show. Now there are a lot of them for a single cour anime, and it's true that most of them fall to the background after getting their own dedicated episode. But don't worry, this isn't a cat-tastrophe by any means. This isn't a narrative driven story but a comedy based one, and I believe that keeping each episode fresh by shining the spotlight on different animals each week kept the show engaging and fun. Whether it was Miyubi's constant deaths or Meimei's masochistic tendencies, there was always something enjoyable to watch. This exotic group causes a lot of pandamonium for Jin, who just wants to spend some time with Hitomi, the epidomy of femininity. Of course we can't forget the ever present wolf girl Ranka, who's sheer positivity and energetic nature were incredibly endearing. And you gotta love her licking and barking. Despite Jin's tsundere nature and claims that he doesn't like her, Ranka almost never loses her upbeat nature, which I appreciate. Though I guess that means she's not much of an aware wolf. This is a comedy anime first and foremost, and I believe that the success of such a show hinges on the quality of the cast. And while these aren't the most developed characters or anything, I'm pleased to say that I was thoroughly entertained by their antics.Now I know that I'm not a koalafied art critic or anything, but I found  the animation to be the weakest part of the anime. In the beginning, it just looks low budget, which is unfortunate, because the visuals probably turned a lot of people away from the show who probably would have enjoyed the actual content of the anime. But this anime did something incredibly rare, which is improve vissually as it went on. Maybe it's just me, but I thought that later episodes featured much more detailed art and pretty aesthetics. We get an assortment of cute character designs and many of the characters are pretty expressive. I just feel like the animation lacked consistency. On the flip side, I absolutely loved the voice acting since the beginning. The high pitched animal noises that the seyiuu were making were both hilarious and adorable. Especially Ranka, whose loud, high pitched voice ALMOST ventured into the realm of annoying, but it was just too cute to not like. And the way that she sang the ending theme song, voice cracks and all, was just so howlsome and precious!I'll conclude by addressing the elephant in the room, which is do I recommend Murenase! Seton Gakuen? I would say that it's quite the entertaining anime, and if you just want to watch something fun and don't mind some weird animal shenanigans, then I'd say go ahead and give this a shot. It's not purrfect by any means, but if you like a good school life comedy, animals, or a crazy combination of the two, then you should totally watch this anime and join the pack!

Oh but the girls have animal ears and tails this time, that's never been done before right?There's a reason why this show only has the male anthropomorphic animals with the females basically human girls badly cosplaying animals, it's for the cheap sex appeal to compensate for the uninspired writing.If they actually wanted to focus on just the animal fun facts or the 'comedy' and rely on that for a good experience, then there'd be no reason to have the female animals look...like girls in cosplay, but they don't, they're relying on the ecchi appeal to pull in the immature demographic for views.I've seen others comment on this show saying because it's a comedy it shouldn't be taken seriously, but in reality they're just making excuses for how bad the writing is and I bet you they aren't watching for the jokes.The comedy isn't even good either, most of it relies on Jin being a rude asshole to Ranka and most of the other students because he hates animals for some reason, despite living in a world where you can communicate with all of them!? Or cheap ecchi jokes, like the school president being a naked mole-rat girl who's embarrassed to wear clothes. Such an amazing pun that was clearly written for the laughs and totally not as an excuse for her strip constantly! Oh and she doesn't actually get naked either, she keeps her underwear on even in private with her other naked mole-rats, showing it's not about her species but instead for more cheap sex appeal and ratings.If ecchi and generic slice-of-life are your thing, then by all means watch this show. But if you're over puberty and looking for a show that does something new or has some substance to its writing/humour, stay far away from this garbage heap. like girls in cosplay, but they don't, they're relying on the ecchi appeal to pull in the immature demographic for views.I've seen others comment on this show saying because it's a comedy it shouldn't be taken seriously, but in reality they're just making excuses for how bad the writing is and I bet you they aren't watching for the jokes.The comedy isn't even good either, most of it relies on Jin being a rude asshole to Ranka and most of the other students because he hates animals for some reason, despite living in a world where you can communicate with all of them!?

And in the world of the anthropomorphized animal kingdom such as this, whether there\'s some form or (valiant) escape or not, this animal academy has it all, nooks and crannies that\'s enjoyable to the same degree. This is what this show encapsulates them all into one school comedic package that anyone can pick up and enjoy from start to finish. And for once, both the manga original source and anime are on par with each other.The story of humans being in the animal kingdom is relatively unheard of (unless when it comes...to prey and predator), but that\'s what happened to male MC Jin Mazama. Being someone whose abhorrence with animals has carried his senses from young, an animal school like Seton Academy wouldn\'t be his best shot (but decides to make the best anyway by finding human girls like love-interest Hitomi Hino) and make it out alive, all in one piece.ALAS, meeting someone coincidentally like Ranka Ookami the wolf just begs his sanity, and you\'d know when wolves like to mark people as part of their pack, is when Jin always marks Ranka as the ""irritable flea"" of the group (despite her calling Jin the ""boss""), but doesn\'t want her (licking) love shoved in his face. All in all, these animals which arrive by proceeding episodes all shoved into Jin and Hitomi\'s cooking club, as stupid and questionable as it sounds, makes for some fun comedy pertaining to each and every animal species\' quirks.Character-wise, it\'s easily a 50-50 combined win for this series. In the cooking club, from adorable Ranka to strong koala Komori and sloth Miyubi (who ALWAYS ""Die!"" out of comedic laziness) to cat-centric Kurumi, if it\'s taking the animal kingdom into the human context, it succeeds somewhat. Remember, ANY and EVERY animal is shown to great detail of how they resemble in real-life, bar none from some differences that are made to characterize (e.g. hyena-girl Yena who acts like a tomboy despite being female). To make the experience turn up a notch, the ""scientific"" narrations provide a great depth of knowledge based on the highlights of the animals shown and given time to mold their characterization (it was a good time learning from the humans\' standpoint as well). And of course, the lion-impala running gag moments of King Shishino and Shiho Ihara (by which if you\'ve watched the show, you\'d know what I mean). In all sense of the word, if animals are your thing, then this show can satisfy your eyes. The character category is why this show truly excels in its own right.With Studio Gokumi helming the production and Cygames being the overall producer, having that ""Uma Musume"" effect from 2 years ago still rings a lot in my head as far as memories of unique stand-out horse girls go, and this show is no exception. Clearly the Cygames effect just can\'t be outclassed when it comes to the specials of standouts from Seton Academy\'s footing to all of the character cast (plus the background notables). The same can be said on Studio Gokumi\'s side with good artwork and decent animation that overall, I\'ll give it a pass for not trying too hard, but having just enough to suffice for the inevitable that the series has offered, much more than actually showcasing the low budgets (which are STILL a sacrificial point, needless to say).The musical side though, it was decent overall while the only notable was the OP however. Trying to cram a lot of the key settings and the eccentricity of the characters in a song that\'s as unique as idol-centric music was a nice treat to listen to every week, and it did not get old. What got old was Ranka\'s ED, but really, a good effort for trying on VA Hina Kino\'s part to act on Ranka and her ""Ookami Blues"" putting a spin on being alternating between cheerfully happy and sad moments.All I can say is, it was fun while it lasted. School comedy in the animal kingdom sense is somewhat of a subgenre twist according to the settings here, but while there are hits and misses, generally this is a good show to relax to (while it\'s not on the Iyashikei side of things).

The character designs are interesting. The females have the ears and a tail while the males are just anthropomorphic animals. The comedy is fairly funny, but as we all know that comedy is relative so some may not like this. The Opening and Ending are both great. Opening is catchy with cool visuals. Ending is more sad lyrically, but the music is still good and is sung by Rankas voice actress.Story: So, we follow Jin Mazama who is one of the two humans in a school filled...with animal human hybrids, but the thing is he hates animals for the reason that a group of bears once bullied him. He accidentally hits Ranka with a pineapple of all thing during the welcoming speech. He later goes to the cafeteria and meets Ranka yet again but this time Ranka invites him to her pack. Of course he refuses but later on after another human Hitomi Hino joins Rankas pack and then Jin also joins. Hitomi creates a Cooking Club and all of them join in and also few other people Yukari Komori who is a koala and Miyubi Shishio who is a sloth. We follow them and their daily whacky adventures while meeting new people. We also got a tournament episode or as they call it ""a field day"" where every species can flex on other with their natural powers.This is a very funny and light-hearted comedy anime with of course many character who are waifu material.

It contains many things that I love and therefore is one of my favourite shows. It does deviate from its source material but then many adaptations do. You can only adapt so much in a tough industry.When I first noticed this show on the site before it aired I began to read the manga of which is ongoing. I am very pleased with how the show runs in this hilarious slice of life comedy in a school.I was immediately in the show itself happy to...see the dinosaur teachers they are just amazing.It is odd in some ways that the males are the animal and girls are demi-human but personally I have no complaints. This is especially hilarious with King Shishino and Shiho Ihara in their situation.A big shoutout for all the lionesses who are adorable.The story itself just revolves around Jin who has been emotionally damaged when younger by animals so acts to dislike them but in reality, he is a harshly worded tsundere. Ranka is his partner to his own dismay in some cases but also not in others. She is a cute wolf.The art of the show I personally think for the show itself is great. It does exactly what it needs to do consistently throughout the show.The OP for this show is great, it is so memorable and great to listen too. The ED is more calm and different but is still great. Voices are superb in Japanese. Ranka has an amazing voice and hats off to the VA because she is such an adorable character.In terms of character, there are a fair few but the main characters revolve around the cooking club and the side story of King Shishino and Shiho Ihara.Cooking Club:- Jin the main as said is a harshly worded tsundere. He does care for Ranka more than he shows but does slip up at times.- Ranka is a super cute pink-haired wolf girl with a noticeably unusual voice that is adorable.- Hitomi exists as like Jin another human who is therefore in Jin's interest by species.- Yukari is a green-haired koala that has questionable eating habits.- Miyubi is a blonde sloth. She suffers often a fate expected of a sloth.- Kurumi Nekomai is a pink-haired cat. She is the best character for me since I love catgirls. She is a tsundere but her tail gives her away.- Meimei is a panda who is a complete masochist and loves the attention she gets from Jin which is in contrast to her pampered lifestyle.The Couple:- King Shishino a male lion as expected in beast form. He is pretty funny and makes for a hilarious side story.- Shiho Ihara an impala is a cute demi-human girl that makes again for the funny scenario.Others of note:- Kuroe Mashima a zebra demi-human that builds the first few episodes.- The rabbits are pretty involved and pretty funny in the aspect they contribute.- The lionesses are also pretty great and fit the gal style well for those it applies.- Kurumi's cat friends are all amazing because cats.- Yena a female hyena with identity issues.- An a neanderthal who makes for the final part.- Man the mammoth who is a loli female effectively.Special mention for her cameo appearance is Suimori Chii a common vampire bat that in the manga is super cute and on par with Kurumi for best girl. Seen during the festival.There are many other characters to see and know in the show and the quantity in the detail it is shown is what makes the show great.With this, it helps the enjoyment with the facts that Jin comes out with all being true and the narrator facts being true too. It is great that many of them act how they should do as the animal but in a more civilised way. One example of this is how the female rabbit's act is true to their nature.The show covers a fair amount of the source material but also leaves plenty of room for another season.The show has a great dynamic with how it flows through and the enjoyment it brings. I looked forward to the OP every week. I looked forward to Ranka and Kurumi and what shenanigans will be had this week.In the end, for me, this is an excellent show that ticks many boxes to a very high standard. There is a special coming too towards summer 2020 and hopefully, it can be continued in the anime with a season 2 followed afterwards.The source material continues forwards and is definitely worth reading too. see the dinosaur teachers they are just amazing.It is odd in some ways that the males are the animal and girls are demi-human but personally I have no complaints.

a lot of them animes like this where it\'s the girl who has to try hard to wind over the guy\'s affection, also this probably the only anime where we see a female character taking the lead when it comes to being the ""BOSS"" of the group, so:Story:Pros: Ok, so the plot ride on that usual harem genre, but unlike the usual, the plot itself wasn\'t more like guy like certain girl but...another girl keeps the guy from ever having a serious relationship with the girl that the guy like, also this has that certain situation, where it wasn\'t the harem that was being portrayed around here but rather the relationships of the members of the ""Cooking Cub"" as they go day by day of being able to proved that different species can get along......Con: given that this was the usual harem themed anime, it still relies on the short romances that the club members have for the guy.....Verdict (6/10)Art:Pros: It may have that usual ecchi element but it was mostly limited to Miki Hadano, though the most intense one would be with Mashima Krone in the beginning and Hino Hitomi at the end.Cons: Thought there was an onsen service and beach service don\'t expect any boob flash from Hitomi nor with anybody else.Verdict (6/10)Sound:Pros: Well, I can say for sure that studio Studio Gokumi did choose the right seiyuu to do the voices of the characters most especially when they choose Kino Hina to do Ranka\'s voice and there that opening theme "" ""Gakuen Soukan Zoo "" by Ryouri-bu and ending theme ""Ookami Blues by Kino Hina.Cons: It was kind of a waste that the seiyuu who did Shishio, Miyubi\'s voiceKohara, Konomi was basically a waste of the seiyuu\'s talent, also the who did the Mammoth Girl\'s voice sounded pretty much like a reatard.Verdict (7/10)Character:Pros: Well, I did say that having an MC like Jin who wasn\'t much of a nice guy, in fact he\'s one guy you\'ll like to hate, but here he\'s an exception , cu\'z he really did played his tsundere role very well, now I don\'t know about you but TBH, I really do find Ranka being this yauidere dere dere to Jin as rather annoying and if this anime\'s manga series I would prefer that he ends up with Hitomi, if not IMAO it would better that it gets a harem ending.Cons: Thought Ranka does provide the comedic aspect of this seires ( Anime and Manga) she was pretty much an annoyance that I would have prefer that Jin just simply ignores her when Kronoe was having fun with her, also I kinda hate that Hitomi becomes this yuri magnet for Yena and Ann, now if Ann was looking forward to make them mordern humans to go extinct, then she doesn\'t have to put up a sweat given that Jin might end up with Ranka and Hitomi might end up having a yri relationship with her and Yena.Verdict (8/10)Enjoyment:Pros: It wasn\'t a chore watching it.Cons: Nothing to mentioned.Overall:Verdict (8/10)Even thought, this maybe the usual harem anime, it was just worthwhile watching it, but for this to have a season 2, well IMAO that

ReviewSPOILER FREEIntroAfter witnessing a fair amount of drama surrounding this show from the furry community leaking into the anime community, I decided to give this show a shot. Fueled by an urge to support a series that was falsely slandered online, I finished Seton Academy; and overall, it wasn’t that bad!StoryThe story of Seton Academy is very limited compared to other anime, while not falling to far behind from others of its genre. It follows a human named Jin enrolling at a school called Seton Academy filled with animals, all of which he hates with a passion for mostly unexplained...reasons. After he meets a human girl named Hitomi, he feels as though his experience at the academy will finally be turned around. When he finds that Hitomi is rather sympathetic to the other species of the academy, he inadvertently becomes part of a multi species harem under the guise of a cooking club. The story is obviously not a very important part of the show, because it is mostly ignored in favour of bolstering the other departments of the show which make it worth watching. Be honest, if you are watching Seton for the plot, then you need a better hobby.6/10ArtThe art of SA is wholly unremarkable but is rather important to discuss at least for a bit. The main reason I decided to watch SE is because of the drama that it garnered during its pilot, when it is revealed that the main premise of the show is a mix of real animals and kemonomimi. There was no mention of SE’s art direction before its anime adaptation, but after certain furries found this show, there was quite a bit of uproar about just that. I’m very impartial to kemonomimi, and anthropomorphic styles both, but the needless conflict about it bugged me quite a bit. If a viewer wants anthropomorphic style, there is more than enough content surrounding it online, even Beastars caters directly to that crowd in the anime space. Let the people that want to watch a show for kemonomimi do that in peace, this show clearly wasn’t made to be accurate in that category… it’s a harem SoL. Nobody complains about Cells at Work cells being humans and not round unicellular blobs, because that’s the appeal. Rant aside, the art does more than enough to convey themes and characters but doesn’t overachieve in that sense.7/10SoundThere isn’t much to be said about the sound design of SE. Like the story, that simply isn’t a big focus. So even though it gets a lower individual rating, it won’t matter as much as the others do towards the overall score. There are no bangers to be found here, but the ED is enjoyable, and sound effects realistic which can be said add to the overall comedy of the show.6/10CharacterThe characters of this show are very good. For the genre, they each have surprising depth even if it’s not exactly how more sophisticated shows might portray depth. Each character doesn’t vary far from the quirks that each animal they’re based of off might have, but each animal’s shortcomings irl are real shortcomings that the characters experience and can overcome. Each character, like other harems, have two-dimensional identities, but that isn’t necessarily a bad thing, because it helps the main three characters: Ranka, Jin, and Hitomi become more developed. Those three, by the way, are all very likable and help with this show’s enjoyment. I won’t give specific characters, because the joy of this show is slowly getting introduced to all the characters and their quirks.8/10EnjoymentIf there is one aspect this anime excels at, it is enjoyment. Seeing the progression of characters being added and seeing how real-life aspects of their animals affect them is always a treat and did not get old even up to the loli mammoth they added because mammoths were smaller than people think. Small things like that add up to give this show a unique dumb enjoyment not often found. Many shows worry too much about being the next masterpiece like death note, or the next needlessly ecchi show like Ishuzoku Reviewers. This show knows its place very well in the anime community, and caters extremely niche, yet very broad at the same time. If you can get past the entry barrier of the female and male animal split there awaits a very enjoyable anime to take your mind off the scary events ongoing in real life.9/10OverallSE is hyper focused in certain aspects to maximize the strong suits of its genre. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing to some watchers, but it could be off putting to others. Thus, it finds itself in a limbo of not being dumb fun, but also not very serious either, if that interests you then I highly suggest Seton Academy. reasons.

Those three, by the way, are all very likable and help with this show’s enjoyment. I won’t give specific characters, because the joy of this show is slowly getting introduced to all the characters and their quirks.8/10EnjoymentIf there is one aspect this anime excels at, it is enjoyment. Seeing the progression of characters being added and seeing how real-life aspects of their animals affect them is always a treat and did not get old even up to the loli mammoth they added because mammoths were smaller than people think. Small things like that add up to give this show a unique dumb enjoyment not often found. Many shows worry too much about being the next masterpiece like death note, or the next needlessly ecchi show like Ishuzoku Reviewers. This show knows its place very well in the anime community, and caters extremely niche, yet very broad at the same time. If you can get past the entry barrier of the female and male animal split there awaits a very enjoyable anime to take your mind off the scary events ongoing in real life.9/10OverallSE is hyper focused in certain aspects to maximize the strong suits of its genre. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing to some watchers, but it could be off putting to others. Thus, it finds itself in a limbo of not being dumb fun, but also not very serious either, if that interests you then I highly suggest Seton Academy.', 'Ok, as I have seen in previous reviews, a lot of people do like this show, so heream I to tell you my opinion.I do not really like shows where there are actual animals, demi-humans are good enough, you should not cross the border.Of course there is Ranko which is pretty cute, cannot name other characters cuz of spoilers.I never thought I would ever find OP that irritating(its no better with ending).But I gotta admit, i learnt something from this show, so Imma give it 5 stars.If you are into animals, this anime could satisfy your needs. ', 'Seton Academy is one of those shows you look at and think ""Wow, this looks really dumb."" but you would be wrong.~~~May Contain Spoilers~~~This show has a purpose. That purpose is supposed to teach you that no matter where you come from or what you look like you should make friends with everyone! Overall the show is very light-hearted with very mild ""uncomfortable"" scenes. Almost every episode tries to put a point across, mostly friendship related. such as getting along with this person, setting aside differences, and just dong judge someone by looking at them.All around I enjoyed this show a lot. If you...are one of those people that don\'t really understand furries or animal people this show might not be for you. BUT... Half the people look humanish so its not really that bad. Overall I would watch the first episode and if you don\'t like the way they look or act you should probably stop because it doesn\'t change much. are one of those people that don\'t really understand furries or animal people this show might not be for you.

Hitomi on the other hand creates the cooking club where Jin joins to spend more time with her however Ranka and the latter on, Yukari Komori voiced by...Misaki Kuno a koala who wants to eat tasty new food, Miyubi Shishi voiced by Konomi a sloth that ""dies"" from ""overwork"", Kurumi Nekomai voiced by Sora Tokui a cat joins the cooking club and comedy hijinks ensues.  Due to Ranka\'s overactive and helpful nature is how she bring sin all these animals into the cooking club and because of this the club goes beyond six members thanks to this.The comedy if anything from Murenase Seton Gakuen revolves around the animals and how they\'re ""nature"" translate into the hijinks into the anime and that Jin and Ranka and the cooking club needs to fix, be it if it\'s a lion who falls in love with impala to asports festival...with animals in where Miyubi wants to TAKE PART IN IT!??!?!. This does take the comedy to crazy levels merely due to the premise itself and majority of the time it lands as it\'s both realistic due to how informative it is about the animal in question of the episode to the character interactions with those animals in question that makes the comedy rather funny AND informative.The characters themselves are pretty well done for a comedy anime as yes they do have some running gags about them like Ranka and her clinginess to Jin and JIn wanting to find ways for him to be alone time with Hitomi and backfiring to Miyubi\'s deaths and whatnot but as the anime progresses and the new character verge to the cooing club ALOT of great interactions happens and best part is that the anime\'s structure doesn\'t reset itself, thus as more characters comes into play, they sometimes have a cascading effect towards the cooking club one way or another. Of course there are some isolated episodes like their look at the Sea division of the Seton Gakuen but for the most part, due to how the anime\'s cast grows, the character interactions and thus little developments with the huge cast grows at that too.Ok now for the elephant in the room...or more like human in the room this time, Jin as a character will probably be the most divisive character in the anime due to how hostile and annoyed he is to ALMOST every character in the anime besides Hitomi and wants nothing to do with him. On one hand he does help with the what Ranka wants to help with, bu on the other hand in more comedic moments he wants nothing to do with Ranka, so take JIn like you will, even LA can\'t pin Jin down...he can be a good one liner due to how informative he is about animals as much as he hates animals, but on the other when he\'s extremely hostile to Ranka and even the animals outside the cooking club, he can be VERY aggressive. In a ways it\'s like Noah from Noah\'s Ark being pissed off that he\'s stuck with animals for the rest of his life with NO human interaction.The animation done by Studio Gokumi was pretty consistent and detailed all things withstanding thanks to how good the character designs were as well as all the crazy reactions from ALL the characters were as well as the decent backgrounds etc. From the character designs themselves, the female characters have the typical anime anthropomorphized form to them (well cept Hitomi cos she\'s you know HUMAN) while the male characters have more animal features to them. From this Studio Gokumi overall did a great job in the animation while LA will also praise the manga author Bungo Yamashita for creating the world of Murenase! Seton Gakuen whereas it\'s an amalgamation of what if? of humanized/antromorphized animals co-existing with humans.The voice cast is actually pretty great in all honesty from Yukari Tamura as the student council president Miki Hadano, Tomokazu Sugita as King Shishino the big lion on campus, Sora Tokui as Kurumi Nekomai, Misaki Kuno as Yukari Komori, Konomi Kohara as Miyubi Shisho, Yuu Serizawa as Mei Mei, Yume Miyamoto as Hitomi Hino and finally Hino Kino as Ranka Ookami. Probably the MVP is easily Hina Kino as the hyperactive genki wolf Ranka but LA would also like to give it to Misaki Kuno as Yukari because of that one koala scream she did because WOW...it\'s like Hawkform Seven Deadly Sins x 100 screaming cadence, LA was actually quite impressed nonetheless.Murenase! Seton Gakuen does go into an sorta finale arc once Anne Anetani voiced by Sumire Uesaka arrives where she struggles in having a crush on Hitomi while trying to ""achieve her goal"" and the WHOLE club is affected during the cultural festival. Nonetheless this breaks form the isolated ""animal"" episode.

Seto Gakuen, was a good show. A fun watch with fun character. I love the animal character they have here. Various cute animal out of nowhere and join the cooking club. Lucky Jin, with how hate Jin to the animal, he always get into the problem to the all cute animal girls. My best scene was in MeiMei episode. How cute their relations. Sadly, it wont long last. Yet, with the focus of the genre do not come to any relationship, i can't do anything to help. Maybe a bit too over reacted at some scene. And i dislike so much about Hyena persona....But its okay afterall. Since they just prove, that they have a good character with cute and fun persona as a unison Lol. Dont get me wrong.Maybe this is my shortes review, because this anime can not watch continously at one day. But, its okay. This show actually pretty fun and give a prospecting promising one of this year series. How detailed narrator give information can not missed my judgement here. It was so amazing. How they put it with best momment, the interaction was so smooth. Sometimes, maybe a bit too rushed. The side story also a good approach to show some more unique dedications. But, my complaint just one. The ending. Its awful, non sense, can not bring my enjoyment at other previous episodes. Damn, with that problem, and other unnoticeable-with-no-explanation reason, i just wanna put my rating to the story section at 7. An average story with an awful ending. Really apreciate if the studio give their best video to improve my complain. Can they?For other aspect like music, sounds, art, characteristic were good. Maybe not be the best. But not bad at all. I smirk with the animal sound, and mixing it with female acting realy make laugh. 8/10 for them, which is include to the art one. Enjoyment shall be the integration to all aspect. Same as the overall section. By clearing my intentions there, i will give my enjoyment for some conditions. First, story telling quiet well enough explanations, and it plot was good. The aspect to this some was average, 5 point. With that plus my reason aboves, the total shall be 6 points. Second, character development was nice, or unique, and strong enough to surpass the plot advancement to the story sake. With that i may come my score to the 8, since i like how Jin's character so well change every episode. His interaction over other female animals was good. Even, his characteristic is horrible, but that just make this anime likeable by me. With that, i give 8 to compare all of the problem, and give total character point to 8 aswell. 8 plus 6 is 7.

My reaction at times was usually ""hah, I didn´t know"". The more you know so to say, and each of these moments felt pleasant.Of course, I imagine a general interest in animals is required to maximize your experience watching this.

With that being said, I may need to come back and edit my review at the end of the season, because it does seem to get less funny by the episode.

I find episodic comedies too often end up being monotonous and formulaic. However, Seton Academy did a good job with the episodic architecture of the show. Rather than being formulaic, each episode tends to do something new as compared to previous ones. New, significant characters are introduced, a recurring story line might be advanced, or a different character steps into the limelight. While I did think some of the episodes were boring, I generally thought the show did a good job keeping things fresh and interesting.The animal theme was well done, and I enjoyed the...character design. It wasn’t just an aesthetic, but a core component of the story and characters. I\'m unable to vouch for their voracity, but I also enjoyed how various factual details (some of which are clearly embellished) of animal characteristics and behavior was used to model the cast. For example, Ranka\'s (wolf) iconic greeting, Miyubi\'s (sloth) frequent ""deaths"" due to overexertion, Yukari\'s (koala) interesting dietary choices, and Kurumi\'s (cat) aloof, independent nature, to name just a few. Even beyond that, this theme is used flavor the characters relationships with each other, such as the romance between King (lion) and Shiho (impala). The level of detail afforded to this component is commendable.Jin and Ranka\'s interactions were the highlight of the show for me. Ranka\'s indomitable optimism, belief in her friends, and affection for Jin provides a humorous contrast against Jin\'s tsundere nature (spawned from his marked, yet ever-diminishing hatred of all animals). There obviously isn\'t much story given the nature of the show, but Jin and Ranka\'s relationship along with other elements, such as the King/Shiho romance and Yena\'s protracted character development, provide a small amount of continuity.I thought the production quality was solid other than the intro/outro music which I did not like at all.

Definitely came out of it wanting a Ranka.The MC is a tsundere and as much as I can\'t stand tsundere guys he is not that bad. There was only one time I disliked him and it was because he made Ranka cry pretty hard. Unacceptable. He doesn\'t like animals, but he knows a variety of facts about some of the most random ones, including marine life. I can tell he genuinely doesn""t like animals, but I guess even he can\'t resist a cute face all the time.Ranka is cute pink-hair wolf-girl. She is beyond cute and very prideful. Most of...that pride is used for comedic effect, but she is a sincere sweetheart nonetheless.The rest of the characters are truly just interested in cooking. Not much else to say since it doesn\'t really have a plot. It is mostly just for comedy and that alone would usually get a 10 outta me, but I think a 9 is fair. The comedy and cuteness were spot on. The tiny tension in the last episode is just comedic. Although you gotta feel bad for Hitomi. Always getting knocked out by apes XD.

As of late, I was getting bogged down by some rather underwhelming action animes so this change was quite jarring for me. Thankfully, I was able to get into this quickly, and adapt to the genre this is.The story is typical for a slice-of-life (but not really) comedy. That is, there is not really a story but more like a series of events. This is typical so the overarching story/plot won’t be judged. The events that take place makes sense. The setting works well with the story, though I would like to see a bit more world building if possible....Things happen, characters and occurrences are introduced, and it works out nicely. It is simple but well done.The art is good. Not amazing. Good. The brighter colors fit well with the theme and it helps add to the fact that things aren’t too serious. This is a good thing since art must be able to portray the atmosphere.The sound is something I can’t focus on too much. It’s okay. I’m really bad with listening specifically for music, so unless it is amazing or catches me on a good time, I mostly won’t notice music too much. What I heard was okay. The music catered toward the story, which was nice. However the music kind of flew under my radar mostly. Doesn’t add much IMO.The characters are well done. Each character is unique in personality and design. The interactions are quite comedic, and I believe this is where the show shines. I enjoyed each character but I have to say that there isn’t much development at all. It seems that the characters are thrown in just to interact, similar to a puppet show for children. They talk, have fun, a new puppet gets thrown in, they talk, they have fun, so on. This makes the characters seem static, stagnant, and too in-the-moment. Though, this wasn’t too big of a problem for me.I enjoyed this anime quite a lot. I was able to press the next button with motivation after each episode, which is rare for me. This wasn’t the greatest piece of entertainment I enjoyed but I could definitely say that I cannot wait for season 2.Overall, I think this is a fun piece of fiction. It doesn’t seem real at all, which is fine, and the comedy is well done. There is also bits of information here and there about the animals themselves, making this show somewhat comparable to Cells At Work, but more comedy rather than educational.Good show, I recommend, have fun. Things happen, characters and occurrences are introduced, and it works out nicely. It is simple but well done.The art is good. Not amazing. Good. The brighter colors fit well with the theme and it helps add to the fact that things aren’t too serious. This is a good thing since art must be able to portray the atmosphere.The sound is something I can’t focus on too much. It’s okay. I’m really bad with listening specifically for music, so unless it is amazing or catches me on a good time, I mostly won’t notice music too much. What I heard was okay. The music catered toward the story, which was nice. However the music kind of flew under my radar mostly. Doesn’t add much IMO.The characters are well done. Each character is unique in personality and design. The interactions are quite comedic, and I believe this is where the show shines. I enjoyed each character but I have to say that there isn’t much development at all. It seems that the characters are thrown in just to interact, similar to a puppet show for children. They talk, have fun, a new puppet gets thrown in, they talk, they have fun, so on. This makes the characters seem static, stagnant, and too in-the-moment.

In order to get closer to Hitomi to gain her romantic interest, Jin starts a Cooking Club and invites Hitomi to participate in it. However, Jin soon starts to regret his decision of making the Cooking Club as more and more animals start joining the club, much to Jin's dislike of animals. Personally, I thought Seton Academy was...a little above average at best considering that the characters were kind of dull and bland in the sense that none of them got any real character development. What you see is what you got with the characters. None of them really changed all that much. However, the central message of the anime was pretty vivid in which you don't have to be exactly like other people in order to be friends with them, as we can see many different animals coming together and making friends with each other in the Cooking Club started by Jin Mazama and Ranka Ookami, the wolf. Seton Academy: Join the Pack has its funny moments, but it's just your typical furry anime.

Didn't regret watching, but probably wouldn't watch a 2nd time if nostalgia bias didn't exist. Probably had a good message, was a guilty pleasure, or the story was solid.Alright, so forget what anybody else is saying. This anime isn't comedic gold, but dang it it's comedic bronze. Each and every single character is funny in their own special way. They're not always making me laugh, but they do little things that show their personality that just cracks me up.And that's important. A comedy show should be able to make you laugh once or twice. Which this does. Not only...that, at least once each episode I laughed out loud because of just how dumb (in a good way) some things were.Jin is just a funny asshole! He really is. He's sort of like Yusuke from Yu Yu Hakusho. They're basically selfish and self centered, AND unnecessarily mean, but man do they make you laugh by just how open they are about it. And despite there being multiple female characters, this isn't a weird harem either! None of it is weird. Sure, there's fan service sometimes but not very often. Not to the point where it becomes weird. And that's good.I really don't think I can talk too much about this anime. The story is decent and simple: It's a group of friends that are different species in school, and they get into random scenarios. Episodes are sometimes based on a certain animal's dilemma. A copy and pasted structure for any SOL, so it's nothing special. The story is decent as really only three characters have any overarching true goals (Lion, Wolf, Human) but it keeps the story going either way.I honestly don't what it'd take for me to consider taking this anime up to a 7- which mean's that I'd rewatch it, but I think anyone should really just be able to binge watch this in a single weekend and come out with a smile. Plus, sometimes you learn about different kind of animals! It's more of a one time thing for me.I didn't find anything annoying about this anime. Art and animation are ok. Voice acting is solid for Japanese dub. It's just a fine anime really. If you're bored, want to watch something funny, and are interested in school setting anime then you should probably watch the first few episodes. that, at least once each episode I laughed out loud because of just how dumb (in a good way) some things were.Jin is just a funny asshole!

Seton Gakuen well what can I say about this show hahaha this show is just laughs ngl i enjoyed this soo much, comedy series are always fun and entertaining to watch because they arent meant to be taken seriously unless you dont have a sense of humor that or you are just a buzz kill that gets offened by lowkey everything and anything, the dumb wacky characters and their insane interactions was fun and the fact that they still somewhat teach about friendship in this is pretty nice also the art and animation wasnt to bad for such a series but the thing that...made me laugh the most was that dumb OP wtf who wrote the lyrics for the OP shit had me dying also it might not seem like it but there is fan service here and there not as much as some hardcore ecchi series but its nothing over the top also lots of famous voice actors in this (japanese VA) I say famous cuz the VA's in this are also in loads of animes that Ive seen already anyway as i said in the being i enjoyed it and thats what i mainly focus on with animes whether or not its enjoyable or not and this one is good not on konosuba level but its stil good. made me laugh the most was that dumb OP wtf who wrote the lyrics for the

or not its enjoyable or not and this one is good not on konosuba level but its stil good."", 'Well chalk this one up as another one of those random manga I read that I never thought would ever get an adaptation.\xa0 Seriously, this series is actually popular enough to be turned anime?\xa0 Color me fucking surprised.Story:The school for animals, Seton Gakuen, holds a veritable ecosystem of animals that range from the tiny naked mole rats to literal dinosaurs that take up roles as the school\'s faculty.\xa0 Within the school is one human male named Mazama Jin who despises all animals.\xa0 (Though I don\'t know why he\'s enrolled here.)\xa0 While attending this school, he meets the only female human in the school, Hitomi Hino....After a chance encounter with the wolf, Ranka, the three form an interspecies \'pack\' and found the cooking club, which serves as Hitomi\'s way of trying to bring species of different animals together.The recipe for Seton Gakuen is one part zoology lesson, two parts anime comedy, at least three parts recurring animal jokes, and all introductory arcs.\xa0 Each episode takes only the source material\'s list of \'introductory\' arcs, making it so that each episode shows off a different animal or concept whether or not they be part of the recurring cast or just one-offs that appear for one episode.\xa0 As a result, the story of Seton Gakuen is really just a series of progressive mini conflicts that build up the series and its overall cast, but don\'t generally impact the overall scope of the show.\xa0 Which makes each conflict feel minor and a lot less dire because everything\'s constrained to such a strict time window and they kinda dramatize everything more than they really need to.That\'s mostly because the general tone of the series is comedic to lighthearted with very few, if any, moments of actual conflict.\xa0 Even the parts where the show feels serious should be taken with a grain of salt because this is a show where animals go to school and have carnivores fall in love with herbivores even though in any other context that sounds like a recipe for disaster.\xa0 That\'s one of the show\'s recurring subplots, which happen alongside whatever thing Jin and the rest of the cooking club are dealing with at the time.\xa0 Which is admittedly humorous and I\'m glad they at least managed to keep something recurring in the series instead of switching over to something different every time.Worldbuilding is also a bit of a strange point for this series because it has it, but it doesn\'t make sense.\xa0 Like how do extinct animals exist if they\'re you know...extinct?\xa0 Why are all of these animals either anthropomorphic or look like they\'re cosplaying?\xa0 If humans supposedly ruined things, then why are there only two humans in this school?\xa0 Shouldn\'t there be more if their population is of \'least concern\'?\xa0 This can all be explained by the simple fact of that being the joke, so don\'t think about it too hard.Despite the questionable worldbuilding, this adaptation still feels like it\'s rushing through its story in order to cram in as many characters and animal facts as it can.\xa0 There\'s not really any time to sit down or develop any of its cast members (Meimei, I\'m looking at you and how your entire second half of your introduction got cut), and I actually find it to be a shame because as the audience, I didn\'t really get to sit down with anyone before the show decided to transport us to a different conflict or a different plot point in order to give us one extra animal.Characters:Jin is a male tsundere-like character who despises all manner of animal and in most cases is completely justified in his anger.\xa0 Aside from Hitomi, he pretty much calls every other character in the series ""stupid-x"" or ""shitty-x"", which, at least he\'s consistent on his feelings towards the...creatures around him.\xa0 The show relies on him to fulfill multiple roles, either helping solve the problem of the week, or serve as the show\'s zoologist because he can quickly identify what animal they\'re dealing with and what bit of trivia about them is relevant to the current situation.\xa0 So he does a lot of legwork in that way.\xa0 The show also drags him around, a lot, forcing him to be complacent in the demands made of him, which create a negative feedback loop as to why he despises all animals.\xa0 Which is why I find him fascinating due to his self-awareness and reaction to everything.\xa0 Indeed he can be...a little harsh at times, but I imagine dealing with a literal school of sentient wild animals can get on someone\'s nerves over time.\xa0 Deep down, he cares.\xa0 Under all those thick, hardened layers of his.Then there\'s Ranka, a wolf who also serves as both the series\'s mascot and reason for most if not all of Jin\'s headaches.\xa0 Excited to be the leader of a pack and a \'boss\', Ranka\'s personality is mostly like that of a dog, just occasionally more wild and feral in order to make her more wolf-like despite how domesticated she becomes at times.\xa0 Her character is centered around her being a sufficient \'pack leader\' to her friends as well as helping everyone else\'s problems, so she\'s pretty much the spark that helps jumpstart most episodes.\xa0 The joke with her is she\'s a wolf, so she\'s a canine(dog), and thusly acts like one.Finally is Hitomi, the only other classified human in the entire series who generally takes either a backseat in the series or serves as a kind of \'trophy\' for various characters in the series.\xa0 Her kind and gentle personality kind of makes her a target for conflict since she kinda acts like a damsel in distress which gets boorish towards the end because she doesn\'t really have much of a personality beside being the cute human who likes cooking and friends.\xa0 The thing that irritates me about her is the \'female\' symbol that\'s so obviously folded into her character design.\xa0 Her hairclip is literally the female symbol, and that same symbol plus the color pink are so present in anything to do with her that it becomes annoying since it feels like the series is constantly reminding the audience that she is a \'HUMAN FEMALE\'.\xa0 It just feels tacky.The rest of the cast is just a bunch of animals that show up in the series, generally staying as recurring cast members with their only contribution really just showing off what their respective animal traits are as a gag.\xa0 Sloths are slow so Miyubi constantly fucking dies as a result of overexerting herself, Meimei is a panda and lazes around because China as a country pampers the few remaining specimens of their national animal, and Kurumi is a cat so you have no fucking idea why she does what she does.\xa0 And of course there\'s more: Naked mole rats think clothes are the devil because they have \'naked\' in their name, Beluga whales look like they\'re always smiling, so they\'re literally always smiling, and...you get the picture.\xa0 The side cast is at the very least quirky and memorable because of these individual animal facts that encapsulate both their personality and their gag, but there\'s little else to talk about since hardly any development is devoted to them.Aesthetics:Produced by Studio Gokumi, the art for this show feels very...average.\xa0 The biggest boon I can give for the show is just how consistent it is, since the show doesn\'t really go off model that much unless they really have to for either a gag or a comedic moment.\xa0 There\'s nothing particularly bad about it cause it looks ok, but nothing about Murenase! Seton Gakuen really stands out visually.Well, anything on the quality scale.\xa0 Content-wise, the show is very bizarre.\xa0 For one thing, the sexes of the animals make no biological sense.\xa0 Because all of the males of any species are literally the species of animal they\'re supposed to be just on two legs and in human clothes, but every female of every species looks like a human girl cosplaying said animal.\xa0 There\'s some cleverness with the design of some of the female designs like Meimei having her characteristic sunglasses look like the pair of dark circles around a panda\'s eyes so she looks like she\'s wearing a panda hat, but there\'re very few things that are like that, instead opting for putting ears and a tail on a girl and then declaring that they\'re x animal.\xa0 I\'m positive they did it just for fanservice because catgirls and the like are all the fucking rage these days, but it still feels like both lazy character design and lazy worldbuilding because it doesn\'t feel like there was full commitment to the \'animal\' school that was promised.\xa0 Especially since the entire cooking club at face value just looks like a bunch of girls in animal cosplay and one dude.On the complete opposite end of the aesthetics spectrum is the show\'s OP/ED.\xa0 ""Gakuen Soukan Zoo"" sung by the seiyuus of the entire cooking club (Yes, even Jin) sounds like they wanted to make a generic anime song, but also wanted to make a kind of jungle theme opening for an animal education show for kids.\xa0 It\'s a weird mix that works, and while I definitely think this OP is memorable due to the description listed above, I\'m probably not gonna pop this one in for an independent listen any time soon.By contrast, we have ""Ookami Blues"", a much slower, lullaby-esque song sung by Ranka\'s seiyuu.\xa0 It\'s kind of a fun song because you can progressively hear Ranka get more ravenous as she\'s singing kind of off-key, and it\'s oddly humorous.\xa0 I almost don\'t want to say it\'s a \'song\' per say because it\'s much more than that.\xa0 But it\'s definitely memorable due to how unique it is, and I\'m kind of all for that.Final Thoughts:I honestly did not expect this series of all things to get an adaptation.\xa0 I found the source material randomly one day and been reading it ever since it peaked my interest.\xa0 Never once did I ever think to myself, ""Wow, I can\'t wait to review this series one day"" because it was always that one manga I read in my down time every now and then when they have a new chapter out.\xa0 But truth is stranger than fiction, so I guess I\'m writing my online essay for it.As much fun as I had reliving the earliest arcs of the manga, I didn\'t really find this adaptation to be all that great.\xa0 There were a few things I did like such as the show injecting as much nature footage as they could because technically this show educates the audience on various animal facts, as well as Meimei because that panda is my favorite character and seeing her animated was a treat.\xa0 But the adaptation as a whole feels so rushed that it doesn\'t feel like most of the things I watched had a lot of weight behind them.\xa0 Entire arcs that spanned multiple chapters got condensed down into a single episode, so a lot of details got skipped over, and even entire arcs got cut out in favor of moving forward into something else that seemed like a more \'fitting\' climax.Disregarding the manga\'s content altogether, the show still felt like it was missing something because the show\'s just event after event after event.\xa0 Nothing sits still and as humorous they make each species\'s fact/gag, that\'s all we really get out of this adaptation.\xa0 As such, my recommendation is to watch only if you\'re interested in a school comedy that\'s equally weird and educational.\xa0 Murenase definitely has its charm and intrigue, but the adaptation doesn\'t feel like anything beyond an animated slideshow of various animal species, so any story or conflict/impact there might\'ve been is either gone or put to the wayside.\xa0 The only time conflict ever matters is at the end of the series which, given how adaptations work, is really just par for the course in order to give the cour a last hurrah. After a chance encounter with the wolf, Ranka, the three form an interspecies \'pack\' and found the cooking club, which serves as Hitomi\'s way of trying to bring species of different animals

show relies on him to fulfill multiple roles, either helping solve the problem of the week, or serve as the show\'s zoologist because he can quickly identify what animal they\'re dealing with and what bit of trivia about them is relevant to the current situation.\xa0 So he does a lot of legwork in that way.\xa0 The show also drags him around, a lot, forcing him to be complacent in the demands made of him, which create a negative feedback loop as to why he despises all animals.\xa0 Which is why I find him fascinating due to his self-awareness and reaction to everything.\xa0 Indeed he can be...a little harsh at times, but I imagine dealing with a literal school of sentient wild animals can get on someone\'s nerves over time.\xa0 Deep down, he cares.\xa0 Under all those thick, hardened layers of his.Then there\'s Ranka, a wolf who also serves as both the series\'s mascot and reason for most if not all of Jin\'s headaches.\xa0 Excited to be the leader of a pack and a \'boss\', Ranka\'s personality is mostly like that of a dog, just occasionally more wild and feral in order to make her more wolf-like despite how domesticated she becomes at times.\xa0 Her character is centered around her being a sufficient \'pack leader\' to her friends as well as helping everyone else\'s problems, so she\'s pretty much the spark that helps jumpstart most episodes.\xa0 The joke with her is she\'s a wolf, so she\'s a canine(dog), and thusly acts like one.Finally is Hitomi, the only other classified human in the entire series who generally takes either a backseat in the series or serves as a kind of \'trophy\' for various characters in the series.\xa0 Her kind and gentle personality kind of makes her a target for conflict since she kinda acts like a damsel in distress which gets boorish towards the end because she doesn\'t really have much of a personality beside being the cute human who likes cooking and friends.\xa0 The thing that irritates me about her is the \'female\' symbol that\'s so obviously folded into her character design.\xa0 Her hairclip is literally the female symbol, and that same symbol plus the color pink are so present in anything to do with her that it becomes annoying since it feels like the series is constantly reminding the audience that she is a \'HUMAN FEMALE\'.\xa0 It just feels tacky.The rest of the cast is just a bunch of animals that show up in the series, generally staying as recurring cast members with their only contribution really just showing off what their respective animal traits are as a gag.\xa0 Sloths are slow so Miyubi constantly fucking dies as a result of overexerting herself, Meimei is a panda and lazes around because China as a country pampers the few remaining specimens of their national animal, and Kurumi is a cat so you have no fucking idea why she does what she does.\xa0 And of course there\'s more: Naked mole rats think clothes are the devil because they have \'naked\' in their name, Beluga whales look like they\'re always smiling, so they\'re literally always smiling, and...you get the picture.\xa0 The side cast is at the very least quirky and memorable because of these individual animal facts that encapsulate both their personality and their gag, but there\'s little else to talk about since hardly any development is devoted to them.Aesthetics:Produced by Studio Gokumi, the art for this show feels very...average.\xa0 The biggest boon I can give for the show is just how consistent it is, since the show doesn\'t really go off model that much unless they really have to for either a gag or a comedic moment.\xa0 There\'s nothing particularly bad about it cause it looks ok, but nothing about Murenase! Seton Gakuen really stands out visually.Well, anything on the quality scale.\xa0 Content-wise, the show is very bizarre.\xa0 For one thing, the sexes of the animals make no biological sense.\xa0 Because all of the males of any species are literally the species of animal they\'re supposed to be just on two legs and in human clothes, but every female of every species looks like a human girl cosplaying said animal.\xa0 There\'s some cleverness with the design of some of the female designs like Meimei having her characteristic sunglasses look like the pair of dark circles around a panda\'s eyes so she looks like she\'s wearing a panda hat, but there\'re very few things that are like that, instead opting for putting ears and a tail on a girl and then declaring that they\'re x animal.\xa0 I\'m positive they did it just for fanservice because catgirls and the like are all the fucking rage these days, but it still feels like both lazy character design and lazy worldbuilding because it doesn\'t feel like there was full commitment to the \'animal\' school that was promised.\xa0 Especially since the entire cooking club at face value just looks like a bunch of girls in animal cosplay and one dude.On the complete opposite end of the aesthetics spectrum is the show\'s OP/ED.\xa0 ""Gakuen Soukan Zoo"" sung by the seiyuus of the entire cooking club (Yes, even Jin) sounds like they wanted to make a generic anime song, but also wanted to make a kind of jungle theme opening for an animal education show for kids.\xa0 It\'s a weird mix that works, and while I definitely think this OP is memorable due to the description listed above, I\'m probably not gonna pop this one in for an independent listen any time soon.By contrast, we have ""Ookami Blues"", a much slower, lullaby-esque song sung by Ranka\'s seiyuu.\xa0 It\'s kind of a fun song because you can progressively hear Ranka get more ravenous as she\'s singing kind of off-key, and it\'s oddly humorous.\xa0 I almost don\'t want to say it\'s a \'song\' per say because it\'s much more than that.\xa0 But it\'s definitely memorable due to how unique it is, and I\'m kind of all for that.Final Thoughts:I honestly did not expect this series of all things to get an adaptation.\xa0 I found the source material randomly one day and been reading it ever since it peaked my interest.\xa0 Never once did I ever think to myself, ""Wow, I can\'t wait to review this series one day"" because it was always that one manga I read in my down time every now and then when they have a new chapter out.\xa0 But truth is stranger than fiction, so I guess I\'m writing my online essay for it.As much fun as I had reliving the earliest arcs of the manga, I didn\'t really find this adaptation to be all that great.\xa0 There were a few things I did like such as the show injecting as much nature footage as they could because technically this show educates the audience on various animal facts, as well as Meimei because that panda is my favorite character and seeing her animated was a treat.\xa0 But the adaptation as a whole feels so rushed that it doesn\'t feel like most of the things I watched had a lot of weight behind them.\xa0 Entire arcs that spanned multiple chapters got condensed down into a single episode, so a lot of details got skipped over, and even entire arcs got cut out in favor of moving forward into something else that seemed like a more \'fitting\' climax.Disregarding the manga\'s content altogether, the show still felt like it was missing something because the show\'s just event after event after event.\xa0 Nothing sits still and as humorous they make each species\'s fact/gag, that\'s all we really get out of this adaptation.\xa0 As such, my recommendation is to watch only if you\'re interested in a school comedy that\'s equally weird and educational.\xa0 Murenase definitely has its charm and intrigue, but the adaptation doesn\'t feel like anything beyond an animated slideshow of various animal species, so any story or conflict/impact there might\'ve been is either gone or put to the wayside.\xa0 The only time conflict ever matters is at the end of the series which, given how adaptations work, is really just par for the course in order to give the cour a last hurrah.', ""(I'll put it here just in case: Warning, this may spoil you, watch the Anime first before reading).It was interesting to watch, recommended for kid minded adults. There's some Ecchi that reveals being half nude and mating season but it was a little bit educational and cute to watch. I just don't like the way they handled the males art in every animal, you can clearly see almost all female animals has a body of a human while the male animals doesn't. They tried to make this as a fan service while showing a limited kinds of animals which is very cute but not that...great.I enjoyed watching this even if the plot was out of order.The only thing I disliked about this animation was that they portrayed in the theme song that there were 5 main female characters but was not given more emphasize and only Ranka and Jin haggled the thoughts scenes (whatever term you call it) and Hitomi on the other hand became a supportive character that being a heroine without any realization to her character if she likes Jin or not. They didn't even consider making more scenes for the 5 female characters of the opening theme which consists of Ranka (has more dialogue), Hitomi became a mascot instead of a main, Miyubi's dying joke became redundant and was left to dust, Meimei the cute Panda stopped their joke about her masochism (why?), Kurumi the tsundere cat that I love just became another background character and Yukari's Mythical strength was not seen when fighting the EX Team. I believe there are many different factors I haven't included in this review but in short, there should be more comedy going on if they didn't rushed the job and tried to explore the premises instead of portraying the different aspects of their life as friends in a club. I just wanted it to be balanced and not make other possibilities to be left out which is kinda frustrating.Overall, I liked it and watched it till the end and not for the sake of finishing it but for the sake of love between Jin and Hitomi or Ranka if you shipped those two.Music wasn't bad.The OP wasn't bad but I realized it was based on some song like an adventure through the forest.ED seems calming.Art is good but the animation became clunky like its from a cartoon at some parts.As a said earlier, the Characters need more scenes especially sub-characters.Story, it has some potential but I was utterly disappointed but I recommend it. great.I enjoyed watching this even if the plot was out of order.The only thing I disliked about this animation was that they portrayed in the theme song that there were 5 main female characters but was not given more emphasize and only Ranka and Jin haggled the thoughts scenes (whatever term you call it) and Hitomi on the other hand became a supportive character that being a heroine without any realization to her character if she likes Jin or not.

It features Seton Academy, a school where all sorts of animals attend. This includes two humans as well, one of whom is the protagonist, Jin. However, he absolutely despises animals to the point he spends a lot of time reading about animal science such that he’ll have the knowledge to be able to deal with them if the situation ever arises. Despite that, he somehow ends up getting...pulled into joining the ‘pack’ of an overtly energetic and kind of dumb wolf girl named Ranka, whose dream is to become the boss of a great pack. They both also end up joining the cooking club, a club led by the only other human at Seton, a kind girl named Hitomi, whom Jin is infatuated with.The anime is essentially just the various hijinks that those three and all the other friends they make end up involved in. These hijinks are always tied in some manner to actual science about animals and there’s a good amount of footage and pictures of real animals with a narrator just throwing out animal facts so there is a good amount you can learn. However, how the actual science ends up playing into things is a complete mess because the world is inconsistent nonsense. There are characters that are constantly dying to show how easily such species die, but they don’t actually die. The teachers are all dinosaurs who it seems can’t even fit into the school building. Girl animals are like kemonomimis while boy animals are far into the furry side of the spectrum. Animals often don’t know basic information about themselves and need to be told by Jin as some sort of twist. There’s an entire group of extinct animals complaining about being extinct… except obviously they’re not. It’s honestly impossible to list it all. And also, often even when the actual science is included, the plot doesn’t follow it at all and it just throws in a disclaimer at the bottom noting that what’s being shown isn’t anywhere near true.It’s completely and utterly absurd from beginning to end. But despite that, it does still manage to capture both the charm of seeing and learning about animals, which I will note is surprisingly hard to do for me as I in general hate nature, while also being filled to the brim with an endless stream of great comedy. The characters are all really bizarre and one dimensional with any character or relationship development also being incredibly simplistic. But it introduces new characters every episode and because there are all sorts of different animals, there are all sorts of different characters, and thus the diversity of the cast holds things up on the character side. And while the focus usually is on new characters, there are a number of smaller side stories that are developing over the course of the anime, the most noticeable of which is the random cuts to the completely disconnected story of the lion trying to woo an impala. Thus, the variety to plot and the fast pacing it uses in getting through things also prevents the plot from getting boring despite there not really being much plot at all. Ultimately, there’s no depth at all, but it’s still a lot of fun.The art and animation were pretty good and fit well, which I think is impressive considering the variety to the animals and all the weird stuff it kept trying to do. How it mixed in the real with the nonsensical so seamlessly was also pretty impressive. Character designs were all over the place and honestly hard to judge holistically because different designs were trying to do different things. The soundtrack was solid enough though not particularly exceptional. The OP fit the anime perfectly in terms of the song and visuals, and the song was pretty fun too. The ED also fit reasonably well and had a decent song and visuals. I really liked how the OP and ED changed from episode to episode though. pulled into joining the ‘pack’ of an overtly energetic and kind of dumb wolf girl named Ranka, whose dream is to become the boss of a great pack.

Seton Gakuen (aka My Gym Partner Is A Wolf) is a story about Mazama Jin who used to go to a human school where everyone was the same. Now he goes to an animal school because Lyon’s his last name.The story takes place at Seton Academy where a wide variety of (anthropomorphic) animals attend.Jin is one of the only two humans, the other being a girl Hitomi.Jin encounters a lone wolf named Ranka and she asks Jin to form a pack with her. Problem is Jin hates animals.Jin, Hitomi, and Ranka create a cooking club. And eventually more animals join. Female animals because...this is a harem.A sloth, a koala, a cat, a hyena, and a panda. Each with their own characteristics.Jin really wants to spend time with his fellow human Hitomi. But the wolf Ranka is very clingy as she has imprinted on him.Ranka sees herself as the pack leader, and Jin as essentially her husband.The anime is pretty funny. And even educational. You can learn a few interesting facts about animals.The female animals look like typical anime girls but with animal ears and tails. Thats how the anime takes advantage of the sex appeal. The males are just animals who stand up right like humans.But the ecchi stuff isnt too extreme (unfortunately).There is a naked mole-rat who feels embarrassed when wearing clothes so she strips to her underwear when people are not around.

I thought would be maybe a heartwarming tale of how he changed to love animals etc or we would learn how this evolutionary step came, but that would of involved thought.I am guessing despite the ecchi moments from the education interruptions, this was designed for young kids or those with animal fetishes who will watch anything for bunny ears and cats, etc.The premise is 2 humans are at a school for animals, they instantly bond as the instinct of sticking...with their own pack, the girl wants to start a cooking club, so the boy follows thinking he will get some, then makes no real romantic moves.The guy continually tells animals how he hates them, and yet they don't avoid him, they don't hate him, they act fine apart from when the wolf is in heat, which he gets further with than the other human.It's harem'y, has a bit of fan service for those ecchi moments, but overall is a trash story that just doesn't add up.   It has more plot holes, it's tropey and I struggled to continue watching it, thinking would have a redeeming quality, which it failed to show.So a failed story, underdeveloped characters who we find nothing about, repeated tropey jokes just made it seem trash.

The whole plot of the story is just okay and yes it’s a anime about human like animals but it’s not beastars lol.

And that reason probably have something to do with my passion in animals. as the name of the name implies, Murenase! Seton Gakuen is a slice of life mixed with comedy elements that takes place in a world where animals, or should i say anthropomorphic animals learning like normal students would do at an academy. So here is my rather not so long review on Seton Academy : Join...the Pack!One of the things that i really adore is the opening and ending songs, especially the latter like it literally melted my heart every single time i listen to it. It is so cute and lovely to the point that i didnt even skip watching it in almost every single episode. Other than that, the sound design is quite good. the voice actors had done a splendid job portraying the personalities of the characters as shallow and one dimensional as they are.Speaking of characters, we have our standard main protagonist, Jin who just gotten elected at an academy filled with wild animals and also a person who hate animals because of some incident happened to him when he was a child. Being the only human in that academy, or so he thought until he encountered with a human female whom he fell over heels for her. But wait, where is the harem if the anime has it on the tag? well, that is when a lone wolf named Ranka decided to join the cooking club which started by the human characters and thus begin the daily lives of Jin and his harem as more female animals also joined their pack. To be honest, most of the characters did not really stand out that much and does not help that some of them are really shallow and didnt show not even minor character developments at all.There is not much story being told as it is basically about the daily lives of members of a cooking club at an animal academy searching for more members to join their pack . There are some issues that are addressed like whether if it is morally okay for different species of animals to become a pack together which is what the members of cooking club unintentionally had initially done.As i mentioned in the first paragraph about me being a zoology nerd, that is pretty much the biggest reasons why i decided to watch the entire thing. Not only there are short sessions where the narrator will explain general facts on specific animals but i am also surprised on how accurate they are although there are some misinformation that really made me angry. But overall, it is a decent comedy anime and i did laugh at some parts even though the fan service can be a bit overblown at times.i give it a 7/10 the Pack!One of the things that i really adore is the opening and ending songs, especially the latter like it literally melted my heart every single time i listen to it.

Also at first, I was prejudiced by its score but after reading some reviews I gave it a shot...and I enjoyed it so I hope this helps you if you have the same situation. and I enjoyed it so I hope this helps you if you have the same situation.', 'The show has some cute character designs and fun gags, but it all feels very shallow and goes absolutely nowhere.One of my biggest gripes with the show is the protagonist. In short, I don\'t know why Jin is in this series at all. The guy hates animals, seems annoyed in every scene he\'s in, nothing ever goes his way and, although the first few episodes revolve around him and Ranka, later on he gets heavily sidelined in favour of the female lead and other side characters. It seems all Jin ever does is talk about how much...he hates everything and spout an animal fact about one of the other characters to magically resolve whatever conflict is going on in the episode. I just felt frustrated watching this, although he\'s not the most likable of charactersI wanted to see him evolve, I wanted to see his relationship with Ranka or Hitomi develop, I just wanted something to happen.Another major flaw in this series, for me, was the lack of narrative focus. The first half of the season introduces the main group of characters, which is to be expected, they\'re quirky, the jokes are still fresh and the interactions are interesting to watch. But the latter half of the episodes is not focused on seeing how these characters play off of each other, rather, they keep introducing new characters each episode to the point that I ceased to care about any of them. Characters like the koala, the panda and the cat, which are supposed to be part of the main crew, just feel like background characters. They\'re introduced with some interesting traits and dynamics but then nothing is done with any of it. The koala is just completely thrown aside and never gets any attention beyond her introduction. The panda is introduced as an arrogant idol with personality issues and a masochist side, but after her debut episode she\'s just an average nice girl and none of it is ever brought up again. The cat girl is just a pile of nothing, shows up at random, acts like a cat (in contrast to most characters which tend to act more like humans), barely interacts with any of the other characters or does anything of note.I guess I just expected more coming into this. Beyond some funny bits, like the after credits scenes of the lion\'s romance with an impala, there\'s just not a lot here. If they wanted to focus on Hitomi and the side characters they should\'ve just made this a ""Cute girls doing cute things"" sort of series. As it is I expected Jin and Ranka to be the focus, along with the cooking club. But they spent way too much time focusing on introducing random characters that weren\'t even around long enough for me to care. In the end, the lingering feeling I have is that watching this was just a waste of time seeing as nothing went anywhere. he hates everything and spout an animal fact about one of the other characters to magically resolve whatever conflict is going on in the episode.

I no one talking about what I wanted to rant about so I had to do this....This is the I wouldn’t have sex with you even if you were the last guy on earth anime adaption. Jin is such a cuck that Hitomi would rather fuck a hermaphrodite hyena and a female Neanderthal than the last human male on earth and she’s not even gay. I loved the anime but Jin got cucked so hard. Looks like he’s going to have to fuck a dog. The dog will most likely cuck him for the chad hyena later as well. Talk about depressing. This should go on one of those top anime betrayals/saddest anime endings list along with Yui yahaloosing on origaru. Big oof. Feels bad man. lol. I'm kinda joking but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel depressed after the anime ended knowing the hyena got more relationship and character development than Jin did. especially after the special episode where they basically gang banged Hitomi. Jin not only got cucked out of his girl but his role as harem protagonist as well. Oof. I don't think I've ever seen a show where the last man on earth got cucked. I asked myself; how was that even possible? How could Jin have possibly fucked this up? He had one fucking job. At least they were original in that sense.Besides that, the intro song was a cacophony of synchronized furry chaos and I loved it. It had me grinning every time it came on. The ending song was purposefully cringe and adorable. It followed the feeling of the show perfectly. The music was easily the best part of the show. Unless you love shows about getting cucked by furries.I can understand why Jin was an emotional train wreck. I myself can't stand howling dogs or loud animals. In the entire show, Jin is basically suffering and no one really cares. There's no way they could do a season two bc Jin would have post-traumatic stress disorder so bad that the whole show would be about him trying to cope with being cucked so hard. Not to mention chad hyena, and every other animal would be lining up to bang Hitomi's brains out. Now that I think about it maybe they should make a second season under that pretext. I would watch it. What a shit show. I loved it.And that all I've got to say about that. This is the I wouldn’t have sex with you even if you were the last guy on earth anime adaption.

This world is so stupidly confusing. Early on, it shows a flashback to about 40 years ago, and it\'s just a zoo. With humans. And animals. What happened to earth in this abhorrent landscape that within 40 years, humans have had to deal with all animals spontaneously acquiring human level intelligence, but also all female animals just turning into humans with different ears. How. How is it that dinosaurs, and other extinct species just came back to...life. That\'s another thing. The kind of villains? for the last 3 episodes are clearly not extinct, as they are there talking about being extinct. But say there\'s only one of each of them, wouldn\'t that take away the pandas fame as being 3rd rarest? See what i mean. This world is like a Jenga tower of mediocrity and if you ask any questions it instantly breaks apart. Also is some death stranding shit happening, where you can\'t die, because they specifically say the sloth dies many times, but then she just appears back. Also, what up with height? All height proportions are so off it makes me sick. They kinda explain the wolf girl, but why is the student council girl human proportions when her species is tiny, but the honey badger is tiny. It makes me want to die. Apart from the frankly terrible world building, the scene with the bears in the first episode was genuinely leading to rape if the wolf girl didn\'t show up. Then I was thinking, will this affect the human girl in anyway meaningful, maybe give a good message? NOPE. It led to LITERALLY nothing. The character writing is also quite horrible. The koala has no personality, the panda had something good set up with the masochism thing, but the writers quickly forgot that. The sloth is ok, but she\'s really just a quiet version of the human girl. The human girl is annoyingly boring, being the most cliche character I\'ve ever seen. The main guys just like ""I hate animals"" which were constantly reminded of, but nothing comes of it. He just says it and then just starts talking to wolf girl. There is also continuity errors such as the wolfs sister ranging from about 3 metres to a titan who can hold a human in the palm of her hand. The show also isn\'t funny, but thats subjective. There is one thing that I found funny in the entire series, and it\'s because I already knew that hyena girls had dicks, so when I saw in the opening that there seemed to be a gender confused hyena I thought it would be funny if they actually did something with that. Now, I didn\'t particularly like how it turned out, just kinda that they included that in this anime. Honestly, it\'s not the worst thing you could watch if all you want is to turn your brain off and go ""wolf cute"" or ""wolf funny"", but if you want literally anything else, never touch this show. It\'s not good, and I\'m fed up with the standard that if the quality is completely standard in every way, but a show has cute girls it\'s instantly alright. I want a better standard and it\'s shows like this that clearly don\'t care for quality and are just pumping out content, that really annoy me. life. That\'s another thing.

Negima!?,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1546/Negima,"['Negima!? is not to be confused with Mahou Sensei Negima!. They\'re part of the same universe, but are completely different stories. Negima!? is produced by SHAFT, and their crazy experimental presence is definitely noted in this show.Story: Negima!? takes a completely different direction from its counterpart, deviating from the manga storyline. The first episode opens up with the final battle between the Thousand Master and Evangeline McDowell. Evangeline gets turned into a loli form and we then start the story with Negi Springfield. Negi starts his teaching career over at an all-girls school. The crazy mischief starts when it\'s revealed to his students that Negi...is really a magician.Note that this show is for comedic purposes, and should not be taken in serious comparison to the manga storyline. The plot paces itself fairly well and we get a lot of insight on the lesser known characters in each episode.Art: SHAFT\'s strange art style is presented in the form of Negima!? The character designs are crisp, the art is fluid, and we get some colorful environments all around. Some of the characters look a tad bit different than their counterparts in Mahou Sensei Negima! but it still works in perfection.Not to mention they make some excellent work of Asuna\'s hair.Sound: The soundtrack of Negima!? is nothing too special. It has some nice quirky music during the episodes and transitions nicely when it gets to the \'dramatic\' parts. What stands out the most is the OP of Negima!? The song is sung by the various voice actresses of all the students and has several different variations. Not to mention a full length song of the OP was in episode 19.Character: Unlike the Mahou Sensei Negima! anime, Negima!? gives plenty of screen time to all the girls in the class. For such a large cast of characters, we get to see everyone participate in the anime. We also get introduced to some new characters in Shichimi and Motsu and a few others. From Shichimi\'s strange body contortions to Motsu\'s epic ""...in a good way"" line, this dynamic duo is probably the highlight of the characters.Enjoyment/Overall: Some people hate this series because it\'s not part of the Mahou Sensei Negima! line or it\'s crap because SHAFT ruined everything, but I thoroughly enjoyed this series because it has its funny moments and because it\'s a different approach to an already on-going series.Unfortunately, subs are nearly non-existant as Mahora Academy simply reduced subbing to one episode per 7 months after episode 20. Whatever the case, we\'re down to waiting for these slowpokes or for Funimation to release their DVDs. Hopefully they won\'t trash Negima!?\'s dub... in a good way. is really a magician.Note that this show is for comedic purposes, and should not be taken in serious comparison to the manga storyline.

If your a fan of Negima the manga, your probably not gonna like this and you might want to delete any episodes you have on your harddrive (I mean return the dvd you bought, of course that's what I meant). I walk a middle ground here as a fan of both of those series, however, it did get boring for me as it continued on.Now, if you think you knew the characters from the series, you'll only be half right (for the most part)...the characters are altered to be more humorous. For example, Asuna's search for the chupacabra (which is probably the worst depiction of the creature I've ever seen and yes I know that's the whole point of the joke). A few new characters are also introduced, but we all know how filler characters are.I suppose I should get this out here quickly, the story is altered. Instead of attempting to follow the plot of the manga then ending on a horrible filler ending (like its predecessor), it doesn't even try to the follow the manga and makes a whole new story revolving around a powerful magical artifact. This is kind of a double edged sword, atleast its not as bad as the filler ending in its predecessor, its not as good as the original story.The focus of this series is comedy and action, which sounds good in theory. The comedy, however, sometimes gets cringe worthy or boring. The action doesn't meet up with the bar set up by other fighting animes that have done some crazy sh*t (its a little dull in comparison, but others might still find enjoyment in them).Now, the English dub (all sub lovers can probably ignore this) tries to be authentic by giving all of the British characters accents (just the British ones). This would be ok, if Negi didn't sound so whiny and weak. Sure, he's ten years old, but he's ends up sounding whiny and like a wimp. In the manga, he had a little more balls.Overall, its an ok show and half the reason of my middleish rating was being fan of the manga. If you like gag comedies and action and wondered what happened if they were merged together, you got this show. If you can't stand the weirder kind of Japanese humor and a few jokes you sometimes can't fully get, you might want to look elsewhere (quick little note: pacing could be better).Go Baka-Rangers! (.....I hate myself for doing that).P.S. I like to just add, I think another problem was the feeling it was not Ken Akamatsu's work, but more the work of Akiyuki Shinbo.P.S.S Anyone else confused they made a new manga series to go along with this? the characters are altered to be more humorous.

The story's plot is good and that I find it interesting. The action contained in this good as well though it could have been better if the battles are much tougher.

It also seems that there are confusing parts in the story but these are explained later on.All in all, the story is great.Art:Generally, the art's well...done I should say. Things are colorful in this and the art style is very creative. Everything is detailed down to the smallest object (well not always though). The chibis drawn are adorable in their own way and this also adds to the great art style.Sound:The opening and ending songs are quite catchy which I liked. The background musics are awesome especially during battle. The sounds make the battle scenes more tense and that's a good thing. Insert songs also add to the atmosphere.

Very stylish, fiuld, and quite hyperactive.While it does look just like every other Shaft anime, with random images every where and well... just plain random, it looks great but alot of the female characters have very similiar looks and it doesn't help that they wear school uniforms.SOUND: Just like my review with the first Negima anime, I watched Funimations dub version and even the dub is better in this one. With the experience gained through the first dub, each voice actor does a better performance and they don't have that slow having to get used to it feel that alot of dubs suffer from.The most notable voice actor is Cherami Leigh, who voices Setsuna,  is new in this dub and can perform action scenes a great deal better than Dana Schultes, who was Setsuna's original voice actor, from the first anime.Even though everyone else sounds better, Greg Ayres still sounds like Negi with cancer.The theme music is quite catchy and Funimation even made a dub version of each theme song that, depending on your taste, may sound better than the japanese versions.OVERALL:The Good:+ Better animation than the first anime.+ Improved english dub.+ Minor characters get more screen time than other adaptions.The Bad:- Just a reboot, not a continuation (This is especially disappointing to those who read the manga and watched the first anime).- Way too random at times, and sometimes utterly pointless.- Fans of the source material may become alienated.- The gags are more miss than hit.- Annoying mascots and villains.Lots of disappointment is expected to anyone who is expecting a true to the manga adaptation, but this is still undoubtly better than the first anime with better animation, a better dub, more action, and a different way of story progression, but the gags can get annoying and the second half of this anime feels dragged out.But there is more screen time for even the most ignored characters and the short little gags at the end of each episode are enjoyable. the original source material right off the bat and introduces alot of the story relevent characters early (Like Setsuna and Chamo) and follows the gist of the Evangeline arc from the original story.After that the story goes off and basicly wonders around with random gag after gag within it's continuing original story arc that's filled with alot of almost non canon and almost pointless events with the inclusion of the most annoying mascots you'll ever see that are unfortunately relevent to the story and the very lame but relevent and somewhat interesting second antagionst after Evangeline.Fortunately interesting characters who had no place in the first anime finally get their own spot in this one (I'm talking about the sword wielding character Setsuna).Some characters get a few tweaks in their personality, Asuna is an idiot who's obsessed with finding a chubacabra, Takahata-Sensei apparently loves ramen, and even the most ignored characters get their own gags once in a while.But in the end, this is not the Negima fans know and love, and said fans will feel a bit alienated.ANIMATION: This is the biggest improvement compared to the first animes crappy animation. Very stylish, fiuld, and quite hyperactive.While it does look just like every other Shaft anime, with random images every where and well... just plain random, it looks great but alot of the female characters have very similiar looks and it doesn't help that they wear school uniforms.SOUND: Just like my review with the first Negima anime, I watched Funimations dub version and even the dub is better in this one.

We get a tale about Negi’s father fighting a vampire and how rather epic that fight had been, only to cut into a little bit dramatization of when Negi is given the assignment to go teach in Japan. This is a rather large contrast where the beginning of Season 1 was him already on his way to the school and the rather funny time he would have there (not to mention the strange love spell Asuna was doing in...the bathe). Even the little rodent that shows up partly through season 1 is in the first episode of season 2. I contribute the change to the fact that Shinbo was the director of this one. Yes, the guy that did Moon Phase, Dance in the Vampire Bund, Soultaker, Pani Poni Dash, and Madoka Magica.We learn almost every 31 girls all at once, getting almost all of their personalities at once. It’s a bit of a mind blowing experience to have that happen, making me wonder just how we are supposed to remember their names. Konoka Konoe is played much the same way as how Hazuki was played in Moon Phase but slightly more strong. She does work hard to get what she wants. Many of the other characters feel one dimensional or just don’t stand out at all and I think it’s based on how many episodes are contributed to them. We see Asuna and Konoka all the time and so therefore we get more of a personalized look into how each other act were as many of the others we see only for a brief time or when we get to one of their episodes. Sometimes even with something that doesn’t even feel like its part of the story, sort of like Hetalia in that sense. Still, this show does get into more of them then the first series and makes them a little more loveable except for Asuna. I’m sorry but she comes off as way to stupid and off then in the first which makes me pull away from the show. If they had played her a little more straight, then she might have become a bit more loveable.Another thing that makes this one different then the rest is that the first few episodes at least the first few episodes have a running plot that doesn’t really involve Asuna. It is all about the vampire girl and Negi. There are some side characters, but they don’t stand out as much as these two and the ‘epic fight’ that they are about to have. The thing with Asuna doesn’t happen until the third episode with a magical contract being created. I like how they didn’t wait until the very end for every girl to make a contract with Negi. And in the forth episode, he has another partner contract so it makes much more sense.Lot of the jokes turned very old very fast and the story went really into a odd storylines that don’t seem to mesh all that well together, but it does come into a climax although how that climax actually works is kind of up in the air. Now, this has a way of doing something similar to what Persona did in that it gets to a point where the show ‘ends’ in the middle, then they have more character development and then the final ‘battle’ as it where. Unfortunately, this anime has more dinking around then character development and storyline.The animation looks so much more like it was created as an OVA in the beginning with strange camera angles and high detailed lines. Even Negi who is just a young boy looks a little bit more adult and well defined then in season one. With a lot of the angles and such, it reminds me of Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei in how dramatic they try to be and yet how funny they get. In fact, they even have the writing on the chalkboard changing every time we pan back to the board. I’m a bit surprised that they fixed Asuna’s eyes so they would have the same color. They do cop out of some times with just a single frame but it isn’t really that bad. It actually makes the dramatic parts even more dramatic. Unfortunately, it’s when the animation looks extremely poor and low budget that makes me feel sad that they had done such a thing. Characters end up losing their shape and seem to just become stretched out piles of wonky colors sometimes. They do tend to take different animation styles and have them done in rather interesting ways but it all feels flat when we get the poorer parts or doesn’t seem to fit. Just as any anime from Shinbo, they have naked women in the transformations. This doesn’t exactly bother me although in some places they do tend to go overboard in detail. It’s rather low detailed that it doesn’t become bothersome to me, I seen much worse…The opening and ending remind me a lot like Sayonara, Zetsubou-Sensei so it’s really hard to look at the show differently then that show. Makes me wonder why this was dubbed and not Zetsubou. Many times though, the opening and ending seems to change at random. I give them a bit of props for this since it shows they had a lot of money for this, I just wish some of it would of gone for the main part of the show and the script.I seriously think we don’t need the narrator voice, which makes things feel very cheesy (to the point I smack my head against the table at times). Something about trying to make this show overly dramatic just makes me want to hit my head against the wall. I watched the English dub of course so again, it was overly dramatic and bothersome. I’m not very sure if it would have been any better as the Japanese dub though.In the end of watching it, it is rather interesting seeing a new take on a show that I watched. I would say watch it if you want a different kind of comedy then the first season. Even though the show is really strange and even more out of control then the first, it is a bit interesting. the bathe).

If you aren’t sure that you’re into the action harem anime sub-genre. I highly recommend that you would watch this series first. It sets the bar for what a good harem anime would be. Equal parts big cast of females with varying characteristics with a strong voice acting cast, sprinkled with a semi-serious plot, caked with large amounts of comedy and slapstick. Bring this together and you can pretty much name any harem anime around.Why do I say this is a benchmark series? This is the only series I know of...that can have one boy socially interact equally with over 30 high-school girls in an amazingly believable way. On top of that, each girl literally has their own unique kind of personality or some silly little ‘hook’ to make them different from each other. The funny thing above that is that all of them are hilarious as well. I could type forever talking about each girl and how each of them is good in their own way. But people who love moe anime, you will find at least 5 you will absolutely love. As a fan of these types of series I found all of them very enjoyable.As harem anime rely heavily on character chemistry and comedic value, if you don’t like comedy you shouldn’t even bother trying to watch this as most of the Japanese-centric jokes will go well over your head. As a twelve episode series (and one prologe episode) story progression moves surprisingly slow. But to keep the viewer glued to the screen, the series carries a large amount of mini-episodes sprinkled in every series. You will see them make spoofs of Gundam, Power Ranger, and many other spoofs if your knowledge of Japanese pop culture is well versed.The production value is pretty good considering this was produced by shaft. Their production values are generally done in high value, unfortunately its Shaft so their style of anime always transitions the same way from one anime series to another. Granted its a style that has been working for them for over 30 years so you really should fix what isn’t broken, although its a little old at times.Overall I completely enjoyed the whole series and is best enjoyed in small bites. Chupacabras UNITE! If watch any anime that's tied with a manga with anything short of a wide open mind, then you will sadly be disappointed for the rest of your life. that can have one boy socially interact equally with over 30 high-school girls in an amazingly believable way.

As noted in other reviews, this series has almost nothing to do with the manga storyline what-so-ever. Sure the Series starts with the Nagi-Evangeline fight, and that has some of the best visual presentation i think i\'ve ever seen in an anime, but after that it goes....to left field...in a good way. (Not really...just keep reading...)One of the big differences...a fan of the manga will notice right off the bat is the turning of 3 of the most minor characters in the series (though one is major in a few ways) into 3 of the characters that the story revolves around in one degree or another--those three are: Takamichi, Anya, and Nekane. And it also introduces 2 characters that are series exclusive- Shichimii and Matsuo...Character development in this series is a bit off as well, with Negi essentially making contracts with all of the students in his class, to avoid becoming a Chupacabra (Yes...i said Chupacabra) instead of the ermine that is mentioned in the manga.Story- As far as the story goes, it was enjoyable to me because i\'m a Negima fan, while the first 3 episodes had me hooked, i am a bit disappointed in the rest of the series. It starts off well with the Evangeline arc, but then it begins to shift to a filler style storyline that sort of fits with what they were trying to do with this series. Essentially Negi is the target of a mysterious ""Darkness"" and between that and a mysterious ""Black Rose Baron"" as well as Shichimi and Matsuo things get...for lack of a better term...stupid. Often times episodes don\'t really have a solid story to them and have to resort to brief fillers to get through the episode, while some are mildly entertaining, most are pretty bleh.One thing i will say about this series is that it must be meant for younger viewers to help get them into the Negima universe, because as far as story plot goes, if you can guess about 2-3 possibilities, then there\'s a good shot that you\'re right--Case in point- the ""Black Rose Baron\'s"" identity- I figured out about 4-5 episodes earlier who that character\'s identity really was, and as it turned out- HEY! i was right...I really wondered for a while if it was meant to be a serious entry into the Negima world, because if it was, then the writers failed on an epic level with some of the plots and storylines and character developments. HOWEVER- I don\'t think this is the case, i think its just a playful series meant for entertainment as something different, not to be taken too seriously.And it seems that the SHAFT writers have an extremely weird fixation on all things Chupacabra...as you\'ll see it ALOT in the series, enough that it gets to the point where you\'re going ""Really? Move on already"", however they actually do that with a couple of other things as well....But despite all of my complaining, if you can stand all of the little quirks of the story,  its really not that bad.Art- SHAFT did this...which is often times obvious with their unique way of doing things. I will say on the record right now though, as stated earlier the Nagi-Evangeline fight is possibly the best animation style that I\'ve ever seen in an anime hands-down. It was impressive enough to hook me all the way through to the end hoping for more...As far as the characters go, SHAFT did a good job not going overboard with things, all of the colors and characters pop out at you, though there are certain students who kind of seem to blend together, but in all honesty they do that to me in the manga too, so it doesn\'t really matter. One thing i\'m personally curious about is SHAFT not making Asuna\'s eyes multi-colored---in the first anime, as well as the manga, Asuna has Green in one eye and Blue in the other. My thought is that maybe since they wrote out Asuna\'s abilities and essentially all of her history that they didn\'t need to make her stand out too much.Characters- well...i pretty much wrote about this earlier, but as stated above there are a lot of minor characters that play a bigger part in this anime. ALL of Negi\'s students become partners with him, so you have to see each and every student, sometimes that gets to be a little...overbearing. Sure to me its great watching Takamichi, but there are some students that are shown often that made me wonder why couldn\'t they fit another more recognizable character in this scene? Evangeline in this is actually rather tame compared to the other series and manga as well, which makes things kinda feel weird if you\'ve read/seen those entires in the Negima! universe. Other than that, the only other point worth mentioning is Konoka and Setsuna\'s ""relationship"" the Konoka in this series is rather ""puckish"" in that she likes to play jokes on people at certain times, a lot of these times are at Setsuna\'s expense.Overall- If this is the first Negima you\'ve seen, then you\'ll probably like it, if you\'ve read the manga or seen the other anime series, you\'ll immediately wonder ""what the hell?"" and probably either watch it, or immediately stop. The only reason i kept watching was because it was random enough that i kinda wanted to see how everything turned out. Even though before most of the major plot points i already knew what was going to happen within a few episodes of it happening, though around episode 10-12, there\'s a major plot point that made me laugh, even though it was kinda expected...in a good way. a fan of the manga will notice right off the bat is the turning of 3 of the most minor characters in the series (though one is major in a few ways) into 3 of the characters that the story revolves around in one degree or another--those three are: Takamichi, Anya, and Nekane.

I honestly do not suggest this anime to people who have read the manga or want an accurate description of what the story line should be like. It was okay I guess.Character- It's based off of negima which is made by the same person who made love hina so unless you try to mess it up there will be good character development.Enjoyment- I actually did not enjoy this series at all it left a very bitter taste in my mouth compared to the sweetness brought to me by reading the manga and watching Mahou Sensei Negima.Overall- I thought this version of the series was a complete joke and a waste of my time.

Also, I’ll remind you my reviews generally encompass the whole series of an anime unless otherwise stated (That is to say that no more seasons are coming out). So let’s get to it!Negima!?… I wanted to like this anime. I really did. In fact, I quite fancied the previous installment of Negima way back when. But, this time around, Negima just went...full crazy. You should never go full crazy, just like you should never go full retard. We saw where that got Simple Jack after all. (And Excel Saga too) There is something akin to a story here, but the level of ridiculousness encountered as the plot “develops” really is too much. The story is diminished because there are simply no boundaries of insanity that are off limits. Some might like that, but I don’t.Earning 2 points----------------------------I don’t even know how I should grade this. I mean, when we’re dealing with full crazy, the dialogue synced up nicely. Is that a good thing? I don’t even know. The one thing I will mention is that this time around, Negima focused more on a few characters, developing them to some extent beyond their roles in the previous anime. Job well done for what it’s worth.Earning 1.5 points---------------------Animation and style are fine. Luckily, for most anime this is a given 2 points. That holds true here as well. Speaking off the cuff, I’m pretty old school and don’t mind “substandard” animations/style/etc. as most people might. To make a game analogy, I remember one of my friends told me he couldn’t play FFIX because the graphics were too “bad”. That’s pretty sad. Hell, I still play games like Xenogears (which is a masterpiece) and I’ll be damned if I let the trivial mar what is by all other rights extraordinary!Earning 2 points---------------------Bonus points goes to… That opening! I have to admit, this anime had the catchiest opening song I’ve heard in a while. In English too!Earning 1 point (am I not merciful?)--------------------Add it all up and we have a dismal score of 6.5! Another fail for the anime universe. I recommend watching the first Negima! Unless of course you liked Excel Saga or something, then, go for it! To me, this is what happens when you do remakes. They come out like crap. What’s that say about the Final Fantasy VII remake on the horizon? For that matter, what’s with all the gaming references in this review? Frakkin Frak, GAH!!!As always, since I’m a critic, I’ll round down my score to a 6 because that’s just the way it goes. That way it’ll be better than expected when you watch it!

Till next time', 'This is Gansis\' and Shaft\'s foray into Ken Akamatsu\'s Negima world, and my first real dive into the franchise. I\'ve heard that fans weren\'t that into this series, which makes me a bit sad because despite its flaws (especially during broadcast), this is some of Shaft\'s best work.I\'ve actually seen an anime adaptation of Akamatsu\'s handiwork before, on recommendation from a friend: Love Hina. That was a ridiculous and yet sweetly sappy sort-of-harem romance that threw in as much fanservice it could without getting spanked by Japan\'s television networks. Oh, and the anime radically differed from the manga, I learned later. Oh well, the OVA...finale tied up the story nicely and Hocchan was great in her early starring role. I avoided the first Negima! anime because a 31-girl harem involving a boy younger than them wasn\'t appealing to me.When this series first popped up, I was like, ""Oh, great, another season of Negima... wait, what\'s with the question mark?"" Then I saw that Shaft was doing the animation, and by this time I knew they were a capable studio. I dive into the TV broadcast, and I discover that this is like an animated variety show, but way more fun than the ones on Japanese TV (which are basically reality shows, but with ridiculous dares given to washed-up comedians and actors... and this genre is handily beaten by big-time TV stars going to interesting places and eating, because Japan), and not lacking at all in the drama or character department.As far as story goes, I\'m usually not a huge fan of ""we\'re winding up for a plot twist... but not this week"" style of story writing, but because of the ample comedic scenes and great chemistry even among some of the lesser-known students, I was distracted enough to not care. The show is roughly split up into 4 arcs: the prologue (getting to know the girls, especially Asuna and Eva), the secret identity arc, the false school arc, and the epilogue. The way the story foreshadowed the final boss and yet made you fervently wish it wasn\'t that person lent a genuinely tragic tone to the overall drama.The magic system is comprised of ""temporary"" Pactio contracts and whatever other magic that wizards use. The Pactio system, sealed by a kiss and providing one of 3 cards (armor/rare, cosplay, and ""dud""), is the more interesting of the two, and naturally receives the most focus. While the armor or cosplay cards are generally desirable, the ""dud"" card serves multiple purposes beyond comic relief-- they are a fun expression of each girl (especially for the second opening credits song), and are a critical plot device just before the climactic episodes of the show.When Shaft is able to wrangle the key animators needed to draw a shot, it\'s usually either a great expression of the story at that point, or the key animators goofing off (both are OK in my book). Being an early Shaft production, there are still frames substituting for more difficult animation cuts. Some of these filler frames they used are silly, spelling out ""mambo"" in the opening credits with various girls (or Suka (""Dud"") with Motsu and Shichimi) when the final version shots are of girls doing a synchronized swimming dive, or twins doing a bumping dance. Some of the shot designs will look familiar to those who have seen the ef series, like dividing the screen into black and white halves with magical writing in one half.While the final animation for the opening credits is fantastic, the disc release doesn\'t always use the same audio as the broadcast-- some episodes would have groups other than Negi/Asuna/Konoka/Setsuna singing, but the disc release used that group as the default, and the lyrics are actually different when the second verse (spoken dialogue over music) is used. I wish I could have the different opening songs/dialogue and the final animation, and I\'m not 100% sure whose fault that is, Shaft\'s or Funimation\'s. This is probably because the intended final version is far more complicated than they could pull off-- I\'m thinking they wanted to feature every single ""team"" in Negi\'s class plus Anya and Nekane like how massive idol groups like AKB48 splits up into groups or ""units"". And if you collect all the different versions of ""1000% Sparking!"" sung by each group of voice actresses, you can hear unique mini-dramas in the second verse. Awesome, to be sure, but a bit more than they could handle, and it relies too heavily on the otaku Japanese collector.There are a few ending themes as well, the main one being ""A-Li-Ya!"" (which, like 1000% Sparking!, has versions sung by every team in the show) whose arrangements made it easy on the voice actresses singing it, and was accompanied by a fun mini-sketch involving 4 girls playing percussion instruments. The other ending theme played during the first arc of the show, and it was a nice relaxing number. The BGM is mostly fun to listen to, especially 2 ""derp scene"" tracks.I\'m rewatching the series now (lost count how many times this is), and I\'m still unearthing new things. For instance, the explorer helmets are styled after each character\'s ""dud"" card in the library scene, except Konoka (but you can assume her getup is Australian). And yes, Negi has that ""dud"" card of sorts, but only for one still shot. The little extras like the (fake) sentai series Baka Rangers, or a little South Park parody featuring Nekane, or a reprise of the first Negima opening credits song at a pivotal scene in the show pack the show, all maximize replay value. This is quintessential Shaft animation, and I love it to bits.So I went back and tried to watch series 1. While (allegedly) faithful to the original, it felt like dragging an anvil compared to Gansis/Shaft\'s production. I also watched the official sequel, UQ Holder. Same thing, the dialogue and the slow pace feel like the show never raised the anchor before setting sail. The way Gansis and Shaft made sure there was always ""light"" in the production, whether it\'s lighthearted moments or hope even in hopeless situations made this show, well, magical for me. finale tied up the story nicely and Hocchan was great in her early starring role.

He gets an appointment at a girls academy, and (trigger harem flag) must keep being a Mage a secret. That's pretty much it. Each episode different things happen- usually focusing on or involving one of the girls in his class, and slowly reveal.... slowly change Negi into... hm...'Stuff happens'?If you are new and wonder if you should start here or with the other...version- it depends on how much viewing you plan on doing.If you just want 'a taste' to decide if you like it, or only want to watch the bare minimum- I recommend you ignore this and go to 'Mahou Sensei Negima!'If you already plan on watching them all, then I think it would be better to start here.I'll explain myself in a bit.I think the idea of 'rebooting' the series was to improve the plot of the first story while keeping the character elements and other parts that worked in the first, and it does improve some of the plotting compared to the earlier version in the early episodes.It also changes the overall tone of the anime, and makes a few changes I think work against it- so I'll get to that right now.In this series, there are a few things I like less:The art is generally lower quality. The multi-camera collages are neat, but don't offset the generally lower quality.The sound is pretty flat, with minimal special effects.Many character arcs are quite abbreviated.The bg music is frequently intrusive, with it's level being too high, or the limited selection itself off-putting.The Pactio cards (the items produced as a function of Negi making a pact with a partner) are changed drastically in Negima!?- going from a permanent  representation of a useful contract, to a disposable reflection of the luck-based, (& frequently gag-like) manifestationThe largest story arc is pretty close to a waste of time.A lot of episodes within that arc are pretty much filler.You know how an anime gets cancelled, then the last 6 episodes or whatever are 'trying to wrap up'- where they force everything important in all the sudden? This doesn't do that. It's the opposite- as if they expected it to run for a season, and someone told them 'Hey- you can do another, that's ok, right?'...Overall, the tone of Negima!? is much more random, nonsense and slapstick- (NOT 'in a good way'). In fact, any gag is probably fair game- so 4th wall breaking dialog, narrator/character conversations, and tons of transitions with quick comments/skits are wedged in.

The art and characters are all quite good, but the plot falls apart after the first half and is clogged with filler. ', 'More or less directly copied from my review on Anime Planet-----------------------------When I first watched this back in April 2012, I was relatively new to watching anime, so I didn\'t have many standards. I just wanted to watch something where I could kick back and enjoy myself with a decent story, entertaining characters and a bit of humour.The first time I watched Negima!?, it delivered. Sixteen months later... not so much.StoryWhat\'s notable about Negima!? is that it actually starts off with the original manga\'s plot; namely, the Evangeline arc. However, it\'s made clear that Negima!? is a spin-off from the original as this gets cleared up...in the first few episodes and fast-forwards a whole year after the incident.What makes this show stand apart from its parent show Negima!, besides the extra question mark, is that it focuses more on comedy and action compared to the original\'s harem antics. However, even the comedy starts to lose its lustre as the show drags on, becoming just the same jokes repeated with some variety thrown in every now and then.AnimationBeing done by Studio SHAFT, the animation is one of the saving graces of the anime. Bright colours are often used with odd angles and flashes of title cards featuring the characters, especially in the later stages of the anime, used to show a scene break. The actions were done really well, particularly the battle with Evangeline in the opening episodes.SoundNot really that much to say about the sound this time around.The opening song, ""Sparking 1000%!"", is one of my favourite songs, and would make it onto my top 50 anime openings list if I make one. There were various endings; ""Hoshizora Letter"" didn\'t really stick out for me, whereas the regular ending after it, ""A-LY-YA!"", was a lot more fun to listen to, and fit the light-hearted feel of the anime very well.The background music was never really particularly memorable, except for one or two tracks used during action scenes, which were also used in the first Mou Hitotsu no Sekai OVA.The voice actors were much the same as they were in the original Negima! anime. They brought the characters to life much more effectively than the original anime, but that may just be because of the series\' more colourful presentation.CharactersAs with the original, the characters is where Negima!? truly shines. What with introducing a total of thirty-six characters in the first episodes alone, there are a lot to choose from.One thing this anime does is stick with one attribute of each character and take it to the extreme; for example, Asuna, who in the original was often tired due to her paper routine and had poor grades as a result, was turned into an outright lazy character whose day started the moment class ended.One thing I really liked about Negima!? was the fact that it brought several characters who were never really important in the original right into the forefront much earlier, particularly the Narutaki twins and Kaede.Final thoughtsIn the end, Negima!? is nothing more than a spin-off of the original work. The only things the two share is the setting and the characters. It\'s better not to think too much when watching this anime, so just sit back, relax, with a nice cup of tea and watch the characters go through their various advantures.Story - 4.1Animation - 8.7Sound - 7.8Characters - 8.1Enjoyment - 9.0FINAL SCORE - 7.54/10 in the first few episodes and fast-forwards a whole year after the incident.What makes this show stand apart from its parent show Negima!, besides the extra question mark, is that it focuses more on comedy and action compared to the original\'s harem antics.

Serving as the gateway to my interest in bizarre comedies, alongside my love for it going so far that I even made a fan forum for it many years ago, even though it inevitably fell apart and I had sadly not discovered that AnimeSuki was a thing. But, I digress.The Shaft variation of the Negima series, this one follows the characters in a fully original story. Right off the bat for fans of the original, the characters are in a noticeably different area. The school setting looks far more unique than it did before...and, despite the first episode beginning with a literal flood of students trampling into the building, you never see anyone beyond the cast they want you to see ever again. Besides that, hair colors feel more correct with the characters\' personalities than ever before, especially Nodoka and Yue. And overall, you will see a refresh of designs as you watch it. I will assume you saw the original, as I wish to avoid repeating myself due to there being two different Negima anime out there.Now, the plot is everything to go on about. By that, I mean it\'s about what you would expect from Shaft. If I tried to summarize everything, I would get lost. So, I will instead go over what they copy from the material, rather than the original content. Negi, as usual, is your kid mage that is assigned to teach a group of high school girls English. You know, for some reason. They all think he is adorable and all that. But, the most noticeable differences occur in the writing and personalities. Some personalities are more exaggerated than before, well others are mostly the same. One character I would like to bring up is Asuna, who is still a douche, but it is toned down just a little and she really has a deeper connection with Negi here than she did in the original. She is also thinner.Oh, and if there is one thing they made sure to exaggerate, it\'s the kissing scenes. The most infamous thing about the anime is that Negi must invoke probationary contracts with his partners by kissing them, and Shaft made sure that a lot of the animation budget went towards every kissing scene. Granted, they kind of force all the other girls on him in this ridiculous falling scene, but a lot of them still get some passionate moments with Negi. And some surprise ones come later on.That aside, the comedy aspect is really the best part of this version of Negima. As you would expect from Shaft, there are moments of randomness that can really rile up your funny bone and there is rarely a moment where you can take a break from the comedy. If you are somebody that decides to watch anime in the fashion where you look at something else and simply run it in the background, you should avoid doing that at all costs with anything made by Shaft. And their version of Negima is no exception, for the first episode alone has you looking around the classroom so much that it almost hurts at how much is going on. And if you watch it subbed, well, good luck.My revisit, at first, seemed like I enjoyed this anime as much as I did years ago. However, approaching the second half, things actually got a bit bleak for me. And I can confidently say that I only love the first half as much as I did back then, but not so much the second. Maybe it\'s because they started to force the same running gags down my throat. Most notably, the Sasaki Makie one. There is just something about this joke that went from very funny to quite boring, up to the point where even the other girls started to get annoyed by it and would sometimes go ""here we go again"" before it began. Only props I have to give here are that they at least acknowledge it\'s a problem that Makie is treated so poorly.And, as usual, I dislike how an innocent character is treated poorly. The case this time being Asuna and Negi. Well she is more respectful towards him here than in the original, she is still pretty rude to him at the most simplest of times. And Negi being nervous is a trait that is more befitting of a kid, so you feel more bad for him than this scenario being done with high school characters, where they usually have the reason as the man being perverted. Negi is very much a child, though the one credit I have to give them for is the scene where Negi accidentally crawls into Asuna\'s bed. She is about to smack him, but remembers how young he is and simply wakes up. There was just something about the subtlety of that scene that I admired and how she had the common sense to remember he was a kid, rather than punish him as though he was a pervert. Must have also implied that she is aware children sleepwalk.And, a common complaint, they stray away from the source material. Not my own complaint, but one I figured should be mentioned. Many people scoff that this version of Negima is one that Shaft did purely to be the characters in a new story, so I don\'t know why people have to say it\'s a ""drastic change"" in a bad way when they clearly did it for fun. I believe they only improved upon it and simply gave us more material just for the heck of it. And the best part is that, if you are familiar with the Japanese, all of the same voice actors return to voice their respective characters and they do an amazing job with it as they did before, given their tones are much more polished.Overall, I believe Negima!? deserves to be watched by any fan of the series since it\'s the same characters you grew to love starring in yet another adventure, giving the entire series a ton of episodes to go over. Of course, if you do not enjoy the abrupt change in style and humor, you may not like what Shaft did and that is fine. It is really for those that have finished all of what the original has to offer and want more fun adventures with the characters. If you see it that way, you may find something you love in Negima!? and I can guarantee you will laugh at least once. and, despite the first episode beginning with a literal flood of students trampling into the building, you never see anyone beyond the cast they want you to see ever again.

Up until the part where Negi and his crew visited Wales and the whole story turned into some Dragonball Z -esque bullcrap and everything went out of control. Last I heard from 4chan\'s /a/ section; our hero Negi Springfield was having his (finally superpowered) rear handed to him by Evangeline. ...and then I stopped.There was a time, when I started reading the Negima manga despite my hatred for Ken Akamatsu and his Love Hina series, when I believed I can handle it.

For people unfamiliar with Negima, it is an all-around average shonen with traces from the harem source material and some strong 2000's vibes.Before watching this show, you should be warned that the story is not at all like the Negima manga. Like many old adaptations, it starts similar but veers off in a completely different direction, resulting in the studio's completely new version of Negima. In the end, the only thing that is retained from Akamatsu's original are the characters. Note that the giant cast is crammed into a single...season with less episodes than girls in the class. This is just an unfortunate issue of setting incompatibility, but it is handled quite well for what can be done, allowing the anime to stand on its own, albeit with a handful of unnecessary characters.Regardless, Shaft manages to write a fun and compelling adventure story from the little source material they have, although a lot of it will be familiar if you have watched other anime from this time period. Although the season falters toward the end, it kicks off very strong, and manages to wrap up passably with a satisfying conclusion of its own (maybe even more so than the manga!).Like all Negima anime, the soundtrack is very creative and really makes the universe feel expansive. The art, on the other hand, may need a little work. While it's certainly more lively and characteristic than that of the previous adaptation, the inconsistent artistic tone contributes to the weaker second half of the series, and like many 2000's anime, it is in desperate need of color-checking.Shaft ups the bar on Xebec's original attempt at Negima, and it's clear that they care about this project, a trend that will continue to the same studio's anime final 5 year later. Yet, due to circumstances or otherwise, the end result is somewhat amateurish. While it's regrettable that Negima never got proper anime treatment, this series is quite fun to watch regardless, especially for dedicated fans of the Negima franchise. season with less episodes than girls in the class.

One of the few positives I will say about this show, is the colour pallette is very vibrant and brings light to a what feels like a dull show.My main issue with this Anime is the message it's trying to portray in the first 3 episodes, 'big tough popular girl wanting to...protect her cinnamon bun boyfriend who refuses to defend himself'. This is an infuriating concept to watch, as it constantly rehashes the same scenario over and over again with no progression. *I don't care if this stops on chapter 99 of the manga, I'm judging the Anime NOT the mangaThe creator could've at least portrayed their relationship in a more wholesome way, but what I seen was not wholesome. What I seen was a relationship closer to a mother and small child to that of a genuine boyfriend and girlfriend, I actually got uncomfortable watching it at some points.Even still I would give it somewhat of a pass if other characters in the show were entertaining enough to stick around, they're not. Every side-character in this show has about as much personality as a Skyrim NPC, and I'm being generous there because I feel I'm insulting Skyrim with that comparison.I'll finish it off with a positive, the OP is very good. It's about the only part of the show I enjoyed and had more fun than the entire first 3 episodes combined. So I'm sorry to anyone who genuinely likes this show, but this was a pretty bad watch. protect her cinnamon bun boyfriend who refuses to defend himself'.

Nothing more, nothing less.The premise is very simple - an extremely unlucky boy has an extremely cute girlfriend who can switch to ""cool"" mode and be his knight in shining armor when his bad luck strikes again, and a group of friends who they both hang out and do mundane things with. It\'s nothing groundbreaking. There is no depth to it. Its whole purpose is to give you a dose of fluff.So then, why a 9/10?It\'s simple - because Shikimori succeeds at fulfilling that exact purpose with flying colors and...more.If you truly enjoy these types of shows, then Shikimori has it all - a huge amount of cute couple moments, a vibrant color palette, high school shenanigans, festivals, and most importantly - a fun supporting cast, consisting of both a group of friends with high chemistry between them, and surprisingly alive and kicking parents, whose interactions with the main couple are often even more fun to watch than the friends group shenanigans.If I had to give a rating to the supporting cast alone, it would be as high as a 9.5/10 - even if you\'re less invested in the couple for one reason or another, every moment the side characters are on screen is a joy to watch. Whether it\'s the MC\'s mom inadvertently seducing her son\'s girlfriend or Hachimitsu delivering her deadpan one-liners, each of them made me look forward to watching the show every week just as much as the main couple.And regarding the elephant in the room, Izumi - the male MC who I\'m sure you\'ve heard negative things about at one point or another before reading this review - his only ""fault"" is that...he\'s not very masculine. Other than that, he\'s just a regular, social guy with a small group of friends that includes his girlfriend. He\'s nowhere near the cringy loner MC that starts stuttering whenever a girl enters his line of sight, if like me that is what you first imagined when you heard the rumors. At the same time, he\'s also not a deep layered character, he\'s a run-of-the-mill romcom MC - but his only ""fault"" is, again, that he is more feminine than masculine. You could say that this is a gender-reversed romcom, but that\'d be mostly wrong - Shikimori herself is just as feminine 90% of the time, when she\'s not protecting Izumi from whatever tried to kill him that day.To sum it up, I recommend this show if :- You enjoy fluff romcoms.- You like girls being badass.- You are looking for a chill slice of life show to just laugh and turn your brain off to.- You like deadpan characters/Kuuderes. (seriously Hachimitsu alone makes this show worth watching)I do not recommend this show if :- You expect strong character development.- You expect plot/romance progression, and are bored by ""mindless"" fluff.- You expect My Dress-Up Darling like a lot of people did when starting this. (Why?) more.If you truly enjoy these types of shows, then Shikimori has it all - a huge amount of cute couple moments, a vibrant color palette, high school shenanigans, festivals, and most importantly - a fun supporting cast, consisting of both a group of friends with high chemistry between them, and surprisingly alive and kicking parents, whose interactions with the main couple are often even more fun to watch than the friends group shenanigans.If I had to give a rating to the supporting cast alone, it would be as high as a 9.5/10 - even if you\'re less invested in the couple for one reason or another, every moment the side characters are on screen is a joy to watch.

(Why?)', ""The story and most other things about this anime is fine but it's all ruined by Izumi Yuu. One of the most bland and cliché characters ever written where the only distinguishing aspect about him is his bad luck.  There is more to this show more than just him but he still manages to makes a big enough impact to just make this anime just straight up flavorless. I wouldn't agree that this show is cringe but every interaction with that guy is just awkward and not interesting which is the cringe aspect of this show. This show is mainly his interactions with Shikimori...so the highlights of each episode are the parts without him which is rare. I only watched 3 episodes and it already feels like a chore to try to catch up with this.This show being this bland and uninteresting is not justified just because it's supposed to be a wholesome slice of life. There are other slice of life shows that are interesting due to comedic aspects like Aharen san or the something we can all relate to like making friends and communication in Komi san but there is nothing that sets this apart from the rest. Literally about a girlfriend being cute or cool with a dull protagonist. so the highlights of each episode are the parts without him which is rare.

Just this season, the OP for SPY×FAMILY, where it begins looking like a hyper-stylized spy thriller, but then quickly devolves into children’s artwork perfectly encapsulated the charm of the series; the OP for Summertime Render was so slick and atmospheric; and Paripi Koumei’s OP was a brilliant modern classic for obvious reasons, but the two runner-ups have to be Shikimori-san and Love After World Domination. They were both absolutely stellar, and Shikimori’s was so delightful, it almost successfully gaslighted me into thinking I was actually watching...a good anime.They say 70-93% of human communication is non-verbal, and I stand by these findings completely. This show has one of those OPs where, whether the show delivers on its promise or not, it at least suggests a level of personality and energy which I personally find so endearing and infectious. Like, even if the show has no personality (which, spoiler, it doesn’t), then the expressiveness and artfulness displayed throughout the OP can successfully brainwash me into thinking it does. It feels like a mixture of the Engaged to the Unidentified OP and the After the Rain OP, and no matter how shitty of a day I was having, no matter how fucking miserable I felt, it always made me smile.The problem with all of this, of course, is that after the OP ends, the show starts, and it’s not great. The OP would make me think, “Oh, gosh! These two are so CUTE! Everyone looks so happy and expressive, the animation is astoundingly beautiful, and the artistry the director used to illustrate the trials and tribulations and the clumsy, invigorating course of their budding love is all just so invigorating! I just can’t wait to see this show with these characters and this artwork and this direction and—oh the show is boring as fuck………okay…great.” Generic, bland, banal, whatever word you wanna use, anything works. It’s just a boilerplate teen romcom with gimmicks that get old instantly.There are definitely some things to like about this show. It’s a Doga Kobo project, so no matter how bland the art direction and character designs are, and no matter the fact this is clearly one of their lower effort productions, nothing ever looks unacceptably bad. The main couple are in a relationship at the start of the show, so you don’t have to deal with the usual melodrama involved with getting together, which itself is assuming you’re lucky enough to be watching one of the very few anime where the two main love interests actually at some point do fucking get to together. However, other than those few concessions, the entire show has very little in the way of redeeming qualities.The gimmick is that Shikimori isn’t just a cutie. She’s also the female equivalent to the domineering ikemen in shoujo manga, and she endearingly protects her effeminate twink boyfriend, Izumi, all the same. I found it cute enough for a while, but my breaking point was already reached by episode five. Each stock friend character is just standing around doing their ONE thing, saying their ONE line in their ONE tone. Contrary to the bustling, energetic opening, the show itself has lifelessness leaking out of every orifice, including its fucking voice actors. As far as other, more recent waifu-bait shows go, Shikimori is comparable in quality to My Dress-Up Darling, an anime which I gave a 4/10.…clearly should’ve put some more thought into that one.Thank you for reading. a good anime.They say 70-93% of human communication is non-verbal, and I stand by these findings completely.

Now, i am not saying the criticism for this show is unwarranted, its just that i feel that the hatred for this has been blown out of proportion in discourse about the show.Shikimori-san has a pretty blatant and on-the-nose way of reversing gender roles. It would put...the couple in a position where gender stereotypes about masculinity and feminity come out, and would well... reverse them. Shikimori aims to act feminine in order to fit in with the school, but fails spectacularly no matter what. However this failings are not treated as failings, rather theyre validated as Shikimori choosing to ""be herself"". All of her decisions in how she behaves, especially when in cases when the action is not traditionally associated to be feminine are all treated as something that is ""cool"" and to be proud of. The female characters actually have agency, which should be the norm, but isnt something that the average romcom has. Izumi also has this one scene where he goes ""Please dont tease me"" and becomes all flustered and blushing, something that is typically associated with a female character in any other romcom. This reversal is what makes for this dynamic in their relationship which i will talk about next.And so there is this interesting dynamic between Izumi and Shikimori, as Izumi happens to be extremely unlucky. The anime doesnt fail to hammer this point as it is one of the first lines of narration in ep 1. This is used to create situations where our mc ends up in trouble in order for Shikimori, to swoop in and rescue him. This happens over and over and over again and is probably the main thing that the show does, at least for the first half of the series, even the ED has this sequence where Shikimori is helping Izumi dodge and knock obstacles away.This dynamic seems to have created this idea that this show is another one of those ""waifu bait"" shows with Izumi being an audience insert, but i could not disagree more. The conception of an audience insert protagonist is someone who the audience is supposed to project themselves onto, a blank slate, featureless, in a show meant for escapism. Well, when u consider the things that happen to Izumi, losing his things, getting his planned events ruined, it evokes laughter or pity rather than encouraging projection. Theres the other kind of audience projection, i.e. ""this loser is you"", but i find it hard to see Izumi as a loser at all. Izumi has a lot of qualities worth liking about him, his resillience to his unluckiness gimmick, or his ability to see the best in people, which earns him friends. It seems like any male protagonist who isnt straight up confident and upfront is suddenly a ""generic loser mc"" or a ""self insert romcom protagonist"" like what happened with Wakana Gojo last season.Perhaps the most tenable criticism of Izumi\'s character is the unluckiness gimmick in itself. Its absurd, to the point that its funny (intentionally or not). However it becomes understandably hard to take him seriously at all. Any dramatic moments that youre supposed to feel sad for become comically laughable. Its also obviously a cheap way of creating situations for the wholesome interactions that we all expect out of a couple in a romcom. In this case, it manifests in the form of Shikimori saving him. If you can look past how contrived these situations are, and get over how repetitive the unluckiness gimmick (and it seems easier said than done for most ppl), then you\'ll probably be able enjoy these cute romantic moments more, and by extension the show too.Shikimori-san is actually at its best when it... isnt focusing on Shikimori or Izumi honestly. The side characters, some of them pretty blatantly queer coded, are great too. Theres this introverted girl named Hachimitsu, who despises outdoor exercise, and she gets a whole episode dedicated to her and Izumi for them to train for their school\'s sports festival. I wont go into much more detail about it, but the experience was really heartwarming, and seeing them training hard together for the sake of the rest of the team, was easily one of Shikimori\'s best scenes. This is only one of the examples of Shikimori\'s side character episodes, and if theres one thing you should watch Shikimori for, its for the side characters.The studio suffered from an outbreak of COVID in the middle of the show\'s runtime, which led to delays. Thankfully the end product is still of passable and servicable quality visually, and overall, it still looks decent, tho definitely not the best thing that Doga Kobo has made.Easily the most overhated show of Spring 2022, Shikimori-san is a show that i recommend with significant caveats. Ultimately the appeal of the show for me was ironically Izumi, despite the repetitive nature of his unluckiness gimmick. the couple in a position where gender stereotypes about masculinity and feminity come out, and would well... reverse them.

According to me, even though this show may not be a masterpiece, its still fairly fun to watch.The story revolves around the badass Shikimori, her boyfriend Izumi and their clique. Its just about their regular old high school life. Its the calming Slice of Life formula I’ve come to rather enjoy. The one unique thing about the story is that Shikimori and Izumi are dating since before episode 1.The animators have done a really...good job with the art style of the show. The vibrant colours used are really refreshing. The opening is one of the best openings this season. The song is pretty catchy and they have gone above and beyond to animate that opening.The characters are kinda the weak point of this anime as they feel a little bland. Shikimori and Izumi are polar opposites. The former is good at everything and the latter is bad at everything. In addition to that Izumi really clumsy. The popular girl and a regular guy being in a relationship feels like it’s the point of the story, but I wish the characters had a little bit of realism to them. The supporting characters don’t stand out too much, but mostly just exist to help the audience understand what’s currently going on in the anime.Overall this is a good slice of life show that you should definitely consider watching. good job with the art style of the show.

This anime was supposed to be a rival to My dress-up darling but it came out to be a rival to nagatoro. I could describe the mc as: gayish, not interesting, bland, indistinct and last but not least pathetic. Shikimori on the other hand appears to have no opinion or she plans her day in a way that is the most effective to help hers gayish bf survive the day. I do not understand what is going on inside people who makes mc's such as Izumi aka soft highschool boy without...kg of muscle. The art and the opening are pretty good but that are the only things that I find worth praising. Usually, I really enjoy watching girls blushing, but unfortunately in this anime you see shikimori blushing almost every 3 seconds. The other characters in this show are nothing special, they are just average supporting characters, what can you expect, it is not a show with a complex plot. To be honest, I am looking forward to the end of this anime because I have a strong feeling that I will be able to lower the rating of this anime to 2/10. kg of muscle.

I read the manga and i know that this is basically the story, each episode Izumi getting saved by Shikimori or seeing her doing something that looks very cool rather than cute and tbh it works in the format of manga where it comes in chapter rather than...several chapter press into 1 episode of anime, this makes it very repetitive because even it\'s presented with different situations in the end it\'s the same issue and problem overall.I don\'t wanna give this a very bad rating because the va is good enough, animations is decent, character designs according to manga is close enough, music can be better though but because the adaptation doesn\'t work in the format of anime i must dropped it and therefore give this score. several chapter press into 1 episode of anime, this makes it very repetitive because even it\'s presented with different situations in the end it\'s the same issue and problem overall.I don\'t wanna give this a very bad rating because the va is good enough, animations is decent, character designs according to manga is close enough, music can be better though but because the adaptation doesn\'t work in the format of anime i must dropped it and therefore give this score.', 'Ok so, I’m a manga reader so of course I’ll have bias, but I think this is a great series with a slow start. I read the manga for this series a while back and really did enjoy it, but the start was pretty bog-standard and unremarkable. It’s really being felt full force in the anime because of the weird lengths of the manga chapters. In the beginning of the manga the chapters are only around 5 pages long on average, that doesn’t really translate too well to screen. Aside from that, this adaptation has been good so far. The animation is surprisingly good for...a show like this. I don’t really dig too far into the details of specific productions, I just look at the studio and that’s about it. When I saw the studio for this series, I wasn’t expecting all that much. Needless to say, I’m pretty surprised. The music and voice acting in this show is solid enough. The ost hasn’t stood out to me too much. The voice acting does it’s job as well. As for story and characters, the story is pretty standard, and the characters are fun. The story is just about Izumi, who is very unlucky, and Shikimori, who is popular and attractive (and surprisingly cool), going on wacky antics with friends. The story gets way better in later arcs but as of now it’s nothing too special. I do suggest you stick with it. a show like this.

I just don\'t think it\'s a good anime overall.What\'s up with their eyes?No, but seriously, this is one of the weirdest eye designs I have ever seen in anime. It actually looks good from some angles, but most of the time it\'s rather creepy. The blonde girl literally has dead fish eyes. And it looks horrible.Since I see people that seem to be saying that the ratings of this show are low from a lot of watchers because ""the expectations were too high"", "" everyone thought this will be Dress-Up Darling 2"", and ""yall just watch...mainstream media & shounen"": sorry to break it to you, but that isn\'t the case! (at least for me). I went into this with no expectations, and Dress-Up Darling wasn\'t the best show in existence anyway; yet, Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie was just not that good. Just like Tonikaku Kawaii. And my most watched/read genre is romance, so this low rating is not because I get bored without an interesting plot, cool fights, a lot of action, or anything that is not usually associated with romantic comedies. Basically, you don\'t need to find excuses as to why not everyone enjoys it.CHARACTERSContrary to whom most seem to consider to be the worst character in the series (Izumi), I\'d say that it\'s actually Shikimori herself. She is obsessive, very jealous, and possessive. She doesn\'t have any hobbies and sticks to Izumi like glue, and doesn\'t seem very pleased with the fact that he has friends. Even worse than that, her whole identity is basically just trying to be seen as a cute girl while also ""protecting"" Izumi. That\'s all she cares about, aside from winning in every game/competition. Well, honestly, it\'s not like Izumi is much better. I get it, he\'s unlucky, but for being a main character, he sure doesn\'t have a lot of focus put on him. Rather, it\'s like he is there just for Shikimori (and 2 other girls haha, didn\'t know this was a harem) to have someone to be cute & a mommy for. He doesn\'t have any presence, like, at all; I almost forgot he was the other main character while writing this. He just exists to be the kind, cute prince that captures the hearts of lonely girls just by being kind to them. But, I mean, he\'s trying to overcome his unluckiness and do sweet things for his girlfriend and friends. At least he\'s trying. And his culinary dishes are said to be delicious.(On a side note, Izumi\'s unluckiness is not even that bad. His worst unlucky moments were him jumping in the bushes to avoid being run over by a bicycle and drowning, though the last one is pretty bad. The rest were just random, almost harmless inconveniences, with him losing his wallet or tripping; so, no, he didn\'t deal with it well or anything, since there wasn\'t really much to deal in the first place. The only thing I remember was him trying to be prepared for anything that could go wrong on a date, which I mean was cute, but not that smart? Since he knows he often loses his stuff no matter what he does, why doesn\'t he let someone else keep them when he\'s going out? Like, giving his wallet to Shikimori would have resolved the problem.)As for the side characters, they surprisingly have more character development than the leads (who have, like, almost 0 growth). Two of them, to be more specific; they have a whole episode dedicated to each of them, and it was quite nice to see. Though, the extra characters that were used in one of the episodes were just pure mockery. But all in all, the side characters are better than the main ones, that\'s how bad this show is.STORY/ CHARACTERS\' RELATIONSHIPSJust in case you were wondering… I haven\'t mentioned anything about the story because there is literally no story. It is a slice of life romcom with school setting; and instead of going for a boring, generic plot, the mangaka (since I suppose the ""story"" is the same in the manga) chose to not have one at all. Which is not a problem at all, don\'t get me wrong; however, it means that in order to make the anime/manga enjoyable, it is a must for the characters to have amazing chemistry (among other things). And sadly, this is not the case at all. The main focus of the show, Shikimori and Izumi\'s romantic relationship, is very awkward and unrealistic. They are supposed to have been together for one year already, yet act like they have only known each other for 4 months at best. It\'s like they don\'t even really know each other\'s personalities that well. It\'s just... very weird, you know. They don\'t seem to be comfortable with each other at all, and it bothers me. It feels like they are both looking at an idolized version of their partner, only seeing what\'s at the surface: a soft unlucky guy that needs to be protected and a cool, beautiful, perfect girlfriend. Well, the point is that their chemistry it\'s rather weak, and nowhere near good enough to make me want to watch more of it. Though, a 12-14 years old person may find it cute and enjoyable, I guess, its demographic is shoujo after all.The friendship of the rest of the characters feels off sometimes as well, but overall it\'s passable. The trio of girls (Shikimori, Nekozaki and the other one) seem rather awkward with each other for being friends for more than a year. Again, it\'s like they have only known each other for like 4 months.ART STYLE/ANIMATIONWhen it comes to art style and animation, well... The animation is as good as it can get, and the style itself is pretty nice, though generic. Very charming color palette, well suited for the genre, atmosphere, and demographic. But like I said, weird eyes. Oh, and while I did say the animation was good, it had some slip ups here and there.~~CONCLUSION/ENJOYMENT~~Well, having said all that, here\'s the catch: it\'s not a horrible anime. As far as entertainment goes, it is actually passable. In short, I didn\'t hate watching Shikimori trying to look cute for a date, Izumi having to spend his time at a school event in the library, Nekozaki laughing  or smiling most of the time, and  Inu\'s laid back attitude. I mean, if I did, I wouldn\'t have completed the anime. What I\'m getting at is that it is not that bad of a show, either. At least when it comes to the enjoyment.The best thing about KS? Its OP! Hands down one of the best this year. The ED was pretty enjoyable as well. mainstream media & shounen"": sorry to break it to you, but that isn\'t the case! (at least for me). I went into this with no expectations, and Dress-Up Darling wasn\'t the best show in existence anyway; yet, Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie was just not that good. Just like Tonikaku Kawaii.

The only thing I remember was him trying to be prepared for anything that could go wrong on a date, which I mean was cute, but not that smart? Since he knows he often loses his stuff no matter what he does, why doesn\'t he let someone else keep them when he\'s going out? Like, giving his wallet to Shikimori would have resolved the problem.)As for the side characters, they surprisingly have more character development than the leads (who have, like, almost 0 growth). Two of them, to be more specific; they have a whole episode dedicated to each of them, and it was quite nice to see. Though, the extra characters that were used in one of the episodes were just pure mockery. But all in all, the side characters are better than the main ones, that\'s how bad this show is.STORY/ CHARACTERS\' RELATIONSHIPSJust in case you were wondering… I haven\'t mentioned anything about the story because there is literally no story. It is a slice of life romcom with school setting; and instead of going for a boring, generic plot, the mangaka (since I suppose the ""story"" is the same in the manga) chose to not have one at all. Which is not a problem at all, don\'t get me wrong; however, it means that in order to make the anime/manga enjoyable, it is a must for the characters to have amazing chemistry (among other things). And sadly, this is not the case at all. The main focus of the show, Shikimori and Izumi\'s romantic relationship, is very awkward and unrealistic. They are supposed to have been together for one year already, yet act like they have only known each other for 4 months at best. It\'s like they don\'t even really know each other\'s personalities that well. It\'s just... very weird, you know. They don\'t seem to be comfortable with each other at all, and it bothers me. It feels like they are both looking at an idolized version of their partner, only seeing what\'s at the surface: a soft unlucky guy that needs to be protected and a cool, beautiful, perfect girlfriend. Well, the point is that their chemistry it\'s rather weak, and nowhere near good enough to make me want to watch more of it. Though, a 12-14 years old person may find it cute and enjoyable, I guess, its demographic is shoujo after all.The friendship of the rest of the characters feels off sometimes as well, but overall it\'s passable. The trio of girls (Shikimori, Nekozaki and the other one) seem rather awkward with each other for being friends for more than a year. Again, it\'s like they have only known each other for like 4 months.ART STYLE/ANIMATIONWhen it comes to art style and animation, well... The animation is as good as it can get, and the style itself is pretty nice, though generic. Very charming color palette, well suited for the genre, atmosphere, and demographic. But like I said, weird eyes. Oh, and while I did say the animation was good, it had some slip ups here and there.~~CONCLUSION/ENJOYMENT~~Well, having said all that, here\'s the catch: it\'s not a horrible anime. As far as entertainment goes, it is actually passable. In short, I didn\'t hate watching Shikimori trying to look cute for a date, Izumi having to spend his time at a school event in the library, Nekozaki laughing  or smiling most of the time, and  Inu\'s laid back attitude. I mean, if I did, I wouldn\'t have completed the anime. What I\'m getting at is that it is not that bad of a show, either. At least when it comes to the enjoyment.The best thing about KS? Its OP! Hands down one of the best this year. The ED was pretty enjoyable as well.', ""This has to be probably one of the most boring and horrendous anime ever created.There is practically not a single redeemable thing, NOTHING, not the opening, not the music, nothingThe protagonist is an idiotic prince, and the bad luck thing is not funny, he should be more careful and not letting his girlfriend do everything, about Shikimori, she is toxic, possessive, everything bad about worldThis anime romanticizes toxic relationships in the same way that Kanokari does, but atleast it's not as cringeAnd nothing happens in the chapters, nothing interesting and nothing of value, every story needs a conflict to move forward, if it doesn't have...it, there's no point in watching it.Conclusion, Shikimori-san is a mockery to the viewer and anyone who watches it.Note: 2/10 it, there's no point in watching it.Conclusion, Shikimori-san is a mockery to the viewer and anyone who watches it.Note: 2/10"", ""Shikimori's not just a cutie was one of the series where people thought that Shikimori would overtake My Dress-Up Darling, but as of now, it's not coming near that.Story: 5The story lacks a little more depth. Normally I wouldn't care with slice of life shows but it's a good example of that the girl is amazing and the guy is just a little awkward and not good at most things. It is not a terrible thing obviously, because (for example) Aharen-san doesn't have a real story as well, but with Shikimori's not just a cutie, I had more expectation because of the hype...it was getting. Like I said, the story so far isn't terrible, but the first 3 episodes it lacked a little depth.Art: 8The art this show has given us is pretty good! My most favorite thing about the art is how the eyes we're made. You can see that a lot of time went into them. Shikimori's facial expressions are golden as well. They we're really well made and you could read her expressions really well. Background of the anime is really good as well. They didn't miss with the animation on this one!Characters: 5Now I don't lie, the characters right now are pretty average in my opinion. Of course this could change in the future, but right now most of the characters are really boring and not interesting at all. Shikimori is obviously the most interesting character since she is the main character like Izumi, but Izumi lacks a lot of personality. Inuzaka and Nekozaki are not that interesting at all and Hachimitsu is ok, because she makes it up with funny moments. I hope they do a lot more with characters later on.Sound: 7The music in this anime is pretty good. It fits the setting most of the time and is not over the top. The OP is really really good. I even have it in my playlist and the ED is pretty good as well! I like what they were going for, for the music.Enjoyment: 6Even tho I find this series pretty fun, I sometimes get bored with the scenes they put in. I hope they come with more funny moments or depth in the series.Overall: 6This show has some potential but with the setting it's in right now, It can only get better if the characters get some more depth and little bit of backstory, because (compared to Aharen-san) it doesn't make up for much other then ''OMG LOOK AT SHIKIMORI SHE BEST GIRL''.

The amazing art and the name even sounded intriguing, but I didn't really like the show at all.REST OF REVIEW CONTAIN MINOR SPOILERSThe main male protagonist is honestly quite annoying. He is always needing to be saved and is clueless. The only good thing about the plot is that they are already together and the roles of the male and female are flipped from what we normally see in anime and manga. The strong female protagonist is probably the only reason I would watch another episode. "", 'Obligatory ""This is my first review"", and I\'m also writing on mobile so the structure of the review might seem strange.Shikimori-san was never going to be the next My dress up darling, not even close, and even that show got incredibly lucky in popularity.The story is non-existent, the manga chapters being on average 12 pages, with most chapters being self contained with some exceptions. They\'re merged in the anime to give it a sense of continuity, but somehow the pacing is incredibly slow making every episode a drag.The characters are nothing special with the protagonist being especially pathetic, and if you\'re not a shikimori...fan then there\'s no enjoyment whatsoever.The art is the standard high quality you expect these days, and the music is fitting but forgettable.Overall, while this show is harmless, the horrible pacing is destroying me inside out, but I could recommend the manga as a nice time killer.*Edit: Why did I bother watching as far as episode 8? This show is absolutely terrible, both as a romance and as a slice of life. While I thought the anime was bad from the start due to it\'s atrociously painful pacing, I was thinking of giving the manga a positive score, but I must of been blinded by it\'s pretty art. When both the show and the manga have absolutely meaningless dialogue, no chemistry between the main leads, and a pathetic protagonist that can\'t even breathe unless his perfectly engineered waifu reminds him, you rapidly lose interest.

Just seeing how they care about each other makes me smile and happy at the same time. Having a girlfriend that cares about you feel dream come true. I really love the energy from this anime. I really love how they support each other and it really fun to watch them. It really exciting how they go every day like that.I really recommend this anime to anyone, it is a fun and enjoyable anime I seem in 2022. ', ""Shikimori's not a cutie. At first glance, this anime may seem like your traditional, conventional romcom, slice of life anime that you will watch because you want to have a good laugh or because you want to have some fun while watching it. The astonishing reality is that this show takes everything bad about the generic romcom/slice of life anime and amplifies it to the absurd extreme. This show is completely based around extremely repetitive and boring gimmicks. The whole premise of the show is that shikimori is not just cute, but awesome. The problem is that shikimori is not awesome. She is the literal...definition of a mary sue. She is good at everything everyone desires her, she is the litteral definition of a goddess in this anime considering this world is full of peasants. The other problem this main character suffers is from being a walking talking plot device. Like literally without her there would not be anything. The protagonist would die in every scene of the anime if it wasnt for her. In fact all situations in the anime have to revolve around the fact that she is awesome. If it wasn't for that fact there wouldn't be a story at all. Then,  you remember. This anime has no story. This anime literally takes the most mundane and boring situations of ordinary life and just past them together just adding shikimori and the protagonist as carboard cutout. This makes this show suffer greatly without any story and all events being as random as you could imagine ends up hurting all of the characters, every one of the feels as bland and unimpactful as the others. As if this story only card about Shikimori being awesome (DID I ALREADY MENTION, WOW SHE IS SO AWEEESOME DUDE.) I don't have a problem with the protagonist being beta or  or shy or useless. The main problem is that the protagonist just exist for shikimori to be saved (walking talking plot device). This makes the show super predictable and boring. You already know that Shikimori is gonna help the prota somehow and he cannot do anything for himself whatsoever. And I think this is this show's main sin. This show is boring and predictable as hell. You know one of the main selling points of romcoms/ slice of life anime. I can not recommend this anime to anyone. Just because this is a romcom is not an excuse, romcoms/ slice of life anime can have interesting stories likeable characters. THis show has none. If shikimori wasn't cute, ironically, this show would be rated as a 5 by almost anyone. It's purely a wifu bait show. definition of a mary sue.

As it can be seen, this review will be negative, but then again you know that if you are taking time reading this (Thank you)So I\'m an anime only, and going into this, I was well-aware of the hype surrounding this show, and I tried to watch this with the same expectations I have had for other shows. Be decent and I will enjoy this. But damn, after seeing 3 eps, all I can say are these.Story: Make it Look GoodYes, I am only writing after three episodes, but god damn do I want to get...this off my chest. Slice of Life has never been known for its stellar storytelling. From all the shows I have seen, (Granted not much) there is not a single show in anime that does its plot the way shows like Death Note did (Just an example). Never did I expect that out of the show, but there is absolutely no way the plot of a show could be that painful of a watch. A majority of these are just chalked up to the protag being unlucky, which is wholesome at first, but gets old and boring by the time episode 2 rolls around. Most of these ""events"" do not excite the viewer post-opening episode, and from what I have seen, there is absolutely zero chance they had another goal that\'s not ""Make Shikimori Look Good. Shikimori best girl of the season."" But hey that\'s my take, lets move onto ArtArt: Look at the eyes + more.I will give it to the show, though dreadful, has some of the most wonderfully drawn characters from this season. From the first glance of watching the show, you can tell how passionate the animators were when drawing each of the character\'s designs, especially the eyes. You can tell a lot just by looking at each of the character\'s eyes, and that is one of the most important parts in establishing the mood around situations. (To me at least)Sound: I don\'t remember muchI am not the biggest when it comes to sound. I mean hell, the only things I can clearly remember are the OP and ED. However, I have not had an issue when it came to the sound. Effects were at the very least not a problem, but they were not stand out either. (Though technically part of Art, Big fan of the ED visuals in how they are presented. OP is pretty forgettable)Character: I remember you...Unfortunately, when it comes to positives about the show, the art and (kind of) sound is where it pretty much ends. All these Shikimori characters, besides main girl herself, are forgettable, except our main protagonist. Every time I see the protag, I want to skip 5 seconds ahead. There is no charm or flavor he brings to the screen, if it is not being an absolute pussy and being babysat by main girl. I do know what his name is, but I won\'t give this guy the time of day to name him properly. I do not understand how this guy got to bag a woman like Shikimori, as this guy probably has zero redeeming qualities and gets knocked out by a soccer ball. In all honesty, if the soccer ball killed his ass I wouldn\'t complain so that shikimori could go get herself another man. Cheating is not acceptable, but if our girl turned into a hoe, I\'d ask her why she didn\'t do it sooner. Basically I hate this guy, but thankfully not the other people in the show. Simply put, they are too boring and forgettable for them to incite a strong feeling within myself.Enjoyment: You already know the deal.I mean, you see the score, I don\'t have to talk why I didn\'t enjoy this.Overall: 2/10Sadly, this anime gets a 2/10 from me, as the most enjoyable part of the show are the swarms of hate threads that stem from it. I generally do not support any sort of negativity, but in a show so boring with a main relationship that was probably rooted in money and not love, the negativity of the anime community surrounding it is what\'s keeping me interested in the show as a media. If this gets better, (In which I hope it does I banked on it for my FAL) I wouldn\'t mind being spoiled as the 75 mins I spent watching could have been used on anything more productive or entertaining.Final Edits as I did not plan anything in my head:This anime being compared to MDUD is insulting to the creators of the Winter 2022 Romance.

While this has opened up more and more for girls, many now openly enjoying a more out of the box of femininity portrayal of a female character, for guys there is still a certain expectation of what he needs to do in order to be deemed worth the love of the fans or his love interest.What do I mean with said expectations tho? Well he gotta meet some standard of masculinity. While it\'s okay for a girl...to just be cute, bubbly, kind and loving, if a guy isn\'t masculine in one way or the other, or over the course of a show, progresses towards that inevitable ideal, but is shown to just be this immasculine way, he is quickly dismissed and called bland and being called out for ""not providing anything to the relationship"". People still seem to feel deeply uncomfortable by the prospect of just accepting to be more feminine, shy and to deem that as okay and perfectly lovable.Now that\'s not to defend your average ecchi male lead cut out and say that it\'s realistic to be with a girl that is literally perfect in any way and longs for him, despite him neither having character nor a distinguishable look from anyone else.Which brings me to Izumi, who is done a lot of wrong in too many things I\'ve read here.Izumi is a pretty, super soft and kind hearted, positive and attentive personality. He is not that good at sports, super clumsy, easily frightened and of a more delicate statue, tho more subtitle, wearing his emotions on his face. He often struggles with his own ideals of what he should be so he can be a good boyfriend, clearly showing the same ideas of what makes a guy lovable and desirable, that I mentioned before. The catch tho. That person, that ideal. It isn\'t who he is. And instead of giving him a reason to ""man up"", this show clearly says to him, that who he is is not only okay, but lovable and very much desirable. Which is handled both through his friends and parents, but with Shikimori as the main driver.Which makes me come to Shikimori. She has an outgoing, competitive yet caring and protective personality, easily reacting jealous, annoyed, overly excited or falling into her general cool mode, eyes on what matters most. She is shown to care a great deal about both her friends and her boyfirend, often getting offended on his part when someone else questions Izumi\'s worth based on his softness. She is the force leading this anime to what it wants to show ultimately, opposing the general idea of both what a girl and a guy should be in order to be desirable.Which brings me to their dynamic. A dynamic I would sum up with one word: Healthy.Because one thing that is clearly established from the start is that beyond everything else, they really care for each other. They value and love who the other person is for them, being super attentive to each other\'s needs, worries about desirability and wellbeing. This relationship is what I have longed for to see for such a long time. No forced drama, no compliance to dumb expectations set by society, just two people really loving each other and being good and caring for each other.This anime doesn\'t invent the wheel and this anime doesn\'t go to a deep level to reach a level of finesse of a masterpiece anime. But it really doesn\'t have to to be an absolutely wholesome, enjoyable and lovable ride so far. Truth be told I hate to make such early reviews because there is always more to assess when giving it a complete watch. But the reviews I read here so far... They really wanted me to give the fragile broken masculinity of all these guys (and maybe some girls, dunno) who have adopted this dumb idea of what one needs to be to be lovable, the last hit and burry it for good. Get over expecting a guy to be a certain way in order to be attractive to a girl.

I was hoping this would be as engaging as My dress up darling with relatable characters with heart and personality/motivs to them. (and no I didn't just enjoy that anime for the fanservice, the fanservice was actually the only part of that anime I disliked and actively zoned out during)I've never watched such a by the numbers anime before this one, and i've seen a lot of predictable stuff..Every scene I can predict what will happen. Izumi gets into a wacky situation in which Shikimori will...save him from, then they'll both blush at each other and giggle. It's just boring. I have no reason to care about this relationship aside from just Shikimori herself because while Izumi obviously isn't an offensive character or anything by any means, there's no reason for me to care about him. I know people are going to say, he is just acting like a normal person but sorry, it's incredibly boring to watch an anime about normal everyday people. If I wanted to do that I would just go people watching.Honestly best way to describe this anime is background noise. I tab out every time I watch it because of how bored I get. If people enjoy this, I understand. Different strokes for different folks.I'd only recommend this to the anime fans that enjoy watching nothing but generic looking anime girls blushing all day. save him from, then they'll both blush at each other and giggle.

If I wanted to do that I would just go people watching.Honestly best way to describe this anime is background noise. I tab out every time I watch it because of how bored I get. If people enjoy this, I understand. Different strokes for different folks.I'd only recommend this to the anime fans that enjoy watching nothing but generic looking anime girls blushing all day."", ""Imagine.

Unfortunately, that\'s as far as the show\'s appeal went. Characters are one-trick ponies, with their personalities being defined by a single characteristic. Strangely, their dialogue is also limited to these singular traits. An example would be Izumi, our titular effeminate MC, who is almost always exclusively talking about how unlucky he is and how his girlfriend is so...great because she protects him from danger. Any additional run time is dedicated to the running gag of Izumi being unlucky and/or watching as his girlfriend fulfills the tropes of traditional male love interests. Being tough, athletic, protective, unafraid, etc. You would think at least the comedic elements of the show\'s main running gag would land some laughs, but not so. While the role swap concept is somewhat original in anime, the execution is anything but interesting.When it comes to the relationship dynamic, there is none. They really don\'t act like a couple at all. You\'d forget they were dating if not for their incessant need to tell the audience how much they think the other is cute every 5 minutes. They act more like 10-year-olds dating, proceeding to say they like one another and occasionally holding hands. That is the extent of their ""relationship"".The best the show has to offer is ""cute moments"", delivered similarly to how an Ecchi would deliver raunchy fan service while disregarding any meaningful storytelling. great because she protects him from danger.

And since I\'m seeing that the majority of the community sees Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san a.k.a Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie as a target of objectification worth its massive hate (and to be unbias, it\'s warranted), so let me be the Devil\'s...Advocate to tell you the other side of the story why this rom-com works, is overall very good (but not great) for the most part, and most certainly, doesn\'t deserve its maligned status of being overhated to hell and back.Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san a.k.a Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie is a show, that like many anime and sources of the same kind (the similarities draw close to works like this Winter\'s Sono Bisque Doll, Nanashi\'s Nagatoro, HERO\'s Horimiya, and most certainly very striking to Kenjirou Hata\'s Tonikaku Kawaii), already establishes the main couple\'s status from the get-go: the unlucky boyfriend that is Yuu Izumi, facing mishap one after another no matter how good or bad the situation is, and the ""ultimate heart-throb"" of a girlfriend that is ""Micchon"" Shikimori exuding in her coolness that makes people\'s heart beat. It\'s your stereotypical standard of a rom-com that does its job of whatever gears towards the author\'s train thoughts of view (in this case, it\'s Keigo Maki). Together with friends, both Izumi and Shikimori\'s typical lovey-dovey high school couple life takes its chances to jab how perfect of a girlfriend Shikimori can be, why she is ultimately Izumi\'s saving grace to his accident-proneness life, and with friends, create the recipe for an intentional, unintended, mitigating disaster henceforth that builds up the frustration, but can be wholesome as well.As I\'ve already mentioned, Shikimori-san shares a lot of similarities to Tonikaku Kawaii (which is a rom-com that\'s better in every way and definitely recommended), and given Kenjiro Hata\'s status as one of the best well-known authors back in the heyday for Hayate no Gotoku! a.k.a Hayate the Combat Butler, it\'s fair to assume that eventually someone else will do an imitation of it, and that\'s what mangaka Keigo Maki did to pen this series a full year after Tonikaku Kawaii\'s release around the same time period in February 2019. And boy, it blew up like wildfire, that is still wildly popular and successful to this day. This, you can\'t discount that although Japan\'s reception was lukewarm (even though it was advertised quite a lot), over in the West, this was some hot stuff.With that said, let\'s start with the comparisons: Yuu Izumi for one, he is very similar to Nasa Yuzaki in the case that while they both have blue hair, the latter is ridiculed for his bizarre name (that\'s literally named after NASA, but that also meaning the starry sky (hoshizora)) while the former has been leading an accident-proneness life, from breaking things to getting hurt over minor scuffles, so much so that even his parents have gotten used to their only child that\'s a DNA inheritance from his mother Motoko, who\'s also just as accident-prone. Despite the constant issues that arose from his non-accident-negating personality trait which contributes to his terrible luck (which is where all the hate comes from the community), Izumi is a good-natured, upbeat and friendly boy whom knows how to cook, but he is rather unassertive (or as the term is now coined ""herbivore men"", young men whom lost their ""manliness""), but through Shikimori, he intends to become bolder (which is still a work in progress), and overtime we see that he can overcome his tumultuous bad luck by not consigning himself to the cliche ""red thread of fate"" of succumbing to the predictability of his ways, and pushing forward even if the adverse hits him hard. Character development on Izumi may feel blasé, but that\'s to be expected of the girl who\'s been standing by his side, the fercious and jealous Shikimori.And this is a good segue to talk about Shikimori, which like Tsukasa Yuzaki/Tsukuyomi, she turns up as the cool and assertive girlfriend that garners everybody\'s admiration, for any potential guy that would come to date her, will be the best boyfriend to offer. Also, if that ain\'t enough, both Shikimori and Tsukasa have light pink hair, and is adored by everyone around her as the precious gem (in Shikimori\'s case, it\'s her nicknames: getting called Mi-chan at home and Micchon from her friends). But in hindsight, Shikimori is not the same Shikimori we know of now, as she was raised like a tomboy whom is proficient in martial arts, and despite being a girl, doesn\'t know what girls do to be cute. And this is where her older brother Fuji comes in to change her perspective to try to be more like a girl, arising the ""Not Just a Cutie"" tagline of the manga, that everything is also built from scratch: learning what and how it feels like to be a girl in love. And that is the story of ""How I Met Your Mother"", like geddit? Izumi and Shikimori noticing each other in school, thus, laying the groundwork for the relationship to prosper in both the good and bad.So, obvious comparisons that are nothing more than just a passing resemblance for similarities, literally a copy-paste tactic that\'s more or less the same.But what\'s the main couple without their gang of friends, and they fill the missing void that surrounds the couple\'s life, whether is it in school or outside and hanging out. Izumi has a Best Boy friend around him: Shu Inuzuka. Izumi describes him as ""being true to himself"", while being the absolute goofball that doesn\'t like to slack off, and this is evident throughout the anime. Also, if you\'d noticed that he sounds and looks a lot like My HeroAca\'s Bakugo, you\'re right as VA Nobuhiko Okamoto also voiced both characters. Shu\'s essentially the kinder version of Bakugo, if you would imply. For Shikimori\'s side, there\'s 2 characters: Kyo Nekozaki and Yui Hachimitsu. I\'ll start with the latter, as Yui is pretty much like Shu being a very goofball character, but a lifeless version of it. But what she makes up for is her skill of observation, being a very petite and gentle girl, and like Izumi, prefers the indoors rather than going outside. I feel for Yui, because she is a person of few words, but what she can appreciate having, she wears it with a smile. With the former, Kyo is a very outlandish and supportive character of Shikimori\'s (almost to the point of being her right-hand woman), being the sportier and outgoing person. But it\'s here that Shikimori would face a rival: Kamiya, because you see, both her and Nekozaki are from the volleyball club, and contrasting with Shikimori, Kamiya\'s like the school idol that is instantly likable by everyone. But when it comes to romance, the level-headed girl becomes more meek (and some like me will say: cutesy kawaii), and that is the result when she finds that the kind-hearted Izumi is someone she\'ll pursue that\'s just your standard ""like and love"" affair. I understand the pain when someone you like and/or love has been requited to somebody else, as it releases another side of you that the one you love would appreciate. But nevertheless, it wasn\'t meant to be, and one can only think that Kamiya\'s love for Izumi exists only as a footnote in the know-how of the actual girlfriend that rather than bringing her down, actually lifts her up by acknowledging that love and becoming friends. That\'s something that\'s IMO, it\'s pretty tough to execute in the real world.For the most part, romance adaptations are also Doga Kobo\'s bread-and-butter (other than the usual CGDCT-expected works), and for the most part, it presents itself nicely...if not for the fact that 2 episodes were delayed due to COVID (it\'s still a thing, and not funny to make a fun out of it). Regardless, it is valiant to look at the beautiful backgrounds, much less Shikimori\'s panned facial gestures when she decides to get serious, that\'s some quality commitment there amidst the usual soft palette colours that I have long expected of the studio to produce when the source work ain\'t all CGDCT-like.The OST is also nice for such a rom-com series like this. Nasuo☆\'s OP ""Honey Jet Coaster"" has so much personality in both music and visuals, that amidst the nice song, lies an ""in your face"" OP visual that pops with flavour, and it\'s a job well done with the musically-timed scenes.  It\'s the same story with Yuki Nakashima\'s ED ""Route Blue"", that showcases the couple of Izumi and Shikimori walking side-by-side, and the cool girlfriend just trying to protect the bad luck boyfriend from all sorts of calamity in a frenetic order, only to have Izumi protect Shikimori from something as simple as a lone ball hit that shows his side of assertiveness. Both visually creative OP/ED set and nice songs that\'s in complementation by sound director Takeshi Takadera (Fumetsu no Anata e a.k.a To Your Eternity) and music composer Hiroaki Tsutsumi (Takagi-san franchise, Jujutsu Kaisen etc.).You can love or hate a series that\'s entitled to your opinion, and Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is no different in that aspect. Sure, what both the anime and source material has to blame for in Yuu Izumi\'s accident-prone constant repetition that is always shoved in your face so much that we\'ve gotten so used to it, but the flipside is that if there is no action taken, nothing will bear fruit, and Izumi for all his problems, even acknowledges his faults and does things to soften that impact. And for that, I\'m willing to see eye-to-eye with Izumi\'s shortcomings for Shikimori to smoulder all of her strong love and affection for him, that makes this show look good for what it tries to do.I may be the minority part of those whom likes this show, but I can most certainly understand the majority\'s hate, and while Shikimori is by no means perfect, it\'s at the very least, acceptable for all to watch a few. Advocate to tell you the other side of the story why this rom-com works, is overall very good (but not great) for the most part, and most certainly, doesn\'t deserve its maligned status of being overhated to hell and back.Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san a.k.a Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie is a show, that like many anime and sources of the same kind (the similarities draw close to works like this Winter\'s Sono Bisque Doll, Nanashi\'s Nagatoro, HERO\'s Horimiya, and most certainly very striking to Kenjirou Hata\'s Tonikaku Kawaii), already establishes the main couple\'s status from the get-go: the unlucky boyfriend that is Yuu Izumi, facing mishap one after another no matter how good or bad the situation is, and the ""ultimate heart-throb"" of a girlfriend that is ""Micchon"" Shikimori exuding in her coolness that makes people\'s heart beat.

'Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san' happened to be one of  those anime and boy do I regret ever watching this.Some SOL anime have plots that are very original. Some, however, do not but make it up with having likeable characters or other aspects that manage to save itself from getting horrible reviews. This anime, however, has no redeeming  qualities whatsoever.Let's start with the story. This anime's story is...the exact same as every single romance SOL anime out there. There isn't anything special. So far, the story is SO generic that I can guarantee that there will be a summer festival at the end of the anime.Now let's talk about the one and only thing I like about this anime: the art. The art is very good. I can't say anything bad about it. The use of vibrant colours really gives you refreshment from every other aspect of the show.Let's talk about sound next, shall we? I, personally, don't like the ending. The opening, however, is nice. I wouldn't add it to my playlist but it sure is nice. About the actual music that plays in the episodes though? The only word I can use for it is... generic.Looks like the character bit is up next. Oh boy. Let's talk about the mc. Izumi is a clumsy boy who gets into trouble every corner he turns. He is also a very kind person. And? Shikimori is a cute and, yet again, kind person who protects Izumi from the misfortune that happens to him on a daily basis. But watch out; Shikimori also has a darker, more serious side to her that we STILL have not seen extensively. And? The rest of the characters are also just filler. I do, however, like one character and that happens to be Hachimitsu. I can relate to her because of the lifeless expression I have while watching this anime looks exactly like her face, minus the smile.Now, we have come to the most important part of an anime: the enjoyment. Anime are pieces of art on their own, and you have to enjoy a piece of art to really experience it. Need I say more? Having to skip one fifth of an anime really is not an accomplishment for itself. Although I normally drop anime that I don't like whatsoever, I am still clinging to the tiny bit of hope that I have left for this anime to be good. Overall, this anime is a solid 3 out of 10. I would say that another title suits this anime than its own: 'Shikimori-san wa kawaii dake da'.Thanks for reading my review.

My Neighbor Totoro, K-On!, Horimiya, Tsukigakirei; all of these have nothing going for it plot-wise but are some of my all time favorites. But this show had me straight snoozing. I thought I would like it because the premise said that the main characters were already a couple, which is not something you see much. I loved that aspect in Horimiya and Tsukigakirei so I thought a show where you just see a couples life could be wholesome...and comforting. But this is way too unrealistically perfect. There is no conflict, no drama. They are always doing happy stuff and saying romantic things for no reason. Both the characters and the plot are straight up Boring. I remember she was really athletic and he had bad luck but that was all there was to it. I honestly forgot there were other characters when I started writing this. All this show had to offer was feel good vibes but even those seemed artificial and fake. This was not a relationship, this did not show any love. It was a vain fantasy world where everyone is happy and innocent all the time. For some reason I feel like the person who wrote and directed this show has never been in an actual relationship before. Or got out of a bad one and is making it out of spite. And the other people working on it just kind of want the paycheck. It’s bland, the nonstop smiles kind of piss me off and my dude couldn’t even kiss the girl at the end. They’ve dated for 6 months I think and in the final super ‘romantic’ moment, my guy had to go for the cheek. Fucking loser. Still better than Rent-A-Girlfriend though. Also it’s hilarious that the title is grammatically incorrect. It’s supposed to be “Shikimori isn’t just a cutie”. Fucking dumbass. and comforting. But this is way too unrealistically perfect. There is no conflict, no drama. They are always doing happy stuff and saying romantic things for no reason. Both the characters and the plot are straight up Boring. I remember she was really athletic and he had bad luck but that was all there was to it. I honestly forgot there were other characters when I started writing this. All this show had to offer was feel good vibes but even those seemed artificial and fake. This was not a relationship, this did not show any love. It was a vain fantasy world where everyone is happy and innocent all the time. For some reason I feel like the person who wrote and directed this show has never been in an actual relationship before. Or got out of a bad one and is making it out of spite. And the other people working on it just kind of want the paycheck. It’s bland, the nonstop smiles kind of piss me off and my dude couldn’t even kiss the girl at the end.

Fucking dumbass.', ""TL;DR: The 1st half was repetitive, with boy being unlucky and girl saving the day, whereas the 2nd half was the show's main highlight, with relationships flourishing, personalities shining, backstories being introduced, and Izumi and Shikimori's relationship progressing.Warning: Minor Spoiler Alert.I'm sorry to inform anyone who came here anticipating a Sono Bisque Doll-quality anime adaption that they instead got a show comparable to KanoKari. It is as if Kazuya Kinoshita was isekai'd to this show, but instead of the annoying and simping attitude, the male MC was given the unluckiness trait. That is not to say that the show is a complete disaster.I'm not sure...if it's just me, but the show's portrayal of the male MC, Yuu Izumi, as pathetic and powerless in the absence of his girlfriend, a badass female MC, Shikimori, made the show somewhat disheartening to watch. The first half of the show did exactly that, showing Izumi's bad luck and how his girlfriend always comes in to save the day, with the cycle repeating. The show attempted to portray Shikimori in a Marin-esque (Sono Bisque Doll) manner, but failed as she was more of a possessive type with the occasional yandere-like face shown.The second half of the show, on the other hand, was able to at least help redeem the show, beginning with the cultural festival revealing a more adorable and innocent Shikimori personality and with the introduction of Kamiya into the fray, the show was kicking up a notch. We got to see the personalities of the various characters blossom, as well as Kamiya's backstory and how she is related to Izumi. Yui Hachimitsu's involvement in the latter half of the show was also a plus since we got to see her interesting and appealing character who has some sort of charisma that can win over the viewers. The interaction of the friends with one another is also realistic and entertaining to watch, especially during the relay race, and demonstrates how truly close they are as friends, even when the outcome is predictable, with their never give up attitude.The last two episodes focused more on the Izumi and Shikimori couple, with them planning their date while also revealing how the couple met, their backstory, and how their relationship came to be. The finale featured a date between the two, and we got to see more of Shikimori's feminine side and her desire for a Prince-like romantic scene kiss from Izumi, as seen in a commercial, as well as Izumi's somewhat more masculine side, with him wanting to at least reciprocate his feelings and be able to fulfill a girl's wants. The date felt like a fantasy in which all of Izumi's supposed bad luck came together to result in him being brave and aggressive enough to embrace Shikimori with a cheek kiss that made her more than happy. That was an epic finale to a series that had been a rollercoaster ride.Overall, the show had a lot of potential; if Izumi hadn't been portrayed as a bland, cliche, and hopeless character, it could have easily been on par with, if not better than, Sono Bisque Doll. This show isn't as bad as people make it out to be, as the side characters and Shikimori did their jobs well, and the episodes centered on them were far more entertaining than just focusing on Izumi's bad luck. Honestly, if Izumi and Shikimori's relationship had been shown in a more wholesome manner, with the genuine lovey dovey relationship that is typically seen in a RomCom show, the viewers would have been far more satisfied. That is not to say that this show should not be watched. If you can get through the first half of the show, the second half is actually worth watching since it is entertaining and fun to watch. I'm expecting season 2 (if there is one) to showcase Izumi's masculine side and Shikimori's feminine side. if it's just me, but the show's portrayal of the male MC, Yuu Izumi, as pathetic and powerless in the absence of his girlfriend, a badass female MC, Shikimori, made the show somewhat disheartening to watch.

That\'s a pretty word.When Shikimori was about to air, manga readers were promising us THE next big thing. Something, that will dethrone Marin and Dress Up Darling. Expectations were great, so what did we had? Well, to say that we\'ve been lied to is an understatement. We\'ve been backstabbed, deceived, bamboozled. We\'ve got a show so bad at fundamental level (so you can\'t even blame quality of adaptation), that fails at absolutely everything it does.At what exactly?This show is being sold as a romcom.It utterly fails as a romcom, because it completely skips development of relationship between two main leads, which is bread and...butter, fundamental aspect of every romance. There is a good reason why most of the good romances end on confession. And if they continue further after the confession, the relationship between two main leads is usually slightly awkward and both are still inexperienced and are developing and in most cases even are wondering wether they even should be together.But here, we start at the ending. And as a result, there is absolutely nothing, that makes us invested in following the relationship of those two.But that\'s not all. This show really feels as if we have missed an entire season of content, despite it literally being the first episode. What I mean by this? Well, imagine, that in the very first scene, in which our Stock Anime Protagonist leaves the house, some sort of timer appears out of nowhere (upping the comedy because funy). After our Protagonist takes a few steps and timer counts to seven seconds, he trips on a conveniently placed in front of his house rock (I won\'t question the logic of it even being there. I\'m not that petty.) So, if you\'d be confused as an anime only by what just happened, you\'d be correct. Apparently, Stock Protagonist in this show has luck so bad, that it can be considered as something supernatural. Just like him having a Shikimori as a girlfriend the first place seems supernatural. Jokes aside, the show either expected us to find a boy tripping on a rock funny or pretended like we already know the entire premise of the show, but I\'m pretty sure it wasn\'t established in those two minutes. Such a scene might appear as the first scene of a sequel season, but here it is literally the beginning of the supposed ""story"". The show quite literally starts with us wondering what the hell just happened. And it\'s all downhill from there.So, if romance is bottom tier and pacing non existent, maybe we\'ll approach it as comfy SOL?Nope. The only thing that matters in SOL are characters and interactions between them. Characters are soulless husks (with an exception of maybe Hachimatsu), two main leads have absolutely no chemistry, main guy has literally no personality and main girl is a complete Mary Sue waifu bait and not even the best girl in her own show. You are literally going to ask yourself a question what does she even see in him and the only answer given by the author is ""he\'s kinda nice"". On top of that, there is absolutely NOTHING happening throughout entire run.How about comedy?Well, after seeing the Protagonist tripping on the rock at the beginning, you have seen everything and won\'t see anything new. There is literally one joke (MC being unlucky), that becomes stale midway through the first episode and is actually more sad, than funny if you think about it. This joke is so overused in fact, that ED is made entirely around it.As such, I highly advise you to take others hyping series up with a grain of salt. butter, fundamental aspect of every romance.

I guess I’ll just have to play a bit of devil’s advocate here then…This show presents to us a bit of a different take on the romance genre, a clumsy but lovable main character, with an alpha, and very cool female main character. This show gets people into huge debates about gender roles and the dynamic between the main characters, but for me, the problems lie not necessarily on the dynamic of the main couple, but more on the repetitiveness of certain tropes presented. There are a lot of good aspects about this show as...well, especially some of the supporting cast, which was surprisingly strong and intriguing to watch, and I’ll highlight all of that in my review below.My grading criteria: Story: /25 Art: /10 Music: /10 Characters: /20 Enjoyment /15 Thematic Execution /20STORY: 17.2/25The story isn’t this show’s strong point, and that’s to be expected as this is a slice of life romance anime. In a nutshell, Izumi is a “cursed” kid, who’s very clumsy, and needs to be protected. His protector, and girlfriend is Shikimori, a very cool and badass character, who can be cute at the same time. Its overall premise is unique in the sense that the relationship starts from episode one, and it’s not one of those romcoms where a romance is developed, which is a welcome change for sure. I would have liked the backstories of the main characters a bit earlier in the series, but at least we got one.What this show does super well is its handling of side characters. There are other people potentially interested in our main characters, and I’m glad that didn’t draw anything out in terms of romantic development, or create any unnecessary trashiness or love triangles, harems or anything of the sort. That’s why I liked Kamiya so much. It shades away from fan service as well, and didn’t need to rely on that to make the show more intriguing for the viewer, rather, it just used normal romcom slice of life elements to create a more organic path for our main couple.It’s not perfect though, because the jokes are repetitive for sure. Izumi’s constant “bad luck” moments get a bit over the top and unrealistic, like the guy almost got isekai’d by Truck-kun, and that’s a main reason why people don’t like the show probably. I do think it’s repetitive, but that’s the premise of the show, and it’s just a minor drawback for me. Shikimori’s moments are also a bit repetitive, in that her thing is saving Izumi, and getting jealous. I’m glad that the characters had a little bit more depth, as shown in the backstories, or else the characters would have seemed a bit dry.ART: 8.3/10It’s a decent style, and I’m glad Doga Kobo was able to handle the production issues due to the studio getting closed down in April. Didn’t see any quality issues in later episodes.MUSIC: 8.5/10The opening and ending were pretty top-notch and one of my favourites of the season, as they were decently creative. The soundtrack was pretty solid throughout.CHARACTERS: 14.8/20This show shines a little brighter than the romcoms due to the greatness of the side characters, but first I’ll talk a bit more about Izumi and Shikimori.Izumi, probably the character that gets the most hate. He’s clumsy, but kind, and needs to be taken care of. I know that a lot of stuff that happens to him is quite unrealistic, but we got to remember that this is fiction, and this stuff isn’t reality. His constant mess-ups do make for good comedic moments at times, and when he’s able to be, he can have his good, wholesome moments as well.Shikimori is an interesting character, in that she protects Izumi, and also loves him, most likely because he’s kind and tries his best to take care of her too. She has her moments, but honestly, she felt a bit of a boring character to me, even though she was very cool, and showed off her skills. Basically, she’s the OP character you’d normally see in an isekai series, maybe she could be a solid isekai protagonist.Now to the side characters, and in my opinion, one of the best parts about this show. Inuzuka and Nekozaki don’t contribute a whole lot to the overall story, but they have quite a few comedic moments that were very fun. Hachimitsu was one of my favourite characters, because what can I say, I’m a sucker for deadpan humour. She’s a good friend to everyone, and she kind of feels like Izumi, in that she tries her best at things she struggles at, and was the pinnacle of comedic relief. Personally, the character I was most impressed with was Kamiya. The way she was written to prevent any love triangles from forming was awesome, and just saying, if this series went that route and got trashy, INSTANT 2 OR 3/10. Luckily that didn’t happen.ENJOYMENT: 13.5/15I was very impressed with the handling of Kamiya’s character, and the backstories too. Good that there were some good comedic moments.THEMATIC EXECUTION: 15.8/20I enjoyed how the romance was handled, and the depth that some characters had as well. The development felt well paced, and all the characters had their time to shine. Some jokes were repetitive, but overall, the show worked for me.OVERALL: 78.1/100A pretty solid show for me. Sure, some of it was boring, but I don’t really get the hate it gets. Perhaps people were wanting a new waifu at the same level as Marin, and a show like My Dress Up Darling, but a show with little to no fan service, and a good, and different romance was just as good and funny for me.

After the succes of  Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru many manga fans of Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san would try to convince you that this anime will be as good as Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru or even better with its unique premise and intressting Side-characters that would blow you away with a couple that everyone will love. After watched this show I can say that ""well, that was dissapointing"". I will...tell you why I think what went wrong with this show and why it was such a let down.Story:The first problem with this show is that there wasnt really a narrative structure, it felt like every episode random things happend without any ryhme or reason, characters seem to already know eachother without really a proper introduction and you might ask the question, why did they become friends in the first place? Is it because they met eachother at a bar, at school, do they like the same things or did they introduce them to their other friends? If they were to awnser these questions I would feel way more immersed into their world and it would make a bit more sense why they are all such good friends but this show is not only about friendship but also about romance and the romance is bad. If you were to ask me why do the main characters like eachother I can say:"" Because they think the other partner is cute I guess..."". Yes thats the best explenation I can give about an anime that primairely focussus on the romance. The reason why they do love eachother is in my opinion very vague even around episode 11 when they do give more info its still lacking. Also well I do believe many rom-com anime lack romantic development this anime with 12 episodes almost feels like it has no romantic development at all from episode 1 till 12 the main characters love eachother as much as they did before, its so bad that you can maybe skip the first 10 episodes and begin at episode 11 too have the same experience as some one who watched all episodes. I am not saying that the first 10 episodes are a waste of time but it is an option to skip them but this isnt the worst part about this show yet. Its our main character called Yuu Izumi, every shitty thing that ever happend in its life he will blame it because of his bad luck. Like, if he were too be in a comendy I wouldnt really care about it that much but like come the fuck on. Making stupid mistakes or bad things happening around you and calling it your ""bad luck"", no you should take responsability for your stupid actions. Also, from what is shown this man can not do shit and always has to rely on his girlfriend (Shikimori). Man I could rant about this caracter for hours but in a nutshell, I really dislike this pathetic character, but at least he isn\'t Kazuya.Characters:The characters are all bland and dont get a lot of development making the experience even worse. Every one of them feels like a recycled anime character that you have probably seen before in other anime rom-coms. Also they do not have any damn chemistry, they just do random shit together but I never had the feeling that they were all close friends but rather people they have met a few days ago. Also I do think the character designs for the most part are also a bit borring and I didnt feel like there was a lot of effort put into it except for the main girl. Also I never laughed at a single joke they made in this show, and maybe because I do not laugh a lot in general but I also do think that the comendy was also very poor in this. If were gonna talk about the characters then we do have to talk about the main girl Shikimori, she has fatal flaw and that is that she doesnt have any flaws. Like the only thing we know she is bad at is cooking, so she is basically perfect, and yes I know the show will tell you that she is struggeling to be cute but is that really a struggle at all if it doesnt affect the main couple in this story, because Yuu thinks she is still cute? I wished the a would have cared a bit more about the main girl that is basically the selling point of this show. While I do not use this word often but calling her waifu-bait is understandble because the trailer of this anime is centerd about her. She has to most detailed expressions and she is also the character with the most screentime in this show. If you are going to watch this show because of her, I wouldnt recommend it. But a show like ""Komi-San Can Not Communicate"" is the perfect example with a girl having struggles because of her social-anxiety and that struggle does have a purpose in the story, well I do think its handeld poorly I think its way better and relatble struggle instead of being ""oh no, I am not cute enough"".Animation:The animation in this show is decent. Sometimes the anime has frames that make you realize what art is but sadly the animation inst consistent. In the first episode everything looks way better animated compared to the last. But I do not care so much about animation as the other elements of this show but I do think the animation is decent.Music:Both the Op and Ending are really nice. The OST throughout the show is kinda forgettable to be fair.Enjoyment:I think this anime could be enjoyed by an optimistic rom-com fan but I do think that this show lacks in a lot of area\'s so I do have a hard time enjoying this show. I think the show maybe wasnt meant for me or I forgot something\xa0 about this show that made it great but really. I had a poor experience and that kind of ruined my enjoyment of the show.Overall:This show is quite dissapointing and it fails on many levels that make a rom-com great. I do think some one can like this show and there is nothing wrong about it but I do feel like the elements that are missing makes this show very bad. Despite my expectations not being that high I was still kinda let-down and dissapointed about the experience about this show. I will not recommend this show too anyone to be fair, but if you really liked this show I am happy that you found your sastisfaction that I myself couldnt find.....-Thx for reading my review- tell you why I think what went wrong with this show and why it was such a let down.Story:The first problem with this show is that there wasnt really a narrative structure, it felt like every episode random things happend without any ryhme or reason, characters seem to already know eachother without really a proper introduction and you might ask the question, why did they become friends in the first place?

Also I do think the character designs for the most part are also a bit borring and I didnt feel like there was a lot of effort put into it except for the main girl. Also I never laughed at a single joke they made in this show, and maybe because I do not laugh a lot in general but I also do think that the comendy was also very poor in this. If were gonna talk about the characters then we do have to talk about the main girl Shikimori, she has fatal flaw and that is that she doesnt have any flaws. Like the only thing we know she is bad at is cooking, so she is basically perfect, and yes I know the show will tell you that she is struggeling to be cute but is that really a struggle at all if it doesnt affect the main couple in this story, because Yuu thinks she is still cute? I wished the a would have cared a bit more about the main girl that is basically the selling point of this show. While I do not use this word often but calling her waifu-bait is understandble because the trailer of this anime is centerd about her. She has to most detailed expressions and she is also the character with the most screentime in this show. If you are going to watch this show because of her, I wouldnt recommend it. But a show like ""Komi-San Can Not Communicate"" is the perfect example with a girl having struggles because of her social-anxiety and that struggle does have a purpose in the story, well I do think its handeld poorly I think its way better and relatble struggle instead of being ""oh no, I am not cute enough"".Animation:The animation in this show is decent. Sometimes the anime has frames that make you realize what art is but sadly the animation inst consistent. In the first episode everything looks way better animated compared to the last. But I do not care so much about animation as the other elements of this show but I do think the animation is decent.Music:Both the Op and Ending are really nice. The OST throughout the show is kinda forgettable to be fair.Enjoyment:I think this anime could be enjoyed by an optimistic rom-com fan but I do think that this show lacks in a lot of area\'s so I do have a hard time enjoying this show. I think the show maybe wasnt meant for me or I forgot something\xa0 about this show that made it great but really. I had a poor experience and that kind of ruined my enjoyment of the show.Overall:This show is quite dissapointing and it fails on many levels that make a rom-com great. I do think some one can like this show and there is nothing wrong about it but I do feel like the elements that are missing makes this show very bad. Despite my expectations not being that high I was still kinda let-down and dissapointed about the experience about this show. I will not recommend this show too anyone to be fair, but if you really liked this show I am happy that you found your sastisfaction that I myself couldnt find.....-Thx for reading my review-', ""Reviewing it after reading all the negative ones..I don't know why sooo many people are hating it just because of the character of Izumi being reallly clumsy or i should rather say a guy with misfortune by his side all the time and Shikimori who is just a super cute popular girl, great in athletics and is in love with Izumi.I don't what is the problem relying on female lead and the point that she is dating  normal clumsy guy, rather than being clingy and stuff it seems very normal and cute thing to me. It is basically portraying that she loves him...no matter how clumsy and dependent he is, she wants to protect him the say way most of the male characters do in other anime.And being honest, it is very cute and really relaxing to watch.Only if they had put a lil more efforts in the role of side characters and Izumi also helping Shikimori secretly in stuff and the girl not being so much perfect would have made it much better.But i loved it and you may proceed watching it if you are searching for a relaxing and kawaii anime with slice of life.Im sorry if i sounded offensive but from my pov it isn't filthy as it seems to many of you i swear.Have a good day! :) no matter how clumsy and dependent he is, she wants to protect him the say way most of the male characters do in other anime.And being honest, it is very cute and really relaxing to watch.Only if they had put a lil more efforts in the role of side characters and Izumi also helping Shikimori secretly in stuff and the girl not being so much perfect would have made it much better.But i loved it and you may proceed watching it if you are searching for a relaxing and kawaii anime with slice of life.Im sorry if i sounded offensive but from my pov it isn't filthy as it seems to many of you i swear.Have a good day! :)"", ""Story 10/10: At first, the progression of the story might seem pretty bland, however, in episode 3 things started to get interesting after they hinted some Shikimori x mommy action. It all started in that scene in the kitchen were mommy says that she wishes Shikimori was her girlfriend. After this, I realized what the true potential of this show was and what the author really wanted to focus on.Art 10/10: It doesn't take a genius to realize how peak this animation is. The real strong suit of this art lies on Izumi's mom character design. Her usual appearance seemed pretty decent at first,...however, when she showed up in those mommy backstory scenes GOD DAMN. I'm not sure if it was the short hair or her attractive looks. but something clearly stood out for me.Sound 10/10: This one is probably the easiest category. I mean, has anyone listened to those mommy waifu sounds? On episode 1 I thought they were pretty standard anime mom sounds, but my opinion changed drastically after watching that episode 4 bonus scene when mommy whispers in an intimate manner on Shikimori's ear. Peak sound right there ladies and gentlemen.Character 10/10: I wouldn't give this category a 10 if it was just based on Izumi and Shikimori's character development. The reason for such a high number rating is 100% because of the mind-blowing romantic hints between Izumi's mother and Shikimori's character. Even though we've only received a few minutes screen time of this happening, I do believe this has MASSIVE potential to develop the characters in this show.Enjoyment 10/10: Mommy scenes. That is all.Overall 10/10: Opposed from what is usually depicted on most romantic anime, we see the female constantly protect her male significant other in a heroic manner. Even during common scenes their dialogue seems inverted from their stereotypical roles. Overall the anime is pretty average to decent, with the exception of being heavily carried by Izumi's mother. It all goes from her virgin killer looks to her Shikimori affair plot bait. I really hope that they continue to show us more of this content. The show recently suggested some type of beach/river episode? The first thing that came to my mind after hearing this was that mommy better show up in a swimsuit when that happens.Thank you all for reading.

This show is clearly misunderstood by a ton of viewers who have watched 2 or 3 episodes and bailed.The show has a slow build. It\'s slice of life. This isn\'t a show to shove action down your throat every 2 seconds. It\'s character driven. This time the two main characters are together from the start, and not just that, the female takes more of the ""male"" role in being confident, taking action, great at sports, etc. while the guy, Itsuki is basically timid, shy, cursed with bad luck wherever he goes. The point being...they compliment each other. They grow together. No, in 2 episodes you will never see a character arc. It takes time, and by episode 5 and 6 you\'ll start to see how they grow in their own ways but also need each other.This goes much deeper than a surface level romance, and the story doesn\'t have some main typical arc, it\'s about their journey together, and the places and destinations aren\'t as prominent and important to the story line. The focus is their growth as people, as students and individuals with different struggles. They learn that their struggles aren\'t only on themselves, but they grow and find out that they can rely on each other.It\'s better than what others are saying. Give it a try, and give it time. Not every show ever is going to hook you instantly, but the opening and ending songs are pretty great as well. they compliment each other. They grow together.

The layman\'s definition is ""an anime in which nothing really happens and it\'s just kind of relaxing to watch."" There\'s no drama, no tension, and no overarching plot to speak of.Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is a cute series with characters who are refreshing in how kind and honest they are. Shikimori and Izumi are dating at the start of the series, which differentiates it from most anime...where the protagonists don\'t even get together until the very end... if they get together at all. I enjoyed this unique take since it\'s something that doesn\'t happen often.To top it off, Shikimori and Izumi are adorable together. You can see through their interactions that they actually care about each other, and they treat each other with basic human kindness. It\'s a rare thing to happen in any media. Most modern stories are drowning in unnecessary amounts of relationship drama, so having a story without all that BS was a nice change of pace.As this is a slice-of-life, nothing really happens. Some people might not like that, but I found it relaxing. It\'s a great series to watch when I want to unwind.There\'s a lot of excellent comedy in this series as well. What stood out to me were the funny one-liners that were delivered in a timely manner, usually by characters other than Izumi and Shikimori. Inuzuka was a true bro. I thought it was great how this series depicts an actual friendship between dudes. I\'ve had enough of watching supposed ""best buds"" tell their friend to die because they went and got into a relationship with a hot girl... especially since it\'s almost always a misunderstanding and the protagonist isn\'t even in a relationship. Like, do the years of friendship mean nothing to you? You gonna listen to some broad say something misleading and try to beat your best friend because of it? Take a page from Inuzuka\'s book and don\'t be a douche, bruh.There were a few times where I facepalmed, usually whenever Izumi got injured, which happened quite often near the start. I\'m on episode 6 now and he hasn\'t been getting hurt as much. I\'m wondering if maybe this was done on purpose. It\'s possible the fact that the most he suffered in episode 6 was that slip at the end is a sign that he\'s growing. Or maybe I\'m just deluding myself.While Izumi has his problems, I really like Shikimori. There are times when she came across as too perfect, but those were blown away by two things. Her cuteness and the few times she spectacularly failed like when she tried to cook during the bbq in episode 5.I found this series to be a very relaxing and wholesome story about a young couple in high school and their friends.On a side note, I\'m certain Hachimitsu is a robot or an alien. where the protagonists don\'t even get together until the very end... if they get together at all.

Although I wish I could say it is flawed, it is not. One of the best exchanges occurs between the main characters. Shikimori is the best, and Izumi perfectly complements her; I enjoy how these anime make me feel warm. Izumi unintentionally sold all of his luck to meet Shikimori, and they could not help but fall in love and warm each other's life with happiness. They both complete each other's hearts and are a match made in heaven.While they are separated, they miss one another and think about one another often. They are honest and do...not try to conceal their emotions from one another. I really admire how they care about one other's happiness. not try to conceal their emotions from one another.

It is meticulously designed to feed on us. It weakens our allies, and emboldens our enemies.Something about this gets to me. I read plenty of romance manga and...watch the animes, and have regrettably become accustomed to bathing in my sadness. While the characters of these stories are ultimately unrealistic, they are flawed in some or many aspects; they possess a trait that lets me spite them. Like, some of these motherfuckers don’t even know how to talk. They’d speak Latin better than Japanese to their crush, probably. But Skikimori and her friends just… don’t. They are perfect in every way.This may sound like a flaw. I don’t even know at this point. I’ve read the entire manga, watched what is out of the anime, and now, I don’t remember what a flaw even is. Shikimori’s prismatic hair flows through each frame like a fucking Kendrick Lamar verse, and Izumi might just be the single cutest thing ever conceived. His blush could reignite the souls of starving children everywhere.Anyways, rejoice, I guess. Because while watching this will meet you with endless amounts of happiness, warmth, and pleasure, the hours following will be filled with nothing but depression, misery, and existentialism. You'll never be as attractive as the main character. You'll never date such a perfect girl. You beat your meat to anime girls. As your mind is flooded with melancholy, you'll be reminded why you should maybe get your life together.

For the past few weeks, I would always hear how Shikimori was a character that everyone would absolutely fawn over, similar to Marin Kitagawa from My Dress-Up Darling, but after watching a few episodes, I don\'t think that\'s going to be the case. Shikimori as a character is just not interesting in any way except for having a nice character design, and she lacks the charisma and charm that Marin had. At this rate, she can\'t hold a candle to Yor...Forger or Kaguya let alone Marin for the title of ""Best Girl"".The romance aspect of this show is not believable in the slightest, because from what I saw in the first 3 episodes, Shikimori does practically everything in the relationship. If you are tired of MCs with meek personalities and being a generic self-insert, I\'m sorry to say I have bad news for you. The MC isn\'t a bad person by any means, but other than having luck that rivals Nagito Komaeda, there is nothing to him that even hints why Shikimori even likes him, and I don\'t count him making her blush by complimenting her at all, as I find it to be an extremely cheap and manipulative way to make you think it\'s a wholesome relationship. Every episode, the only takeaway I get from this show is to hope for someone that will fix all your problems and do everything for you to show up in your life. Not exactly the best message to convey.The story might not be the main focus for a slice of life anime, but is it too much to ask for something that doesn\'t just make you check the clock every 2-3 minutes? It\'s most likely because the characters have 0 chemistry with each other that their dates just make me yawn instead of feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside. Furthermore, the pacing is way too slow, which further contributes to making 24 minutes feel like it\'s twice the length.The characters are also extremely forgettable, the only side character I remember is Inuzuka and that\'s only because he looks like a dimestore Katsuki Bakugo. As stated above, I found both the main characters extremely bland and uninteresting, and the same goes for all the side characters.On the bright side, the art is nice to look at. I really like how vibrant the eyes are. The animation is serviceable in general and isn\'t terrible. The voice acting was also decent, it\'s about what you\'d expect from basically any slice of life anime. The OP and ED however I don\'t remember at all, but if I\'m going to be honest the OP and ED I never remember unless it\'s so catchy it gets stuck in my head for days, and that almost never happens so I\'m not the person to ask about it.Overall, I simply cannot recommend this anime. Putting it bluntly, it\'s boring, manipulative and forgettable. There is nothing to the dates except for the MC getting in trouble and Shikimori saving the day then blushing after a ""thank you"" from him. Your time would be better spent with other romcom shows such as Kaguya-sama S3, Love After World Domination, or even Komi Can\'t Communicate Pt. 2, as those shows have actual substance to them.

While Shikimori is good everything the MC is awful at everything. These characters then do slice of life shit like meeting their parents or grocery shopping etc.While the MC has certain good quality traits like ""working really hard and never...giving up!""

"", ""Solid 9/10I hate to rate any anime before it's completely aired but reading the reviews here, I had to do it. Reading the reviews on this anime also made me realize how wrong reviews can be in terms of judging something, especially this show. It's a great show IMO.This show is totally wholesome and lovely to watch. The art is fabulous and extremely well done. The story is where people tend to misjudge the show. As another reviewer pointed out, these days people expect a certain sense of masculinity from a guy in a relationship, and when the roles are reversed, like in this...anime, people are caught off-guard. The majority of the low-rated reviews are from these people who have made a certain image of men and women in any relationship and conform to those ideals, and when these ideals are challenged by a unique show like this, it hurts their mental image of themselves. It's as if people are so used/accustomed to these ideals in present-day society.Coming back to the topic, the story format resembles that of Kaguya-Sama or Lucifer, meaning it's interconnected as well as independent. It might not be for everyone but it works perfectly for me. I have heard the manga also has arcs so it's well worth waiting for.The characters are quite good. Shikimori, the main female protagonist, is quite well thought out. She has a strong but gentle character, cute but also cool, and much more. Izumi, the male protagonist, is someone who has very bad luck and often gets into trouble because of it, but his relationship with Shikimori often creates an enjoyable dynamic that makes it less of a trouble for him. The other characters are also quite funny, Hachimitsu being very relatable to everyone IRL.Now the best part, the show is not cringing at all! As someone who doesn't like watching cringe shows with excessive drama or harem, I stay clear of the rom-com genre for the most part. This show however falls outside of those criteria and is perfect for someone who is looking to watch a wholesome rom-com.Give it a try, regardless of what the other reviews say/recommend, and then judge it for yourself. If you don't like it, then you can always quit, but if you don't fall into the category that I mentioned above, I'm pretty sure you'll love it! Have fun watching! anime, people are caught off-guard.

Not only is the idea the most stupid thing I've ever seen, but I also don't find a virtue in the guy at first glance, besides being a very good person, most romance series present us with the problem...and then gradually teach us how to the secondary characters of the series and becoming fond of them, most of the romance series in the same series show us how they fell in love and it creates a really beautiful dynamic where we see how they grow fond of each other and we of the same time of them. This is not the case here, the relationship is already established and we have to assume that they love each other because they tell us, not because we see it.The protagonist is the worst, not only because he always says he wants to be better so that his girlfriend needs him and not hers, but at the end of the series that never happens and he's just a stupidly clumsy person without any kind of charisma, but he is also a first-class useless who at no time empathizes with him.The girl is such for which with the protagonist, she is a kind tough girl who is obsessed with the protagonist in such a way that it is a bit uncomfortable, she protects him from everything and for me it is something very strange, it seems that the only thing that matters about him it can protect you.The plot of each chapter is simple, the protagonist can't do something and the girl helps him end of the chapter (that's how mediocre the plot is).I do not recommend it, do not watch it and please do not waste your time here, there are much better romance series that are worth much more than this rubbish.Español.Un amor super tóxico que nunca avanza, odie está serie como no tienen idea, no solo porque el protagonista es de lo peor también porque nunca entenderé el punto de que exista está serie, nos muestran un tipo con muy mala suerte y su novia según super guapa que se enamoro de él de repente y quiso que fuera su novio.

I mean if you just want something on in the background sure.Thoughts: Maybe I overhyped myself up for it because I've seen many many people hyping it up saying she'd be the new best girl after Marin from My Dress-Up Darling. But going into this anime I have to say. I did not understand the hype. I can say Shikimori herself is cute, but I just feel like the only reason to watch this anime is for her. The other characters don't seem to make an impact. The main guy who's her boyfriend doesn't really have any impact or backstory. He's...just a clumsy guy that gets rescued by his girlfriend. And only feels bad about being protected. Other than that not much happens besides daily activities of normal life, and Shikimori flexing on how awesome she is. There's no plot twist, no drama, not much comedy, no character development. Pretty much most of the reasons I watch anime this anime didn't really have any of those factors besides the cute girl factor which can only go so far. Because yes Shikimori had some adorable moments and some cool moments, but not much else is going for this anime. To be honest as I watch it I'm waiting for it to be over so I can go to the next anime. I believe I may drop it, but from what I also hear it's supposed to get good later on, so Idk guess I'll stay around to watch it, but so far not really enjoying it as much as other animeArt: The focus on Shikimori at times definitely was highly produced, but everything else is just standard anime stuff which is alright.Sound: Opening is really catchy. Love itCharacters: There's other characters besides Shikimori? Lol for real though at most you get the main guy who's Shikimori's boyfriend, but he's just a clumsy goofball. The anime just wants to focus on shikimori being cool or cute, and show how protective she is which hey great waifu, but bad showOverall: As I said might drop it within the next 2 episodes if nothing happens just a clumsy guy that gets rescued by his girlfriend.

It actually made the show a downright chore to watch most times and caused me to like the side characters more.Shikimori-San had been hyped up as one of the best upcoming manga adaptations and a waifu of the year prospect for months. For that reason, I had some decent expectations for the story. Unfortunately, the show did not live up to it at all. I found the MC, Izumi to be one of the most insufferable and annoying...beta male characters ever. The whole girlfriend saves boyfriend constantly gimmick of the show did not land on me and most of the time I found it to be gratuitous and unfunny. I mean, a few times here or there would have been fine, but you’re telling me this dude can’t walk outside without getting hit by a car or breaking a leg? He needs to be babied that much? And this isn’t just a complaint about mommy dom gf archetypes, it would be annoying if it were the other way around as well. Moreover, that’s basically all there is to the series. Like Izumi being saved by Shikimori is the story. If you’ve seen one episode you’ve seen them all.The high point of this series for me was by far side characters like Kamiya who were way more interesting and had more complexity than the MC himself. I was extremely dissatisfied with how her character arc was handled in the anime and felt she deserved more. Of course the school festival arc which revolves around her, ended up being the best part of the show. The other side characters are also genuinely more funny and entertaining than Izumi, which I suppose isn’t hard to do.Subpar plot and awful MC aside, Shikimori does have some really beautiful art and animation that’s wasted on a mediocre show. Some of the visuals and animated sequences really did blow me away. Pacing and direction were also solid. Not at all surprising for a Doga Kobo show. They continue to be one of my fave studios.I think this is one of those very divisive series where you either love it or hate it. The gimmick is not going to be for everyone. I have noticed a gender divide in terms of reception and despite being a shonen, I feel this definitely resonates with female fans more than males.

""Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie"" is an absolute gem of a romantic comedy that\'s like a cozy hug for your heart. It\'s like living in a world where love is as perfect as a perfectly drawn manga panel.Shikimori adores Izumi, and guess what? Izumi loves her back just as much! No over-the-top drama, no crazy misunderstandings, just pure, unadulterated affection. It\'s like something out of our wildest anime dreams.Sure, in real life, love can be a rollercoaster of emotions and insecurities, but in this show, they keep it simple, and I couldn\'t help but fall in love with it!...""Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie"" is that romantic fantasy every anime fan secretly craves - the kind of love story that makes you believe in fairy tales and happy endings all over again.

The other...one is that the mc did not get castrated during the show, bro was so forgettable I literally forgot his name already, and I bingewatched it an hour ago- and on a related note Shikimori (female mc) does not turn yandere (except some comedic moments).So, it could have been worse, some may enjoys this show, but it is literally just a plaim, soulless, lifeless, depressed shoujo manga you have seen 1000 times already with switched gender roles.Story: Was there a story? 3/10Art: I mean the art look pretty good, gotta give props to the animators on that one 7/10Characters: I personally hated the blind and 2d characters (Mc-s included), but I dont want to be too harsh and subjective, so maybe a 4/10 (a real big rounding up).Sound: I really liked the OP, the ending was a little more bland but still manageable, voice acting is average (fitting for the anime), not bad, but dont expect a lot of emotions or anything (to be fairy with writing like this, I cant blame the voice actors). 5/10.TLDR: If you want an aestheticly pleasing but very plain, gender switched, no brain no problems shoujo anime, this is a treat for you, otherwise I would not personally recommend. one is that the mc did not get castrated during the show, bro was so forgettable I literally forgot his name already, and I bingewatched it an hour ago- and on a related note Shikimori (female mc) does not turn yandere (except some comedic moments).So, it could have been worse, some may enjoys this show, but it is literally just a plaim, soulless, lifeless, depressed shoujo manga you have seen 1000 times already with switched gender roles.Story: Was there a story? 3/10Art: I mean the art look pretty good, gotta give props to the animators on that one 7/10Characters: I personally hated the blind and 2d characters (Mc-s included), but I dont want to be too harsh and subjective, so maybe a 4/10 (a real big rounding up).Sound: I really liked the OP, the ending was a little more bland but still manageable, voice acting is average (fitting for the anime), not bad, but dont expect a lot of emotions or anything (to be fairy with writing like this, I cant blame the voice actors). 5/10.TLDR: If you want an aestheticly pleasing but very plain, gender switched, no brain no problems shoujo anime, this is a treat for you, otherwise I would not personally recommend.', ""Yui Hachimitsu is the girl with the dead expression and eyes that look like lemon candies. She is my favorite part of this anime because every one of her lines is funny and she is cute.The rest of the show is mid. If you fantasize about this specific kind of relationship (Cool girlfriend with feminine boyfriend) then you will like it. Otherwise I don't think it is worth your time. This isn't an anime where characters get very developed, at least in the first four episodes. You either like the thing that it is supposed to be a wish fulfillment for or you don't. "", ""Coming into this season, Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie was expected to be the next Dress-Up Darling. Another fun, Slice of Life romcom that revolves around a single female lead that is peak waifu material for weebs to salivate over, competing with other very popular originals like Spy x Family, as well as sequels to great romcoms like Kaguya-sama and Komi-san Can't Communicate... Unfortunately, as evidenced by its current overall rating, as well as many of the reviews that have already been posted about it, it is pretty obvious that it greatly failed to live up to those expectations. So, what the heck happened?Part...of why I have been hesitant to even attempt a review on this anime is due in large part to how little there is to actually talk about. It is easy to list of all things that make a terrible show terrible, however it is fairly difficult to properly explain why a boring show is boring without becoming redundant, and to put it bluntly, Shikimori-san is really freakin' boring. Super boring, and it does not offer anything new to table when it comes to romcoms. Now this is perfectly okay. Not every show needs to provide completely unique content to be considered good. However, if an anime is not going to add anything new to its genre, it needs to provide high quality material that one would typically expect to see to make it worthwhile. Sadly, there is nothing remarkable about this anime. The characters are all largely forgettable, including Shikimori herself. The plot is simple and extremely repetitive. And the humor (which is sub-par to begin with) relies very heavily on the same few gags multiple times every single episode. The only notable thing about this anime is the art, which is its only saving grace. I love the vibrant color pallet and every character at least stands out upon first glance. Unfortunately, a great art style is not enough to save Shikimori-san from the rest of its issues.Now of course all of this could be forgiven if the couple we are following are at least interesting in some respect. Unfortunately that is not the case here. The dynamic between Shikimori and her boyfriend Izumi is tired at best, and only grows more stale with each passing segment. It is simple, Izumi is cursed with abysmal luck that effectively makes him a walking hazard, while Shikimori is your 'perfect girl' of sorts that can basically do it all. This pairing is supposed to highlight just how cool Shikimori is, thus making her more attractive and likeable to the viewer. Instead, all it does is create a strange dynamic between the two that does not at all resemble boyfriend and girlfriend, but rather a mother and her clumsy son. And this is not at all helped by Shikimori's treatment of Izumi coming off as weird, rather than cute. She's sort of like a yandere, but just not obsessed to the point of wanting to inflict bodily harm on others to keep her man all to herself. This is not helped by the fact that Izumi's attempts at flipping the script are pathetic compared to what Shikimori does for him. It was kind of cool watching Shikimori save Izumi once. It stopped being cool the third time around, and we're only on episode 2.Unsurprisingly, I did not enjoy watching this show, and ended up dropping it fairly early on in its run. While I do not believe that it deserves the intense amount of hate that it has received, I certainly cannot endorse it as something that's even worth a watch. The thing about bad anime is that they at least provide a viewer with something memorable to think about. Boring anime provide nothing except for wasted time and effort spent finding some valid reason to continue watching. Give this one a skip.

No, of course not since this site is very opinionated and everyone is entitled to their own tastes. So this review will come from the few majority that actually enjoy this show.The story follows your typical average guy dating the super popular girl. Now I don't particularly mind these types of troupes being used over and over, but the way the anime executes it is very poor. I don't know what they were thinking when they decided to start episode 1 from chapter 18...and somehow squeeze in whatever chapters followed the episodes plotline. This isn't exactly a bad thing but it leaves a very bad impression for new viewers. The first couple of chapters in the manga fleshes out Izumi and Shikimori's relationship, essentially exposing to the reader that he's the unlucky boyfriend and she's the cool girlfriend. It shows the reader that this is going to be a slice of life/slow life story. The anime just seems to assume you know what you're getting into, just another mediocre romance anime with a bland and generic narrative. The art also makes it look more generic then it already is. (Keigo Maki is an amazing artist you should check out the manga)Speaking of which, another qualm people seem to have with this anime is the minimal character development and Shikimori is just another waifu bait. In all honesty this is quite justified. The only character that has seem to developed so far is Kamiya. She shown to have a cool and reserved personality. She doesn't initiate in conversation and is kind yet distant towards everyone. It is shown later that she has feelings for Izumi because he was the only one to know her inner self as opposed to her outward appearance, but this is quickly resolved in a heartfelt manner. These types of characters are so complex and that's what I love to see in these types of narratives.Shikimori's not just cute (anime) is no where near amazing but if you were to not analyse every aspect of it, you might find yourself entertained with this simple and enjoyable anime. Let's see if anyone's opinion changes in the last 3 to 4 episodes.Also the OP and ED are absolute vibes. and somehow squeeze in whatever chapters followed the episodes plotline.

How can a show which uses 'generic' features of your typical romcom appear to be so unique? It's difficult to answer and I can already smell the shonentards in...my inbox after I write this but shikimori is different as it's not what you would expect with the 2 protaganist (izumi and shikimori) both have soft sides with one not completely overpowering the other - if you actually watch the show you can notice this. It also has an amazing cast of side characters all of which add a lovely sense of comedy to the show and bring a nice vibe, the plot also has intresting twists especially recently with the unspoken 'feud' which was supressed so nicely and provide a great insight into certain characters just by potraying their actions rather than a backstory.The animation is also top notch and couldnt have been better, the bright, vibrant colors also help add to the cheery vibe of the show and is well done. my inbox after I write this but shikimori is different as it's not what you would expect with the 2 protaganist (izumi and shikimori) both have soft sides with one not completely overpowering the other - if you actually watch the show you can notice this.

Like, the power dynamics are hella off, even nasuo, the artist for the OP, addressed this by saying 「なんか僕よりも彼氏みたい」which roughly translates to “you look more like the boyfriend than me”. You get what I’m saying now?The story goes like this, Izumi Yuuki, who’s been under an umbrella while God was making luck rain from the sky, pulls Miyako Shikimori, the baddest girl one can ask...for. Yet both of them have some screws loose for real. Miyako be trying to be more feminine, as if her looks ain’t enough for that. My friend Ediz (a.k.a BRUHLAS) actually had some shit to say about this. “Bro I’d get it if her hair was short, but which tomboy has long ass hair like this?” And I agree with him, because that bomboclaat hair of hers is longer than then Hindu goddesses, like what the hell? Izumi’s case is already obvious, so I ain’t saying shit about that.The only thing that was nice about this bomboclaat anime is the “gang”, i.e. Inuzuka and the others. They were legit entertaining and that’s one of the reasons why I wanna give some extra points, the other being the fact that Miyako has pink hair. Since we don’t really have room for development as the ship has already sailed, the only thing that gets the story going is Izumi’s god damned luck and Miyako just trying to deal with all that shit.Speaking of Miyako trying to deal with all that shit, let’s talk about the realism of this whole saga. I’m telling you, if a couple had Miyako and Izumi’s dynamic and the situation, then the girl would most likely dump the boy, I’m not saying she’d break up or shit, she’d fucking DUMP him.

Take Izumi trying to carry Miyako on his back during the fireworks festival episode. I vaguely remember it as I watched this shit way back in December 2022, but my boy straight up got VIOLATED by that bad luck over them stairs.Although I ain’t gonna lie, Izumi’s mom be bad as fuck, yet again, his dad wouldn’t normally be able to pull someone like her, if he wasn’t actually hot back in his youth which we have no bomboclaat idea about. It’d be nice to see Motoko and, what was Izumi’s dad’s name again? Whatever, it’d be nice to see an arc that covers how their parents met, like in Horimiya.

Yet both of them have some screws loose for real. Miyako be trying to be more feminine, as if her looks ain’t enough for that. My friend Ediz (a.k.a BRUHLAS) actually had some shit to say about this. “Bro I’d get it if her hair was short, but which tomboy has long ass hair like this?” And I agree with him, because that bomboclaat hair of hers is longer than then Hindu goddesses, like what the hell? Izumi’s case is already obvious, so I ain’t saying shit about that.The only thing that was nice about this bomboclaat anime is the “gang”, i.e. Inuzuka and the others. They were legit entertaining and that’s one of the reasons why I wanna give some extra points, the other being the fact that Miyako has pink hair. Since we don’t really have room for development as the ship has already sailed, the only thing that gets the story going is Izumi’s god damned luck and Miyako just trying to deal with all that shit.Speaking of Miyako trying to deal with all that shit, let’s talk about the realism of this whole saga. I’m telling you, if a couple had Miyako and Izumi’s dynamic and the situation, then the girl would most likely dump the boy, I’m not saying she’d break up or shit, she’d fucking DUMP him.

They captured the best parts of the anime, and they chose the right stories to show. They also added some meaningful things that the manga didn't have (best example is showing Shikimori's brother more). I think the anime is slower-paced and more cheesy overall compared to the manga, but in a way it adds to the wholesome and romantic feel of it.This anime is for the most part your typical high school romantic-comedy story, but the chemistry between the...main two leads (Shikimori and Izumi) is a stand-out feature. They don't fit the classic stereotype of soft-girl-and-tough-boy, and the anime shows us that it's a thing to be proud of. Their relationship is a healthy one, as even though Izumi is constantly struck by bad luck and being helped by Shikimori, he doesn't use it as fuel for self-destructive jealousy and pride, but rather to push himself to be a better person and also to cherish Shikimori even more. It's an entertaining dynamic that never feels too one-sided despite Shikimori's prominent personality, as Izumi constantly shows his best self (or at least tries). The anime portrays the relationship in a decidedly cheesy manner, and it might be too sweet and lovey-dovey for some. For me, it hits the right spot for a high school love story.The side characters are quite the entertaining crew. Among them are Izumi's parents: a lovely, supportive couple that will make you smile as they can't help to be so charming. Izumi and Shikimori hangs out with their three good friends, and they are also a vibrant bunch: a short girl with semi-permanent neutral face and relatable demeanor, a dependable Bakugo-esque boy, and an athletic girl that is the energetic core of the group. And there are a couple more that I won't mention. All of them have their own moments in the spotlight, and their mini story arcs support the main ideas of the anime quite well: themes of friendship, love, and the understanding of self.The cast of characters are well-voiced overall. I particularly enjoy Hidaka-san's performance as Hachimitsu (the short girl I mentioned before), as she perfectly conveys her silly personality through a neutrally-toned voice.The animations and visuals of anime are solid enough. It uses slideshows pretty often, but for brief moments. Most importantly, they nailed the look of eyes of the characters, especially for Shikimori. There are a couple moments featuring individual characters that are superbly animated (thinking of Shikimori eating dessert during their summer holiday, you know it right away when you see it).The plot overall is a slice-of-life story following the main two leads' high school life. This season of the anime goes through the early chapters of the manga (approximately the first 20-30%) of it, and it ends in the perfect spot that I won't spoil. Hopefully more seasons are to come by the same studio, as I think they truly understands the manga's qualities. main two leads (Shikimori and Izumi) is a stand-out feature.

Shikimori unfortunately has the double whammy of having BOTH its MC and Love Interest be some of the most unlikable boring characters in all anime.The basic premise is that Shikimori occupies a boyish role and Izumi the girlish role, ie the idea is that common tropes in romcom are switched for the two. However in practice this does not happen at all. A...good example would be something like Nozaki-kun that uses its time well to demonstrate and highlight the tropes or cliches commonly associated with romcoms and build a strong comedic foundation upon it. Shikimori has none of that and does nothing to capitalize on its gimmick. In fact, later down the line it practically stops doing the gimmick and becomes indistinguishable from your standard mediocre romcom. Shikimori herself initially seems to be a tomboy with a girly streak but just stops being tomboyish at all and is just another main love interest that can easily be replaced by anyone from your typical mediocre series.Izumi is the worst though. My god. I think the best word to describe him is ""embarrassing"".  I still don\'t know how anyone would keep him as a boyfriend even after this long, and all his antics are just cringe worthy. It\'s one thing to suffer through a mediocre romcom with a bland self insert MC, it\'s another to do the same with a terrible MC you feel embarrassed to be seen with.Not to say the show is a complete failure. There are some good episodes in here, and by no coincidence they all barely involve Shikimori or Izumi. A highlight would be that sports festival episode with Hachimitsu. Now stuff like that is fun, and I don\'t get second-hand embarrassment being with her (or the other side characters, Accelerator-kun, and that other girl) unlike with the MCs.Single target romcoms are hard to do, I get it. You get none of the fun love triangle bits from a standard romcom, nor any drama. But, that still doesn\'t excuse Shikimori from being a terrible show and frankly a waste of time to sit through. If this was at all your first romcom, you\'d be poisoned from ever touching the genre again.3/10 good example would be something like Nozaki-kun that uses its time well to demonstrate and highlight the tropes or cliches commonly associated with romcoms and build a strong comedic foundation upon it.

Not only does it not even attempt to do anything new, but it doesn\'t do anything particularly well either.This show is so formulaic that it hurts. Every episode feels like they took a script from a generic romcom from around 2014 and said \'alright, let\'s just throw in a 10 second scene of Shikimori being kinda cool right here\'  and that was that.It seems like the...only goal the creators had when creating this show was to make the audience want to bang the main girl, and that\'s it. It\'s possible to do that without ignoring every other aspect of the show, though, ex: My Dress-Up Darling. I know it\'s kind-of a lazy comparison to make, but when we have a perfect example of how good a fan-service filled romcom can be just a season ago, it\'s hard not to lump these two together.The best thing I can say about this show is that the art style is pretty unique, at least for it\'s genre. That\'s probably the only compliment that I\'ll give it.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I wouldn\'t call this show \'bad\', it\'s just painfully cookie-cutter and bland. It\'s not offensively awful or anything, but there\'s just nothing that sets it apart from other shows in the genre in any meaningful way.

It\'s still not a very good show, but it ended up being a lot better than I expected. There were a couple really solid episodes, which was pretty shocking to me.

But God does the art catch you off guard, you'd expect a typical cute, yet serious art style, and you'd not be wrong for thinking that, but this is soo much more. I can't explain how much I love this art style, you will have to watch it to get a better understanding.The soundtrack somehow manages to surpass my expectations about it, even though...it may be very overlooked, it does excel in expressing the feeling and emotions of a certain scene. To that, I give it a solid 8/10Storywise, I have read the manga up to where it is currently (2/5/2022) and it is safe to say if you like a dominant girlfriend that is also very overprotective of you and also one of the best-designed characters that can not get more perfect, this anime is for you.What I did not find the best:The sound, I did not particularly feel any emotions for it, not that it is bad, it is definitely good, but it just did not capture the emotions in me that other animes have done prior. But nothing wrong with it, it just is not good nor bad, I am going to get a lot of hate for this.

And to be honest I understand why one will stop watching this after it's starting 3-4 episodes. BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BLAND AND BORING.But...If you were to dig a little bit deeper into animes in general, a lot of anime like stiens;gate and everyones fav gintama, they had a lot slower start than this show. Bear in mind, I'm not saying this show is better or anything (and...I personally adore gintama more than anything), I'm just saying this one takes time to polish what it's been building. It's not engaging in the start what so ever. But damn this goes mature. I cannot force you to watch this show, I mean obviously, duh! But hey it'll be worth it if you actually liked it after processing what harm will it do.Anyways to sell what I've written I'll start my review, which I don't do normally but this one had too much hate so, yeahh...Story:In my opinion, the start is bland, yes it had its moments and all to show how cool is shikimori by creating random events and damn she's strong. Judging by the opening song, she's a fighter from her childhood (just start with the backstory, goddamn it, it's ep 8 already).So when I say it gets better, by that I mean, while this subtle cliche still remains, it is far less than the first 4 episodes, hell, bit of a spoiler about the arcs but after the 'summer vacations' it's really better. It's an 8 here, if it weren't for the starting epsiodes, it would have been a 9 maybe.Art (animation):Holy shit the animation, it's top tier, Doga Kobo, pulling it's big guns on this. The opening song is good, but the animation is a masterpiece, it always gives me chills. The Ending is artistic and cute, I like it. The actual animation however, could have been improved in my opinion. But it certainly gets the job done, with major events having beautiful animation, like if it weren't digging for Shikimori character already, her acting (voice and animation) would have gotten me. It's a 9 here.Art (characters and background):Obviously the character designs are orinally from the creator itself, but I have a love and hate relationship here. While making a few artistic touches here and there with the colour of hair, with almost every important character to stand them out of the crowd, the side characters are generic as hell, like I would have easily figured out which one is which here lmao.But these are just minor things, you adapt with it the more you watch it. And now I couldn't care less however they are drawn, although, my major problem was with the character nekozaki, her hair. JUST WHY?Anyways, onto the next thing that is the backgrounds, and I have nothing to shit about here, they Te just good, as most of my focus was on the characters.This is a 8 too.Sound:Nothing special, I think the opening and ending songs are definitely good. I'm personally not a very big fan, But I understand why someone would like them.Voice acting is okay too, similar to the animation the main bitd have alot more focus, characters who are supposed to sound cool are cool, and those who are laid back sounds laid back. 8 cuz it was nothing exceptional but still does the job.Characters:I'm on episode 8, and I think these characters won't cut it in the long run. Don't get me wrong, the main characters notably shikimori and yuu, they are cool but the characters beside them are meh. The only other character I really started to like appeared in episode 7 and we where she's coming from and that was really good not gonna lie enough to convince that she is needed for this story to progress into a better story. Anyways, it's a 7 for me, cuz non main characters are 2 dementional. Whatever they do is so predictable, I think they need a makeover at least.Enjoyment:When I say I didn't like the characters I didn't mean that I didn't enjoy the show. Since the show only revolves around the two main characters, the side characters play as a stepping stone only. There still were times when I thought it's too much. But there were more times when I thought the setting was too mature and I was invested in what is going to happen. 8 here.Overall (conclusion): for obvious reasons this show is worth a watch, yes it's having a cliché but when it's shining, it's doing that effortlessly. The animation is good, not flawless but certainly great. I love how I feel after finishing every episode, it's wholesome and mature at the sametimeBut again it's possible that why I like this show is because Shikimori san is a really interesting character, the more I watch her, the more I want to know about her.Please give it a try, and with that byee!! I personally adore gintama more than anything), I'm just saying this one takes time to polish what it's been building. It's not engaging in the start what so ever. But damn this goes mature. I cannot force you to watch this show, I mean obviously, duh! But hey it'll be worth it if you actually liked it after processing what harm will it do.Anyways to sell what I've written I'll start my review, which I don't do normally but this one had too much hate so, yeahh...Story:In my opinion, the start is bland, yes it had its moments and all to show how cool is shikimori by creating random events and damn she's strong. Judging by the opening song, she's a fighter from her childhood (just start with the backstory, goddamn it, it's ep 8 already).So when I say it gets better, by that I mean, while this subtle cliche still remains, it is far less than the first 4 episodes, hell, bit of a spoiler about the arcs but after the 'summer vacations' it's really better. It's an 8 here, if it weren't for the starting epsiodes, it would have been a 9 maybe.Art (animation):Holy shit the animation, it's top tier, Doga Kobo, pulling it's big guns on this. The opening song is good, but the animation is a masterpiece, it always gives me chills. The Ending is artistic and cute, I like it. The actual animation however, could have been improved in my opinion. But it certainly gets the job done, with major events having beautiful animation, like if it weren't digging for Shikimori character already, her acting (voice and animation) would have gotten me. It's a 9 here.Art (characters and background):Obviously the character designs are orinally from the creator itself, but I have a love and hate relationship here.

Basically like 99% of rom coms out there. What makes this one so infuriating is that the premise, on paper, is solid. A caring, athletic, attractive girl falls for a shy, timid guy that could be the manifestation of Murphy's laws. In theory it’s a solid premise with a lot of potential about role reversals in relationships. That could be a pretty good anime.Unfortunately we will never know that because we got this atrocity instead.Let’s start...with a positive aspect of the show. The two main protagonists are actually dating. That saves us from god knows how many episode of “will they-won’t they” bs.……Yeap. That’s it. End of the positive aspects of the plot.The problem is that this “relationship” doesn’t look like a romantic one. It looks more like codependency or emotional addiction with a touch of child-guardian aspect to it.Miyako Shikimori - the cool, athletic, competitive girlfriend that hates to lose, acts more like Yuu’s mother or big sister than a girlfriend. She protects him, cares for him and even gets unjustifiably jealous of him. To be honest there are very few scenes that portray their chemistry in a romantic way.Yuu Izumi - the timid, shy boyfriend with more bad luck than people who thought EA would give up on loot boxes, is… just boring. In theory he should be the star of the show. A person who is a walking jinx gets a girlfriend that actually likes him. There are a ton of ways to tell awesome stories just from that one sentence. Instead we get more of the things we’ve seen a million times from any romance. Some self doubt, a little bit of hope for the better and all topped with a not so healthy dose of being a goddamn idiot ergo any rom com out there.To be fair after the first 3 or 4 episodes You saw it all. You won’t see anything original in the whole show. The premise has potential but it should be given to a writer that actually can take advantage of not so standard relationship setup. with a positive aspect of the show.

If you are looking for a cheesy yet laid back feel that doesn\'t invoke much of heavy feeling of sadness I would highly recommend watching this one. The rating doesn\'t necessarily reflect the overall quality of this series, yes it is not perfect, but it is worth the watch.The traditional romance anime contains a Male Character being the cool guy while the Female Character being the shy and timid one. However in this Anime, you are introduced to an unusual pair of Shikimori and Izumi. As the title suggests that ""Shikimori is not just a cutie"", this...Anime delves deep into that Idea and is paired by an adorable dynamics between of their relationship. My first thought while watching this series is that, it\'s extremely unusual for the girl to be the cool person in the relationship, which I think could be the reason why the series is rated low, however as get to watch more episodes the series I believe delivers, which in my opinion is what makes this unusual plot work.""A strong relationship requires two willing hearts that are committed to making it work"". This quote in my opinion best describes the entire journey of this series. Regardless of how cool and strong Shikimori is she is willing to do anything to make her relationship with Izumi work. The Case is the same with Izumi, though a natural airhead, he is willing to make himself a better person for the sake for Shikimori\'s sake.

However, this anime is probably one of the most boringly generic slice of life anime I have seen in my time, and as someone who started out watching cute lolis do cute things, I'm very surprised Shikimori has managed to make me not enjoy it. For an anime like this I...do not need anything unique or revolutionary to enjoy it, it just needs to to succeed in one of these categories for it to be a fun watch:1. Good plot/drama2. Good comedy3. Good charactersQuite frankly, I believe Shikimori is sub par in every one of these genres.The plot is non-existent, which is fair enough for a slice of life, but in this case I find it excessively bad. There may be a niche for people who like cute girls with a dom side to them, but there is no where near enough material there to possibly create a whole manga/anime on, without it becoming stale and boring very quickly. If you told me that was the synopsis of a single episode of an anime, I'd say cool, fair enough, but I'm in disbelief someone chose that to be the foundations of an entire story. Even anime like Komi-san have an underlying premise that the rest of the episodes stem from (i.e. lonely person making friends). The events that take place in the 5 episodes I've seen are generic in every sense of the word, and the only unique thing I can point out is the mc's horrific luck, which is still barely unique considering plenty of anime have done the unlucky-sod character trope. But the 'generic-ness' of the anime (you may have noticed I'm using that word a lot) would not hold it back if it had any other redeeming quality, but in my opinion it really doesn't, and I'll explain why.The comedy in this show in my honest opinion is also non-existent. Of the 5-6 anime I'm watching weekly as of now, all of them manage to get at least a couple chuckles out of me, which is enough to satisfy me when it comes to this genre. All of them, except Shikimori. I can't recall a single time I've found this anime decently funny, the jokes they make feel like jokes I've heard in 100 different anime in this genre, which further adds to its generic-ness. On top of this, the characters are also generic, not in their character archetype (Shikimori is a trope we see very little I'd say), but rather in their execution. Whenever I watch an episode, it's obvious each character, bar the main couple, is there to simply serve there purpose and nothing else. The two female co-leads, and the mc's parents all have interesting dynamics to them that, if exploited, could make the show more fun to watch, but the show never utilises this. The male co-lead (the bakugo rip off dude) is as plain a character as you can get, but even he has an interesting dynamic with the female lead sometimes (she views him as a rival), and if they expanded on that a little more, there would be some good comedy/character material there. But instead, the show will give you a couple lack lustre one-liners in relation to these characters before reverting its focus to the main couple and once again becoming generic as f***.I could've gone into much more detail why I think this anime is sub-par but I'll leave it here as there are many other like-minded people who have probably explained my thoughts already, and in better fashion. do not need anything unique or revolutionary to enjoy it, it just needs to to succeed in one of these categories for it to be a fun watch:1.

This show lacks something, and I think that thing is growth which may happen in the latter half of the season. There really isn\'t a story per say its just a general slice of life anime. The MMC is in a word pathetic, and detracts the most from the story. Sure you can have an unlucky character who gets saved by his Mary Sue but it does lean a little hard into it, made worse by the fact...that if you looked bitch up in the dictionary this guys face would be right there. the FMC shikimori is alright, the superwomen gimmik is kind overplayed and underexamined. I mean in Ep 1 she swats a 80+ pound metal sign like its nothing, minor spoilers btw, this could be an interesting in concept much like the MMC horrid ""luck"" Luckily the FMC is more rounded then the MMC and there are side characters.Speaking of which they are the source of about 100% of the laughs and chuckles this show has received from me. They start off a bit bland in the setup of the main 2 but their interrelation and banter have been carrying the show the last couple episodes.This last one gave me hope, that being ep 5, as the MMC was only half a bitch actually do a couple not completely idiotic things and doing a good. sure he ended up needing to be saved at the end but baby steps.Character and story aside the art is decent, I actually dislike that they went as ham on the 2 MC\'s sure it makes them easy to pick out in a lineup or a crowd but it also really puts the spotlight on them and they just don\'t quite live up to it, at least not yet. The scenery is nice, The river animations seemed smooth, overall not bad.Sound is sound nothing stands out either good or bad. OP is aight ending is skipped.Overall the show is a drag for the first few episodes but then starts to pickup, time will tell if it keeps up.

The big appeal of the manga in the first place was the relationship dynamic and the art (mostly the facial expressions Shikimori makes), but it\'s all just downgraded to mediocrity in the show. Still decent enough to kill time, but it was disappointing as a fan of the manga.This honestly seems to be a trend lately, taking manga with a cool gimmick and just not delivering on the gimmick part at all. Again, just disappointing. And without the gimmick this show is peak mediocrity, as the ""story"" is pretty non-existent.6/10 ', ""This anime Is literally what I was expecting and more, it is cliche, funny, wholesome, and the best of all, backwards. I was, indeed, expecting it to be funny, but the fact that the ''roles'' of a couple are inverted makes it really funny.Those scenes where the boy is saved by the girl and she flirts with him and after embarrassing him she is the one embarrassed makes me laugh strongly.It is really like someone took a thing that did already exist and invented it, because it has an original air, but with something we already know much.The characters are...pretty simple but those moments make me laugh so much that I, afterwards, sympathy with the simpleness of this anime. pretty simple but those moments make me laugh so much that I, afterwards, sympathy with the simpleness of this anime."", ""I liked this show, at least for the first three episodes. Then I saw what everyone was complaining about. And I can look past that.Animation is clean and on point. ED has catchy music (bell chimes and disco) and an original idea - Shikimori playing a rhythm game to block everything that's flying at Izumi. Izumi's voice acting might exacerbate the problems people have with his character.Starting in the middle of their relationship allows their past history to be slowly revealed, without having the audience wonder if they'll ever actually get together. But it doesn't look like the show is interested in how they met....Also, the biggest complaint character-wise is that Izumi is too weak, as he's afraid of a clown horror movie and literally gets hurt by sunlight. Probably would have been forgivable if he had a personality. Izumi has hopelessly bad luck so he can get into trouble without having to make any bad decisions of his own. Gary Stus aren't necessarily bad if they are used to explore the world and characters around them, but Izumi doesn't do that.I mistook Shikimori's glare at the guys giving Izumi a hard time as character development. So I come to the conclusion that her character could have been further fleshed out if we were able to explore her jealousy issues, but again, this show doesn't want to develop Shikimori or Izumi. You know what? That's forgivable. Yet Kamiya, as the most interesting character, doesn't get any screen time. The other characters don't exist to do anything beyond support the main couple. Izumi is unlucky and Shikimori saves him. Shikimori worries about seeming more girly/submissive and Izumi the opposite, and that's it for the conflict. I said a lack of character development wasn't that big of an issue, because this is the real problem. The conflict doesn't evolve. It doesn't get worse or better.For all it's worth, the anime does a fine job setting up simple supporting characters and has some good, sugary, heartwarming moments. Kamiya is interesting because we see Shikimori's coolness isn't always a good thing. Shuu and Kyou are decent wingmen, I guess. Hachitmitsu's dumb smile, although a small detail, makes her funnier than other anime characters that fit the same role. The mom is easily a likable person and she tries to alleviate how we see her son's wimpiness by bragging about his perpetually considerate nature. Actually, it's incredible how much this show would improve if Izumi had his mother's lightly teasing personality.The idea of a girl taking the lead isn't novel anymore and thus people see this show as boring. At least Shikimori doesn't turn into a full-on psycho whenever she saves Izumi. Given how passive Izumi already is, imagine how obnoxious this show would be if she regularly thrashes her boyfriend and he just laughs it off. So why do I like Shikimori is Not Just a Cutie? Because it's the wish-fulfillment fantasy of being in a *healthy* *relationship* with a confident, *mature* girl. Given how most anime romance is, I'm starving for this sort of thing.

If you go into it expecting it to be a My dress up darling type of anime and expect to see sexualised minors, you'll be disappointed so save your time and don't even start watching it.(may contain spoilers)This is a slice of life romance anime so story-wise and sometimes character-wise it falls short. It has the cliché obligatory beach episode, fireworks episode, cultural and athletic festival episodes. But honestly I really enjoyed them. Shikimori and Izumi already dating since the beginning and not having to...sit through 12 episodes of the main leads trying to get together was somewhat refreshing too. So if you go into just wanting a relaxing, fun-ish short anime, definitely give this a try.As for the characters, I'm not sure about some of these reviews saying the main couple had zero chemistry. I thought their interactions with each other were really sweet and (mostly) innocent.I thought it was a nice, wholesome, cute summer watch. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a light anime. sit through 12 episodes of the main leads trying to get together was somewhat refreshing too.

The anime just shows us sweet moments between a young teenage couple and their friends. It's very light to watch but kind of gets repetitive at times.

I loved the animation and the eyes are something I haven't seen before.I've seen a lot of people compare this to Rental Kanojo and Dress Up Darling. I understand it with Dress...Up Darling but Rental Kanojo? I personally think that it should not be compared with Rental gf since that is literally dumpster fire. That's enough malding from me, I just like Shikimori way more than Rental Kanojo.Anyway I gave it an overall score of 8/10 since its lighthearted, enjoyable for people who just wants to see what a side of romcom is like, reminds you that you have no maidens whatsoever and it keeps the show simple and enjoyable.oh and also Izumi>Kazuya Up Darling but Rental Kanojo?

The art and character designs are eye-catching, and the show’s main couple is cute. However, that’s the main issue: this show is just cute and boring.

The problem is that it doesn't allow its characters to ever deviate from these roles, thus limiting their ability to grow and develop as characters.Their dynamic is admittedly rather cute, but it quickly becomes repetitive as the episodes drag on. It also doesn't help that the cuter, more wholesome moments in the anime failed to impact me...the same way the manga did. Nothing about the music or the animation stood out. With the exception of Shikimori herself, the character designs felt flat, dull, and unmemorable. One of them literally looks like a bootleg Bakugou from Boku no Hero Academia, and I say this as an avid hater of BNHA, mind you! the same way the manga did.

It was definitely a great change.- Sound -The op and ed themes were also bland. I found myself skipping them after the first 2 episodes.- Character -Some characters did not seem original. For example, the character Shuu Inuzuka was piece for piece, identical to Katsuki Bakugou from My Hero Academia, the only difference is that Inuzuka's character has softer and duller colors...as compared to Bakugo. However, the show's overall color palette for majority of the characters were eye-catching, bright, and honestly pleasing to look at. Aside from their physical appearance, their personalities are almost nonexistent not because he needed his girlfriend to protect him, but due to the fact that he is just all in all a boring and bland character.- Overall -Although I do find that many people do genuinely enjoy this series, I just happened to be one of the few that found it overrated and dreadfully unbearable to watch. I see a few are also comparing this show to My Dress Up Darling. Even though My Dress Up Darling did not have a particularly unique plot, they still made it work and got the rating it deserves.

Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is a cute and simple romcom with role reversal of the main couple. The main characters are dating from the get-go and show they love for each other. So, it\'s different from other romcoms, in which there\'s a lot of drama until the characters can finally be together. Instead, we get to see their lovey dovey relationship daily and their interactions with side characters without any problems arising, which some people could say is boring and maybe is one of the reasons why many people don\'t like...it. But that\'s something that many people ask for in romance animes when the characters only start dating by the end and it\'s not shown what happens after it.The main characters are pretty straightforward, without much depth or development. Shikimori is the cool and strong girlfriend, who loves Izumi more than anything else. Shikimori alone is the reason why many people like the anime, and it\'s understandable. She is attractive, protective and loving. It\'s natural to fall in love with her and to wish she was your girlfriend, and that\'s also one reason Izumi will get hated, since people will think someone like him doesn\'t deserve her. Izumi is the shy and weak boyfriend. One thing that was bothersome was how much the anime kept repeating their traits over and over again. I get it Shikimori is amazing and can do anything and Izumi is unlucky, weak and can\'t do anything alone, so Shikimori always has to help him. That was cute and funny in the beginning, but it keeps happening every single scene, and you know it will happen again and Izumi will never be able to overcome anything by himself. It becomes dull at some point, especially when Izumi wants to do something for Shikimori, and we already know beforehand it won\'t work because of his bad luck. To be fair, the anime did a good job in the final episode turning it around, when his bad luck actually did something good for them, so there\'s that.Nekozaki and Inuzuki are fine as the main couple friends, they have their moments in the story, but also lack depth like the MCs. Hachimitsu is one character that I kept wondering every episode ""why is this character in the anime?"", she is even more plain than the others and the deadpan comedy from her is not even funny for the most part. The only time she became a somewhat relevant character was in the sports festival. And finally, Kamiya. She is the only character that I can say has depth and development and her arc was the only time the story shows some seriousness and drama, she is the best character in the anime.The art was good, the animation was stunning in many scenes, but also pretty plain in others. The opening is amazing, ending is pretty good as well, other than that I can\'t say much about the ost, there wasn\'t anything remarkable.Overall, this anime was enjoyable, which is the most important, the interactions between Shikimori and Izumi are too adorable, they are enough to carry the anime and make it enjoyable. So I recommend if you are looking for a cute romance without drama, without a deep story or characters and if you don\'t mind the role reversal. It\'s definitely underrated because people don\'t like the male character being a weakling and relying on the girlfriend, especially by insecure people who want a weak girl to be saved by the strong boyfriend, and not the other way around. it.

I don't have anything critical to say about it because it's ignorant to expect too much from these types of shows. But I'll give my honest thoughts on it.The show revolves around Izumi, our protagonist (???) or the main male lead character. His character is grounded in the super unlucky trope, and it's ruining my life type of thing. He's very passive for most of the show and doesn't really have...any funny or exciting moments either. He's just whatever. I don't hate him but don't expect an interesting or engaging male lead character for this show.The female lead character, Shikimori, has been in a relationship with Izumi since the first episode. She's bright and fun and makes Izumi a tolerable character by saving him multiple times throughout the show. But she's not just a cutie, she's also super cool and serious at times. She's also just whatever. She's an average SOL female lead character without much going for her, but her dynamic with Izumi and the other characters ultimately saves the show.There's not much to say because it's your average slice-of-life anime with your average characters. It has funny moments sometimes, and the romance is there but I wanted more from our main characters. Izumi was far too passive for my tastes, but Shikimori helped balance him out, which made it a cute and fun show to watch. You can tell from the premise of the show and from the first couple of episodes that it's nothing serious, or even that great, but it wasn't a bad show. But if you want good characters, maybe you should look somewhere else because everyone here is pretty average.The story and plot, I'll say are a 4-5The animation, art, and music save this show.

I like how the colors of the characters represent their personalities, or the personalities that they want to be. Like Shikimori is pink because she wants to be a cute girl,...and Izumi is purple because he’s shy.The premise of the show is unique in that it’s the girl that’s is the dominant one in the relationship.

Overall if your in the search of wholesomeness I strongly recommend this."", ""This series is best described as being very WHOLESOME. Actually, I was under the impression that this anime would just be a mid\xa0series, but it much exceeded my expectations. The main couples are perfect for one another, and the supporting cast who I initially thought would be bland turns out to be one of the liveliest groups of characters. The animation is also excellent, especially the op, which is also extremely good. This would be one of my top 10 best op, if I had one.As you can see, Izumi's misfortune was the more focus\xa0of the first and second episodes, and Shikimori was always there...to help him. Izumi's misfortune caused him to be too miserable in the first two episodes, but later on, it was toned down, which I'm glad they did since it also allowed me to enjoy the entire series. It would have absolutely destroyed the entire anime if they had continued to treat him poorly from the beginning to the finish, so it's a good thing that didn't happen. Izumi's misfortune may also work in his favor; for example, in the\xa0last\xa0episode, the waiter accidentally gave to the other customer the table reservation they had requested, so they were put at a different table, which turned out to be an upgrade from the one they had originally requested. The worst bad luck scenes only occur in episodes 1 and 2.So let's get started with the best thing this series has to offer. One of them is that, unlike most rom-coms, this one begins with them already dating. In most rom-coms, dating happens after two or three seasons, with the focus on how the MC and FMC get to know one another and the development of their characters growth. However, in this one, since they are dating, it mostly focuses on their romantic interactions. Additionally, I really appreciate how most of their romantic moments are shown as being realistic. Simple things like walking home together, talking on the phone, going out, having one-on-one conversations, comforting one another, and providing relationship assurance on the moment. Simple details like this all contribute to being realisitc. I also particularly enjoy the serious moments in these series when they are just the two of them. During these times, they talk about those stuffs that couples do talk while they are dating rather than ones that would drive the plot.Let's now explore the other characters. Their circle of friends is made up of good and funny people. It's enjoyable to see Hachimitsu, Nekozaki, Inuzuka, Izumi, and Shikimori interact since they have great chemistry. Here, neither excessive fighting nor borderline toxicity exist. There is also that one episode about a sports festival that focuses on friendships and character growth, and I really enjoyed that episode. It's incredibly entertaining to watch them put forth extra effort for their friends. Additionally, the families of the two major characters are wonderful people who are supportive of them. So, very wholesome indeedThe love triangle scenario or the introduction of a new character who ends up liking the main character also happen in this series. Kamiya, a popular girl who is somewhat at ease with someone like Izumi, finds herself falling for him. Unfortunately for her, the person she likes is already dating someone else. Really beautifully written and executed, that arc. Kamiya's feelings are being so beautifully portrayed. She is also kind of cursing herself for liking the guy and asking why they shouldn't simply be friends, and she feels as like he is betraying the person she likes. Shikimori then appears and helps her in moving on. Shikimori compliments Kamiya on her kindness after conveying to her that kamiya\xa0is sacrificing her feelings for the sake of their relationship.\xa0Shikimori comforts Kamiya with a hug as Kamiya begins to move on as well. Without a doubt, that scene and the smart word choice were well done. \xa0In other anime, adding a new love interest is typically done to spice up the relationship, but it can also be unnecessary and a waste of screen time. Other times, the added love interest is later rejected, leaving us viewers feeling very sad about it. Other times, the added girl would continue to pursue the guy even after being rejected. However, it was handled nicely in this anime, and it was quite moving and emotional.Next, let's talk about the male protagonist. Since this is sort of a reversed shoujo series, it makes sense for him to have a feminine appeal. People criticizing the show because of izumi for being weak, which is untrue. He has dealt with his bad luck since birth and survived in many situations. There is also an episode where he ends up carrying Shikimori on his back up a hill so they can watch the fireworks there, and he also proves that he is stronger than what he appears to be during the cavalry in the sports fest. Izumi is an average boy; he is neither weak nor dense like the other mc. He is not your typical mc who is useless. He doesn't stutter while speaking to girls, nor is he socially awkward. Even still, shikimori is the major reason for his blushing, not other girls. Thus, he is a totally respectable MC.Let's now review the main couple's relationship. Their relationship is truly ideal for one other, and their together times are also quite sweet but not to the point where they make you get diabetes lol, the\xa0anime really does a good job of portraying their relationship. They are an innocent couple, which is not awkward either, so they do, in fact, have the ideal relationship, as well as a normal one. The anime also showed how they first met and how Izumi asked Shikimori out,\xa0these two scenes stand as the most notable ones of their past. Izumi, who always suffers with his bad luck before ending up hoping for a hero to come to him, fits Shikimori's ideal guy as well who is handsome and kind. So both of their wishes were fulfilled. I also appreciate that their characters at least have some depth.So I don't see why I can't give this anime a 10 rating.Animation:10Op/ed:10Story:9Character:10Enjoyment:100/10But if you want some intense drama, you might not have to make yourself to watch this. This one has it, although it only occurs once\xa0or during those\xa0serious\xa0scenes; otherwise, the scenes are mostly nice. It features both realistic couple moments and idealitic friends and family. This is a simple, wholesome slice of life romcom. So try watching this anime if you want something more relaxed. to help him. Izumi's misfortune caused him to be too miserable in the first two episodes, but later on, it was toned down, which I'm glad they did since it also allowed me to enjoy the entire series. It would have absolutely destroyed the entire anime if they had continued to treat him poorly from the beginning to the finish, so it's a good thing that didn't happen. Izumi's misfortune may also work in his favor; for example, in the\xa0last\xa0episode, the waiter accidentally gave to the other customer the table reservation they had requested, so they were put at a different table, which turned out to be an upgrade from the one they had originally requested. The worst bad luck scenes only occur in episodes 1 and 2.So let's get started with the best thing this series has to offer. One of them is that, unlike most rom-coms, this one begins with them already dating. In most rom-coms, dating happens after two or three seasons, with the focus on how the MC and FMC get to know one another and the development of their characters growth. However, in this one, since they are dating, it mostly focuses on their romantic interactions. Additionally, I really appreciate how most of their romantic moments are shown as being realistic. Simple things like walking home together, talking on the phone, going out, having one-on-one conversations, comforting one another, and providing relationship assurance on the moment. Simple details like this all contribute to being realisitc. I also particularly enjoy the serious moments in these series when they are just the two of them. During these times, they talk about those stuffs that couples do talk while they are dating rather than ones that would drive the plot.Let's now explore the other characters. Their circle of friends is made up of good and funny people. It's enjoyable to see Hachimitsu, Nekozaki, Inuzuka, Izumi, and Shikimori interact since they have great chemistry. Here, neither excessive fighting nor borderline toxicity exist. There is also that one episode about a sports festival that focuses on friendships and character growth, and I really enjoyed that episode. It's incredibly entertaining to watch them put forth extra effort for their friends. Additionally, the families of the two major characters are wonderful people who are supportive of them. So, very wholesome indeedThe love triangle scenario or the introduction of a new character who ends up liking the main character also happen in this series. Kamiya, a popular girl who is somewhat at ease with someone like Izumi, finds herself falling for him. Unfortunately for her, the person she likes is already dating someone else. Really beautifully written and executed, that arc. Kamiya's feelings are being so beautifully portrayed. She is also kind of cursing herself for liking the guy and asking why they shouldn't simply be friends, and she feels as like he is betraying the person she likes. Shikimori then appears and helps her in moving on. Shikimori compliments Kamiya on her kindness after conveying to her that kamiya\xa0is sacrificing her feelings for the sake of their relationship.\xa0Shikimori comforts Kamiya with a hug as Kamiya begins to move on as well.

Shikimori, who is the supposed popular, pretty girl, who is perfect in every way.  While it's far from the amazing showing that I thought it would be after the first few episodes, it's still far from the disappointment that I'm hearing people say they believe it to be.Story & Characters: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie features Shikimori, who started dating Yuu Izumi at the start of their high school life.  The story of what pulled her in to start dating Izumi...gets explained a few episodes in, but these two are pretty hopelessly in love and are hesitant to show it, outside of hanging out with each other.  Together, they try and get through high school while Izumi's historically bad luck follows him everywhere.  Shikimori is so amazing that she's able to fight off half the things that come Izumi's way, while he just kind of accepts the beating that he takes with the other half.  Luckily, the series doesn't seem to zone in on this unlucky side of him completely, but instead, tries to let us know how he's trying to change his own luck.  Is one adventure any more safe for him than the next, and, will the couple's next date go as planned?  These are the two questions the series is basically seeking to ask through this season.Shikimori is such a strong willed character, and easily my favourite part of this series.  She's athletic, pretty and refuses to let anyone talk down on her boyfriend.  You always appreciate series like this that shows how the female is the stronger character of the couple, as it goes against the grain of what is typically shown - especially because Japan has a thing for showing shy, weak-willing girls.  She comes with multiple different personalities that you wouldn't believe is still her, and I loved it all.  Another feature that shows she's different?  She's a left, something rarely showed in anime these days.  Izumi is the unfortunate one who gets pretty much every shred of bad luck possible going his way, and everyone, including himself, knows it.  He tries so hard to impress Shikimori, even though she really doesn't ask for a ton in return, and that fact that she sees all this just makes her a better character to watch.  Izumi isn't dense, though, he does need some time to think things through before he arrives at an answer.  He's not the greatest character, but he's far from the worst.Their host of friends comprise of Shuu Inuzuka, Kyou Nekozaki, Yui Hachimitsu and Kamiya.  Inuzuka is Izumi's best bud and he's an entertaining watch.  Subtly making fun of people is probably where he shines, and he's always up for an adventure.  Nekozaki and Hachimitsu are mostly seen together all the time, though mostly act as observers - I didn't think much of them.  Kamiya has some pretty interesting storylines and makes the middle of the series a lot more fresh, as it was starting to slow down after the initial first few episodes.The storyline really shines at the start because we get to see how Shikimori and Izumi interact with each other, as well as the world, and even though this remains the case through much of the runtime, the episodes in the second half didn't feel quite as entertaining as the first half.  There could have been more elements added to their relationship, and mixing it up a little more would have gone a long way.  Kamiya's inclusion and her interactions with Nekozaki did help alleviate this a little bit, but seeing Inuzuka and Hachimitsu a little more involved would have added more to it.  Shikimori's brother, Fuji, is seen in a few episodes, and watching how he interacts with his sister is mildly amusing.  You do get an idea how Shikimori grew up, but again, I would have liked them to go a little deeper into this.  Keeping the plot fresh was clearly a point that I felt needed some work, but still, watching our main couple go out and try to be enjoy themselves is easily the highlight of this series.  (Story: 7/10, Characters: 7/10)Art: I've never really watching anything by Doga Kobo, the studio who worked on this series, before.  But it looks pretty consistent aside some minor blips in the latter few episodes.  I really liked what they did with the colouring for Izumi's eyes and Shikimori's hair, in particular.  (8/10)Sound: The OST did it's job here, accompanied by a strong OP and ED.  They all set the mood for the series quite well.  The voice cast was very strong, with lots of names I'm not familiar with - which seems to be a trend more and more as the individual anime seasons goes on.  Macy Anne Johnson (Shikimori) was fantastic here.  She sets a strong tone for who Shikimori is and the sudden mood changes are pulled off to perfection.  Similarly, Bryson Baugus (Izumi) portrayed Izumi's nervous, indecisive nature very well.  Clifford Chapin (Inuzuka) is pretty much the perfect person to voice Inuzuka - the match is just too perfect.  (9/10)Overall: Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie was an amazing watch - though I'd be lying if I would say that I have a soft spot for high school romance series, so I might be a tad biased.  It certainly does have a difficult time keeping up the momentum after an insanely strong start, but the overall product is a worthy watch still.  My understanding is that the studio changed some minor elements in the story that did hurt the series a little, but I'd still want to see more if another season were to air.

(8/10)"", 'Shikimori-san is an anime carried by its visuals. The animation is stunning at some points. A lot of episodes are filled with dialogue requiring less motion, but overall this show is a pleasure to look at showcasing the amount of effort that when into its creation. Story Wise: It\'s a ""Slice of Life"". There\'s truly only 1 character that had an impactful development. 90% of the cast are completely static, including the two lead roles for the most part. Outside of Shikimori-san herself the characters seem very low in the department of goals, dreams, and motivations. Other than funny quirks and personality traits, I don\'t...feel like we got to know enough about the characters thus limiting our attachment to the show. I still gave this show a 7 because it has an ability to suck you in. Many times I caught myself with a dump smile on my face. It\'s got a charm that, in combination with the flashy visuals, makes an enjoyable watch. feel like we got to know enough about the characters thus limiting our attachment to the show.

That said I kind of grew tired of it. Episode after episode same old thing happens, that is to say nothing.

It's one dimensional like that, entire thing.Moment where I got tired is around the time when am writing this review (episode 8). They are suppose to be in a relationship but nothing really happens or changes during this relationship. They are...too afraid to even hold hands after one year of going out.

At that point what's the difference between calling someone a friend or girlfriend?Overall it's a cute show which holds attention pretty well but you can't hope to see some  high art here. Just average run of the mill romcom with standard issue characters.

After that, the episodes quickly pick up in quality and character development. The anime follows a very predictable formula for the first 4 episodes: Izumi\'s bad luck strikes again, then Shikimori does something cool. Rinse and repeat.Once you get past that preliminary stage, Shikimori-san does what it does best: being a SOL romance anime that makes...you feel warm and good inside. Don\'t expect story development or anything like that, you\'re very well just following the daily lives of Izumi and Shikimori and seeing wholesome moments. The animation isn\'t anything too special, but the art style itself is colorful and eye-catching. Most importantly, it\'s very consistent and I don\'t remember any instances of bad art.CHARACTERSI\'ve seen people say the cast is great, but I disagree. I would actually say the cast is the weakest part of Shikimori-san, other than Kamiya who gets the most development. They aren\'t awful or anything, rather just average to slightly above average. The supporting cast have the problem of only getting one episode dedicated to their development, some characters even having to share half their episode with others.I actually liked Izumi. He is no way as pathetic as people make him out to be, especially in the later episodes, and I honestly don\'t understand the fascination with wanting a more masculine character because that\'s what the entire dynamic between Izumi and Shikimori is based around. His bad luck gimmick gets less attention as the anime goes on, which is a relief, but unfortunately that\'s all that stands out about Izumi. He\'s a generic shy anime boy with a heart of gold. I suppose that\'s better than writing a character so awful that you question how someone like Shikimori fell in love with him...(Minor spoilers for Shikimori\'s past ahead)Speaking of Shikimori, despite being the MC and my favorite character in the anime, I would argue she\'s one of the weakest character-wise out of the cast. The OP has flashback scenes that make it seem like Shikimori has a serious past, and it certainly doesn\'t help that the first few episodes play up Shikimori\'s ""toughness"" as something to hide. Instead, what we got was: Shikimori doesn\'t know what she wants to do (as a middle-schooler mind you), she follows her brother around, gets into karate and excels at it, and her friend recommends her a romance manga. She reads it and suddenly decides her entire personality will revolve around being cute and wanting her dream to love someone. Even for a SOL anime that\'s ridiculously weak. She\'s good at everything for literally no reason other than she was good at karate that one time.Part of this is my fault since I had mistakenly thought bandaged Izumi in the OP was a young Shikimori, and that the person confessing was someone else instead of Izumi cause the confession doesn\'t line up with Izumi\'s in the anime. I had assumed that as a child she was a tomboy who regularly got into fights with others, was a loner, had someone important to her, and she slowly became more feminine to escape her past. Still, I can\'t help but imagine if that was actually what her character was based around how much it would help her character\'s depth. That would explain her toughness way better and why she tries so hard to be seen as feminine and cute. The way it is, even if her ""coolness"" is certainly refreshing, it\'s poorly explained and she has little to no flaws other than being really competitive and slightly possessive. While I would not consider her a Mary Sue, she\'s waifu-bait, clean and simple.CONCLUSIONThe first 5 episodes did not help the reviews for this show. They make it seem like Shikimori-san is more predictable and tropey than it actually is, and I can understand why someone would not like the anime based off of those episodes. It\'s definitely not an anime for people expecting serious story, but for those that just want a feel-good anime, I would easily recommend this, you just have to stick through it. I genuinely think the anime can only go up from here, so it would sadden me if we never get a second season because of the low reviews. you feel warm and good inside. Don\'t expect story development or anything like that, you\'re very well just following the daily lives of Izumi and Shikimori and seeing wholesome moments. The animation isn\'t anything too special, but the art style itself is colorful and eye-catching.

I would actually say the cast is the weakest part of Shikimori-san, other than Kamiya who gets the most development. They aren\'t awful or anything, rather just average to slightly above average. The supporting cast have the problem of only getting one episode dedicated to their development, some characters even having to share half their episode with others.I actually liked Izumi. He is no way as pathetic as people make him out to be, especially in the later episodes, and I honestly don\'t understand the fascination with wanting a more masculine character because that\'s what the entire dynamic between Izumi and Shikimori is based around. His bad luck gimmick gets less attention as the anime goes on, which is a relief, but unfortunately that\'s all that stands out about Izumi. He\'s a generic shy anime boy with a heart of gold. I suppose that\'s better than writing a character so awful that you question how someone like Shikimori fell in love with him...(Minor spoilers for Shikimori\'s past ahead)Speaking of Shikimori, despite being the MC and my favorite character in the anime, I would argue she\'s one of the weakest character-wise out of the cast. The OP has flashback scenes that make it seem like Shikimori has a serious past, and it certainly doesn\'t help that the first few episodes play up Shikimori\'s ""toughness"" as something to hide. Instead, what we got was: Shikimori doesn\'t know what she wants to do (as a middle-schooler mind you), she follows her brother around, gets into karate and excels at it, and her friend recommends her a romance manga. She reads it and suddenly decides her entire personality will revolve around being cute and wanting her dream to love someone. Even for a SOL anime that\'s ridiculously weak. She\'s good at everything for literally no reason other than she was good at karate that one time.Part of this is my fault since I had mistakenly thought bandaged Izumi in the OP was a young Shikimori, and that the person confessing was someone else instead of Izumi cause the confession doesn\'t line up with Izumi\'s in the anime. I had assumed that as a child she was a tomboy who regularly got into fights with others, was a loner, had someone important to her, and she slowly became more feminine to escape her past. Still, I can\'t help but imagine if that was actually what her character was based around how much it would help her character\'s depth. That would explain her toughness way better and why she tries so hard to be seen as feminine and cute. The way it is, even if her ""coolness"" is certainly refreshing, it\'s poorly explained and she has little to no flaws other than being really competitive and slightly possessive. While I would not consider her a Mary Sue, she\'s waifu-bait, clean and simple.CONCLUSIONThe first 5 episodes did not help the reviews for this show. They make it seem like Shikimori-san is more predictable and tropey than it actually is, and I can understand why someone would not like the anime based off of those episodes. It\'s definitely not an anime for people expecting serious story, but for those that just want a feel-good anime, I would easily recommend this, you just have to stick through it. I genuinely think the anime can only go up from here, so it would sadden me if we never get a second season because of the low reviews.', ""As we saw from the first episode, we were introduced to the main characters, namely Izumi and Shikimori and we know that they are not just friends but they are dating. Well, from the first episode to the third episode, we are introduced to another character named Kamiya. a bit of a spoiler, I warn you once again, this is a spoiler so actually Kamiya already has feelings for Izumi but yes, beautiful Shikimori has preceded him hahaha then over time we have reached the eighth episode, finally here there is a conflict between Shikimori and Kamiya so they meet at The roof of our...school is shown by Kamiya who is thinking about his feelings for Izumi and then Shikimori comes to want to return the partner number he exchanged earlier, then actually the goal was not to return it but just wanted to say not to approach Izumi again, so that's a little explanation in the episode  8 school is shown by Kamiya who is thinking about his feelings for Izumi and then Shikimori comes to want to return the partner number he exchanged earlier, then actually the goal was not to return it but just wanted to say not to approach Izumi again, so that's a little explanation in the episode  8"", ""Let me start by saying this kind of anime is not normally what I would even consider watching. I have no idea how I even found it, but I was hooked before I even finished episode 1.To say I loved this anime is an understatement. The characters feel fleshed out and you can only want what the two main characters have. The female lead, Shikimori, is not just a damsel in distress far from it in-fact.

If you're someone who cannot possibly stand a woman being a dominant figure in a relationship. If her spouse is shy and awkward and you find that to be ultimately too cringeworthy to possibly comprehend, then this isn't the show for you. As you have probably noticed from the countless reviews from people who are enraged by this, The general thoughts for this show are not only on MAL. On twitter, youtube, anilist or just about any corner of the internet, Shikimori is referred to as...'mid'.Why is this?My theory for why this anime had such a dramatic backlash from the community is because of the reputation the manga held as a highly rated romance manga. On sites like MAL and all social media, there has been a big influx of elitists, especially since covid as more people got into anime, so obviously there'll be more new, pickier fans, especially on seasonals. When the first couple episodes aired, more picky fans went into this anime expecting something special. This show is a lighthearted slice of life that fans of the manga enjoyed exactly for that reason (hence its high rating). So when people who are not interested in that watch it and cringe at some of the scenes in the first couple episodes, they are ultimately disappointed. It also doesn't help that Dress Up Darling got an adaptation the season before. Which handled the shy male main character much better.However, if you're like me and enjoy watching cute anime and are easily pleased, it's entertaining. This anime and manga is a wholesome, fun, and simple trip for anyone open to enjoying it. There's so much anime rated much higher than this with much more questionable morals than 'The man isn't a chad'.At the end of the day, don't watch a show you know you're not going to like. What the hell were you expecting? It's a cute but average show, but I recommend it to those who are interested.

No, this will not happen and this doesn\'t exist.It\'s just a story of a useless clumsy unlucky boring dude with no personality (the Kirito inverse) who is been protected by a cool pretty popular strong girl, mixed with weak romance and ZERO chemistry between the two.

I assumed it would have been nice to read the manga, so I went on and did.

I want to preface this review by acknowledging that I had high expectations heading in with all the buzz the show got prior to release and even drawing comparisons to Bisque Doll with fans claiming Shikimori-san will dethrone Marin Kitagawa. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met at all as Shikimori-san proves to be a bland showing.STORY: 6/10The core plot of Shikimori-san is actually quite unique. You have a soft boy who is seemingly perpetually cursed with bad favor and his wonderful and all powerful girlfriend...that loves him and protects him from all harm. It's an archetype that I feel I haven't seen before and yet the entire show still feels bland and lacks actual purpose. The running gag/theme of Izumi being clumsy and always falling into trouble gets old quickly and so does Shikimori's badass and cool nature. The show progresses but there feels no progress at all. I feel that we have the same exact characters that we had during the very first episode until the very last. The bit of Izumi being clumsy and Shikimori being cool fails to be a strong center point that offers an overarching goal similar to that of Bisque Doll's cosplay theme or even Komi-san's goal to make 100 friends.ART & SOUND: 8.5/10If there's one thing I have to commend Shikimori-san for, it has to be its art. I absolutely love its vibrant colors and artstyle and it single handedly brings life to a dull world. The various contrasting colors of each character is a treat to the eyes, and speaking of eyes, so much detail is given to each character's design down to their pupils. Animation is consistently smooth and very crisp. For an underwhelming show, this is one area that it was able to stick the landing.CHARACTERS: 5.5/10Now to talk about the characters of Shikimori-san. Where do I even begin. With Shikimori-san's unique plot and wonderful visuals, you would think it would be an enjoyable romcom series, but it lacks the vital crux of any decent show: characters to care about. I won't even pick on Izumi too much in this review. Yes, he has been a point of heated discussion among the community with most being unable to stand his weak and soft nature. I am personally fine with that, I find nothing wrong with it and even find it interesting and unique. However, the problem is that much like many of the characters in this show, he has personality but no identity. I feel that each character has their unique traits and characteristics, but they all lack a sense of personality that makes them memorable and makes them a character that the viewer can resonate with and care about. Yes, this sentiment of mine extends even to the titular Shikimori. She is unable to provide anything that sets her apart from your traditional anime waifu and she comes out bland and dull, even for the main character that is supposed to carry this show the way Marin and Komi-san carries their respective shows. Additionally, there's just a lack of chemistry between Shikimori and Izumi. For the main duo, they lack the chemistry that provides excitement and something to cheer for. I understand that they are going for the awkward stage vibe especially with their contrasting personalities, but it isn't executed well. For a romance with weak chemistry that works, I suggest checking out Tsuki ga Kirrei. It's able to tell a love story with minimal chemistry while showcasing young and awkward love.I honestly have a hard time trying to find the right words to express what I feel for these characters or rather the lack of feeling. They all just lack something for me to cheer for or care about. All except one, I guess. Kamiya-san singlehandedly resurrected my little interest for this show when she appeared. We were finally presented with a character with heartfelt motives and genuine conflict. In her little screentime, I can easily say that the episodes she was in were my absolute favorites. She is the sole reason the score does not go any lower.ENJOYMENT: 7/10With its dull characters and plot that misses the mark, Shikimori-san still had its enjoyable moments. Aside from literally every second Kamiya-san is shown on screen, moments like the fireworks at the festival or the scene in the gondola are able to provide a short-lived and much needed spark. At the end of the day, though, Shikimori-san was not a show I was really looking forward to or excited about each week as every episode was mostly more of the same.OVERALL: 6.5/10Coming in with high expectations, Shikimori-san was unable to meet them except on the visual aspect. Everything is dull and bland with nothing special especially during a time with great romcoms like Bisque Doll, Komi-san, and Kaguya-sama.

But by starting the series with the two characters already in a relationship, Shikimori can instead dedicate time to portraying the euphoria of being in love.And that's basically what Episode 12 involves. Twenty minutes of pure joy. In a way, it actually makes this a difficult episode to review....If I put it down to words, it's very straightforward: Izumi and Shikimori go to a faux-Disneyland and have a lovely time. When Shikimori asks if they can kiss, he misunderstands. Later, he kisses her on the cheek and she's happy about it.There's no particular ongoing drama, and there's actually less focus on comedy than usual. Instead, what we get are just a series of heartwarming moments. It's fun watching them be in love with each other, whether that's in a ridiculously long line, in a surprisingly fancy restaurant, or during an intimate boat ride. Shikimori skips the fluff and has them say lines like “You're all I'm ever looking at” and “I'm in love with you, Shikimori. I'll stay with you forever” to each other.Of course, it is funny that they're so madly in love with each other but still consider the act of kissing each other to be so embarrassing. It's clearly not an issue of not knowing each other's feelings—it's very clear that they both want to kiss. But I guess they have to hold something back from the audience.This may be a short review for the series finale, but there really isn't much to say. While I've made it clear before that I wasn't too impressed with the early episodes (which I think is why I've seen a lot of people calling the show “mid”), Shikimori found its footing halfway in with some surprisingly strong drama. Izumi being unlucky is only funny for a short while, but the writing flourishes the moment these characters are taken seriously.I will miss Shikimori. A COVID outbreak at Doga Kobo made for a rockier production than the team would've liked, but they've still put together a visual spectacle. With today's digital landscape, it's difficult to say if the show's been successful enough for them to consider a second season, but I hope they do. Or, at least, I hope there are more romance anime like Shikimori that are prepared to commit to this same kind of euphoria.

It stayed visually appealing from start to finish. The characters were all loveable, some were relatable and overall impacted the story in their own unique way. Musically, I enjoyed the anime's opening and ending songs but the opening had a fun take on showing off the two main characters, Shikimori and Izumi.The place where it lacked the most was the storyline. At first, I had mixed feelings about this anime. I felt it was a bit too cliche for my liking but then I came to enjoy the characters and the overall happy vibes...that the anime held mostly throughout. If you are looking for a saucy romance anime, look in another direction. But if you enjoy easy, heartwarming anime then I would advise that you take a look at this. that the anime held mostly throughout.

But what mattered was ""Did I enjoy"" and heck yea I did.It\'s your average rom-com in which they have tried to add some spice or something but have failed to make a mid-tier romance anime.Some moments were actually cute but some others were just... damn, how can a rom-com trigger me so fricking much.

I've seen reviews saying this is generic and too simple for them but the simplicity is one of the most significant reasons I love it. It's been a while since I've seen a simple, slice of life, romance anime with an art style I really like (especially in the manga). However, people like different things so I get where the bad reviews come from. I'm just simple and really enjoyed seeing simple characters be happy lmao. I truly think it's not...necessary for these shows to have insane character development with insane plot and nuance for a show to be enjoyable or even good.

But this was the first time I can't watch it any further.Story is not good, dialogue feels very slow paced, characters feel unreasonable at times and too much cringe.Only things good about this anime are the opening, art style and Shikimori's looks.The scene where they make a line for shaking hands with Shikimori and Neko for winning Volleyball was so cringe it was unbearable.The main character is bland. The relationship between the both is certainly unique but not executed well. "", 'Disclaimer: I haven\'t read the source material (and probably won\'t), I rate this show solely based of the anime. I don\'t know how good or bad the manga is. Also, this review may contain spoilers, so if you don\'t want to get spoiled, try to avoid this review.Unlike others, who came into this anime because of hype, I came into this series without any expectations. I simply watched trailers and read the synopsis and gave the series a fair shot.Let me tell you this, despite having 0 expectations, I was still disappointed. Me being disappointed is something that rarely happens, considering that my...standard for ""good"" anime is extremely low (I rate almost all the shows I watch an 8 or higher).So, let me explain why I dislike Shikimori\'s Not Just A Cutie.Story(4): Shikimori\'s Not Just A Cutie is about a cute, cool girl named Shikimori and her weak feminine boyfriend Izumi. I personally don\'t mind the roles of a weak girl and a cool boy being swapped, but specifically for this show, it is poorly written in my honest opinion. Izumi is the victim of bad luck, which is the reason why he\'s considered being weak. The problem with his bad luck though, is that majority of the bad luck that is happening isn\'t even bad luck.Some examples:- Bowling: Izumi doesn\'t hit the pins with the bowling ball --> ""bad luck""- Football/soccer --> Izumi sucks at shooting a ball, ends up tripping because of it --> ""bad luck""- Izumi not paying attention to his surroundings, what causes him to either trip, get hit by items such as stuffed animals, tree branches, etc. and him almost being hit by a car --> ""bad luck""- Izumi not knowing whether a certain surface is possible to firmly stand on, which causes him to slip --> ""bad luck""- Izumi getting sunburnt --> ""bad luck""- An exam ticket slipping out of Izumi\'s hands while there is a lot of wind, because he wasn\'t holding onto it tightly enough --> ""bad luck""Izumi just blames everything on bad luck while most of these examples can just be prevented with simply thinking better/paying more attention, getting actually good at sports and putting on sunscreen creme. This bad luck gets so out of hand that Izumi blames even a power outage while being in a theme park, which can happen to anyone, on his bad luck. If Izumi actually had bad luck, a power outage would\'ve happened anywhere, not just on a theme park.For a 12 episode slice of life show, this show has awfully a lot of sports episodes. We had a volleyball episode, we had two basketball episodes, we had a swimming episode, we had a sports festival episode, we had an episode with karate in it and we had a bowling episode.  7/12 had sports in it. How original. I personally like sports, but using it this much in a slice of life romance show is just a big no.This show contradicts itself. The show is called Shikimori\'s Not Just A Cutie and the show tries its best to make Shikimori look cool, but Shikimori\'s goal in life is being nothing more than a cute girl.Where\'s the comedy of this romcom slice of life show? Just like my standard for good anime, my standard for comedy is also extremely low yet I haven\'t laughed even once. The bad luck gimmick had given so much opportunities to have tons of comedic scenes, but lots of them were missed. With the bowling game, Izumi could\'ve thrown the bowling ball accidentally in the ceiling for example (it did not happen) and then falling on his feet. I don\'t wish Izumi harm, but pain is an easy (and maybe generic) way of getting laughs. Shikimori saving Izumi also causes the prevention of a lot of comedic scenes from happening (Shikimori saving Izumi from a car isn\'t one of them).Art(8): The art of this show is really good. The artstyle makes me think of bubblegum somehow. For one this artstyle could be seen as generic, but I love it. Doga Koba is a great studio when it comes to animation. I rate this category an 8 instead of a 10, because I feel like it is missing something, but I don\'t know what.Sound(7):I\'ll split this category up in 2 sub-categories:- Opening and Ending theme (9): The songs of the OP and ED are very catchy, grab your attention,make you excited. The only negative thing I have to say about the OP and ED is that the songs aren\'t really my style. While they are good and enjoyable, it is not like I would listen to them on a daily basis.- OST(5): OST is an important factor in order to make someone enjoy a show. No matter how good or bad a certain story is, people can still like a show if the OST is good. Good OST draws you into the story and makes you feel what the characters feel. The OST made me feel nothing.Characters(5):Shikimori(8): Shikimori pretty much carries the show. She lives up to the title of the anime. She is cool, curious, helpful, jealous, kind, etc. which makes you actually care about her. She\'s behaving like any human being would behave: natural. There\'s one flaw with her though: Shikimori being depicted as the perfect girl makes the show at times quite predictable. With sports you just know she will win. Even when she\'s playing terrible, she\'ll win. With the volleyball game, for example: she was pretty much losing by a huge margin, but then at one point she touched her hair in a bad ass way and voila, she started carrying her team to the win.Izumi(4): Pretty much already explained in the story section: his bad luck is poorly written.The bad luck causes him to look like an idiot who doesn\'t know how to solve his problems.The side characters(Izuzuka, Hachimitsu, Kamiya, Nekozaki, etc.) (4): They are just there I guess.. They\'re just there to make Shikimori look better. The only side character I liked was Kamiya, she barely got any screen time, but of all the side characters she was the only one who didn\'t feel like an NPC.Enjoyment(5): Honestly quite a boring show in my opinion. It\'s is because of my curiosity that my enjoyment rating isn\'t lower and is the reason why I didn\'t drop this show.Overall I rate this show a 5. Despite that I quite like the romance, comedy and slice of life genres, this show is not for me. From an anime only perspective, I suggest reading the manga. It just feels to me that most of the problems I have with this show were caused by poor directing choices. Animation and the opening + ending sequence got prioritized over emotion and making the show interesting to watch.You, as reader, can agree or disagree with me, either way is fine, but keep in mind that everyone has their own opinion. We all should treat each other politely.Thank you for reading my review.

Just be prepared for easy going pace and some questionable character moments.Shikimori does a lot of things right where:(1) We have a couple who\'s relationship is respected by family, friends and acquaintances (i.e. no one is trying to break them up or sabotage)(2) The quality of animation is solid and on model nearly 90% of the time(3) Shikimori and Izumi have open communication which helps them avoid big fights, misunderstandings and conflictsPossible spoilers ahead!My issues lie with Shikimori herself and her character. Shikimori is very...""overprotective"" of Izumi due to his streak of bad luck but a lot of times I read this as possessive. Shikimori gets jealous when Izumi appears to be having fun without her and even sees his male best friend as a rival for Izumi\'s attention. Not huge red flags but definitely questionable. The most insane thing for me what how she confronted another classmate who appeared to like Izumi (though this girl did not confess or do anything inappropriate). The confrontation was calm and diplomatic even, but  it still left a bad taste in my mouth. However, this incident is remedied by a follow up episode of her and this girl becoming friends and leading to a possibility that she is shippable with her other female friend.  They also don\'t go to deeply into Izumi or Shikimori\'s backstories which according to the anime seemed to be (Izumi) ""I have bad luck and I want to stay away from others so they\'re not hurt"" and (Shikimori) ""I didn\'t know what I wanted to do until I read and shojo manga and decided I want to be a cute girl""Hopefully the manga is a bit better.EDIT: After reading more of the manga I will say that the show basically edited out all the sexual tension between Izumi and Shikimori and I think for a series about a couple this was desperately needed in the anime.

But what sets this particular romance anime apart is that they are already dating starting from the first episode. From all the romance anime I've watched I do love the story of how a couple gets together and seeing the different ways they woo each other. But it is so refreshing when the story starts out with them already together and you just get...to watch them be in love.The only disclaimer I would give is that this anime is very wholesome so if you're looking for some naughty vibes that My Dress-Up Darling gives off then you won't find them here. It's almost like a lighter-hearted version of Horimiya.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is such a feel-good anime with all likable characters that you get to see grow a little throughout the show.

Oh, and spoiler free.If you want to be reminded how maidenless you are and want to commit sudoku by giving yourself diabetes, watch this show. It's a simple, very sweet, very wholesome story about Izumi and Shikimori, two adorable characters who, unlike many romcom couples, are already in a relationship.Also unlike many romcoms, there isn't that much drama and conflict. Don't like love triangles and misunderstandings? This show is the one for you. I will say though, that the show is pretty slow and stress-free so if you're not...into these kinds of shows, I suggest romcoms such as Kaguya-sama and Rikei ga koi. If you are though, then enjoy.Now for the score, I was going to just give this show a 7 but Doga Kobo really brought their A game with the stellar art and animation, couple that with the wonderful OP and ED made me bump the score up to an 8. Regarding the OP and ED, while they might not be the number 1 OP and ED of Spring 2022 (those titles belong to Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and Bibitto Love respectively) they were catchy enough that it made watching the OP and ED a pleasant experience every episode. into these kinds of shows, I suggest romcoms such as Kaguya-sama and Rikei ga koi.

Now, this on it's own is nothing new, there have been plenty of attempts at this, but this one focuses on the good vibes, beginning with the pair already in a comfortable relationship.The two mains are charming, and their surrounding cast are supportive and friendly. To some, this lack of conflict is a problem, but as a war weary soul in the year of our lord 2022, I don't think gentle fluff is a problem. It is a...warm and relaxing watch, and having read the manga up to date as well, it continues to be so.If I have one major complaint, it's sound design is utterly forgettable. I love the OP and the ED is one of my favorites of the season for it's style, but the in episode soundtrack is the most forgettable background anime tracks you'll ever find. Voices are good, the rest of it, sort of plain. warm and relaxing watch, and having read the manga up to date as well, it continues to be so.If I have one major complaint, it's sound design is utterly forgettable.

Shikimori gets jealous/insecure whenever Izumi was around his male friend who got hit in the face with a soccer ball. Yes, she's pretty, protects her misfortune boyfriend, gorgeous, but she gets insecure/jealous whenever Izumi praises someone else, is amazed by others, thanks others, ect. Because of this I'm going to drop the series.Yes, Shikimori takes the role of how the male lead usually is, pretty, cool, athletic, sometimes blushes/shy, protects the love interest. None of that was a problem EXCEPT when Shikimori was...being unesissarily insecure/jealous. I understand that this is a teen school romance drama, but it was so unnecessary to add those negative qualities into Shikimori. Like bruh.Other points I didn't understand/questioned:I didn't understand why Izumi mother doesn't look a day over 19 with only a single wrinkle under her eye and no grey hair and skinny. And his father being fat and actually looking his age. It's almost like women are criticized and expected to be perfect and ageless even in their elder years. And if they aren't they are demonized, put down, labeled unattractive, ect. And of course it worse towards marginalized, disabled, and colored folk. Even though no women exist to simply BE attractive to the other sex/person.Notice how the father simply gets to age and look like a normal 50-60 year old man. Fat, graying and wrinkly. He just gets off the hook just like real men in society. And isn't demonized nor put down for those physical qualities. Men aren't, so women shouldn't be either.Another thing i noticed and took note in was that when and after Izumi lost his wallet again and coincidencedently met his parents walking back from thier date, Izumi's mother took all the dishes away and washed them, whilst Izumi went to sleep and his dad went to the bathroom. Which is another sexist/weaponized male incompetence thing I noticed. The dad and son should have cleaned up after themselves, it's the bare minimum, the bar is lower than hell and nonexistent.Now, I'm NOT shaming the real women in our world who get botox, dye their hair, use makeup, workout, get surgeries to fit the european/pedophic/racist/abelistic/fatphobic/colanizing beauty standards. The women doing all of that in order to simply be treated better by the scoundrels in our world, yes, no shame to them, if they see and feel that they should or want do anything they can to live easier, not a grain of shame towards them only love.I understand anime doesn't have to be realistic, but we seriously shouldn't add insecure, jealous,possessive characfer traits to our main lead girl, & negative harmful expectations of women to have european/pedophic/racist/abelistic/fatphobic/colanizing beauty standards. And the mom cleaning up after her husband and son when her son and husband should have cleaned up after themselves. Shikimori literally protecting Izumi everywhere was no problem. Shikimori being jealous/insecure when Izumi was simply admiring, thanking, someone. It just rubbed me wrong for a girl who was perfect in every other aspect. She didn't deserve to be written with that horrible negative quality trait of insecurity.10/10 beautiful art. Story 9/10. Characters personality 5/10. [For Shikimori's sake, she didn't have to be put down like that. I didn't like that Izumi and his father didn't clean up, nor wash up after themselves and instead went to the bathroom or slept which is sexist and weaponized male incompetence. Shikimori being insecure/jealous. For those reasons specifically, I'm dropping this anime, becuase I shall not be settling for this absurdity, especially in anime. ] if it wasn't for those reasons I would have enjoyed the series a bit more, but as you can see from my paragraphs it's not my cup of tea. being unesissarily insecure/jealous.

No, Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie is a weapon. A weapon designed to supplant all mass produced Waifus. A weapon designed to be a sleeper agent on all Otaku’s shelves of figurines. A weapon that can even surpass Metal Gear in its lethality. Yeah, this show feels like it was designed to house the perfect Waifu. By looking at the show before it aired, Shikmori looked liked the prime candidate to be best girl this season and potentially challenge Marin for the crown of best girl this year. While that is fine and dandy, you still...need to have an anime to go along with it and this is where I think the show falters.Sit back, relax and grab your popcorn for the annual “Best Waifu” debate as I present to you the anime review for Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie. Let’s beginStory: 3/10Our lead protagonist, Yuu Izumi has a case of bad luck syndrome as anything he does, bad luck will sure to follow and entering his second year in high school, he hopes his luck will change because of his girlfriend, Shikimori, being able to protect any harm coming his way. Along with the rest of their friend group, Kyou Nekozaki, Shuu Inuzaka and, Yui Hachimitsu, they enjoy the school life and with Shikimori around, Izumi hopes his bad fortune will change.That sets the basis for the show and how far the show goes plotwise. Yeah, there isn’t really much of an overarching plot here or any plot for that matter. We are dropped in the middle of Izumi’s and Shikimori’s relationship that is going swimmingly and they have a great group of friends. From there, it’s just going from one event to the next with nothing really getting added. There is nothing that makes the show feel different from the start to the show to when the show finishes. Izumi and Shikimori still love each other and they still have a great group of friends. All there is in between is how they get along. There isn’t really that moment that can make you believe that the state of their relationship is going to change. It stays the same throughout and that leads to the show feeling stale by the end. There is one part of the show that presents a possible love triangle but that doesn’t really go anywhere because that would go against the status quo that the show presents.That’s another problem with the show’s story, the status quo. It follows a lot of tropes you would expect from School Rom-Coms and seems to use many of the cliché episodes like the school festival and the sports festival. The main thing it doesn’t have is the beach episode but proceeds to have a substitute. While it does do these things right and with good execution, it just doesn’t try anything new. It just does everything we’ve come to expect and that’s a problem when they are trying to present Shikimori as this cute girlfriend who is also a badass and yet they don’t do anything exciting with it. They use what we expect them to use but tries to put Shikimori front and centre and make her the star of the show. Like I said, this anime feels designed to make Shikimori a standout character and maker her best girl of the year, let alone the season. They could’ve used her to make something feel more original, but it feels like we’re watching something we have seen before countless times in the rom-com genre. It seems like it wouldn’t matter if Shikimori ended up being best girl this season...so how do we break it to them?Characters: 3/10So we should start with Shikimori first since that’s the character this show wants to display first and foremost. She is presented as this girl who is cute but is also really cool as well and give us the best of both worlds. While She isn’t an absolute perfect girl since she can’t cook and is very competitive, they want to show that she can overcome any challenge thrown in her way, even with a bad luck magnet like Izumi. While that does make for good waifu material, as a character, it doesn’t look like she grows as a character. She remains near perfect from start to finish which itself is a problem because it never feels like she is trying to overcome something. They do show her beackstory where you could say she is overcoming something but since that is set in the past, we already know the outcome. Again, it feels like this character is designed to be best girl and the ironic thing is that I don’t think she is close to best girl this season. You’ve got the other best girl candidates from previous years, Chika, Kaguya, Hayasaka, Raphtalia (quality of season two not withstanding), Komi and Kurumi. But this season, you have Anya and Yor Forger from Spy x Family, Ushio from Summertime Render, Desumi from Love after World Domination and others like Aharen and Eiko. She is among the candidates but I don’t think she is a serious contender because the majority of these characters here have something to overcome whereas we know she can always overcome anything thrown at her. Her only obstacle would be combating Izumi’s bad luck. Speaking of which, let’s talk about him and their relationship.I would consider Izumi to be a wet blanket of a protagonist. Just a sweet, nice guy with no naughty intentions and wants to just be a great boyfriend for Shikimori. But he is a bit of a fumbler and just too sweet of a guy. He just doesn’t have any characteristics that make him interesting as it feels like he is a one note character with one defining aspect to his character, his constant bad luck and how it affects his day to day life. Without this aspect, he is basically like every other nice guy school protagonist but lacks a thing called a spine to be a bit more tough instead of being, like I said earlier, a wet blanket. His bad luck is mainly used as a plot device though for two reasons. One, the comedy and two, to make Shikimori look cooler when she protects him. While it is quite amusing to start with, over time, it just becomes tedious. It’s like how you expect Shikimori to overcome every obstacle, you expect Izumi’s bad luck to strike whenever he tries to do something. Both become very predictable and your interest starts to dissipate and you know that these will counteract each other so it will make them less significant than the show wants it to be.Then there is their relationship with one another which honestly feels artificial. There just doesn’t seem to be any chemistry between these two and while we are told why Shikimori likes Izumi, it doesn’t change the fact that what we have on screen is not working. It just only gives context to their relationship. We start the show in the middle of their relationship but it fails to make us invest into their relationship. It doesn’t feel like a relationship where they are equals. It feels like a relationship between a mother protecting her son. They don’t grow from being with one another, they still act the same and their feelings haven’t changed for one another. There’s barely anything to challenge their relationship in this show. Izumi just feels like a plot device in this relationship to make Shikimori look cooler, so they stuck these two together in a relationship but with none of the setup or natural chemistry to make these characters want to be together.As for the rest of the cast, there isn’t really much to say as they act like one note supporting characters you’ve come to expect and much like our two main leads, they don’t grow as characters. The main group of friends are just there to fill the friendship group quota. They can add some different dynamic to the situation and they do get their own time in the spotlight, but they are so underdeveloped that giving them their own time to shine doesn’t work. There chemistry with one another though is ironically better than Izumi and Shikimori’s chemistry and does do a solid job of making this friendship between these people feel believable.Animation: 8/10Well that was a lot of negativity, let’s talk about something positive. The animation for this series is actually good, particularly with the show’s photography. The show does a good job of capturing the right moment to showcase how cool Shikimori is. If you are going to illustrate how cool she is, you need to make sure that you nail how you display it and in that aspect, the show does it well with the animation itself being able to capitalise on it effectively. In terms of character designs, they do an alright job of making sure that the important characters stand out, despite that they have a stereotypical look to them. So they do their best to spice it up a bit to make them look more unique from their rather stereotypical designs.Sound: 5.5/10The soundtrack for this series is okay but I didn’t really pay much attention to it due to it sounding simple and standard. It mainly uses a combination of traditional and electronic pianos (played separately from one another) as well as violins. The usual instruments in romance shows. Compared to other shows, it just doesn’t have the same pull, especially when it is trying to ramp up the emotion but it fails to leave an impact. There were only a couple of times I felt it succeeded but not by much.  Ironically, it felt doing the trope thing when it came to the show’s music as well when you think about it. They do the standard thing that they know works but don’t put effort in to make it feel original.The opening is the main bright spot in the sound department. ""Honey Jet Coaster” by Nasuo☆ feels colourful, vibrant and has more energy put into making it feel creative than the entire show. It wants to showcase the relationship between Izumi and Shikimori by doing these different things to hammer the message home. Disregarding the problems with their relationship, I think the opening does it well. I main critique is that it can feel like the opening is going too fast and not giving it the visuals to breathe. But other than that, it’s a good opening.The ED as well is fun to watch with the art style and video game-esque aesthetic. Titled, ""Route BLUE"" by Yuki Nakashima, is even more colourful than the OP but less vibrant. Through it’s video game vibes, it showcases the lengths Shikimori will go to to protect Izumi from any bad things that get in his way. The visuals are the best thing about this ED and unlike following the status quo where it would probably be a slide show, they put a lot of effort in. Like the OP, it’s also good.ConclusionShikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie is not a show I hated nor was it a show that I got tired of watching, it’s just a show that felt like it didn’t try to do anything new. It’s a show that felt designed to showcase the best girl of the season and it didn’t feel like they succeeded. Most of the time, you are only as good as the show itself and with the tropy as hell story, underdeveloped characters, a relationship that doesn’t feel believable and a forgettable soundtrack, it just leaves the series feeling bare and uninspiring. The only bright spots were the animation and the OP and ED, that’s it really. Sure Shikimori is a nice character but forcing us to go vote for her being best girl and being so blatantly obvious about it though when compared to everything else about this show makes it less convincing. Very few characters are able to rise above how poor their shows are and Shikimori is a character that really tries to but can’t succeed.Again, its not a show I hated and not a show I got bored with. It’s just a show that felt like it needed something more than the standard. Instead, Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie is a waifu bait of show that does the bare minimum to make it passable not not enough to make me recommend it. Especially in a Spring and Summer season that had no shortage of Rom-coms, many which have more interesting premises, which makes this show feel worse by comparison. Watch it if you wish, just don’t expect anything that will make you wish for more.My Personal Enjoyment: 4.5/10Overall Score: 4.8/10 Recommendation: Don’t Bother need to have an anime to go along with it and this is where I think the show falters.Sit back, relax and grab your popcorn for the annual “Best Waifu” debate as I present to you the anime review for Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie.

Art is decent and characters are joyful to see. Full of colours, colored hairs, eyes overall it\'s a bright anime and it suits well the romcom genre so nothing to say about that.And... Well that was fast because I dont see any other decent things about it !Well, let\'s talk about the setup. It\'s obviously your random romcom. Everything is generic and random. The MC is the virgin dumb boy, he lives...in a random suburb house, he has the random mother that cares too much about him with the same seiyu every mother has in this genre. Shikimori is your random beautiful girl that every highschooler dream about in their highschool.Did you see those redflags ? That\'s what we see in the first 5 minutes. Sweet !Actually there\'s one original thing that surprised me : the MC ""suffers"" from his badluck. We quickly learn that he falls a lot, attracts birds to shit on him and so on.Indeed at first I was happy to discover one original thing ! How unpleased was I when I discovered that it\'s higly predictable and boring because the MC lives unlucky events every TWO F*CKING MINUTES !Worse than this, the girl basically acts as a mother. She protects the MC everytime over and over again. Hey i\'ve got a theory, I do believe that the MC is victim of bullying and that Shikimori secretly protects him punching the students that bully him. Honestly, in the first episode, his classmates laugh at him right in front of him as he dates a beautiful girl like that seeing how bad he is. What did our solid MC do ? He laughed back at them and roasted them about the fact that while they try to find excuses, he gets to sleep and do a lot of things with the most beautiful girl of the highschool !No it was a joke he just laughed with them like an idiot with an anxious laugh. And it leads us to the two main biggest issues with those fast food romcom. In a good anime, the story would be about how the MC gets more confident over time and how he gets to learn taking care of himself without being in need of a second mother watching every of his footsteps at school.Here, it\'s not. There\'s no story, they just randomly go to random places triggering random cliche tropes in romcom : cinema, sports event, cleaning the blackboard and so on.I still dont understand how people can like animes where there\'s basically no story. Just random events. The MC is one of the biggest excuse as a man (as a human being overall let\'s be honest here) that exists ? Not important, his second mother will protect him till the end of his life ! Seriously what kind of lesson does this anime try to convey ?!Thus the second issue is an underlying issue : no story ? No character dev that\'s simple.The classic idiot MC ""It\'s ridiculous I cant protect myself !"" he says that every episode but he has never tried to change in 5 episodes. Yes yes yes.Shikimori ? ""dont worry MC you re strong enough"" and blah blah im too coward to be blunt with the man I love blah blah.Let\'s summarize that anime till now. Not funny ? Check. No story ? Check. No character dev ? Check. No message to convey ? Check.Now what if I tell you the romance is bad aswell.Firstly, we dont know how they ended up together which is... I dont know maybe a lil bit important to enhance our vision of their couple... Just sayinSecondly, even if it\'s not meant to be drama, is it really normal for a couple to live without any issues ? No arguments no question about their future nothing.I mean a sexfriend has a deeper relationship with her sex interest IRL than both of them have with each other. It seems that the author doesnt have anything to tell in his story so he could at least create a relatable relationship and their hardships to get closer over time.Im really fed up with those lazy people. ""Hey i want to do a manga, what currently works in this industry ? Cute girls ? Nice I\'m going to do a terrible manga with it\'s girl as a sole interest !""The most funny element about those animes is the fact I\'ve never given them a 1 out of 10 cuz the people making the anime save it from being pathetic with their work to make it beautiful to watch. in a random suburb house, he has the random mother that cares too much about him with the same seiyu every mother has in this genre. Shikimori is your random beautiful girl that every highschooler dream about in their highschool.Did you see those redflags ? That\'s what we see in the first 5 minutes. Sweet !Actually there\'s one original thing that surprised me : the MC ""suffers"" from his badluck. We quickly learn that he falls a lot, attracts birds to shit on him and so on.Indeed at first I was happy to discover one original thing ! How unpleased was I when I discovered that it\'s higly predictable and boring because the MC lives unlucky events every TWO F*CKING MINUTES !Worse than this, the girl basically acts as a mother. She protects the MC everytime over and over again.

Many of the episodes are episodic and while there is SOME development for the couple of the show, largely things stay the same throughout the anime\'s 12 episodes. The anime had 2 delays with it\'s episodes due to the staff getting sick with Covid, so this also meant a recap episode (not reviewing here) was made titled episode 6.5 and a special program for the 2nd delay where the JP VA for Shikimori-san and Izumi-san talked about the anime (I only...saw the first few minutes so cannot say what all it entails but atm this likely isn\'t even anime as its not got a page on MAL so think of it more as a BD special feature you rarely see and get these days where those who worked on the anime talk about it in interviews or features) Despite the staff getting sick, the anime never lost any of its style or charm for any part of it (Music, art, VA etc. etc.).The anime doesn\'t just focus on the featured couple, but on their friends and class mates too. Each episode is something new, I\'d however also argue with MAL that this isn\'t JUST a Romcom anime, as it\'s also very much a Slice of Life anime too which at the time of this review, the anime lacks this genre on its page. For what Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie has and does it does it very well, and sure the anime\'s art style (the eyes as you\'ve likely heard and seen does take getting used too, it\'s by no means bad, it actually makes the anime feel more alive and beautiful and this anime has some very pretty scenes throughout it. Looking back however, the anime does have its share of problems but most of these are not really the anime\'s fault or anyone\'s fault as its just doing it\'s job. The MAIN issue the anime has is, not much happens in the show that is note worthy, most of it is just fluff and that\'s ok, like i said it does its job VERY well. You might be surprised how much you might come to like some or all of the anime\'s characters. If however you don\'t like character interactions, seeing slice of life stuff, Romcom and want more in a story than all that i\'ve said this anime has to offer then, you\'ll likely find this anime boring or hate it as it\'s not suited to your tastes which is fine, like i said, this anime tells its story and it does so very well but its not for everyone.The music is largely for me, forgettable, while i liked parts of the OP (Mostly the last part of the song), I found myself skipping the OP song every time. I can\'t really recall the music that well in the anime itself but that might be a me thing) but it\'s the ED song that is TRULY note worthy. Its catchy as heck and I want that to be an actual mini game in a game! Seriously if nothing else, you should give the ED song a watch and listen, it\'s GREAT! Speaking of GREAT, some moments in the anime I adored and were GREAT imo. Also, shout out to Izumi\'s Mom whom, only got hotter as she aged. :) The one character in this anime that you LIKELY have seen already though is... Blue/Gary from Pokemon! No he\'s not ACTUALLY here, but the resemblance is basically they\'re the same character, appearance wise anyway cept Inuzuka here has a fang sticking out of his mouth. This took me time to get used to seeing him as I at first was just seeing Blue/Gary lol however their personality is not the same and he\'s a really great guy and friend.I never found anyone in the name to be annoying or awful or even bad. I don\'t dislike anyone in the anime, every character is someone whom I like even if just a little for some. I also like the roles and personality that each character played and has, including and especially Shikimori-san and Izumi-san, the two really do compliment each other and it was great watching them. If you\'ve heard anything negative about the anime or it\'s characters then it\'s likely been blown out of proportion and is untrue, and likely filled with bias to boot as for some reason people who watched this anime were comparing it to My Dress up Darling? Like, WHY!? The two are not even the same AT ALL! My Dress Up Darling doesn\'t even HAVE much romance and the MC aren\'t in a relationship either and it\'s about Hinatsu Dolls, Cosplay and slice of life stuff and it\'s a great anime and should be watched for sure (And ironically, it TOO got shitted on for NO reason and got bias... HMMM, am wondering if this is where those fans went too...) When you watch an anime you should not let another SINGLE anime (or a handful of anime) affect how you feel about another anime. Doing so leads to disappointment and bias (Like what happened here). The ONLY TIME you should EVER let other anime influence your feelings is by the amount of type of an anime genre/theme you\'ve seen as that is what helps you to better make proper, fair, unbiased judgements and is a fair way to let your enjoyment also reach it\'s max as this way you\'ll only be comparing other genres and themes to what you saw already, case in point I\'ve seen a TON of ecchi anime, seen the same old tiring tropes and jokes and it\'s great when i find one that isn\'t the same ol same old.But enough about that, I apologize but it needed to be said seeing as the community is hating on the anime Shikimori-san for no real reason. I promise you it\'s not THAT bad, it\'s just average to slightly above average at best. I also find it note worthy that the anime is rated at the time of this review a 6.96 with 91,382 users having rated it yet the manga which started 3 years before the anime is rated a 7.76 with 15,750 users having rated it. I mention this to further point out the bias I spoke of moments ago. (Full disclosure, i have not read the manga so dunno what else is to come and that might be why its higher but I honestly don\'t believe so)Ultimately Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie is a average to slightly above average anime, it might be worth your time if you like seeing the stuff I mentioned in the anime, but might not if you don\'t. I rate the anime a 7.5 out of 10 and give it a Love score of 7.0. The reason for the slightly lower love score there is due to episode 12 and full disclosure, this is where you need to stop reading if you wish to remain unspoiled, the anime since I like it and mostly enjoyed it, should not be spoiled so last chance to back out.Sadly episode 12 had the NEAR PERFECT set up, it was GREAT! The romance was off the charts, it was great seeing the couple hanging out on their date, everything was leading up to the BIGGEST MOMENT in the entire series where SIGNIFICANT progress for the couple would be achieved, a step forward (Which they\'d had 1 step forward prior to this point so yes there WAS some romance development but it wasn\'t that much and imo, not that great and kinda just borin for the step they did take...) and at the end, Izumi-san... kisses Shikimori-san...ON THE FREAKING CHEEK! ... Like, that was THE biggest let down AND the BIGGEST mistake the anime has period, end of story. It was made worse by the fact the boat rocked and Shikimori-san fell down into Izumi-san\'s lap, typically this is when either two things would happen, one, they accidentally kiss or two, they stare into each other\'s eyes and kiss. NONE OF THAT happened here and instead we get the third route being a ""let me stay like this"" moment. The date ends there and we fast forward to the next day where Shikimori-san\'s friends are questioning her at school, doing a police interrogation skit because they know some new development (BWAHAHA... ;-;) happened between her and Izumi-san as it was clearly written on her face something had and her lies were obvious. Finally Shikimori-san tells the two they kissed and the girls freak out, then she reveals it was on the cheek and their reaction MIRRORED my own. Their interest drained, their investment gone, their mood gone and their eyes soulless. This whole skit, while ironic and trying to be humorous and despite mirroring how invested I was and showing how DISAPPOINTED I WAS that it was JUST on the freaking CHEEK, does NOT justify the betrayal and TROLL MOVE the anime did at the end here and this is WHY I rated it lower than the anime\'s score, because some of my enjoyment got lost there and that\'s not cool what they did, it\'s also the CLASSIC cop out move you see TIME AND AGAIN in 99% of any anime with romance. Just as that waiter who RUDELY interrupted their date in the restaurant is another classic cop out. Its wrong, its annoying and this trend NEEDS to DIE, NOW! ""Izumi-san chickened out.""  -NekozakiIf Shikimori-san ever gets another season i sincerely hope it has ACTUAL romantic development, because while the slice of life stuff and fluff was great as was the romantic moments we saw, none of it makes the anime stand out and it sucks when there isn\'t any romantic progress, especially significant (Which stings even more given this is a COUPLE) so i hope we get it and it does away with the romance tropes S1 pulled. I\'d love a S2, but this anime for me if I had to pick other anime to get a S2 or another season of, would not be anywhere near my first pick. That doesn\'t mean its bad, far from it but there\'s other anime I\'ve been waiting for future seasons that are better. Still, hopefully Shikimori-san gets another season and hopefully it improves on what S1 got wrong. saw the first few minutes so cannot say what all it entails but atm this likely isn\'t even anime as its not got a page on MAL so think of it more as a BD special feature you rarely see and get these days where those who worked on the anime talk about it in interviews or features) Despite the staff getting sick, the anime never lost any of its style or charm for any part of it (Music, art, VA etc. etc.).The anime doesn\'t just focus on the featured couple, but on their friends and class mates too.

This isn’t to demean or undervalue the very clear amount of animation, facial expressions, and storyline that went into adapting this anime. If anything this works to it’s advantage. The only glaring difference between Shikimori-sam and any generic romcom is 2 distinct things: Role Reversal & exaggerated misfortune. These 2 elements are the most omnipresent thing in the show and I think that really highlights the cute relationship our two main characters have: they bounce off of eachothers ideas, have clear and distinguishable character flaws, and end episodes...with some kind of negotiated conflict resolution, for that I really like this anime and would recommend it if you want something that’s generic and not too out there for your tastes. with some kind of negotiated conflict resolution, for that I really like this anime and would recommend it if you want something that’s generic and not too out there for your tastes.', 'Sort of spoiler review(I don\'t talk about the main plots though)When I first heard of this show it sounded really interesting to me so I decided to watch it. Despite the interesting plot that the show provides it falls flat when delivered and at. I went to see why so many manga readers found it so enjoyable when I didn\'t. And I think the reason why it\'s so hard to watch. For one, it\'s the MC Izumi. Izumi pretty much has ""Murphy\'s Law"" where anything can go wrong to him, which makes an interesting plot but the execution is terrible. The show really characterizes...his trait to an extent where you literally cringe to death, such as in the very first scene where he just trips on a rock and we got to watch him say ""ouch"" for an unnecessary amount of time. I\'m also assuming why manga readers liked it so much was that you can bear his weakness at a pace and not shove it all together at once. Another difference from the source material is that it adapted a short form into a long form, so the show pretty much restructures the story in a way its sort of different from how it\'s presented. And that\'s another thing, the pacing of the show is pretty slow. I\'m not sure if it\'s because during the broadcast the studio had to temporarily shut down because of COVID. But you can the limited animation is at its limit at certain points of the show. Certain scenes seem extended for too long. Some characters seem to speak with a period. The titular character Shikimori is an alright character and I like how they flip the gender roles of what people normally see in a ""Strong Man, Weak Woman"" archetype. The side characters are honestly what saved the show for me. Genuinely more interesting than the titular character herself. Overall, if the plot really interests you then I strongly suggest just sticking to the manga it\'s adapted from. his trait to an extent where you literally cringe to death, such as in the very first scene where he just trips on a rock and we got to watch him say ""ouch"" for an unnecessary amount of time.

Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san can be summed as such: forced. Yes, forced is the right word to describe this series. Now, I\'ll explain why that is the word I used.Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is series with a premise of there being an ""ultimate waifu"" similar to My Dress Up Darling, only this time the main heroine (Shikimori) is not an otaku, but an athletic prodigy. Here in lies the flaw. You see, Shikimori is really good at just about anything physically demanding---in particular, sports related stuff. The problem is that nothing...about what she\'s good at per say, is natural. Anytime there is a scenario that involves something like running or whatever, she will instantly activate Super Saiyan (metaphorically) and do said scenario far beyond pro level. You might think that this is no big deal and that it\'s reasonable. Well, not quite because that\'s just Shikimori ON HER OWN.Of course, it wouldn\'t be a romance story with another lead, and in this case, it\'s Izumi. I\'ll get back to what I said about Shikimori because I will elaborate about Izumi first. Izumi is the typical super nice guy, but gets shy about anything actually romantic. This is not the bad part about him. What is the bad part is that the forced plot device of him being unlucky. When I say unlucky, I mean REALLY UNLUCKY. That is emphasized from beginning to end in this series. That is his defining trait. This is just unnecessary on so many levels because there is no reason why he needs to be unlucky. The author just used this to promote the ""cool waifu""...and this is what I\'m getting at.Shikimori in the story acts as the absolute flawless girlfriend, to which Izumi\'s unluckiness is rendered a non-issue when she\'s around him. Izumi can have his unluckiness so unnatural that there is a scenario where something like a tennis ball is going to hit his head, but if Shikimori is there, she will, using Super Saiyian reflexes, catch the ball without even turning her head. I kid you not, (without delving into specific details) there is a segment where a signpost is going to fall down onto Izumi\'s head without him noticing, but immediately Shikmori jumps, flip kicks the sign post, and falls down effortlessly---all before the signpost touched his head. This is episode 1. This isn\'t like a ""Holy Shit, is she an inhuman?"" thing or whatever, no it\'s meant to be taken as a given, like it\'s no big deal a typical highschool anime girl just kicked a signpost before falling onto someone...It is by this reason that I said that this series can be summed up by the word forced. There is not a single possible way the unluckiness (which is already stupid levels of forced for Izumi in this series) can be a problem if Shikimori is there to protect. Like Izumi\'s trait being unluckiness, Shikimori\'s trait is being ""cool."" I used cool in quotations because it\'s fucking forced throughout the series and it takes the immersion out of the story. This isn\'t cool.Oh and just for good measure, did I forget to mention that Shikimori is also the class idol? Yeah, just like Marin in My Dress Up Darling, everyone LOVES Shikimori. It\'s like no, you can\'t be an ultra beast in secret, everyone in the school needs to emphasize how perfect Shikimori is. It\'s tiring and gets in the way of the romance focus of Izumi and Shikimori... which admittedly does exist.And yeah that\'s really it. Shikimori is so over the top in ""coolness"" that it takes your engagement out of it. Izumi is the result of the author\'s crapped out plot device to further force Shikimori\'s ""coolness"". And lastly, there is no explanation for either how Shikimori is even physically capable of being so good at all of these things, or why Izumi has the unluckiness that he has.Even apart from all of that, barely anything happens. Yes, it has Slice of Life as a genre tag, but it\'s the typical stuff like sports festival or going to study together. That in it of itself isn\'t bad, but when coupled with what I stated about our two faces of the series? That just doesn\'t make up for it.Overall, it\'s a letdown. I advise you reading this, whoever you are, to please don\'t buy into the ""OMG best waifu"" hype. This will just make it worse. about what she\'s good at per say, is natural. Anytime there is a scenario that involves something like running or whatever, she will instantly activate Super Saiyan (metaphorically) and do said scenario far beyond pro level. You might think that this is no big deal and that it\'s reasonable.

The author just used this to promote the ""cool waifu""...and this is what I\'m getting at.Shikimori in the story acts as the absolute flawless girlfriend, to which Izumi\'s unluckiness is rendered a non-issue when she\'s around him. Izumi can have his unluckiness so unnatural that there is a scenario where something like a tennis ball is going to hit his head, but if Shikimori is there, she will, using Super Saiyian reflexes, catch the ball without even turning her head. I kid you not, (without delving into specific details) there is a segment where a signpost is going to fall down onto Izumi\'s head without him noticing, but immediately Shikmori jumps, flip kicks the sign post, and falls down effortlessly---all before the signpost touched his head. This is episode 1. This isn\'t like a ""Holy Shit, is she an inhuman?"" thing or whatever, no it\'s meant to be taken as a given, like it\'s no big deal a typical highschool anime girl just kicked a signpost before falling onto someone...It is by this reason that I said that this series can be summed up by the word forced. There is not a single possible way the unluckiness (which is already stupid levels of forced for Izumi in this series) can be a problem if Shikimori is there to protect. Like Izumi\'s trait being unluckiness, Shikimori\'s trait is being ""cool."" I used cool in quotations because it\'s fucking forced throughout the series and it takes the immersion out of the story. This isn\'t cool.Oh and just for good measure, did I forget to mention that Shikimori is also the class idol? Yeah, just like Marin in My Dress Up Darling, everyone LOVES Shikimori. It\'s like no, you can\'t be an ultra beast in secret, everyone in the school needs to emphasize how perfect Shikimori is. It\'s tiring and gets in the way of the romance focus of Izumi and Shikimori... which admittedly does exist.And yeah that\'s really it. Shikimori is so over the top in ""coolness"" that it takes your engagement out of it. Izumi is the result of the author\'s crapped out plot device to further force Shikimori\'s ""coolness"". And lastly, there is no explanation for either how Shikimori is even physically capable of being so good at all of these things, or why Izumi has the unluckiness that he has.Even apart from all of that, barely anything happens. Yes, it has Slice of Life as a genre tag, but it\'s the typical stuff like sports festival or going to study together. That in it of itself isn\'t bad, but when coupled with what I stated about our two faces of the series? That just doesn\'t make up for it.Overall, it\'s a letdown. I advise you reading this, whoever you are, to please don\'t buy into the ""OMG best waifu"" hype. This will just make it worse.', ""The story concept is interesting 6/10but one character makes it hard for me to watch it.I love the visual for this anime 8/10All the characters are interesting except Izumi Yuu 6/10Opening theme song 7/10Ending theme song 8/10...I know this anime about Shikimori as the Alpha-Female and Beta-Male love interest but Izumi Yuu is really annoying for me.

In this type of shows where it\'s basically a high school love story...and the plot is so similar there aren\'t many ways for a show to stand out from the rest, the best options for this are the characters and their dynamics, which I\'ll talk about in further in the review and the premise behind the whole show. The whole premise of this anime is that the main character has the ""law of murphy"" (basically he got max stats on bad luck and anything that could go wrong will go wrong) and then shikimori, his girlfriend, is not only cute but also cool and protective of him always helping him throughout his unlucky moments. It\'s important to note that, if you haven\'t noticed already from the whole premise, ""Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san"" is presenting a clear 180 reversal of gender roles where the woman is the one always protecting and looking after the man which is something that I don\'t particularly enjoy nor hate it was simply an aspect of the anime that didn\'t affect my overall enjoyment but I\'m aware of people who either disliked the anime or loved it even more due to this aspect so I thought it was noteworthy.Sound: This category is a bit weird to rate in slice of life shows since besides opening and ending songs there isn\'t any crazy fight scenes to showcase flabbergasting sound effects and the OST\'s are all pretty much in the same lane of every other slice of life. For the opening I actually didn\'t like it much at the beginning but it started to grow on me, it is still in the realm of the romcom/slice of life type of openings where it\'s simply wholesome and ""kawaii"" but at the same time I found it really unique from the others but I\'m unable to pinpoint the exact aspect that gives it this uniqueness. The ending is romcom 101(and almost all anime really) where it\'s a simple chill song to just vibe, calm down and relax so even though it\'s not necessarily bad it is forgettable in my opinion.Art: The animation was above average in my opinion especially for a slice of life with no fights, the art style was pleasing specially the character\'s eyes. Beside that there isn\'t anything else noteworthy in this category, no drops in quality and no specific highlights in any episode it was simply good quality animation.Characters: As I said before the main two ways an anime of this type has to stand out from the rest is the premise and the characters development and dynamics, with the characters being arguably more important since the initial curiosity for the premise quickly fades out once you start getting past the first couple episodes. With that said ""Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san"" unfortunately falls with many other slice of life shows under where I adore the side cast but don\'t particularly like the main characters. Shikimori is not a bad character and there is no specific aspect I dislike but I simply think she is the worse female character in the story, as for Izumi I personally disliked his character he is the typical air-headed, non-assertive main character that is simply going with the flow and most of the plot is driven by shikimori and the side cast, in some instances they try and make him a deep ""I\'m lonely and am afraid of making friends because of my unluckiness"" type character and then right after they make him a happy go lucky no matter the situation type character which in my opinion are two aspects of the character that are clashing with each other and although some might argue that it gives character depth and layers to Izumi I would simply say it was a failed attempt of doing just that. Hachimitsu is the comedic relief character in the side cast that seems to have such a different personality from the rest of the friend group so you wouldn\'t assume she would fit with them but actually fits perfectly, she is probably the one in the group with the least amount of character development and importance within the story between the five friends but I believe she did her role in the series perfectly as being a contrast to the rest of the group and I loved the episode that focused on her and her development. Nekozaki and Inuzuka (neko and Inu being cat and dog when translated) are respectively the best friends and right hands of each of the main characters, they are above all plot starters for the main characters for example Inuzuka giving Izumi the tickets or Nekozaki inviting Kamiya but they also have a bit of development on them, they didn\'t get a specific episode to develop each other but their development was sprinkled out throughout the whole series. Kamiya is basically the rival of Shikimori and is in my opinion the best character in the show, her personality is very likable, her development and depth is immaculate and her character as a whole is very relatable, in my opinion the best episodes in the show were the ones where they go into her character and she just has a level of writing into her character above all the other character in the show.Overall: The animation and art is above average, the soundtrack is the typical romance type songs but the opening is very unique and I\'ll definitely be hearing it outside of the anime. The premise is unique for a slice of life anime with the whole Murphy\'s law thing but it doesn\'t necessarily make it better or worse because of that (at least from my point of view). The characters are the main focus of shows like this and even though the side cast is all very good with a massive highlight on kamiya, the main characters seemed a bit lackluster especially Izumi who to me is a very unlikable character. With all this in mind I feel that a 6/10 is a perfect rating for a show like this. and the plot is so similar there aren\'t many ways for a show to stand out from the rest, the best options for this are the characters and their dynamics, which I\'ll talk about in further in the review and the premise behind the whole show.

People were saying it's gonna be as good as My Dress Up Darling (which I loved by the way). Saying that Shikimori was gonna be the next 'Marin' or replace her as the ultimate 'waifuu', as one would say. After watching the full 12 episodes - yeah...no.STORY:The story overall is pretty boring. I mean, is there even a story to begin with? I started watching this show as soon as it aired as many viewers did - but I stopped watching mid-airing and only...started picking it up again last week to finish it. That says a lot in itself. The premise of the 'story' revolves around the lives of Izumi and Shikimori - who start off as a couple from the jump. Izumi - the clumsy boyfriend who has terrible luck and keeps getting himself injured or close to death, and then you have Shikimori - the overprotective girlfriend who has superhuman strength for some reason and always protecting his ass. This gimmick wore off for me very quickly and soon turned into an annoyance. Even if it was the other way around - my opinion would still be the same.  Then the following episodes just follow generic slice-of-life episode tropes. That's it. There just wasn't really anything interesting at all - hence why it took so long to finish it. Some nice moments, and cute moments here and then for the relationship I guess, but it wasn't enough for me to really be invested. (6/10)ART/ANIMATION:The art and animation were pretty much the only things I liked the most about the show. The colour scheme was really nice, I liked the art and the animation wasn't too bad. Not that I really paid so much attention to it anyway. (7/10)SOUND:Eh..I didn't really care for the OST for the anime or the OP song. I really only liked the ending song. So, yeah! (6.5/10)CHARACTERS:I briefly touched upon Izumi and Shikimori previously, but honestly, they're pretty much an uninteresting couple with little substance. They just don't give me any reason to root for them - and maybe it's because they started out as a couple - there's not a lot of development in their relationship to understand or appreciate why they are together in the first place. Their relationship seems so co-dependent on one another and the obsessive and clingy behaviour of Shikimori to be her Izumi's 'saviour' in a sense makes their relationship appear unappealing and unhealthy. I mean...there was an episode where a small girl was thanking Izumi for saving her from drowning and Shikimori got really jealous...it just came across as cringe and weird. Other than her strength...she doesn't really have an interesting personality to me...hence why I wonder why she's so popular lmao. As I said for Izumi, his whole personality trait revolves around having bad luck pretty much - other than that he's bland.I want to briefly mention Kamiya..who came and went. She was part of this  'love triangle between the main couple and it was so weird. Crying to the girlfriend that she loves her boyfriend and then the girlfriend comforting her, saying she's sorry she hurt Kamiya? And she should cherish the feelings she has for HER boyfriend? Huh? It was so corny.Her and the rest of the side characters...I didn't really care for. They're pretty generic and not appealing to me. (5/10)ENJOYMENT:Like I said before..some wholesome and cute moments now and then, but overall...this was a drag to watch. (6/10)OVERALL:This anime was a disappointment to me, and I really wanted to enjoy it, but it fell really short. From the beginning, it had unrealistic expectations and didn't deliver or live up to the hype. I don't see myself revisiting this anime again.

Its not groundbreaking or anything but I think its pretty unique to have an anime focusing on after two characters get together. Its not really fair to get upset that its not in the normal format where they crush on each other for 12 episodes then confess at the end?? like its not trying to be that??And the art and animation are beautiful!! the side characters are simple but they all feel like actual friends instead of characters that show up...to interact with the mcs sometimes.And the last thing,,,, this anime really doesnt seem like it was written to appeal directly to men.... Theres not really any fanservice, the male mc is honestly kind of pathetic and not masculine at all (i say this affectionately) and all the female characters act ...normal. pretty sure this even passes the bechdel test? well anyway not saying men cant watch it and like it just that all the gals might appreciate that more. especially if youre expecting it to be another my dress up darling youll be disappointedBut if youre looking for something simple and pretty, no major drama, where you can watch the mcs be in love or 12 episodes,,,,, this is it!!! It takes this idea and does it really well which is why some other reviews made me mad. Just cause you dont like the idea doesnt mean the idea was executed bad,  just means you should watch something else? Cant get mad at it for not being what you want when it wasnt trying to be what you want.... just felt unfair to compare it like that to interact with the mcs sometimes.And the last thing,,,, this anime really doesnt seem like it was written to appeal directly to men....

The first few episodes I would say make the show feel like it will be something more, but it ultimately ends up being a pretty chill wholesome romance anime. It also fortunately after those first four episodes, cools down on the whole bad luck Brian/Izumi and cool girl Shikimori schtick which it did way too much. The whole gender reversal roles got a bit tiring how much they did it to showcase how macho cool Shikimori was and feminine Izumi was. Afterwards it actually becomes a more fun and endearing show about their romance and the characters...while being decently funny at times.It was great seeing a romance where the couple is already together not many animes do that. I would say it reminds me heavily of Tonikaku Kawaii getting to watch the couple as they go about their life and those arounds them. Art and animation were pretty good as expected from Doga Kobo, there are tons of settings and places they go to or explore that it feels like a vibrant world.Also the side characters get a good amount of character development which made it more interesting and memorable to watch them when they were around. Kamiya's was easily the highlight of the show giving it more impact and emotion, while Hachimitsu was just an overall fun character to watch with her antics. Along with the rest of the characters they were all unique and memorable to see with their own quirky funny personalities. Truly, they helped make the show better since it wasn't just about the main couple.Liked both the OP and ED, with the ED being pretty cool animation wise to the tune of the song.Overall, if you're looking for a lighthearted romance comedy this is a great show to watch for that being rather chill, but having some more meaning to it. I liked how the show tied everything up towards the end it felt pretty good. Along with how they came to be together and what they do that makes them really good for each other. It's not a show for everyone and more so if you don't like these kinds of wholesome romance animes or have wildly weird expectation for them, but if you're looking for something that's a comfy fluffy romcom then I would recommend this. while being decently funny at times.It was great seeing a romance where the couple is already together not many animes do that.

I liked how the show tied everything up towards the end it felt pretty good. Along with how they came to be together and what they do that makes them really good for each other. It's not a show for everyone and more so if you don't like these kinds of wholesome romance animes or have wildly weird expectation for them, but if you're looking for something that's a comfy fluffy romcom then I would recommend this."", ""Shikimori is Not Just Carrying This Relationship on Her BackKawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san has an extremely cliche premise behind it, but that doesn't mean it is done awfullyPlot: Izumi and his girlfriend Shikimori are entering their second year of high school. There relationship is pretty cliche, Izumi is an extremely unlucky individual who always has the worst case scenario happen to him, while Shikimori protects him at every turn. This Slice-of-Life/RomCom follows the two as they go through their second year of high school with their friends, and you gain insights into their relationship and how it started/how it developed.Kawaii dake ja Nai...Shikimori-san doesn't have much going for it in terms of relationship development, it is pretty much just RomCom fluff the entire way through, but it is not poorly done, just don't go into it expecting worlds of development and change. While I didn't hate watching the series, I realized quickly that even though Izumi is trying to be a good boyfriend, Shikimori is heavily carrying this relationship on her back, because without her, Izumi would probably have met Truck-kun and got isekai'd immediately. She literally acts as his guardian angel for the entire 12 episodes.It feels as if the relationship has a complete flip on gender norms in anime, which I like. Having Shikimori be the strong and beautiful character who protects the weak and cute Izumi is very sweet. It is also nice to see a series that has a relationship already established, rather that wait for one to develop (even though I do prefer to watch the latter), they did a good job of filling the viewer in on the backstory so you don't have to feel like you missed out on the budding of their relationship.Truly, Izumi may be unlucky in reality/with physical repercussions, but in theory, he is probably one of the more lucky people in the show. He's gotten lucky enough to meet/date the cutest/coolest girl at his school as well as getting lucky enough to get placed in the same class as this girl for 2 years in a row. On top of that, he managed to have the 2nd most attractive girl in the school fall for him as well, even if it can't be reciprocated. He also has a great set of friends who want to help him & be with him, which while common in anime, is rare in the real world.The secondary characters of the show are where I found most of my enjoyment with the series. Hachimitsu, Neko, Inuzuka are one of my favorite cast of secondary characters from recent shows. Hachimitsu being as stoic and unbothered by most things, while also apparently having the ability to defy the laws of physics and just change her body from a solid to a liquid is pretty funny. Inuzuka is a great best friend to Izumi, and when Shikimori isn't around to do her cool protecting, he just takes the asskicking for Izumi that the world is dishing out towards him. Neko, falling on the lower side of this list, is still just as good a friend to Shikimori, as well as Kamiya, and tries as hard as she can to support everyone around her without leaving anyone out. Also, small note, Izumi's mom is bad af.This isn't a series you should watch for massive amounts of development and change, but rather something you should watch to just simply enjoy things as they are. Obviously people want development, but I found some bliss in just being able to watch the story of a couple and their group of friends as they enjoy their high school days without much drama/crazy stuff happening in the meantime.Animation: 8/10Art: 7/10Characters: 8/10Plot: 6/10Voice Acting: 7/10 Shikimori-san doesn't have much going for it in terms of relationship development, it is pretty much just RomCom fluff the entire way through, but it is not poorly done, just don't go into it expecting worlds of development and change.

The series follows an awesomely, cute, beautiful female character called Shikimori who is dating a guy named Izumi. This poor MC lmao. People say hes a beta, but in fact, hes the furthest thing from. Izumi is basically cursed to be unlucky, but if shikimori is around, hes spared of that bad luck, but deep down feels horrible that she has to go to these lengths to protect him. He\'s a very caring, loving, wholesome and sweet character because of these misfortunes (though hes always been like this)....He wants to better himself, so if the need ever arises, she can rely on him. He may not be as athletic or strong as she is, but he is an amazing support for her and the entire cast as well. I\'ve seen tons of ""its too perfect"" ""theres no drama!"" but in reality, i think this relationship, as perfect as it may be, is very grounded to reality. You dont have misunderstandings every page turn (to a point) because if there is, Izumi and Shikimori discuss the problem and how they are feeling about the problem, address it and mature from it. I seriously loved the Manga and seeing the visuals, is breath taking. Yes, theres alot of school festivals and the stereotypical ""slice of life"" scenarios, but thats what you get when you mix slice of life and romance. This series is definitely focused on the couple growing up, together, while also trying to mature themselves in their own way.All-in-All, its a very heart warming, wholesome series. if you dont like slice of life, would not recommend. if you like romance and are getting tired of drawn out drama and misunderstandings, this is a breath of fresh air.

Honestly.', 'Tl;dr 4/10It\'s a vanilla romcom where nothing happens besides the main couple doing cute things, the gimmick being the roles are usually reversed with the man gushing and the heroine being cool. It\'s fun and rewarding to watch since the heart tugging scenes are nice; if you watch it on 2x speed.Artistic and Entertaining: 1/2It is fun at times, Hachimitsu being an absolute mood, Shikimori being cute and cool simultaneously and seeing Izumi actually grow past his weaknesses and try hard. However, I\'ll be lying if I said it wasn\'t a snore, I watched it on 2x speed after episode 5 to actually be...able to finish it. Artistically it really doesn\'t do anything aside from the Heroine being cool gimmick, Shikimori has no weaknesses at all. The only problem she had in life was an insecurity which she kinda overcomes anyway; Izumi being the opposite. There were moments I thought it might do something like with Kamiya Sans Arc, Hachimitsu or even Izumi in the end since it delves into their insecurities and weaknesses. However, aside from Kamiya (which I say sparingly) there is nothing special or interesting being done at all. Simply put, it\'s uninspired and simplistic to a fault. However, that does make it fun cuz it gives you exactly what it says, a Wholesome Romcom.Recommend: 0/2I\'m afraid I cannot in my right mind recommend this to anyone. I enjoyed it myself, but I can never imagine a situation where I would recommend this to someone else. If you want a good romcom watch: Kaguya Sama, Quintessential Qintuplets (I love Itsuki) and even Nagatoro (Unlike this the development does pay off) simply put, its a feel good anime that I wouldn\'t bother recommending to anyone else.Narrative Consistency: 0/2There is none, plainly this means there is a core complication that the plot will progress towards. All options slowly close off until conflict is inevitable which results in a Climax that ultimately resolves and ends with a Conclusion. Shikimori has none of that, for better or worse there is no difference between starting from Episode 1 or Episode 8. Every character is shallow enough you can get what they are irrespective of episodes, and the anime does little to have you pay attention to previous episodes as it feels encapsulated. That may be for the best since the show is a generic slice of life romcom, but if you are expecting any sort of a plot outside ""What is Sihkimori donig today"" ""What is Izumi doing today"" ""What are Shikimori and Izumi doing today"" then you will be disappointed. Even in a show like Phineas and Ferb, the overarching vector is the End of Summer and the boys being motivated to do stuff every day to make the most of their Summer vacation. If Izumi had Cancer or if Shikimori was already set to be married off to someone else, then it would have suddenly added a lot more drama and tension to this anime. However, this anime doesn\'t have any of that again for better or worse it\'s just feel good. It is no stretch to say there isn\'t any plot, its just a show about a Submissive Boy with Bad luck and a Cool Cute Heroine that ends up as his Girlfriend.Emotional Highs: 2/2Emotional high is defined as any scene or set of events that evoke a high sense of emotion. Anger, Sadness, Laughter, Happiness, Wholesomeness, Thought Provoking etc. minimum 3 of these = 2 points while atleast 1 = 1 point.I dumped a lot on this anime already, but this is where I will sing my praises. Shikimori is an anime with a singular focus, to be a nice wholesome romcom of the romance between Shikimori and Izumi. There are no complications, no love triangles (say what you will but that plot point got wrapped up neatly), no impending doom. It\'s all warm and fuzzy. As a result, this anime is packed to the brim with plenty of moments that will have you feeling things. My favorite episode was episode 10 with the Sports festival. Seeing Izumi overcome his bad luck, Seeing the Lethargic Hachimitsu go beyond herself and for once legitimately rooting for Shikimori to carry the day had me on the edge of my seat. Well I\'ll put that mildly as well, it isn\'t a huge hype moment but it resonated really well with me and I am sure it will with a lot of people.Other high moments include the use of Shikimori\'s cool moments, while they become stale later on the first few episodes really nail it on how Shikimori Juxtaposes cute along with cool. Other heart tugging moments are in the Anniversary episode where Shikimori makes a promise to Izumi as well.Lastly the final episode with Izumi and Shikimori pretty much filled the quota for 3 emotional highs for this to get full points. So yeah, this is the one department Shikimori focuses on and it gets full points for achieving that. So credit where it\'s due.Bias: 1/2This anime caters to none of my biases (Idealogue, Magic Systems, History)However, Shikimori\'s cute side really makes me think of my beloved Itsuki from Quintessential Quintuplets.Whereas Shikimori\'s cool side makes me think of Saber Alter (Arturia Pendragon Alter) my beloved wife who is from the Fate series.So a large part of why I even bothered watching this anime instead of dropping it, and the reason why I enjoyed the mundane but wholesome sequences was largely in part a wish fulfillment gimmick. Imagining a fun school life with the person I love so dearly truly is Peak Isekai especially since Covid happened.But besides that it doesn\'t have anything else.Conclusion: 4/10Ill be honest, this anime was quite difficult for me to grade.I started around with 5/10 (1 point in each category) I was inclined to give it another point for the attempt at Kamiya and Izumi\'s flaws so that would be 6. With the conclusion of the final episode I was feeling nice enough to maybe even contemplate a 7/10But alas, I\'d be doing a great disservice to my standards if I had let emotion dictate so much.In the process of writing this review, I ended up critiquing a lot of things in Shikimori in comparison to other anime. The decision to give 0 to recommendation and narrative consistency was the result, if an anime is truly amazing I would recommend it to everyone in a heartbeat. However, if I feel the anime requires some homework or appeals to a certain type of audience (basically not for everyone) then I give it 1 point, but this anime had nothing I could ever in my right mind recommend. It is guilty pleasure if you may.As for narrative consistency, my grade is incredibly harsh and you might rightly point that out. However, I feel justified in doing so since there are a great many anime that show you can have an amazing plot structure and narrative delivery outside simple wholesome romance. Kaguya sama is a masterclass of such things.So outside me enjoying it for my biasness and personal attachments, the only objective point I could give was there was a certain element of enjoyment present in the anime BUT I recommend watching it in 2x speed since it can feel like a drag or even a total snore.So yeah, I can\'t objectively recommend it.

This is one of the most standard and boring slice of life/rom-com anime I have ever watched.The unique premise of Shikimori is that the female protagonist is cool and the male protagonist is a wimp. So it's just like any rom-com but with the roles swapped or something. Definitely not an interesting enough premise to make the show good.The only other thing that sets it apart from other rom-coms is that the main couple is already together. However I don't think this makes the show any better. In fact, for...me it makes it worst. Seeing the main couple get together and develop is probably my favorite part of watching a romance anime. However Shikimori lacks both of those things. There is some development in the protagonist's relationship, however I don't really care for it because I really hate the two main characters. Especially the male one (I forgot his name💀). This won't necessarily be a problem for everyone, but I find the wimpy male to be super annoying to watch. I don't know why actually. I guess I just don't like people like him. Shikimori, the main female protagonist, is alright though.But yeah other than those two things, the anime has nothing special going for it. It has typical events that you see in every slice of life anime. Also there are three other characters that are kinda important, but like they don't do anything. It feels like they're just there for comic relief and for the sake of having other characters.The biggest problem I have with the show is probably how CRINGY this show is.

I started enojying this show after a while, and now I\'m kinda sad because it ended.Why do I think Shikimori was good?I don\'t know. I just really enjoyed it. And NO COUPLE has EVER made me feel so incredibly single. I almost couldn\'t even watch the last episode, because the tension was just...At first, the ""love"" between Shikimori and Izumi didn\'t seem real.

A slice of life. It exists to make us happy just because those characters exist. And that\'s the point a lot of people missed.Can I also mention the opening and ending? The opening had a really wonderful music and I always enjoyed listening to it. The ending was one of the most creative endings I\'ve ever seen. And also super cute.

The character are just straight up bland and don't even get me started on the story the story itself is more bland then the food at my school, the character development is close to non and everything is just way too predictable I mean it's just so pathetic. The only thing that would come close to good is the art. And the voice actor is not bad too, but the story just destroys everything such a shame. And that concludes my review for this anime thx for reading have a nice day. XD...🤦 🤦"", ""I have never been less challenged by a show with so much initial potential. I thought this was going to be something special, and it turned out to be very bland and unremarkable overall. The dub is good, the sound and art are good... there's just no real substance. I wish there was more to the story than what is presented, because even the more bland character designs really are kind of fun to look at with the bright color palette the show offers. Ultimately, this is a case of a spectacular production team making a ho-hum final product. I doubt I will continue watching....Update: When I wrote my original review, I dropped the show 5 episodes in. Now 11 episodes in, I have changed my mind. Out of nowhere this show finds a wild breath of emotional maturity, and at a breakneck pace I suddenly care about the characters. I don't know what changes shy of one specific moment that I will not go into detail about. I am changing my rating from a 5/10 to 8/10 and my mixed feelings are now a solid yeah, watch it. It's pretty good. I'll gladly consume more. I still wish they'd lean a little more into why Shikimori is such a badass, and have more moments truly showing it, but overall it is a pocket recommendation for the relatively moderate anime fan.

I don't know what changes shy of one specific moment that I will not go into detail about. I am changing my rating from a 5/10 to 8/10 and my mixed feelings are now a solid yeah, watch it. It's pretty good. I'll gladly consume more. I still wish they'd lean a little more into why Shikimori is such a badass, and have more moments truly showing it, but overall it is a pocket recommendation for the relatively moderate anime fan."", ""Warning: I don't speak English, so this may have some spelling errors or some words that are not well understood.oh my god, how do I start, how do I leave the anime, I'm only going to comment on the 6 episodes I saw, and god WHAT A FUCKING TORTURE, I mean, a girl takes care of her boyfriend because he has bad luck, well, I'm not judging him, it's a romance at last and after all, but, if we go a little further with the anime, it becomes very boring, very basic and sometimes even boring, and what I don't like are the characters, that...is, the design is good but they are very flat, they don't have personality it is noticeable that the only thing they want is to show the romance between izumi and shikimori they do not show a development of friendship at least they tell us it tells us about the past of izumi and shikimori, but from what I saw they do not give too many details and the next chapter until they forget that they told it, in summary the anime is bad, it has lousy characters and if it weren't for the waifu, people would not watch that anime, so far my report, thanks for reading! is, the design is good but they are very flat, they don't have personality it is noticeable that the only thing they want is to show the romance between izumi and shikimori they do not show a development of friendship at least they tell us it tells us about the past of izumi and shikimori, but from what I saw they do not give too many details and the next chapter until they forget that they told it, in summary the anime is bad, it has lousy characters and if it weren't for the waifu, people would not watch that anime, so far my report, thanks for reading!"", ""Shikimori san is a complete masterpiece(I WANT ANOTHER SEASON!!!)To most, it's seems like another rom-com, but in reality, it's quite unique.

Male romcom leads tend to be rather terrible, however this one's just dreadful. So dreadful I had to tie myself physically to my chair so I wont break my PC out of sheer cringe. Shikimori is overall an okay female lead, but combine it with shallow side characters, a cringe femboy and enough cheese to think the anime takes place in Wisconsin and you get yourself a seasonal flop.Art's pretty good though,...props to the visual and audio team. props to the visual and audio team."", ""I started watching this series with a low expectation because of all the hates it got online, but I honestly think it isn't as how as how people made it out to be.The parts that people hate about this anime is that some episodes are boring, character interactions are cringy, etc., and I can see why they say it.What do I like about it?The anime is pretty laid back and enjoyable to watch. Especially the interactions between Izumi and Shikimori, they're more and more open towards their love for each other as the story goes on. There are rarely any conflicts between characters, making it...stress-free to watch.It is hard for most watchers to acknowledge this writing style, but I do suggest this anime if you are a romcom lover.

Yes, like that was something new in anime.

Hell nah he crazy as hellBakugo on Shikimori-san? Well atleast he\'s more friendly, but still a no for me.Hey, Kylinity here, back at it again with the low quality reviews about seasonals. Today, I\'m gonna talk about somehow the 2nd most anticipated non-sequel anime of Spring 2022, Shikimori-san. Yeah... yet another waifu bait anime.Shikimori-san is the perfect romcom example on how it fails to become a romcom. I don\'t see any good chemistry between the MC and the main girl and feels more of like a pretend-relationship between them. I don\'t even feel the romance this anime is trying to bring out...at all, so this totally feels like a Slice of Life show. I like my SoLs a lot, but a romcom like this that fails to be a romcom doesn\'t even make it even interesting in the least. Half of the episodes are more of SoL-ish more than romantic, plus the anime doesn\'t even try to make it atleast interesting for us viewers. What I\'m trying to say is that Shikimori-san not only fails at being a romcom anime, but also fails horribly at being a Slice of Life anime.There really isn\'t anything to talk about the story, to be honest with you. I told you before, this is more of a SoL than a romcom. Its main focus is the couple between Izumi and Shikimori, but to be fair, it\'s more of like the daily lives of these group of friends, where we have a rehabilitated Bakugo without any badass powers, a monotonic lemon, an energetic catgirl that isn\'t really a catgirl just because her name has a Neko on it, a cute and a badass main girl, and a pathetic MC that is always led by misfortune.Well, Izumi and Shikimori got together during their freshman years during the cultural fest, and the school was doing a Number Couples Game where you\'ll have to take a picture with the person who has the same number as you. As expected, the two got the same number and as absolutely expected of Izumi, he loses the number due to his seemingly unlucky aura [Too long, didn\'t explain: they never found it and they asked the president to replace the lost number] and after the game, Izumi finally confesses to Shikimori and for whatever reason, she accepted it and they got in a relationship. It felt more like the author forced Shikimori to accept the confession so this series has some backstory on how they got together, but it\'s undeniable to me that it\'s just bad...The art though is pretty average. I expected a lot more since the studio producing this anime was Doga Kobo and they\'re one of my favorite studios out there. But it looks like Doga Kobo has lost its best aspect of it, it\'s animation and art. Well, the studio still does well in SoL anime, but this just felt average compared to the other productions the studio had for us. At times, it felt too colorful too, like very vibrant that it hurts my eyes, so yeah...I\'m surprised I managed to stay serious most of the time, but yeah, don\'t expect me to explain the characters well.Izumi [MC] - He feels more of a side character than a main character. He\'s more of like a stepping stone for Shikimori to hog the entire spotlight and just shaming him for being an unlucky fuck.Shikimori [Main Girl] - she\'s cute and cool. Although, she\'s too jealous at times. I get that, but girl, please don\'t get so jealous because your friends talk more to Izumi than you.Bakugo - I know, he has a name, Inuzuka. Yeah yeah, but whatever, I\'ll just call him Bakugo because he\'s Bakugo. He\'s the complete opposite of MHA\'s Bakugo, where in here, he\'s actually friendly and a good friend. Although he doesn\'t seem to develop a lot, which is fine.Hachimitsu - the monotonic lemon. I swear, she\'s boring as fuck. She\'s so monotonic plus she always keep one single face and not showing her emotions to her friends.Nekozaki - she\'s energetic as hell. She keeps calling Shikimori ""Micchon"" but I still don\'t get how she called her that.As you can totally see, I didn\'t enjoy this anime and it technically bored me to hell.

I dont know how they are going to do to turn things around, the ratings keep dropping seems everyone is getting tired of the same formula used in every episode might drop it sooner or later if I dont see any improvements... Even tho the manga is better I hope the anime picks up its pace keep up to the manga.

This anime reminds me of something along the lines of Kubo Won\'t Let me be Invisible or Nisekoi as they share the theme of a beautiful girl dating this bland generic kid. The story mainly revolves around a ""I was born with bad luck but I have my girlfriend to save...me"" story.  This only makes the anime worse because the anime gets very repetitive and boring very quickly. Most of the characters aren\'t as bad as other anime but they could have done a better job personality-wise.

From then on, the characters, especially Izumi, begin to develop. At first I was worried that Shikimori would only have eyes for Izumi and that the other characters would just be placeholders. However, that was not the case. With Kamiya they throw in an interesting character that works well in combination with Izumi and Shikimori. Shikimori's soft hearted nature is revealed as she comforts Kamiya and so my initially anticipated problem has not materialized as Shikimori cares for others too.The secondary characters entertained me sometimes even without the two protagonists, I was particularly impressed by the...relay race episode since Hachimitsu was one of the chars I disliked, but liked towards the end of the ep. Izumi seemed as an annoying and cowardly protagonist to me at the beginning of the anime, but towards the end you could see how he developed and sympathized with him as well. What makes the story of this work the most for me is the concept of a strong protective girlfriend with the counterpart of an anxious boyfriend paired with the character development of the protagonist.As for the adaptation, I have to say that it definitely appears to me as above average for this genre. The color palette was chosen appropriately and motions also looked fluid when needed for sports episodes. Facial expressions and mimics were also well animated and I also liked the soundtrack.

An extremely athletic and cute girlfriend who can be the ""cool"" hero for her unlucky boyfriend when unfortunate luck occurs. The show follows a group of friends doing day-to-day tasks. Nothing extraordinary is displayed, however, the show will make you feel great despite the lack of depth. I watched the show dubbed so all of my experiences with the show is based on that version.Story: [ 7 / 10 ]The show, despite having no true depth fulfills the role of being a true fluff rom-com. Throughout the show, we follow...a group of great friends and their day-to-day tasks. This ranges from cute moments, to high school shenanigans, festivals, and so much more. Despite no major developing plot points as a slice-of-life rom-com this show excels at showing all the important bits of high schoolers and their after school fun. There is no major dark past between our two love interests. The story with Kamiya was incredible and a complete curveball. I wish she was given more screen time. The last episode was absolutely beautiful and had a fitting end for a great show. My only deduction is in relation to not following Kamiya more and the early episodes overplaying the trope of Izumi being unlucky. Thankfully this was dialed back.Art: [ 10 / 10 ]A vibrant color palette is shown from start to finish. This coupled with the wonderful animation style really elevates this show from a dull slice of life to a memorable show. Shikimori, Nekozaki, Izumi, and especially Hachimitsu have incredible facial expressions and emotes throughout the show. So many funny and memorable shots occurred during each episode. The OP and ED are beautifully animated and made me love them so much more. The comic book style of each character in the ED is adorable and cute. Great job animators.Sound: [ 8 / 10 ]Initially, I was not a fan of the OP or ED. However, as each episode began and ended I began to love them more. The intro song ""Honey Jet Coaster (ハニージェットコースター)"" by Nasuo☆ started off strangely, however, the visuals supported and elevated it to a different score. Eventually, I found myself getting excited for the climax of the intro. The ED ""Route BLUE"" by Yuki Nakashima grew on me much earlier. The song is not only upbeat and fun but the art style of ED is absolutely adorable and memorable of old video games. The beat makes it even more enjoyable to watch the ending sequence and watch Shikimori and Izumi.The sound design for the rest of the show was also spot-on. The dubbed voice actors filled their roles perfectly (especially Hachimitsu and Shikimori). Shikimori\'s voice changes throughout the show when she is more serious is incredible and made the character for me. The ambient music that played throughout the show was great and not overdone. General sound design I had no complaints with.Characters: [ 9 / 10 ]In Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie we have two main characters with three supporting characters & an additional bonus. I thoroughly believe each character was fantastic in their own regard. Just a great group of friends who support each other\'s weaknesses.1. Shikimori - One of the main characters of the show and the love interest of Izumi. She is incredibly talented, athetlic, and beautiful. The art style and the dubbed voice actor fit her design perfectly. She is a wonderful girlfriend to Izumi and breaks the trope of ""jealous"" and ""overprotective"" girlfriends found in other rom-com. She is a fantastic friend and is always there for not only Izumi but anyone who she views as her friend.2. Izumi, Yuu - The second main character and the love interest of Shikimori. A more ""feminine"" male role, however, despite the tropes portrayed in other rom-com\'s he always seems to be able to read Shikimori and make her feel better or loved. He is ""unlucky"" and thankfully Shikimori is there to protect him. Despite not being the typical ""cool guy"" MC there are numerous times when he has his charms and makes you as the viewer realize why Shikimori fell in love with him in the first place.3. Nekozaki, Kyou - A wonderful support character -- A boisterous, energetic wildcard who adores her friends. She is there to help with any of their issues and to make them feel better.4. Hachimitsu, Yui - My favorite support character -- quiet, slothful, but absolutely hilarious. Anytime she was on the screen I knew I was in for a wild ride.5. Inuzuka, Shuu - The least ""memorable"" support character from the main set of friends, however, he fulfills his role as Izumis best friend well. It is enjoyable early on to see the jealousy between him and Shikimori.6. Kamiya - The bonus character I mentioned earlier. She is seen in one of the earlier episodes, however, the midpoint of the show focused on her character and growth. Because of this, it made me not only love the show much but her as a supporting character. She is similar in multiple ways to Shikimori: athletic, talented, and attractive. The difference is she wasn\'t the love interest of Izumi, however, despite this she is welcomed into the friend group with open arms. My only complaint is I wish she had more screen time.Every character in this show is memorable and absolutely a joy to watch. I loved Shikimori and Izumi\'s dynamics and how they can flip the roles of being ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" between the two with no awkward pacing. Shikimori being serious was a treat and I loved every scene where she was serious, especially, in regard to Izumi. Nekozaki and Hachimitsu are great comedic relief during the show and truly are some of the best-supporting characters in any anime I have watched. While Inuzuka was somewhat forgettable, like I mentioned earlier, he fulfills his role as being Izumi\'s friend perfectly. Kamiya\'s arc was a complete curveball for me and made me love her character. My only reason to deduct one point was I wish Kamiya had received more screen time especially since it is implied that she is now a ""part"" of the friend group and how the trope of Izumi being ""unlucky"" grew old initially. Thankfully it was dialed back before I gave up on the show.Overall - [ 9 / 10 ]Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie has no major plot development, however, despite this it fulfills its role as a fluff rom-com absolutely perfectly. It is so refreshing to start a rom-com with not only the main love interests dating, but established and relatable. The side characters are all incredible and truly I would not change a single thing about any of them. It is an interesting take seeing a gender-reversed romcom and it works for this show. The show is a chill slice of laugh and the viewer can turn their brain off and enjoy a few laughs and focus for the more ""intimate"" sections. The OP and ED fit the show wonderfully and are backed up by wonderful art sequences. Visually the show is gorgeous and well-animated. The only critique of the show and the reason it did not deserve a perfect score is the initial trope of Izumi being extremely unlucky grew old after the first few episodes. Thankfully the show changed directions quickly and became much more bearable. In my opinion, if it would been an ongoing occurrence it would\'ve been grounds for dropping a rather fun and enjoyable rom-com.My final thoughts: The show is 100% worth a watch if you enjoy RomCom. All the characters are fun and lovable. The main characters have a great dynamic with each other. Do not go in expecting significant plot development, however, the story is still fun fluff. The show fills the roles of romance, comedy, and slice of laugh perfectly. Do not let the first few episodes and the ""unlucky"" trope cause you to drop the show. It gets exponentially better I promise. This could\'ve been a perfect score show if this was addressed slightly earlier. Overall it receives a 9/10 from me. a group of great friends and their day-to-day tasks. This ranges from cute moments, to high school shenanigans, festivals, and so much more. Despite no major developing plot points as a slice-of-life rom-com this show excels at showing all the important bits of high schoolers and their after school fun.

Because of this, it made me not only love the show much but her as a supporting character. She is similar in multiple ways to Shikimori: athletic, talented, and attractive. The difference is she wasn\'t the love interest of Izumi, however, despite this she is welcomed into the friend group with open arms. My only complaint is I wish she had more screen time.Every character in this show is memorable and absolutely a joy to watch. I loved Shikimori and Izumi\'s dynamics and how they can flip the roles of being ""masculine"" and ""feminine"" between the two with no awkward pacing. Shikimori being serious was a treat and I loved every scene where she was serious, especially, in regard to Izumi. Nekozaki and Hachimitsu are great comedic relief during the show and truly are some of the best-supporting characters in any anime I have watched. While Inuzuka was somewhat forgettable, like I mentioned earlier, he fulfills his role as being Izumi\'s friend perfectly. Kamiya\'s arc was a complete curveball for me and made me love her character. My only reason to deduct one point was I wish Kamiya had received more screen time especially since it is implied that she is now a ""part"" of the friend group and how the trope of Izumi being ""unlucky"" grew old initially. Thankfully it was dialed back before I gave up on the show.Overall - [ 9 / 10 ]Shikimori\'s Not Just a Cutie has no major plot development, however, despite this it fulfills its role as a fluff rom-com absolutely perfectly. It is so refreshing to start a rom-com with not only the main love interests dating, but established and relatable. The side characters are all incredible and truly I would not change a single thing about any of them. It is an interesting take seeing a gender-reversed romcom and it works for this show. The show is a chill slice of laugh and the viewer can turn their brain off and enjoy a few laughs and focus for the more ""intimate"" sections. The OP and ED fit the show wonderfully and are backed up by wonderful art sequences. Visually the show is gorgeous and well-animated. The only critique of the show and the reason it did not deserve a perfect score is the initial trope of Izumi being extremely unlucky grew old after the first few episodes. Thankfully the show changed directions quickly and became much more bearable. In my opinion, if it would been an ongoing occurrence it would\'ve been grounds for dropping a rather fun and enjoyable rom-com.My final thoughts: The show is 100% worth a watch if you enjoy RomCom. All the characters are fun and lovable. The main characters have a great dynamic with each other. Do not go in expecting significant plot development, however, the story is still fun fluff. The show fills the roles of romance, comedy, and slice of laugh perfectly. Do not let the first few episodes and the ""unlucky"" trope cause you to drop the show. It gets exponentially better I promise. This could\'ve been a perfect score show if this was addressed slightly earlier. Overall it receives a 9/10 from me.', '[No spoilers, bad language]Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is one of the most boring anime I\'ve ever seen, so much so that I wanted to drop it in the third episode. The only good thing about this anime is the protagonist, honestly I would say ""Smash"", but everything else is boring without a shred of plot and with flat characters and without any personality. Not to mention the normie humor and other shit like that. It really sucks.Not to mention that toilet with the same expression that I don\'t even remember what it\'s called, why is it there? Is it supposed to make you laugh?...""Oh look how cute ahahah very funny she always has the same face hahaha"" BY GOD NO!

It looks really GREAT, especially for its OP and some really great key moments (e.g. the 12th episode looks GORGEOUS), but offers not much besides that.The premise with Izumi being the most misfortune haunted...guy in Japan has a lot of potential (e.g. Donald Duck also has a lot of misfortune, and i think its fair to say he does quite well). But they don\'t really do anything creative with it.

They had a great protagonist and a great concept to boot, where the male and female have almost a switch in regards to anime trops. The female character was really interesting but i do have to say the story fell short...I was expecting charters that would grow with me but in reality it felt like the story stopped growing after the first episode, the male character kinda stayed the same through out the entire story and the female characters started to get boring as well. The entire story line could be summed up with saying...that each episode resulted in the male character getting in trouble and the female character coming to rescue him.

And with at all I really mean at all. I didn\'t care about Shikimori and neither did I care much about Izumi to be honest.As an anime watcher I was straight thrown into the situation of their relationship and everyday school life. I do watch many romance and slice of life stuff and I really like it normally but this was not...it for me.Maybe it was because I was thrown into the situation not knowing anything about the main characters at all. Then again I feel like I knew everything about the characters there was to know after only having finished one episode. I thought there would be more to them but there just wasn\'t not in any of the twelve episodes (I have to exclude episode 8 because we got some minor development there) but otherwise the two protagonist\'s and their friends just had one or two character traits that stayed the same. Shikimoris cute yet somehow cool and Izumi is always clumsy and has to be helped my Shikimori. And their friends Inu and Neko are the competitive type while Hatsumichi always has the same deadpan expression on her face. I actually liked Inu and Hatsumichi the most even though they only had like one big character trait, I somehow liked them the most.Which undermines my point how I couldn\'t, and somewhere along the way didn\'t even want to, connect with the two protagonists at all. Shikimori was from the beginning too much for me. I honestly don\'t get the appeal of the pretty, perfect, can-do-everything girl. She switched from cutie to supposedly \'cool\' and got so overtly jealous and possessive of Izumi that it was just annoying. And Izumi honestly just felt like a sidekick to showcase Shikimoris \'greatness\'.Maybe I would have connected with the characters more if I had seen the beginning of their Lovestory first and then their everyday life. Maybe I wouldn\'t. The most enjoyable episode for me was probably episode 10 with the sports festival because of Hatsumichi.I honestly can\'t remember much more of it. Most scenes were repetitive in some way and so very predictable and the comedy was not to my like.I actually watched it to get the new badge but I wouldn\'t watch it for any other badge again.

They\'re just not enough to make a bland anime interesting enough.', ""*Spoiler Warning*What's there to say about Shikimori's Not Just A Cutie? Well, quite frankly not much. It's a slice-of-life rom com where the main character, Shikimori, seemingly has this supernatural ability (maybe she can use the force, idk), to always save her boyfriend, Izumi, who is stricken with a severe case of continuous bad luck. Seriously, the guy can't go so much as stepping outside without either injuring himself or getting sick or whatever. This is through no fault of Izumi, but it seems like someone somewhere just really has it out for the guy. The entire show essentially revolved around Shikimori protecting her boyfriend...through whatever calamity seems to strike at him, saving his life and preventing serious injury to him. Other than that...not much happens. I hate to say it. There's not a whole lot to this show and it certainly doesn't need to be complex or deep in order to be good, but my problem with this show is that it continuously sets up good or interesting plot points, but resolves it almost instantly and life goes on as normal. The characters are likable enough to keep watching but if you're looking for something big to happen, unfortunately you're going to be kept waiting in suspense.Now the show does have its good qualities, but it's largely confined to its production value. The show looks beautiful, no question about it. Shikimori certainly looks...well...like a cutie, and the animation is very crisp and well done. The intros and outros are cute and both the songs are pretty catchy and something you can vibe to. Otherwise that's just about all that I can give the show full marks for.As I've said above, nothing of serious consequence happens in the show and its just mostly Shikimori and Izumi going through their days at school or wherever they're hanging out, disaster strikes for poor Izumi, and Shikimori saves the day. Rinse and repeat. They go from the first day of school, to a day playing sports and they hang out at the movies, summer break, cultural festival, sports festival and their first real solo date. Occasionally, the other characters in the show, Hachimitsu, Nekozaki and Inuzuka tag along. There's a couple plot threads where another girl named Kamiya is interested in Izumi and had a long simmering crush on him, and Shikimori gets jealous of Inuzuka (the only other guy in their friend group), takes Izumi away from the group to hang out together. Both could've been very interesting plot threads to explore. There's nothing wrong with a good old fashioned love triangle and diving into Shikimori's psyche to see if she's some sort of yandere could've been interesting, but as I said both plot threads get resolved pretty quickly. Kamiya concedes her feelings to Shikimori when she goes to confront her, but says she won't get in the way of their relationship. Inuzuka and Shikimori also achieve a mutual understanding and she calms down. Twice the show could've been made far more interesting, and unfortunately they blew both opportunities.Now there are still some good scenes in the show that are enough to keep you entertained. Shikimori is shown to be an impressively skilled volleyball player as she faces off against Kamiya (who is also very athletic in her own right), there’s an episode where they prepare to a big relay race at the sports festival and a lot of time is dedicated to the one of the side characters Hachimitsu (who has some good one liners throughout the show as well) as she gets in shape to train for the race, and during the school festival arc Inuzuka and Nekozaki get a fair bit of screen time.The season ends when Izumi takes Shikimori on their first solo date together. After going through the date despite some usual misfortunes, they get to the gondola ride where it breaks down and they are stuck. For the first time in the show, Izuymi is able to do something correct and pulls the chad move of kissing her on the cheek and reassures her that they’ll always be together [ah, reminds me of some good ol’ HS era memories ;( ]. Shikimori then goes back to her friends and vows to be more open hearted like Izumi. So the show does end on a sweet, heartfelt note despite being a rather unexciting romcom.The show does at least go into Shikimori’s and Izuymi’s backstory and shows how they got together in the first place, which was nice, but Shikimori’s reasons for falling in love are a bit…questionable at best. Basically, all of Shikimori’s life she essentially followed in her brother’s footsteps and did everything he did. She even cut her hair short like his and practiced martial arts like him. One day, Shikimori has a bit of an identity crisis and has an epiphany to where she can be her own person. So she becomes more feminine and quits practicing martial arts. She also starts reading manga and picks up on this idea of true love and how it works and all that fun stuff. The backstory between the two was sweet and it was nice to see how the two ended up together in which they admitted their feelings for each other at last year’s school festival after they were able to take a picture together (out of the kindness of the Student Council President, since the whole point was that you have to find the person with your name on a piece of paper, you take a picture, Izuimi lost his, you get the gist.)The show certainly has its heartwarming moments and it has some enjoyable scenes, but there’s really no drama and no set of stakes or conflict (other than Izumi’s self-doubt and inferiority complex) so it can make it dull to watch. There were a couple of innuendos by Shikimori teasing Izumi in an episode or two, but that was about it on that front as well. I really only kept watching because those few interesting scenes gave me hope that something good would happen, but alas it never came.My thoughts on the characters:Shikimori: She was certainly the star of the show and there’s lots of reasons to like her. She’s beautiful, athletic, talented and incredibly kind hearted. There may be a hint of overprotectiveness and jealousy within her, but the show rarely explores those aspects of her and quickly resolves any plot threads that come of it. She’s a bit of a Mary Sue in that she’s always able to pull off these incredible feats to save Izumi, but it’s explained she’s able to do all that because of her martial arts training, which explains it a bit but some of the stuff she pulls is certainly a stretch. But hey, its anime, not real life. She’s definitely the kind of girlfriend one would want and the story does successfully portray her as the idea “heartthrob girlfriend”.Izumi: I definitely feel sorry for the dude and his misfortunes, and I’ll give him credit for rolling with the punches that life continually socks him with. He’s certainly a nice and kind-hearted person but besides that there really isn’t anything spectacular about him, which makes his pairing with Shikimori a bit unexpected and that’s something that’s talked about by their classmates quite frequently. All in all, love comes in many different shapes and sizes and I think the show was just trying to explore that.Kamiya: She’s the opposite of Shikimori personality wise in which she’s more introverted than Shikmori is, but she is nonetheless pretty athletic and skilled in her own right. She doesn’t really pull anything incredible like Shikimori does but she’s a very talented volleyball player. I’ll also give props to Kamiya for surrendering her feelings and letting Izumi and Shikimori live their lives without getting in the way, that was incredibly kind of her to do, but the story missed an interesting plot thread there.Inuzuka: He’s Izumi’s best friend. He’s athletic, pretty talented, and overall a nice chill dude. Not much to say about him honestly but he fits the role of “best friend to the mc” pretty well.Nekozaki: Pretty much like Inuzuka, just the female version and Shikimori’s best friend. Honestly thought they would’ve shipped her with Inuzuka but it they avoided that route. Nekozaki also seems to admire Kamiya to an extent, so there could be Yuri potential there but the show didn’t go down that path either.Hachimistu: She’s the stoic, soft spoken and chill girl of the friend group. She has some great one-liners throughout the show and is probably the most rational character in the show. She does get some screentime during the relay race episode and she ends up pulling through for her team and she's a good friend of the group.Fuji Shikimori: Shikimori’s older brother and idol. He’s kind of that stern “don’t talk to me” kind of person but there’s times he goes out his way to help his sister with something, so he’s a nice guy. Not much is really explored with him though.Shikimori’s Not Just A Cutie was a show that had the potential to be interesting and at times set itself up for some potentially interesting and exciting moments, but instead they opted to play it safe with their formula of “Shikimori and Izumi go out and do couple things, something bad almost happens to Izumi, and Shikimori saves the day”. It got old and stale after a while. The characters are certainly likable and the production value is great, but the plot is the weakest thing about the show in there being really no plot at all, which is a problem for any story. If you don’t have a plot, then there’s really no point to the story. Again I think they were trying to explore “love comes in all shapes and sizes”, but that alone can’t really be used as the plot for a story. It’s a good driver and a good narrative device, but again there’s no plot. Therefore there’s no real story behind this anime.For what it's worth I did not hate the show, but I couldn’t sit there and recommend it to someone, and it has more going against it than it has going for it. So I sadly have to say that I can’t recommend watching this anime. Due to the fact that nothing really happens, it's kind of hard to give this an actual rating. Since there's nothing objectively bad with this anime, and that it does have some good scenes, I think giving this an average rating is fair. My mood while watching was either intrigued (and then disappointed) or just neutral. There were some relatable moments and I did enjoy the jokes that were sprinkled in, but I can’t say that the payoff at the end was really worth watching the 12 episodes for. I will say if you had just watched a real heartbreaking anime (like Angel Beats, Assassination Classroom, hell even Toradora really tugs at the heartstrings), this would be a good anime to watch to recover from as you could kind of project the characters onto Shikimori and Izumi since they’re bland enough. I don’t regret watching Shikimori’s Not Just A Cutie, but I probably wouldn’t watch a Season 2 if it came out unless something interesting actually happens. through whatever calamity seems to strike at him, saving his life and preventing serious injury to him. Other than that...not much happens. I hate to say it. There's not a whole lot to this show and it certainly doesn't need to be complex or deep in order to be good, but my problem with this show is that it continuously sets up good or interesting plot points, but resolves it almost instantly and life goes on as normal.

Nekozaki also seems to admire Kamiya to an extent, so there could be Yuri potential there but the show didn’t go down that path either.Hachimistu: She’s the stoic, soft spoken and chill girl of the friend group. She has some great one-liners throughout the show and is probably the most rational character in the show. She does get some screentime during the relay race episode and she ends up pulling through for her team and she's a good friend of the group.Fuji Shikimori: Shikimori’s older brother and idol. He’s kind of that stern “don’t talk to me” kind of person but there’s times he goes out his way to help his sister with something, so he’s a nice guy. Not much is really explored with him though.Shikimori’s Not Just A Cutie was a show that had the potential to be interesting and at times set itself up for some potentially interesting and exciting moments, but instead they opted to play it safe with their formula of “Shikimori and Izumi go out and do couple things, something bad almost happens to Izumi, and Shikimori saves the day”. It got old and stale after a while. The characters are certainly likable and the production value is great, but the plot is the weakest thing about the show in there being really no plot at all, which is a problem for any story. If you don’t have a plot, then there’s really no point to the story. Again I think they were trying to explore “love comes in all shapes and sizes”, but that alone can’t really be used as the plot for a story. It’s a good driver and a good narrative device, but again there’s no plot. Therefore there’s no real story behind this anime.For what it's worth I did not hate the show, but I couldn’t sit there and recommend it to someone, and it has more going against it than it has going for it. So I sadly have to say that I can’t recommend watching this anime. Due to the fact that nothing really happens, it's kind of hard to give this an actual rating. Since there's nothing objectively bad with this anime, and that it does have some good scenes, I think giving this an average rating is fair. My mood while watching was either intrigued (and then disappointed) or just neutral. There were some relatable moments and I did enjoy the jokes that were sprinkled in, but I can’t say that the payoff at the end was really worth watching the 12 episodes for. I will say if you had just watched a real heartbreaking anime (like Angel Beats, Assassination Classroom, hell even Toradora really tugs at the heartstrings), this would be a good anime to watch to recover from as you could kind of project the characters onto Shikimori and Izumi since they’re bland enough. I don’t regret watching Shikimori’s Not Just A Cutie, but I probably wouldn’t watch a Season 2 if it came out unless something interesting actually happens."", 'A romcomedy with lot of potential but not properly developed. Kindness is the key in this story. It can change even the bad luck. Kindness can transform your love rival in your best friend. The two protagonists are excellent with it, and also their friends are supportive in making the world a better place. We have jokes and funny moments, but not enough to make the anime unforgettable. Too much sweetness and few drama. Is this an issue? No, probably this is the genre the writers wanted to offer us: an ideal world where love and kindness can defeat any adversity.

The comedy point is not so much accentuated and some of basic events are in there( festivals, fireworks). The anime isn’t unique and it is easy to prevent all the events that will happen.Personally the thing that I preferred in the anime is...the kindness of characters, especially for Izumi, Shikimori and Kamiya who was maybe the most interesting character.The anime is accessible and will be appreciated globally by everyone that have the time to watch it. the kindness of characters, especially for Izumi, Shikimori and Kamiya who was maybe the most interesting character.The anime is accessible and will be appreciated globally by everyone that have the time to watch it.', ""I am very annoyed so I'm gonna rant regarding this anime.The male protagonist has very annoying voice, is a pussy, no character development (try to stand up for himself), and needs to be saved by the Shikimori almost every time bad things happen to him.

Extra: For me, Yuuki Izumi is more annoying than Komura Kaede from The Girl...Who Forgot Her Glasses.The only saving grace to this anime is Shikimori and the other side characters, especially Hachimitsu and Kamiya.

Many tend to be fairly mediocre and deliver, in my honest opinion, pretty superficial enjoyment. Rarely do I rate animes like this any higher than a 5, this one is no different for a few reasons.First, the story. Basically it\'s just a run of  the mill slice of life high school life anime. That\'s it. Nothing else really stands out.Artwork. Pretty bland. There are so many still shots and panning, kind of tells me they didn\'t have a great budget for this. Pretty much nothing I haven\'t...seen a million times before.Sounds/Music..ehh your typical Jpop music. Nothing stands out to me anyways.Characters. Honestly both the MC and protagonist are fairly weak characters. They really have no qualities that stand out. Izumi is marred by bad luck (some how it\'s suppose to be endearing or funny? Shrugs shoulder) and Shikimori is suppose to be like a hero to his bad luck, saving him from whatever tries to hurt him. This wouldn\'t be a problem if it wasn\'t done so poorly. Rarely if ever do we see Izumi angry, or lose it when it comes to his luck, he just ""accepts"" it and moves on..and honestly just makes him a boring person. Shikimori can do no wrong. She\'s a hero, she\'s like superman just coming in to save Izumi..while that might work in super hero movies, in this type of anime it\'s fairly predictable and well, boring. The only episode I really enjoyed was the one with Kamiya who has an air of mystery. What is her feelings, etc towards the main characters, etc. It was a pretty decent episode and kept me interested unlike most of the others. Kind of wish they did more with her, but they didn\'t do much more than a couple of episodes.Overall it would\'ve been a poor anime to watch, but Kamiya saved it a bit..other than that. Pretty forgettable. By this time next year I will probably not even remember the name of it because it\'s that forgettable. I give it a pretty mediocre score of 5 out of 10. Watchable I guess if you\'re into these types of anime, but for me if I had to do it again, I\'d pass.

It might even be just a little below bare minimum. It passes the time, and it can be somewhat enjoyable for some moments, but I would not recommend this anime.As said, this is a romcom, but the comedy is very lacking. The male protagonist has somehow supernaturally bad luck, which he consciously knows. He needs to make due with bad situations because of it, but none of them are really funny. Aside from him dealing with it, his girlfriend(if you could really call her that) protects him from them sometimes. Which...is a neat little bridge towards the romance part. I wouldn't really call the relationship between the protagonists romance. It is more like a mother or a big sister looking after her little boy. Ofc, Shikimori says she likes him, or you hear her thoughts that she really likes him, mainly because of his infinite kindness. But it never shows that she sees him romantically. Izumi also says she finds her really cute, or really cool, but apart from that, the relationships seems more like codependence on a whole new level. You don't need to watch this anime for the romance, nor the comedy.In terms of story,  their is none.In terms of characters, it relies too much on Shikimori, and she is the only one who gets a bit of depth, and some cutscenes for seeing why she is the way she is.

Whilst being the ""strong"" girlfriend,  Shikimori also shows signs of insecurity over this, feeling like she can\'t be perceived as cute by her boyfriend, which is definitely not the case. Her boyfriend, Izumi, is very clumsy and unlucky and bad things always happen to him, but Shikimori is there to save his day.

Shikimori is a good character. She's pretty, kind, supportive, compassionate and talented at everything she does. She's definitely more than just a cutie.

He's not particularly good at anything. He's determined not to be timid. Unfortunately, the only times we really see him not being timid is when he's cheering on Shikimori.

Tbh it's actually kinda bad. My score is generous.Shikimori is not just a cutie, she's the most irritation likeable character I think I've dealt with in an anime. She did nothing wrong, and that's the problem. How do you write... let me be fair, I imagine the manga has character that's missing in the show. BUT this show is the prime example of looking at ideas that worked and trying to use it to create the same success without understanding what makes it work.I'm going to give examples to other shows and why they work and this doesn't.My...Dress Up Darling -This works because the show is unique and decides to operate in genius. Marin is the main reason anyone watches if we're being real. She's so likeable I couldn't believe it. Before I watched it was like half way through the season. I heard all the hype. I almost never like a show if I year it hyped for weeks then try. It always ends up underwhelming. But here's the thing. Gojo is the POV they focus on and you learn to sympathyze from his POV. You learn the greatness of Cosplay through him. You find out why Marin is so likeable through him. You never at any time feel like it's BS. It all makes sense. Marin being able to carry the show alone was pushed out to the goal. While Shikimori feels like it tries to pull the same idea of introducing characters but they don't matter. Which is a issue when Shikimori's only value is looking cute and being amazing athletically making her able to save her waste man from life 24/7. It's food for a episode. But this isn't Beta male. This is pathetic. It gets to a point you wonder what is really going on and honestly by the time I said that. I stopped caring. I got 4 episodes in and I just get frustrated.School Rumble -While this show takes a entirely different approach. It shows how one of the shows biggest flaws could have been all it needed. School Rumble is a Slice of Life about EVERYONE. Sure Tenma is the main character. But it's one of the few slice of life shows that do amazing at including everyone. Everyone has a real personality, everyone is fun and has unique dynamics based on who they're with. Then they got Harima who completely changes everyones dynamic based on his presence. This highlights Shikimori's biggest issue. It's not the type of show that can rely on the dynamic of the 2 main characters it just isn't approached in a way that works well without them. But they literally just feel like no faced NPCs. I can't even tell you what they look like. They made them worse than these 2 and their horrible dynamic.Love is war -Now to be fair. I actually think Love is War is a PERFECTLY executed SoL romcom. Every single character has a great presence, even if they have a 2 minute appearance. Despite it being focused on the metaphor and the war of submission in the name of love, it perfectly executed fun characters, and very memorable ones. Which is the exact opposite of Shikimori.I think that gets the point across. Basically it's a show where basically nothing exists but the 2 characters. One is unbearably wimpy beyond anything I can think of in a show. Having to be saved by his girl from literal death every 2 mins. What in the world is entertaining about seeing her do that 40 times a episode and him say I'm sorry I'll protect you. Then never do. That's literally the whole plot. Characters show up for like 2 seconds and say basically nothing. They don't give them anything. Just a big disappointment. I may finish at the end of the season.

Except the common roles are reversed and the MC has some very bad luck. In all honesty, there was a lot of hype going into this anime which turned into a lot of hate. While I do agree that this anime is not great, it is not bad at all. In fact, it delivers some good entertainment as the show progressed. The Kamiya stuff was really gooooooood.Art: 8I liked the art. Character designs were kind of whatever minus Shikimori and Kamiya, but the colors were really popping and the animation was really smooth....All of it together made the anime really pleasant to look at.Sound: 7I thought their background music choices were kind of annoying and it was distracting at times, but the opening and endings both slap so I'm willing to forgive it.Characters: 8There was a lot of controversy surrounding the MC because of the way he acted and personally I saw no issue with it because there's nothing wrong in my opinion with being more feminine in nature. However, the whole bad luck trope was more annoying than beneficial to the plot at times. Other than that a lot of the other characters were pretty solid. The best being Kamiya and Shuu, as well as Shikimori.Story: 6Unfortunately, this was the biggest drawback for me, I dont want to keep mentioning it but when the story focused on Kamiya, those were the episodes that delivered the most, because aside from those not a lot happened and the development we got was very minuscule.

It was very good! It\'s not the most amazing slice of life anime to ever exist, sure. I see that this show gave a lot of people in the anime community high expectations and were let down because the anime was ""boring"" and that Shikimori was ""mid"" and that Izumi was ""just a weak and powerless...boy who has so much bad luck that all he can do is depend on Shikimori"" but it\'s not. It\'s absolutely not. But I\'ll tell you now, if you don\'t like Slice of Life Romcoms that\'s just mostly chill and mainly full of fluff, this is not for you. I, for a fact, have been very smitten over this show from the beginning, despite it having a few slow moments that I kind of got bored with, I still pretty much enjoyed this anime a lot.StoryThis show doesn\'t really give us anything much when it comes to the story, it\'s just the everyday lives of a very iconic high school couple, Shikimori and Izumi, hanging out with very fun and interesting characters as friends, and also let\'s not forget Kamiya, who\'s a very great character that I kinda wish had more screentime. Anyway, yeah. It\'s just mostly that. The backstories of Izumi and Shikimori weren\'t as dark as I expected it to be if I\'m gonna be honest, well, at least for Shikimori. Izumi\'s was okay. I wasn\'t really expecting anything much. But he\'s sure been through a lot because of him having so much bad luck. But the story with Kamiya is amazing, I just know people will very much love her and would probably cry because of her unexpectedly like I did. So yeah, it wasn\'t actually as average as people might think it is.ArtI don\'t really have anything unique to say about the artstyle of this anime. It\'s really nice and the colors were bright but satisfying to look at. And for the eyes, they were really unique and pretty! Overall a really good job! The animation is pretty smooth and it captures some small details that makes you realize that they put a lot of effort into this show. The ED is also very fun to watch. I love it. It\'s made like a little game where things are moving towards Izumi so Shikimori\'s goal is to hit all those things so that Izumi doesn\'t get hurt. It\'s fun. Overall, I just really love the art.SoundThe OP and the ED are absolute *chefs kiss* BANGERS. Very nice choice for an anime like this, it suits the show pretty well. I don\'t actually remember much from other music on the show, but I don\'t think there\'s really anything bad about it because I\'d likely notice it if the sound used was kinda off. So yeah, I also loved it.CharactersI would give this a 10 tbh if I saw more character development from the two main characters, but the whole thing with them in these 12 episodes were still pretty good. I was interested with the fact that they had reverse roles while still showing how they can be masculine or feminine. They both have fun personalities and honestly? People hating on Izumi are not seeing this very well. In fact, Izumi is a great character that even if he\'s not your typical cool male MC in most anime but he definitely has his charms that make you realize why Shikimori fell for him in the first place. And no, Shikimori is really the type of girl anyone, even the girls, would surely fall for. And once you get to know her more, you\'d fall for her even more. And this is the same case with Izumi as well, and you\'d fall even more hard when you see that he\'s really trying his best to not be just ""weak and pathetic"". So yeah, they\'re not bad characters, and their chemistry is really good! One of the best wholesome couples in anime. Like, I\'d only just want the best for them, really. I just wish we were shown more development, on them as a couple and as individuals growing on their own and growing because of each other. For the others, Hachimitsu, Nekozaki, and Inuzuka, they were all pretty much interesting and fun characters too. There\'s nothing bad about them. Hachimitsu was really the funniest out of all of them too. I like watching her a lot. Seeing Shikimori\'s brother, Fuji, was also nice. You can see how they act towards each other and how different Shikimori is at home interacting with him. He\'s a nice addition to the characters in the show even if he\'s only a side character. Kamiya is probably the best character in this show, and I wanna see more of her and know more about her, especially since she\'s the one who\'s had some really sad story here. But yeah, other characters were also okay. Shikimori and Izumi\'s parents were nice and funny too. I love how I can also see parts of myself in all the 6 characters you\'d usually see in this show. It was nice. I\'d seriously wanna be friends with them so badly if I could. They\'re sure there but they\'re not ""just there"". It\'s more than that. They\'re interesting and I really love all of them.EnjoymentI think from what I said so far you already know that I really had a fun time with this show. I suggest not binging this show tho, as I think it\'s better just watching a few episodes a day or whenever you just have extra time of just wanna relax and watch the romance and friendships in this show.-So... yeah. Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san was overall a very good anime, and I\'d highly recommend it for people who just want a fun time watching a show full of fluff about a high school couple who already are dating, and them spending time with family, friends, classmates, and also just the two of them in general. It\'s not for you if you want a more story driven slice of life romcom, and if you want to see a slow burn romance or just a story where the show starts with them being friends and becoming lovers in the story eventually. Big kudos to everyone who\'s worked on this from the drawings to the animations to the coloring to the music production and to the voice acting, and everything else for working hard despite it getting delays due to the studio being affected by the virus too! boy who has so much bad luck that all he can do is depend on Shikimori"" but it\'s not. It\'s absolutely not. But I\'ll tell you now, if you don\'t like Slice of Life Romcoms that\'s just mostly chill and mainly full of fluff, this is not for you. I, for a fact, have been very smitten over this show from the beginning, despite it having a few slow moments that I kind of got bored with, I still pretty much enjoyed this anime a lot.StoryThis show doesn\'t really give us anything much when it comes to the story, it\'s just the everyday lives of a very iconic high school couple, Shikimori and Izumi, hanging out with very fun and interesting characters as friends, and also let\'s not forget Kamiya, who\'s a very great character that I kinda wish had more screentime. Anyway, yeah. It\'s just mostly that. The backstories of Izumi and Shikimori weren\'t as dark as I expected it to be if I\'m gonna be honest, well, at least for Shikimori. Izumi\'s was okay. I wasn\'t really expecting anything much. But he\'s sure been through a lot because of him having so much bad luck. But the story with Kamiya is amazing, I just know people will very much love her and would probably cry because of her unexpectedly like I did. So yeah, it wasn\'t actually as average as people might think it is.ArtI don\'t really have anything unique to say about the artstyle of this anime. It\'s really nice and the colors were bright but satisfying to look at. And for the eyes, they were really unique and pretty! Overall a really good job! The animation is pretty smooth and it captures some small details that makes you realize that they put a lot of effort into this show. The ED is also very fun to watch. I love it. It\'s made like a little game where things are moving towards Izumi so Shikimori\'s goal is to hit all those things so that Izumi doesn\'t get hurt. It\'s fun. Overall, I just really love the art.SoundThe OP and the ED are absolute *chefs kiss* BANGERS. Very nice choice for an anime like this, it suits the show pretty well. I don\'t actually remember much from other music on the show, but I don\'t think there\'s really anything bad about it because I\'d likely notice it if the sound used was kinda off. So yeah, I also loved it.CharactersI would give this a 10 tbh if I saw more character development from the two main characters, but the whole thing with them in these 12 episodes were still pretty good.

They also seem to be enjoying themselves and that can really make a lasting impression on a viewer.Unfortunately, the relationship does not seem to develop. The whole plot is about male main character being 'unlucky', while Shikimori, his girlfriend, is being 'cool' and saves her boyfriend from various shenanigans. Nothing is really 'cool' about her. Just switches personality while saving her boyfriend from 'bad luck' (which he...suffers from since he can remember) and then immediately switches back to being cute and caring girlfriend.There is no problem revolving around their relationship and that’s probably the main problem of the whole story – it's bland. Most of the time, they are enjoying themselves and hanging with their friends that are there just for the sake of being there and showing to us, that our lovely couple has friends.

Nothing in the story stands out, and while the main girl is great, cute and cool, the male lead is of course not interesting, with much of his personality being easily flustered and apologetic about his bad luck.But that being said, when you see anime like Tsuki Ga Kirei being rated an average 8.00 in here despite BOTH MCs being bland as hell and barely having any infatuation or interaction with one another, you gotta question why this show got rated lower than that. This show does what it sets...out to do: Depict a wholesome, slightly awkward relationship of a very cool girl and a lame guy in high school. That's it. But at least you can see a little bit into why the girl likes the guy (In episode 11). And no matter how stupid the reason is, you have to admit that stupid reasons for liking people is common in romance. A series like Takagi-San bears a highly unsurprising resemblance to the dynamic shown here, with Takagi being seemingly psychic at times with being always one step ahead and Nishikata being your lame, pathetic male MC. The only thing that might put you off this show is the fact that they're highschoolers instead of middle schoolers, but the same dynamic from the Takagi series is here nonetheless.My only complaint is that the girl flips too often from being cool to being shy. It feels like she behaves inconsistently at times, but after a while, it's easy to get used to it.All things considered, this is an okay show if you don't mind just switching your brain off for a bit and you do want to look at wholesome simple things. I'd personally rate it 7/10 but in the interest of being the devil's advocate to the low ratings, I rated it at 8. Don't expect too much, but atleast the main characters have a sliver of chemistry.

I like the chemistry between the main and side characters. The core group along with Hachimitsu, Nekozaki, and Inuzuka work really well. Hachimitsu is particularly excellent. The Kamiya arc was decent. I think Izumi's parents are a nice addition to the show, and Shikimori's brother has some good moments, as well.The confusing: I didn't read the manga (yet), but I really thought the show was...going to go in a different direction. You have Shikimori acting like a total wild card bad ass in a very stylized way in the intro and the first episode, and I kept expecting it to have more to her story than meets the eye. It ended up with a very straightforward romance direction, which was nice and sweet, but not expected to me, at least.The bad: For some reason that I can't really explain, I feel the execution just really fell flat, particularly with the finale. The show lost some momentum leading up to it. Some of the animation choices were a bit odd with the main duo's facial expressions in what should have been powerful moments, and it kind of took me out of it.

The main characters start as a couple, and the show doesn't know what to...do with them.

Regardless of everything I said in this review I still enjoyed the series despite stopping at episode 6."", 'The reason why this show was bad to me is fairly simple. The main character, Izumi, is the biggest soyboy I have laid eyes upon in the longest time. On multiple instances while watching, I had to question out loud ""Why does this guy even have any friends?"" It is that bad. His main schtick is that he is plagued with terrible luck to a sometimes life threatening level, and to go with that, Shikimori is the only character who can handle being Izumi\'s partner because she\'s cool enough I guess. Inuzuuka had to be with Izumi without Shikimori being in the general vicinity for...a day and he practically came out the other end crippled. Izumi loses belongings even when he knows he will lose them, natural sunlight on a summer day more or less incapacitates him, and it\'s not an exaggeration to say that he would either be unable to ever step foot outside or dead without Shikimori.However, the show does have its few saving graces.1. The side characters are rather interesting and I find myself much more invested in them rather than Shikimori and Izumi.2. (The BIGGEST reason why the ratings I have on this show is as high as it is...) This is the PERFECT show to laugh at how bad it is with a group of friends. This is also the reason why I actually was able to finish the show instead of dropping it.3. Hachimitsu (the blonde shorty with rainbow eyes). She\'s constantly in a zoinked out state and she\'s actually funny. One of me and my friends\' favorite things to do while watching is count how many times she actually blinks in each episode.4. The OP is kinda catchy.To summarize, watch with friends to have a good time making fun of it, otherwise try your hardest to forget Izumi was ever a character in anime history after you\'re done watching. a day and he practically came out the other end crippled.

Having read a fair bit of the manga (which is quite good mind you), I find myself disappointed in this adaptation. This show pretty much forsakes any of the story seen in the manga. This feels more like a loosely connected string of episodes in chronological order rather than a coherent story. It irked me that the vast majority of this is anime original. Where the manga was fairly cute, it didn't just rely on that to tell a fun story. The anime comes off as a copout which had a lot of potential. I'll...have more to say about this when it finishes airing. Now to actually judge the anime on more concrete factors. The art is good, I enjoy how everything just pops. The sound is okay but the music is fucking annoying, the show would be measurably better if it stopped playing Shikimori's theme everytime she fucking breathes.

Despite the 4/10, this show is neither horrendous nor amazing, just below average. I do try to use the full 1-10 range, with 3s being pretty bad, 2s are awful and 1 being everything has gone wrong.Shikimori's Not Just a Cutie is a 4/10 for me, below average, lacking in story and character development and just not my thing. This was one of the only shows in my selection of titles for Spring 2022 that I decided to watch, that I actually dropped. Made it about 5 episodes in and just lost all interest as...other titles in the simulcast season held my attention a lot more. I am sure there are people who will find enjoyment in this show, so this review is by no means trying to belittle their experience with this show. I will still see this season through in the coming days as background to my work, but let's get into why this show was dropped.My major issue with this show is the characters and that is what I will focus on the most as they disrupt the story and enjoyment of the show. While the show is titled after the co-lead Shikimori, I am going to start off with talking about Izumi. Yeah the dudes a beta. Am I fine with beta dudes? Sure. To the point that its not just a bit each episode, but almost every bit? No. The clumsiness, unawareness and just bad luck this guy has was a good starting point, but 5 episodes in, the guy just feels useless. I am not a fan of a complete alpha either as a main protagonist, as most people lie somewhere in between on the spectrum. Izumi is weighted a bit too far on the Jar Jar Binks side of things and I will have to see if he can actually do something in future episodes.Shikimori is the opposite as I am sure the creator did on purpose. The bestest ever, but decides to stick with the worstest ever. Similar to how I dislike the extreme of Izumi; I am also put off by the extreme of Shikimori. 5 episodes was enough to burn me out on these unrealistic extreme and both main characters. Both do not even feel like real people, rather just exaggerated caricatures. Hard to be invested when you dont even buy the main characters or have any vested interest in them.For the side characters there is even less to speak on. Hachimitsu and Inuzuka are nice enough to have, but not enough to carry the show for the main duo. They feel like worse copies of characters I have seen in other anime, while the rest of the supporting cast isn't even worth mentioning.This is a romantic comedy, but I feel like there could have been a lot more to this story if it was a bit more serious. Instead of Izumi being the butt of a lot of jokes, a more down to earth story could have gone a lot farther in feeling anything about this show. Fine enough for being on in the background. 4/10 other titles in the simulcast season held my attention a lot more.

No pointless three episode rule or anything - completely dead on impact and a perfect example of how a slice of life show can fail.Hidden by good animation, character gestures and boring frames show an inherent laziness. Not everything needs to have references or obvert goofiness to spice up the visuals, but having a...unique quality like that makes everything seem so much more alive. A nice OP and ED (the one thing that benefits from the paper-thin plot) sandwich a mediocre middle.The reason I found Shikimori-san to be a test of endurance is how everything seems undeserved. Moments are presented in grand, spectacular fashion as if they\'re animation crescendos, important scenes that\'ll be engraved for years to come... yet they come with characters that haven\'t grown. Scenes don\'t feel like an excuse to let the audience learn to love the characters by simply witnessing them, but rather convenient set-ups without emotional backbone, all for payoffs that fall flat.A terrible decision is to characterize Izumi and Shikimori late into the season. The episode showcases their lives before each other which makes their motivations and fears and their, well, characters, all that more lifelike. Hell, starting with them already dating was a fumble from the offset. The two act as if they\'re lightly flirting with each other, but they\'ve actually been dating for a full year. Of course there\'s a cultural gap and every show doesn\'t need to have the same romantic elements and things vary from person to person, but when the central relationship isn\'t believable, that\'s a problem.Hollow. The comedic efforts of bad luck and badass didn\'t work and following their school life didn\'t appeal to me. Probably my least favorite of the season. unique quality like that makes everything seem so much more alive.

Probably my least favorite of the season.', ""--This review does not contain spoilers--Go to the very end for TLDROne issue with the manga/anime industry is that franchises are often created to milk some money with cute girls. Just like Sono Bisque Doll wa Koi wo Suru and other franchises, Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is another example of trying to milk some money with cute girls. Sure, it may be pretty fun at the start for some people, but it ends up as a boring, typical, and cliched show, which I'm not even surprised with.The story follows our two lovers Shikimori and Izumi, in which Izumi, someone who is affected by...terrible luck, always has Shikimori saving him with minimal injuries. With Izumi and his bad luck, he still lives a high school life with his friends.One major problem with Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san and the story is that it's always cliched and is stupid for the most part. The story is very low effort with overused tropes from the typical romcom show. An example of how cliched Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is the main character's class/team winning a sports event barely; just barely. Things like this often got myself nearly sleeping, because of always seeing the same thing again. Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san was boring all the way; from the start to the finish. Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san did find a way to be somewhat creative with a tsundere protecting her useless boyfriend, but it was still generic and typical.One of the two things that I can positively comment about Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is the art. It's bright and is consistent; despite being affected by the covid pandemic TWICE. That's right. Anyways, the backgrounds look very bright and simple, the characters look really bright and fluid. A minor issue is that faces are sometimes empty at some scenes. That's a rather minor complaint though.The second thing that I can positively comment about Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is the sound. The sound is typical, but is well-timed and fits very well. Sure, it isn't mind-blowing or outstanding, but the job was done just enough. I had no problem with the VAs either. They all fit well for the characters. And for the OST, it was fine. I didn't really have anything to hate about the song, except for Shikimori getting jealous at Inuzaka being more close to Izumi.I thought that the story was going to be the only pathetic part in the series; god was I wrong. The characters in The second thing that I can positively comment about Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san are horrendous. Literally most of the characters are copy paste if not all are. I'll be dividing each character into sections.Izumi is that two dimensional romcom boyfriend who's just plain nice. He just feels too simple and lacking depth. I never really liked anything about Izumi, because he's absolutely useless and very stupid. He doesn't know how to actually counter his bad luck properly, doing stupid things e.g Izumi loses his wallet. What will he do with his new wallet? He does something silly without taking in consideration about what could happen and create some made up situations.Shikimori is your average tsundere. She blushes when you compliment her. Just like Izumi, Shikimori is a two dimensional character. I found nothing to like about her. She's just a competitive tsundere. That's all. The author of the franchise tries to make Shikimori an original character but ends up as a failure + a copy paste character. What's worse, she gets jealous of Inuzaka when he goes and acts like a bro to Izumi. She gets jealous for some reason, which is so dang stupid.What's next? Nekozaki. She's another two dimensional copy paste romcom character. She's that one cheerful/energetic and competitive girl that I've seen in other anime.Inuzaka is another copy paste character. You know that there's that one friend that acts like a brother to the main character. I've seen that everywhere. Inuzaka is basically that. A two dimensional and a copy paste character.And finally, Hachimitsu. Probably the only decent character in the series. She's just a chill, calm girl. So what could you possibly like about her character? nothing. What about dislikes? none. That's right. Despite being so two dimensional, Hachimitsu is the best main character friend.There's no way I could enjoy Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san. The story is a dreadful and cliched. I often found myself tired and wanted to get a sleep, because I would always get a headache watching this. It's a miracle that I was even able to finish this. I still had hopes that it would get better but I was wrong. Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san kept at the same pace of being very bad in general as an anime and as a romcom. Sure, there were a few enjoyable scenes, which was around 4-5. I probably had less scenes then 4-5 to enjoy.TLDR/Conclusion to summarise it.Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is a very bad anime in general. It's cliched, the characters are horrible, and it's boring from the start to finish. The only good things are the sound and art/animation. I do not recommend watching this at all.

This show is a classic example of a romance show that has a trope that is more or less forgotten about for the most part halfway through and then comes back in the closing credits of its final episode. Though the bad luck persists it goes from bad luck to just unfortunate errors. Therefore this is just a romance with a bad trope.The art is really nice and I love the work with...the eyes, it really makes it feel good.The sound is fine, they fit well and suit nicely.The characters revolve around 2 since it is romance and you cycle through other characters that like the main character. God forbid other people in the group are allowed a girlfriend, boyfriend or whatever they want in a partner.The issue with this is the over-the-top way the show goes and I want to know what fantasy the writer lives in. Aside from that the bad play out of the trope of bad luck just doesn't land. This is bang in the middle, without the trope it is a good solid romance just an over-the-top one and with the trope, it just sorts sucks its own life away.5/10.

Creative and original, however, will be eventually forgotten because of its lack of intriguing elements. Though, to be frank, I particularly do not dislike the anime while I do agree that the criticism is irrefutably justified, the anime is somewhat enjoyable even with all the mediocre setting and overused jokes gave the fact it’s a rom-com.Warning: Minor spoilers ahead.The bulk of the story heavily emphasises how the main couple is going on with their daily high-school lives. It’s an episodic romantic comedy primarily focusing on how the heroine...saves the protagonist from a plethora of unfortunate situations, no matter how ludicrous or insane it gets, though it does follow a continuous storyline at times. Eventually, it changes up the formula by providing more screen time to the side characters, (though they never develop to a satisfactory degree or invoke a sense of attachment to them.) or exhausting the main guy’s screentime, which is always a good thing since I don’t like the main guy. I am aware that it is overly reliant on the main guy’s absurd bad luck since that is what drives the plot or to be more accurate, it is an essential plot device to eventually allow other characters to stand out. Although, the story feels like some sort of fetish catered to viewers who can’t help but think of their significant others as overly dependent babies.Either you hate this series, or you will find it alright. If you hate it, it’s mostly because of Izumi or Shikimori, who are conveniently written to portray as the author intended. Though, as I have stated, the result is a weird fetish being brought to life with bright colours and a light-hearted environment as if you were inside a dream. The anime can be somewhat enjoyable because while the protagonist needs saving is horribly hard to watch, the overall story and positive tone are done a well decent job if you can forget about the main selling point of the anime. It can easily fix that if the main guy is provided with a lesser role like being a side or sporadic character in the anime (or rather be superseded by another character) and shift its whole focus onto Shikimori being cool to everyone else she meets instead of saving her boyfriend just because her spider senses were tingling.Shikimori is written as this domineering, aggressive, and attractive significant other who will lead her man while Izumi is portrayed as an effeminate, meek, and soft man who requires someone to rescue him since he is the damsel in distress due to his extraordinarily bad luck. To further tell you what Izumi is, he squeals whenever he gets spooked, he gets complimented for his hair being beautiful (not the word cool), and is more associated with indoor activities like cooking, reading, watching light movies, etc. They were destined to be together; people seemingly think to write them off as bland or dull, but from my point of view, they are not as they claimed. Instead, I would say these are characters who overly play their main characteristics as jokes in a superfluous manner, and it falls short because of its mediocre writing and weak timing. I admit, this show does get a few giggles out of me, but most of the jokes unsurprisingly fall flat. Even though it establishes the main couple as already in a relationship, it somehow manages to put a little of NTR just for poking fun at the main couple.Although, I can’t help but think that the premise is not being optimised to its full potential. Izumi can be made more interesting if it utilises his bad luck to involve the characters that are going through their own crisis that must be taken seriously rather than being used for comedic effect or pushing forward its main agenda. But then again, it is at its core a romantic comedy, so any of these dramas would hurt the light-hearted tone it displays and would somehow turn Izumi into a villain, rather ugly to say. While it does display Izumi's attempts to solve his internal issues, it never seems to be utilised or proven on how Izumi attempts to change himself for the better since the anime is fixed on showing the comedic side of things and never undergoes any major developments. In the end, every character that exists in this anime feels bland and makes the show a chore to go through.The side characters are poor if I’m being honest. Inuzuka is one of the side characters which I like but he is basically the inferior version of Karma and never goes through any substantial development unlike the two other side characters, which I will get into now. Additionally, Nekozaki is quite deplorable since her screen-time is comprised of her shouting admiration of Shikimori being not just a cutie and being the girl who has the supposed mindset of a grade-schooler who can’t think of anything but fun. Hachimitsu is assumably the self-insert character because everyone seems to be able to relate to this character being lazy and cynical. Besides that, the other side characters either have one or two purposes worshipping Shikimori as their idol (“I can’t believe this is a girl’s game!” or “That girl is so cute/cool!”) or corresponding to Izumi’s antics in his everyday life, regardless of their purpose, their main existence is to become fodder for the characters to shine. On the other hand, it introduces similar characters with identical features (for example, their parents) to show their specific origins. Therefore, whilst our knowledge expands further but it becomes thoroughly clear to me that the author ran out of ideas.The only character that I know had me intrigued was Kamiya, another female character who’s also a high-school icon, who acts as the foil of Shikimori, though similarly athletic and attractive, she’s aloof and not quite the friendly type, unlike her counterpart. It helps add another layer of interest to both Kamiya and Shikimori but then later the mystery died with a whimper after it reveals that Kamiya is affectionately interested in Izumi, an extraordinarily monotonous character and acts indifferently to her suspicious enthusiasm towards him. It is a shame to have its only decently written character be reduced to a girl who unconditionally likes the main protagonist.From an art standpoint, there’s not much to say about it. While the character designs and background environment are vibrant and dazzling thanks to Doga Kobo, there are times when 3D animation is used, for instance, whereas the 1st episode where pins are animated differently, may be due to budget issues. Other than that, you have your classic rom-com with a few spectacular scenes that may contain fluid choreography or beautiful close-up shots.There is a bit of a payoff if you take the time to rewatch the first few episodes. For instance, Shikimori calls her boyfriend Ijumi-san in the 1st episode. If you watched the 11th episode, it would then make sense why she would call him that. This somewhat grants the show some replayability but the timing is also slightly bizarre since it’s so far off and subtle. It’s also quite a stretch since the show somewhat expects you to come back and rewatch the series. Even though that’s eventually what I did.To conclude, after rewatching some of the episodes and discerning the series, the anime is decent at best. It is not some dumpster fire or cringe-fest that people seem to declare about this anime, after all, it’s a mediocre comedy with stagnant romance progression even after establishing their relationship as they’re dating. It flamboyantly tries to entice viewers with the role reversal play and fanservice only to be downplayed by the repetitive jokes and shallow characters.Thank you for reading. saves the protagonist from a plethora of unfortunate situations, no matter how ludicrous or insane it gets, though it does follow a continuous storyline at times.

It\'s a hook that is really interesting and the massive hype from the general anime community before the show aired is emblematic of that.However, after the first few episodes the show got bombarded by negative reviews because Shikimori showed exactly what was promised: A cute romance story about a couple that are already dating. Nothing more, nothing less. The problem...for most is that is was also JUST that premise. No drama, no conflict, no development. On paper, it sounds like a very boring show and I can understand why some might think that if they aren\'t hooked immediately.But for my personal opinion, I think the show is vastly over hated.If you\'re going in expecting it to have frustrating relationship drama or unnecessary angst, then you\'re only setting yourself up for disappointment. It\'s a cute show that\'s supposed to make you feel good, that\'s it. It\'s not everyone\'s cup of tea, but if you have the right mindset and curb your high expectations, then it\'s a show that should fill you with ""the good feels"" every episode and leave you sad once you realize it\'s over.The first 2 episodes were really enjoyable due to the fact that Shikimori and Izumi are together. The middle episodes was the only area where it can drag since it\'s the main characters just enjoying life. But then everything after episode 7 was great, even more interesting than everything the show has shown so far.It\'s a shame that so much of the hate came in the middle episodes, and people dropped the show right before the interesting episodes happen due to the ""3 episodes rule"" that most diehard anime fans have. If you decide to watch the show or have previously dropped it, then I highly recommend you at least give the later episodes a chance because you\'re really missing out on the best parts of the show.I think the cast of characters were great. Each one had a sizeable amount of screen time, distinct personalities, and were all likeable (Kamiya best girl). The weakest link is obviously Izumi and I won\'t deny that his cliche can get a bit much. However, he alone doesn\'t ruin the show when there are so many other fun characters and his ""bad luck syndrome"" only occasionally appears.Shikimori is just as obviously the star character. She\'s design to be the perfect girl, but a lot of her charm comes from when she shows her other various sides of her character (determined, angry, flustered, jealous etc.).Every other character could also hold their own and the show explores the different dynamic each characters have with each other, not just focusing on Izumi/Shikimori, and I\'d argue that these dynamics are just as interesting as our main couple.The art style is beautiful and the animation is serviceable for a romance show. The OP and ED are also great, with each of them being both bangers and enjoyable to watch every time.In conclusion, Shikimori is a great show if you want to feel good about a wholesome and healthy relationship.Not everything needs to be filled with drama and negativity. And I think the people who call it boring have forgotten what it\'s like to watch a multi-season romance anime where nothing happens with the main couple until the end. The ""Will they, won\'t they"" formula isn\'t for everyone, especially someone like me who is sick of the frustrating suspension of disbelief over how some of those shows justify their main couple dancing around a confession and act like unrealistic anime stereotypes.Likewise, this show isn\'t for everyone. But for those it is made for, it\'s a wholesome show that will give you a good time.9/10 for most is that is was also JUST that premise. No drama, no conflict, no development.

I thought about it for quite some time before penning this review and to be quite honest I\'m still not completely sure why I feel this way. I can\'t name any big ticket issue; it was really more a collection of minor grievances that led to this unfulfilled feeling.I think many of the problems people will have with Kawaii dake ja Nai are going to about the two lead characters and...I can see where they\'re coming from. The writer had a brilliant idea to reverse the typical romcom gender roles and it was honestly looking quite promising at first, but somewhere along the line they forgot to give Shikimori and Izumi actual personalities beyond ""cool"" and ""nice but unlucky"" respectively. It doesn\'t help that all the character development for those two happens in flashbacks in the latter half of the season. Izumi\'s bad luck is funny for the first few episodes but quickly becomes a frustrating roadblock when he tries to plan or do something cool.As others have noted, the show is also very trope heavy. Moments in the show that should have been deep and meaningful are instead replaced by generalities that could have been uttered by any other pair in any other romcom ever.This gives it a very false taste and greatly detracts from the positives of the show.And positives do exist. I for one really liked their three friends and how all five of them fit together and interacted with each other. In addition, while I think the Kamiya arc was a bit heavy-handed her character is very interesting and I would have loved to see more of her in the show instead of simply being a catalyst for more virtue signaling by the two leads.The art was pretty good. Not the best I\'ve seen and a bit overdone at times (just like the cheese) but for the most part relaxing and cute. I really liked the VA\'s as well. Overall, it wasn\'t bad. But it was just lacking that crucial spark, some kind of special chemistry between the leads perhaps, that would have set it apart. I can see where they\'re coming from.

Whilst the series does have its moments that can make you smile through its humour or general story enjoyment, it is so overhyped yet so underwhelming that you will just be in for a massive letdown if you think this is any better than the standard romance revolving around a weak-minded male character struggling to make basic conversation.This art style is probably the saving grace of this entire series, stopping me from giving...it an even lower school.  It is clear that a lot of effort and love went into making this series and the animators did a very good job, especially considering the dull story they had to work with.The voice acting wasn't terrible but wasn't particularly spectacular either... apart from Shuu's voice (Nobuhiko Okamoto) but that is because he is generally just a great performer in every role he plays. The intro is nice and the outro is funny, but neither are the type to prompt you to look them up on YouTube and listen to them in your spare time.Shikimori (Micchon, Mi-chan) - The main female protagonist and the girlfriend of Yuu Izumi.Yuu Izumi (Ijumi) - The main male protagonist and the boyfriend of Shikimori. it an even lower school.

Second I watched all 12 episodes so none can say it gets better cause it doesn\'t, it actually gets progressively worse. Where can I start, the pointless story, yes the story is pointless and people who say this is a slice of life anime, pls stop talking I have seen slice of life like Usagi Drop and even slice of life have a point to the story but this anime doesn\'t have a point, it is just aimless chatter over and over again, the...characters don\'t progress, the side characters except from Kamiya are absolutely bland with 0 things interesting abound them.After the pointless story let\'s continue with the absolutely disgusting relationship between the 2 main characters. I have seen over 150 days\' worth of anime and only one other time I despised a main character from an anime and that says something. The anime starts with the relationship already established and that makes me feel that every single scene with them together isn\'t earned and all those ""romantic"" stuff feel appalling because of that. The bad luck thing gets old and progressively annoying fast. Also, I absolutely hate everything about shikimori as a character, she is the worst character I have ever seen in an anime.This anime and story in general, is pointless, with no direction, no character progression, no interesting plots, and absolutely nothing to look forward to. This story taught me one thing, to read more about an anime before I put it in my plan to watch cause this was torture.Stay away at all costs, and to all those who say this is a slice of life, again I say shut up, there are slice-of-life anime who are amazing, and calling this slice of life is an insult to those anime. characters don\'t progress, the side characters except from Kamiya are absolutely bland with 0 things interesting abound them.After the pointless story let\'s continue with the absolutely disgusting relationship between the 2 main characters.

So that’s what Kawaii dake ja nai Shikimori-san is about, a boy named Izumi and a girl named Shikimori that are boyfriends and we follow them while they spend time together both with their friends and as a couple, so don’t expect an actually deep plot.Izumi and Shikimori‘s relationship is...more on the side where the girl is the one with the dominant dynamic on this one, since Izumi is pretty clumsy and gets in a lot of problems for his bad luck Shikimori is there to protect him and helping him, they care for each other and she doesn’t hit him because she got embarrassed by him or something if you worry about those stuff. Despite being said that have been dating for a year they seem to have started dating like a week ago, they still blush a lot to each other and they don’t even kiss, I have friends that turned into couple that have kissed more in a day than these two across the whole anime. However, despite their relationship not seeming as advanced as they say it is, they still have their cute moments specially when they aren’t just “she’s so cute” or blushing an giggling, like I really liked the scene when they were talking on phone in the night, on the festival was also nice, and when Izumi gifted Shikimori that necklace, and the date of the last episode were actually cute couple moments, so they relationship isn’t all that bad nor basic but it is still lacking in some areas.About their friends, they at the start seem pretty dull, across the episodes we get to see more of them fleshing out their characters a little even is still quite basic, Inuzuka is actually a good friend and not some of the other friends in animes that want the MC dead for being with a girl. Nekozaki is a pretty active and extroverted. Hachimitsu seems like dead inside (just look at her eyes), but it is understandable and she is actually pretty funny with her one-liners. I think the best part about them was the episode in the sports festival of the school, the interactions of that episode between all of them come across much better than before and you actually see them being more friends than the dull stuff they were doing at the beginning.I actually think the most interesting side character was Kamiya due to adding a little something for a while to the series in her arc, even though she is cool and distant towards everyone, she isn’t actually that reserved and her inner self is something that Izumi noticed so that’s why she feels stuff for him, however she knows that she can’t be with him because he already has a girlfriend, the stuff between her and Shikimori about Izumi got resolved so nicely, there wasn’t some kind of discussion or some kind of drama that kept going for episodes, they solved it right there after talking for a while, and despite still not being over Izumi she understands and tries to get over it, sad that we saw so little of her.I think there is a little problem with the comedy, most of the time it isn’t funny, let’s see a lot of the time this will come down to Izumi’s bad luck which aside from being repetitive (it is character’s quirk after all) it also comes down too slowly, every joke made with this is extremely predictable from the floors to the football game, the punchline just comes too slow to be funny, good thing by latter episodes this got reduced to much less scenes and while till not funny it was much more bearable, but as I said above the bright side of the comedy is mostly relied on Izumi and Shikimori’s friends.The art is pretty colorful and bright, the animation while not top tier still looks good. The opening song is pretty nice, some parts of the video may not fit with the series like at the video where the start of the chorus is, the series of events may be more metaphorical or something than actually showing something that you’ll going to see, however the opening video still looks very good and the song is definitely a very good one. The ending song while the song itself not that special the video is something that I love to watch, it’s almost like a videogame and seems like something like I would play.So Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is definitely not a series that will make you go crazy, but if you want to see two people already in a couple instead of waiting for like 2-3 seasons for they to get together and if you also want a relationship in which the most dominant is the girl then you can have some nice time with this series.Thank you for reading. more on the side where the girl is the one with the dominant dynamic on this one, since Izumi is pretty clumsy and gets in a lot of problems for his bad luck Shikimori is there to protect him and helping him, they care for each other and she doesn’t hit him because she got embarrassed by him or something if you worry about those stuff.

I think the best part about them was the episode in the sports festival of the school, the interactions of that episode between all of them come across much better than before and you actually see them being more friends than the dull stuff they were doing at the beginning.I actually think the most interesting side character was Kamiya due to adding a little something for a while to the series in her arc, even though she is cool and distant towards everyone, she isn’t actually that reserved and her inner self is something that Izumi noticed so that’s why she feels stuff for him, however she knows that she can’t be with him because he already has a girlfriend, the stuff between her and Shikimori about Izumi got resolved so nicely, there wasn’t some kind of discussion or some kind of drama that kept going for episodes, they solved it right there after talking for a while, and despite still not being over Izumi she understands and tries to get over it, sad that we saw so little of her.I think there is a little problem with the comedy, most of the time it isn’t funny, let’s see a lot of the time this will come down to Izumi’s bad luck which aside from being repetitive (it is character’s quirk after all) it also comes down too slowly, every joke made with this is extremely predictable from the floors to the football game, the punchline just comes too slow to be funny, good thing by latter episodes this got reduced to much less scenes and while till not funny it was much more bearable, but as I said above the bright side of the comedy is mostly relied on Izumi and Shikimori’s friends.The art is pretty colorful and bright, the animation while not top tier still looks good. The opening song is pretty nice, some parts of the video may not fit with the series like at the video where the start of the chorus is, the series of events may be more metaphorical or something than actually showing something that you’ll going to see, however the opening video still looks very good and the song is definitely a very good one. The ending song while the song itself not that special the video is something that I love to watch, it’s almost like a videogame and seems like something like I would play.So Kawaii dake ja Nai Shikimori-san is definitely not a series that will make you go crazy, but if you want to see two people already in a couple instead of waiting for like 2-3 seasons for they to get together and if you also want a relationship in which the most dominant is the girl then you can have some nice time with this series.Thank you for reading.']"

Ro-Kyu-Bu!: Tomoka no Ichigo Sundae,https://myanimelist.net/anime/15807/Ro-Kyu-Bu__Tomoka_no_Ichigo_Sundae,"[""It was a really good ova, up until the point where everyone went to Subaru's house and then the perverted loli started to come out. It was a lot better without the perverted stuff. "", ""By reading this, I take it that you have seen / or are familiar with the characters, as background knowledge is needed to understand this review. I have not read the light novels nor read the manga.This is all based on the first season, as well as this OVA.Ro-Kyu-Bu OVA is a story primarily focused on Tomoka. And how much her friends care for her. By that said, some fanservice is always added to make the story more enjoyable. You will either enjoy this or you will detest how the OVA presents it.Speaking of characters. There's nothing much to say. We get to know...the characters better, the bound is getting stronger. And we are getting excited for season two. However, a new character is introduced. She gets some screen time, but will she get more screen time in season two? This is still a question, and we still don't know if she will have an impact on the story. The sad thing is that not every character from season one got screen time in this OVA. I hope they will make a comeback in season two! (Gogo sidecharacters!!)Unfortunately, the OP and ED is the same as the first season. But this is to be expected as this OVA is an episode which leads to season two. Luckily the OST is the same old, good soundtracks. (and if you have not heard the characters song, I recommend you to). A thing which really caught my attention is the Party love! song in an instrumental version played by a violin. I cant recall this from season one, however, it made a good impact on me. And I really loved it.Personally, I am a big fan of this series. And was really glad when it announced an OVA AND a second season. The artwork has a big role here. This type of artwork is really beautiful in my opinion. And I will never get tired of it. The producers have done a great job forming this anime. Regarding the enjoyment, you may call me whatever you want, but personally I find this OVA really enjoyable. I was really smiling while watching. However, if you are a person who dislikes this sort of anime, you might find this OVA with this particularly fanservice rather boring or pointless. However, if you find it ok, or with an 'it's better than nothing thought'. I will really recommend you to watch this simple little OVA. It might possibly lighten up your day!Like I mentioned before, the entire story shows the bound of friendship between Tomoka and her friends. This main theme is very visible from the beginning. And personally I think showing the theme from the very beginning is not a wrong direction to start with. The story actually starts with a parallel action, one part being Subaru and Tomoka, and the other part being Tomoka's friend. The connection between these two parts are good simulated. And it shows off the bound between ALL the characters. But the method used to bring these two parts together is rather old school, thus making it way to obvious. But in the end, the story reaches its goal and forms a stronger bound between all the characters. To make the story float, every character have its own 'scene' to show off their good old personality from season one. The OVA ends with a good match of Basket. Thus the theme of basket is still kept. Nothing have changed since the first season as well, and every character are happily gathered to show you an episode of Ro-Kyu-Bu! the characters better, the bound is getting stronger. And we are getting excited for season two. However, a new character is introduced. She gets some screen time, but will she get more screen time in season two?

Release the Spyce,https://myanimelist.net/anime/37221/Release_the_Spyce,"['Release the Spyce can be a serious competitor for the cartoon “Totally Spies” from Western and Princess Principal (I still consider the latter better). The main difference, the type of missions and the main characters. There is a mysterious taint created during all the episodes. Also, the bad commentaries do not give merit to the show and it deserves some praise. It is not that abysmal, and it is more entertaining than some shows of the same genre and it is highly better compared with some disasters from the season .. Gob..On the other hand, the series at the beginning has a cartoonish...behavior. For example, the heroines defeat the bad guys with some easy tasks, gadgets, skills gained from the spice, and they are ready for the next mission like the American toons. Lucky for all, the story revealed a very significant twist, and the outcome improved the whole show.--The story--The story is too easy to follow. A group of heroines (Tsukikage) has a unique goal of protecting their beloved city (Sorasaki) from any criminal, including the organization called Moryo. One day, a Momo high student is involved in a Tsukikage operation and is recruited. This group has the Master and apprentice scheme. Momo is assigned a Master (Yuki) who trains her in martial and sword arts. There are other members of the group, for example, Mei and her student Fuu. Each pair had different skills, techniques and combined they are robust against criminals. These spies are young girls who use their student status as a cover. When duty demands, they become an active group with one unique goal. The city of Sorasaki is the center where the plot is developed, but some actions outside it affect the plot directly.One of the issues found, in the middle of the show the plot could be seen as too fantastic, cartoonish and focused on children where the good guy always wins. For example, I am the good spy, I throw a kick, and all the villains fall into the ground, easy, right?. This kind of outcome could be annoying for a more mature spectator seeking for some entertainment. However, as the plot advances, the mysteries are more prominent, and there is a breaking point that surprised several of the spectators, it creates a mysterious and dark atmosphere that you will love.Lastly, the pacing is acceptable. The plot advances constantly. Some details will hook the spectators even more. However, in certain parts, I think they beat some villains very easily. No idea if it is because they needed to rush the plot, but it was too easy and leaves you the impression that the show lacks something but is not a big issue. Overall, Release the Spyce is one of the best shows that I have seen in 2018.--Characters—The story has heroines and villains. The Tsukikage group are the heroes and has six members:Momo aka the noob aka tongue. She is the main character. In the beginning, she is insecure, weak, coward. She wanted to protect the city because her father was a police, but she does not have the courage. After she was recruited, her character evolved and thanks to Yuki, she surpassed her fears. She has a unique ability that is helpful under some circumstances.Yuki aka badass with a sword. She is strict, hard worker, intelligent, and very skilled with a sword and martial arts. She trains Momo, and for me, she is the leader of Tsukikage. However, there is something weird in episode 10, but I cannot give details.Mei aka cheerful. She is my favorite character. I love her personality. She is positive, very vivid enjoys life and …. never mind. She is the most agile member and is skilled in knives, espionage, etc.Fuu aka mask. A master in disguise, I consider her like a ninja. She is like Mei, well she is her Mentee, but I think she is obsessed to be accepted.Hatsume aka brain. She is the brain of the group. Hatsume is very calm, friendly, recursive, very skilled with gadgets and with a spear. However, she thinks that even the villains can become her friends and she tries to change them during the series.Goe aka muscle. She is Hatsume disciple. She is a powerful girl that in the deep could fear her strength but tries to be calm and loves her Master deeply.The other characters are the villains, I cannot give details because I could spoil the plot.--Art and Sound—The animation quality is good. I wasn’t expecting a good animation from this show but it is acceptable, and the battles are good and pleasant to the eye. There is a combination between action and sound that fulfills the scene. The camera angles help to maintain the visual in the crucial elements. The show uses a combination of a bright and dark color palette. This technique helps to contrasts the slice of the life and the action events.The sound is acceptable. It does the job and helps to boost the sequences. The OP and ED are good. The OP has a lovely rhythm, catching, and you could end hearing it a few times.--Enjoyment—I liked the show, but there are some ""childish"" parts as I already explained. The anime can be improved, it can be a bit darker, but the outcome is acceptable. There are some boring episodes but it is not a reason to bury the show. Lastly, you should give it a try at least you can be entertained for a few hours.PS: Now I need to wait for the game in 2019. behavior.

Not because it actively tries to be one, like an entire sub-genre of “dark magical girls Madoka-wannabe” series, but because it’s a show with similar themes that succeeds in the similar ways, while being its own thing and telling a different kind of story.Like Madoka, this is a show with moe aesthetic, dark tone, yet optimistic message centered around cute girls. Also like Madoka, amusingly enough, in its very first scene it openly sets up a very dark tone, yet some people somehow miss...it and get surprised when the heads start rolling.Like Madoka, it reaps all benefits of being an original anime story, not constrained by the arc/plot structure of the source material. Meaning, it’s a single well-constructed, well-paced storyline that starts in the first episode, ends in the last, and every episode in between has a purpose in advancing this story.Finally, the style of writing is very reminiscent of signature Gen Urobuchi’s writing - gadgetry/weaponry/fighting scenes that are both impossibly cool and feel very realistic and intelligent at the same time; healthy nihilism; complex narrative threads that pay off in a long run. Supposedly, it should be similar to Akame ga Kill and YuYuYu - other series written by the actual show’s writer, but I’m not familiar with those.Now, about what Release the Spyce does different and why it deserves attention:First, the selling point of this show is suspense mystery. A single mystery. In the first episode, we are introduced to a cast of cute girl spies, oh, and by the way, one of them is a traitor and works for the enemy, enjoy your CGDCT. Over the course of the series, all of them are built up to be cinnamon rolls that you simply don’t want to suspect. Scarce clues and red herrings are dropped here and there, making you pull your hair out, trying to figure who it is. The final reveal absolutely does not disappoint, and no amount of genre awareness, trope knowledge, or even twist/cop-out expectations can prepare you for how it plays out.Camp. This is a contentious point, because not everyone enjoys camp sensibility, and this show is very, very campy. When a character is shot point-blank ten times, spends five seconds in a hospital with a bandage over their head and then is completely fine - do you think the writer does not understand how bullets work, or do you think it’s funny? Your enjoyment of this series will depend greatly on your answer. If you do love camp, prepare for a wonderful parade of middle-aged women biker gangs, contract-killing preschoolers and okinawan vikings.Yuri bait. Deserves a separate paragraph because this is a yuri bait that will yuri bait the heaven. To quote someone else’s words, it’s like the series is playing gay chicken - it tries to make things as gay as possible before turning away and saying “no homo.” All part of the same camp sensibility, and it’s hilarious.9.5/10 because it’s highly enjoyable, thought-provoking and unique series. it and get surprised when the heads start rolling.Like Madoka, it reaps all benefits of being an original anime story, not constrained by the arc/plot structure of the source material.

We live in a world where cute girls doing cute things has become part of the norm. So seeing an original show like Release the Spyce is rather refreshing. Actually, there was another show called “Princess Principal” that had similar base concepts. Yet, Release the Spyce stands out very much on its own as an action spy thriller.When we think of a franchise about espionage, the most famous one that comes to mind is James Bond 007. That franchise is not an anime but...pretty much anyone who doesn't live under a rock knows who James Bond is. When I began watching Release the Spyce, it made me curious if this show had what it takes to capture the thrill of a spy-espionage. Granted, the first few episodes establishes the show’s core concepts as we are introduced the action girls consisting of a group known as the “Tsukikage”. They use a substance known as “Spyce” to enhance their fighting abilities and hence, we get cool girls doing cool things.The main storyline details of their conflict with the Moryo, a mysterious corporation with their own dark agendas. You should probably guess that with these expected concepts, this show can get quite complex. But not really. If we just examine the show on the surface, it actually feels like a slice of life at times when detailing the characters’ everyday lives. Momo Minamoto is a typical high school girl with nothing out of the ordinary and until the day she meets Tsukikage, she’s a rather normal person. In fact, Momo is so normal that a lot of the things she is introduced to often makes causes her to react in hilarious ways. But for the most part, there’s nothing out of the ordinary at first glance until you realize what this show is about.Once we are introduced to the other main characters, it’s pretty easy to say the series capitalizes on its storytelling and character chemistry. To be honest, the plot’s pacing feels just perfect as the first half consists of getting the viewers familiar with the creators’ ideas. The remainder half consists of episodes that builds into the climax with plot twists and revelations. Most prominently, character chemistry is something that really shines throughout the series that begins from the very first episode to the end. Momo’s character relationship with Yuki plays a big role and motivator for her to succeed. Throughout the series, she sees her as a role model and may even have developed a sense of romance towards her. It’s not really yuri or even shoujo-ai but the show does drop in subtle romance hints from time to time. This extends to other members of Tsukikage such as with Mei and Fuu. Character relationships stands out not just for their connection but how each influences each other. It’s especially important in later episodes as we see the length certain characters goes through to prove themselves. At some point, I even find the character relationships to be emotional; not in the tearjerking way but more of a meaningful way.On the other side is the mysterious Moryo. Much less is known about them although it’s clear that their intentions are malevolent. However, I would say that their characters are far less intriguing compared to the main cast. Characters like Kurara and Byakko are not fleshed out well enough to make fans care about them. Their existence seems to serve only as adversaries against Tsukikage. Even characters like Theresia Ray isn’t too well established with her relationship involving Hatsume Aoba. In respect, Moryo is more known for their actions rather than themselves. But hey, maybe you’ll be caught by surprise by a certain plot twist later on.Watch now, later, or never touch? To me, this show is best to watch when you’ve decided the first three episodes are ready for you. While the show’s story may get more complex later on, the first half doesn’t do too much to make itself distinctive. It can actually feel deceptive at times with the character designs. Let’s face it, these girls hardly look like spies. It’s also no surprise that their look resembles characters from Yuru Yuri considering some of the names attached to this project. But on most parts, I think the look and feel of this show is faithful to what it advertised. It’s essentially an action girl series with spies that stays closely to its premise throughout the course of its run. The action is also thrilling with vibrant chereography and style. It even adds elements of disguise and stealth to make the role of spies look more credible for some episodes. Yet, it also has time for lighthearted moments to make humor with some of the characters’ exaggerated expressions. Thanks a lot, Momo.While Release the Spyce doesn’t have much risks, I would say that it definitely had some with the voice acting. Given the premise, it may feel hard to take seriously at some of the character voice mannerisms. Momo stands out in particular since she sounds far too much like a stereotypical schoolgirl. But as the show evolves, you can see that she matures more and become a stronger person. Other characters all define their own personalities thanks to their voices. I could also say that a certain character from Tsukikage really manages to play her role deceptively to the point where it’s almost unbelievable. Oh and before I forget, who can forget that energetic OP theme song performed by the voice actresses themselves? It’s fabulous.Spa pa pa parapa 🎶Spapapapaparapa Spa pa pa parapa 🎶Release the Spyce is a show that may have turned some people’s heads away at first glance. Hell, this looked like Yuru Yuri but with action girls on the surface until you realize what’s really about. I have doubts this anime will be a big talk of the year but it definitely managed to capture the magic of how a spy espionage anime should be. It sets the example of badass action girls doing cool things, something that I need more of. Emphasis on the badass. pretty much anyone who doesn't live under a rock knows who James Bond is.

It even adds elements of disguise and stealth to make the role of spies look more credible for some episodes. Yet, it also has time for lighthearted moments to make humor with some of the characters’ exaggerated expressions. Thanks a lot, Momo.While Release the Spyce doesn’t have much risks, I would say that it definitely had some with the voice acting. Given the premise, it may feel hard to take seriously at some of the character voice mannerisms. Momo stands out in particular since she sounds far too much like a stereotypical schoolgirl. But as the show evolves, you can see that she matures more and become a stronger person. Other characters all define their own personalities thanks to their voices. I could also say that a certain character from Tsukikage really manages to play her role deceptively to the point where it’s almost unbelievable. Oh and before I forget, who can forget that energetic OP theme song performed by the voice actresses themselves? It’s fabulous.Spa pa pa parapa 🎶Spapapapaparapa Spa pa pa parapa 🎶Release the Spyce is a show that may have turned some people’s heads away at first glance. Hell, this looked like Yuru Yuri but with action girls on the surface until you realize what’s really about. I have doubts this anime will be a big talk of the year but it definitely managed to capture the magic of how a spy espionage anime should be. It sets the example of badass action girls doing cool things, something that I need more of. Emphasis on the badass."", ""Please note while care has been taken to minimize story related spoilers there may still be spoilers within character analysis. You have been warned.The tale of how six girls protected the world from the predations of a global crime syndicate with daring missions, special abilities and strong bonds of friendship and trust that exist between them while maintaining the illusion that they are just your average group of high school girls.Based off an original idea Release the Spyce is a action and school genre anime that gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if a seemingly normal high school girl who...always had unusually sharp eyes were to not just witness a team of ninja girls infiltrate a building while out walking but also not only be drawn into their ranks but also discover that beneath the hustle and bustle of the city that she grew up in and loves a secret war for the soul of the city and its people is currently being waged. Though hesitant at first the sense of love for her city as well as the sense of justice that defines her soon compels her to join the group and enter the shadowy world of Ninja spies where each mission no matter how straightforward it may sounds requires a combination of boundless caution, flawless teamwork and effective usage of the groups creative gear to succeed. While the subject matter of ninja’s is relatively common within the anime world due largely to the mystique that surrounds that profession animes that focus on the more traditional nature of ninjas which is spying and the gathering of information for their cause and in the process thwarting the enemy’s plans are rare ones indeed. Whats perhaps rarer than this however are Ninjas that in addition to having such traditional duties also have access to special skills that rather be used to fight large scale battles across different continents are instead used to help them defend their city from the predations of the many enemies that try to claim it. In an age where ability users allow them to take on entire organizations and countries in no time flat seeing a group of ninja spies make use of a combination of their unique abilities, teamwork and gear as they try to fulfill the original role of gathering intel and trying to piece it all together to find and neutralize the enemies plot to their home was something that I really enjoyed seeing it and was a definite breath of fresh air in the subject of ninjas and ability users. The first episode of the series was one that really impressed me and while it did well in introducing both the main setting and the team it also did well in showing the kind of power that the members of Tsukikage can command when they make use of fieldcraft, teamwork and the unique abilities that they command. As a result of this strong showing, I decided to stick with this anime and I'm glad that I watched it to the end.The overall story of Release the Spyce takes place in the modern day within the city of Sorasaki a large city whose unique location has allowed it to expand rapidly in recent years and contributed to transforming it into a metropolis that provides its inhabitants with both safety and economic prosperity while at the same time providing a home for hundreds of people. Among the people that call the city their home is Momo Minamoto a young teenage girl whose keen eyes and a unique sense of smell and taste that not only allowed her to meet the secret guardians of the city that she loves but also open her eyes to the fact that like her respected father who died defending the city she too can take up the mantle of becoming a defender of the city and help protect those people and things that are dear to her. As Momo goes through the training of becoming a spy and take part in the many ops that the team undertakes in their quest to defend the city she will slowly come to realize that while the training that she goes through may be harsh and that the missions in which they undertake may be tense and fraught with danger she knows that only by embracing the teachings that she got from training and only by learning to place her trust in her comrades will she be able to not just change as a person but also become an effective protector of the city and its people. But Momo will not be doing this alone for joining her in her mission is her comrades within Tsukikage that include the cool- and level-headed Yuki, the kind and warm Hatsume, the quiet but understanding Goe, the cheerful and confident Fuu and the carefree but surprisingly talkative Mei.Together these girls must while living the life of a high school student must not only make use of everything that they learned in training but also every ounce of intelligence, creativity, and teamwork that they have as they wage a deadly shadow war against the myriad number of factions that try to bring harm to their beloved city and stop them from corrupting this peaceful and prosperous city to achieve their own nefarious goals.Momo MinamotoMomo Minamoto portrayed by new seiyuu Yukari Anzai in one of her first main roles to date is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A second-year high school student that attends the local Sorasaki high school Momo in initial appearance can be seen to be a positive, energetic and determined person by nature that approaches each new day with cheerfulness and a smile on her face. While a positive person by nature it can be seen that in the beginning, she was someone that got nervous easily which when combined with her curious and innocent nature also had the effect of making her look cute to others as well. While she can be seen to be rather quiet in the beginning it can be seen quite easily that Momo is someone that is said to love the city of her birth as well as the many people that live within it very much and would do her best to protect them. At the same time, she was also noted to be someone that was law bound and preferred to obey all the rules and regulations that she encounters in her daily life which comes from both her strong sense of justice and the respect that she had for her late father who served the city as a policeman. However, despite this strong desire to become a policeman and follow in the footsteps of her father and her determined nature Momo hides within her a deep fear that restrains this desire of hers due to the belief that she won’t be effective in this role showing that she also has a chronic shortage of self-confidence in her. As a result of this, it's perhaps unsurprising that Momo would admire those people that not just possess boundless levels of self-confidence but also a sense of calm that shows their determination in taking their assigned path in life.While Momo always knew that she had both an excellent sense of smell and taste she never in her wildest dreams were to imagine that one day these unique traits of hers were to allow her to enter a life where she can not just protect the city that was so dear to her but also serve them as their guardians just as her father did. At first while dumbstruck by not just the scale of the resources that are available to the agency and somewhat put off by the cold attitude that her assigned master Yuki gives her Momo gradually learned to embrace the new sense of purpose that she had discovered after discovering not just the existence of the Tsukikage but also of their role of protecting the city from the shadows as well. While finding the training hard in the beginning which wasn’t helped by the coldness that she got from her mentor that had the effect of creating doubt within her this gradually began to change as a result of not just seeing the types of enemies that the team must face but also of the passion and determination that her teammates have for the role in which they play in ensuring the safety of the city. While still worried to a certain degree Momo gradually learns to overcome the fear that had previously held her back and begins to slowly build up the sense of determination that she needs to be able to make use of when out on missions. As a result, while still seeing the training and the missions as hard Momo rather than seeing them as something that she will struggle with instead see’s them as challenges in which she must overcome. While initially seen by the team as lacking in the ability to stay calm and being wary of their surroundings as the series goes on and Momo’s skills improve she not only becomes able to remain calm under the most stressful of situations but also remain alert of her surroundings as well. Arguably the most important change that came out of Momo finding the determination that she needed to motivate her was her desire to take the initiative during operations while also making use of cunning to lure her enemies into traps where they can be dealt with piecemeal. These changes to Momo’s skills as a member of Tsukikage as well as the gradual change in her attitude to both the teams purpose and her own role within the team I felt served well to show the kind of journey that she went through as she went from a positive and cheerful girl that let her indecisive nature restrain her to a girl that was not just determined to protect her city and her friends from the enemy but also be willing to not just work hard to improve herself but also use these very skills to strike against the enemy using her own initiative.Yuki HanzoumonYuki Hanzoumon portrayed by veteran seiyuu Manami Numakura of Rail Wars and Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio fame is one of the main characters of the series and is Momo’s mentor within the Tsukikage organization. A third-year high school student that attends the same school as Momo and the rest of the team Yuki on initial appearances can be seen to be a calm, cool and level-headed person by nature that approaches each situation with utmost seriousness. A composed, intelligent and understanding person by nature Yuki while not lacking in social qualities is someone that can be seen to have a level of maturity that is rare within high school students which is shown well in her conduct during missions in which is able to remain calm and composed while making accurate decisions when under pressure. While able to able to display a friendly and sociable side to the people that she encounters in life Yuki, for the most part, is someone that prefers to remain alone or at least with people that she can trust and as a result is seen by many within the school funnily enough of the ideal image of an upperclassman. Despite her standoff attitude however, Yuki is shown to be a perceptive person by nature and able to easily determine when someone is burdened with something and while not always able to help them solve their problems is able to at least hear them out and provide the best advice that she can think off. All of these traits put her in good stead as not just a member of the team but also as their field leader when deployed on missions a role that I felt suited her perfectly. In contrast to Yuki’s default attitude, the attitude that Yuki displays in combat is one that is seen to reflect well on the number of years that she has been a spy as well as the training that she had received as part of that role. In combat, Yuki is shown to be someone that’s not just confident but also inspirational and able to use both her innate sense of caution in conjunction with her fast thinking nature to lead her team to victory no matter the odds against them. This is shown well within the many fights in which the team managed to overcome over the course of the series which shows her talents as both a leader and a tactician.As the series goes on and more of Yuki’s personality is revealed Yuki’s personality gradually changes. At the beginning of the series while seen to be both capable both as a student and as a member of Tsukikage Yuki was noted to be someone that was very difficult to get close too due to both her quiet nature and the coldness that she shows to strangers. As a result of this, the relationship that she had with her apprentice Momo proved to be a tough one that both struggled with at first. However, after seeing the depth of the determination that lied within Momo and her desire to not just be of help for the group but also be of use to her this frosty relationship of theirs began to change. While shown to be someone that placed her priority in the completion of missions and training than having fun as most high school girls her age would have done at the beginning of the series this aspect of hers gradually began to change as the bond between Yuki and her apprentice began to strengthen as the series went on. While still retaining the harsh training schedule that she had created to train Momo it can be seen that the training while certainly harsh was one in which Yuki took great care to be as through with both in the knowledge that she imparted into Momo and the consequences that can come about should she not heed them which is shown well in the aftermath of the mission to Okinawa. With this, it can be seen that Yuki is determined to train Momo and make her the best possible spy that she can and showing well the increased bond that has been formed between the two. While still largely retaining her workaholic nature Yuki as a result of the improving relationship that she has with Momo also began to realize that while being hardworking and studious is a good thing there must also come a time when you need to take a rest and have some fun to unwind.  The character of Yuki I felt was an interesting one whose gradual transformation from a quiet, composed and someone that treated others coldly to someone that was not just considerate and warm but also willing to take steps to bond with her fellows and learn to place her trust in them was a change that I thought was well done. The gradual softening of Yuki’s icy nature when combined with the developing bond that is forged between Yuki and her apprentice, I felt made great use of the mentor-apprentice relationship theme that serves as one of the series main highlights.Hatsume AobaHatsume Aoba portrayed by veteran seiyuu Aya Uchida of Trinity Seven and Devil Survivor 2 fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Tsukikage. A third-year student that attends the same school as Momo and the rest of the team Hatsume on initial appearances is seen to be a kind, warm and friendly person by nature that treats everyone that she encounters warmly and with respect. While a friendly person by nature Hatsume is also shown to be a positive and energetic person that despite possessing both beauty and intelligence is shown to be rather modest in how she sees herself. However, despite the friendly and warm personality that she projects to others it can be seen that Hatsume is also someone that is calm and composed in nature and possesses a great deal of intelligence that she makes use of as both the team’s chief inventor, controller and hacker roles that seem tailored made for Hatsume’s personality.  A curious aspect of Hatsume’s personality that manifests itself often within the series is that while she’s very good at explaining things to others she can often get sidetracked and get too engrossed into it something that I felt was quite amusing and matched well with her character.As the series goes on and more of Hatsume’s personality is revealed her personality gradually starts to change. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that Hatsume is someone that can be said to take the forging of friendships rather seriously and indeed it can be seen to be something that’s akin to the core motivation that drives her entire being.  Though largely as a result of both the kindness and warmth that serves as Hatsume’s core personality traits this is far from being the whole truth for Hatsume instead see’s the bonds that are formed when friends are made to be one of the most precious things in the world and that for every bond and thus friend that she makes the more sense of positivity she can create in the world a motivation that serves to drive her to try to make as many friends as she can in life. In line with this sense of wanting to spread positivity to the world via friendships is Hatsume’s belief that given time she will be able to make friends with anyone that she meets whether they are friend or foe which while dangerous is indicative of just how determined she is to spread positivity to the lives of others by befriending them.  While this desire of Hatsume can be seen to be a weakness of sorts given the nature of their jobs it, however, can also be seen as a strength as well for she can use this desire to save those that she has bonded with and in the process possibly gathering intel as well an act that is shown well in Hatsume’s attempts to reconcile with her childhood friend Theresia. The character of Hatsume I felt was an interesting one whose passion for trying to make friends with everyone that she meets and in the process helping them solve the inner problems that they are burdened with I felt was one that contrasted well the role that she has not just as a team member and inventor for the team but also as part of an organization whose job was to take out crime syndicates. While the job itself may be one that’s grim and fraught with peril the fact that some of these enemies can be befriended and turned back from their role, I thought was an interesting idea and one that was used quite well within the series.Goe IshikawaGoe Ishikawa portrayed by new seiyuu Yuri Noguchi in her first main role to date is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Tsukikage. A second-year student and a classmate of both Fuu and Momo Goe on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, friendly and shy person by nature that finds it hard to interact with all but the closest friends. However, despite her quiet nature Goe can be seen to be someone that’s both perceptive, understanding and considerate of the feelings of others. While each member of the team can be said to be multirole Goe has shown herself to be a capable sniper and often provides sniper cover during the team’s ops. Due largely to the fact that her master Hatsume is able to provide her with the kind of familial bond that Goe has never experienced before then it can be seen that Goe is very loyal to her mentor and would try her best to help her with her duties when possible.At the beginning of the series due in part to her quiet and shy nature Goe often gets eclipsed by her fellow classmate and teammate Mei but despite this, it can be seen that beneath this nature of hers Goe is someone that is caring in nature and is willing to do her best to help her friends. While not one to openly state it out Goe is someone that views the bond and friendship that she has with her teammates and to Tsukikage as something that she considers dear to her. As noted before Goe is very loyal to her mentor Hatsume and indeed seems to view the bond that she has with her mentor to be something that’s akin to a prized possession. As a result of this, she is shown to be particularly sensitive to the bond being tested and is shown to react rather adversely when that happens which in her case sees her becoming much quieter and at the same time enter a state of depression. This shows very well the type of bond that exists between her and her mentor as to Goe her mentor can be said to be the person that not only saved her from a life of solitude but also one that gave her a new purpose in life which is to help in protecting the people in the city by working as a member of Tsukikage. This is shown really well within the series when Goe was affected by a gas attack that was committed in the city. The character of Goe I felt was an interesting one that while contrasting well with the likes of Momo and Mei also served to show not just one of the reasons that can cause someone that Join the organization but also the types of bonds that can be formed between a mentor and their apprentice.Fuu SagamiFuu Sagami portrayed by veteran seiyuu Akane Fujita of Orange and Akashic Records fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Tsukikage. A 16-year-old girl and a freshman that attends the same school as Momo and the rest of the team Fuu on initial appearances is seen to be someone that’s cheerful, quiet and confident in nature that approaches each of her tasks with utmost seriousness. At the beginning of the series due largely to the fact that before Momo she was the newest member to join the ranks of the Tsukikage Fuu’s relationship was Momo was a frosty one. However rather than expressing any sort of actual hatred towards her it can be said that this sense of dislike stems from both the pride that Fuu has for being a member of the group and the wariness that she has towards people that while chosen and held in high regard by her seniors have yet to prove themselves worthy of trust. As a result of this as the series went on and Momo began to not just prove herself to both the team and to Fuu this sense of distrust for her gradually began to vanish and be replaced by a genuine sense of respect and trust that is forged between them. While an intelligent and fast thinking person by nature Fuu is noted to be someone that has a great amount of pride both in her skills as a member of Tsukikage and in the organization itself. As a result of this Fuu while confident in her skills also takes great care to interact with recruits that have managed to pass the tests and have become a full member by trying to bond with them and get to know them both as teammates and friends and at the same time always ready to inject some fun into situations when needed by teasing them. While certainly part of her pride it can be seen that this is also part of her attempts to ensure that the new members have what it takes to fit in and become someone that contributes to the team effectively. However, Fuu while certainly possessing a lot of pride is not someone that allows it to make her conceited and instead is someone that has learned to use it both in moderation and as a source of her motivation. While acknowledging that her skills as a spy are top notch Fuu isn’t afraid to admit that her skills can be improved and indeed she is willing to take up roles and jobs that allow her to improve the skills that she finds lacking. This within the series is shown well in the fact that she’s working in a maid café in order to not just improve her skills at reading people but also in her ability to disguise as others.At the beginning of the series while noted to be someone that was wary of others and not someone that can be easily satisfied as the series goes on it can be seen that Fuu actually has a softer side to her that she presents to those that she has not just bonded with but also befriended. In this side of Fuu’s personality, Fuu is shown to be someone that’s friendly, kind, considerate and willing to help those in need. While the pride that can be said to be her defining personality trait is still present to a degree this is offset by the rather amusing fact that she can easily lose her confidence and composure when she becomes embarrassed a fact that did well to show that despite all her skills, she is still a high school girl as well. While possessing strong bonds of friendship with the rest of the team and with Momo as the series goes on it can be seen that Fuu also has a very deep bond with her mentor Mei. However, while strong this bond of theirs can also be seen as a unique one due in part to their contrasting personalities. Unlike the bond that exists between Yuki and Momo, the bond between Fuu and Mei can be seen to be somewhat unique as it resembles more of a sibling relationship between a younger sister who’s more responsible and stricter and an older more laid back and messy sister that takes everything in stride. While the two of them are often seen arguing with each other a lot usually in the form of Fuu lecturing her master on things she had done it can be seen that Fuu sees this bond that exists between them as something that’s dear to her and indeed views it as the other half of her motivation to do well in her duties as a member of Tsukikage. The character of Fuu I felt was an interesting one that I felt was developed well as the series went on. Her gradual evolution from someone that was both wary of outsiders and unwilling to bond with them to someone that not just realized the effects that strong friendships and bonds can bring to both her role as a spy but also to her social life was something that I thought was done well. Her relationship with her master I thought was also somewhat unique as Fuu while serving as the apprentice also acted as somewhat as a foil for Mei and help maintain the balance within Mei’s desire to have fun and relax with her duties as a member of Tsukikage.Mei YachiyoMei Yachiyo portrayed by veteran seiyuu Aya Suzaki of Battle Girl High school and Trinity Seven fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Tsukikage. A second-year student and a classmate of both Momo and Goe Mei on initial appearances is seen to be a positive, friendly and talkative person by nature that approaches each day with cheerfulness a trait that mirrors her teammate and classmate Momo. A joking and carefree person by nature Mei is someone that can be said to be the joyful heart of the team as while her attitude can be seen to indicate that Mei does not take her duties as a spy seriously it can be said that the opposite is true. Despite her nature Mei knows very well the types of stress that can come from the job of being a spy that takes on fearsome crime syndicates and as a result takes great care to project a carefree and joking nature to her teammates as a means of both inspiring laughter within them and at the same time help take off the pressure that comes from seeing the things that the enemies does. While carefree however it can be seen that Mei also has a serious side to her as well that she shows when the situation calls for it. In this Mei is seen to be confident, intelligent and fast thinking and depending on the situation can also inject some playful elements into it as well. This last part is shown during the teams first op in the first episode where she began posing despite the battle raging around her. Due to this nature of hers, it's perhaps unsurprising that Mei like her apprentice also has a part-time job that allows her to not just improve her skills but also use it to gather intel. In the case of Mei, however, while the job certainly allows her to fulfill the latter it can also be said that the job also reflects Mei’s true desires to be free to do whatever she wants which in this case is to perform and sing for the joy of others. Interestingly her skill at singing is impressive enough in that she could have taken the path of being a pro singer rather than a spy.As the series goes on however it can be seen however that despite her carefree nature Mei is someone that is shown to be a caring person and is someone that can be seen to care deeply about her friends. This is shown well in the relationship that she has with her apprentice Fuu as while the two of them often argue mostly due to Mei’s actions it can be seen that Mei in reality values the bonds that she has forged with her and as a result dislikes it when she sees her break the rules and take independent action. This especially is shown well in her desire to stick up for her and in the process protect her something that I felt was especially heartwarming.AMVIn terms of animation I thought that the animation that was used within the series was pretty sharp and while it didn’t try to use too much color and complex effects, I thought that its emphasis on simplicity was its greatest strength. The various locations and terrain that the team visit over the course of the series I thought made great use of this concept as while each of the locations that were featured within the series while featuring a great deal of variety that reflected well on the main premise of the series also made use of many locations that can be said to be both common within cities and easily relatable to high school girls that serve as the girls day lives. This simplicity also lends itself to the character designs of the series main and support cast as well as while the uniform designs for both the girls school uniforms and combat outfits were distinctive, they were relatively simple designs that aimed to be both functional and at the same time allowing us to easily differentiate between the different girls easily. In terms of combat animation, I felt that the series’ many fights and the many operations that the team goes on over the course of the series were well done as these while featuring many unique enemies and situations that emphasized on the use of teamwork between the girls also made great use of the various mission types that the team can go. At the same time, this was helped greatly by the large number of gadgets that the team can call upon. These gadgets, in particular, I felt while cleverly designed and featuring a great variety of tools also gave the team the much-needed flexibility that they needed to complete their missions successfully without drawing too much attention. Gadgets that I particularly liked within the series include the face changing masks, tranq guns, the hidden boot knives and the hacking tool that was disguised as a selfie stick. In terms of enemy designs, I felt that the designs that were used to show the main enemy fighters were somewhat unique and while doing well in showing their intended role on the field also did well to contrast with their opposite numbers within Tsukikage. Noteworthy examples include Byakko who despite her appearance actually resembling an elementary school student was actually a veteran merc and Dolte whose large bulk hid not just how cunning she can be but also how tenacious she can be on the field as well. This concept of having a character whose physical designs do not match their true skills is perhaps best shown in the various designs that are used by Tendo the leader of the main hostile faction that acts as the teams main opponent within the series as while on the outside she acts and has the demeanor of perhaps a secretary this only serves to hide her inner self who is not just cunning and calculating but also a powerful swordswoman whose skills are above even Yuki.In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Spatto! Spy & Spyce and Hide & Seek that was sung by the main seiyuu’s of the cast in the guise of Tsukikage. Both of these songs I felt were rather unique when used in combination with the visuals that are shown with them. The opening theme due to both the lyrics and the visuals while being catchy also had the effect of reminding me of the animes that I seen back in the ’90s and had the effect of creating a sense of mystique and mystery as you can imagine the team trying to shine light into the many shadows that their foes hide behind. The ending theme also had a similar effect but in contrast to the work of shining light into the shadows to find their foes it had an effect that reminds me of a mission complete and of the girls returning to their daily lives as they relax and spend time with their friends. The series OST I felt did a pretty good job at providing solid backing music for the many types of situations that the cast encounter over the series with its trademarked theme that plays when the team starts their mission being a particular highlight of it.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular, I felt that Yukari Anzai, Manami Numakura, Aya Uchida, Yuri Noguchi, Akane Fujita and Aya Suzaki all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job in portraying the characters of Momo, Yuki, Hatsume, Goe, Fuu and Mei respectively. For Yukari Anzai and Yuri Noguchi who despite being new to the industry managed to pull off impressive performances in portraying the main characters of Momo and Goe, I hope that they were able to gain valuable experience in this series that would contribute in starting their careers within the seiyuu industry.At the same time, while I didn’t cover them within the review, I also thought that Shizuka Itou, Aina Suzuki, Mikako Komatsu and Saori Hayami who portrayed the characters of Tendo, Byakko, Katrina and Dolte also did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters.Overall conclusionIn overall Release the Spyce was an anime that I really enjoyed and was definitely one of the more unique animes that aired this season. Its main strengths in my opinion was its unique premise, strong story, well designed and developed characters, creative and tense fights, its ability to fuse various elements that often conflict with each other together, a novel way of using the villain of the week type of enemy and excellent voice acting.The subject of Ninja’s is a well-trodden one within the field of anime and due to the myth and mystique that surrounds the profession has seen it be used in a great variety of anime types be it as traditional intel gatherers or as ninjas that have access to various special abilities with the famed Naruto series being perhaps the best example of the latter. In this reasonably packed genre, how would you introduce an idea that would make use of the concepts of high school girls, ninja spies, abilities and gadgets? And the answer is here in the anime Release the Spyce.The overall premise of the series which is without a doubt one of the highlights of the series gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if you introduce not just characters but also an organization that in their guise as defenders of the city combine not just the traditional duties of a ninja with that of a spy that has the ability to not just sneak into heavy defended locations to gather intel but at the same time be able to special abilities and gadget’s to not only fight their way through enemy traps and ambushes but also aid them in foiling the enemies plans directly rather than pass it to a higher order. This idea of having ninja’s that are not only able to sneak into the most heavily guarded of locations to gather intel that will aid them in their fight against the crime syndicates but also allow them to deal with them directly I felt was a relatively fresh idea that expanded upon the traditional ninja concept.  While the premise of having ninjas that can potentially use their abilities to overpower their enemies and get intel through sheer physical might is certainly a risk to the series I felt that the way in which this hurdle was overcome was an interesting one as rather than a power that can be used that way the power of the spyce to which is the source of the power itself is short lived and its effects are localized and thus can be seen to be akin to a temporary power-up that’s so beloved of ability based animes and as such cannot be relied upon entirely and thus requiring the girls to make use of other tactics and skills like teamwork and their unique skill sets and gadgets to overcome the challenges that bar their path. The fact that the power of the spyce is also localized also allows it to stay true to the theme and their role as spies and not warriors.The overall story that made use of such an interesting premise was another thing that I particularly enjoyed seeing within the series. While the overall story did an excellent job of showing how Momo and the rest of the team gradually learned to not just embrace their roles as members of Tsukikage and the many personal and professional struggles that they had to overcome to along the way that led to them to forge strong bonds with each other I felt that the series also made great use of the villain of the week concept of storytelling. While traditional villain of the weeks is usually used as stand-ins for the true villains and have no other purpose to the main plot other than buy time for the main villain to appear in the case of Release the Spyce this isn’t the case. In this case, these villains while individually weak still required the team to use strategy against them and even in their defeat they still produced a piece of a puzzle that needed to be used to piece together the true plan that their enemies were planning in the background. This act of making each of these villains relevant in the larger scheme of things not only served to enhance their roles but also make the hunt to determine the enemies true plan that much more tense as the team had to not just determine which of the villains were their targets but also the role that they play in the larger plan as they piece together the evidence that they gathered. This was something that I thought took great advantage of the theme while also making the story that much tenser.Overall Release the Spyce was an anime that I really enjoyed that did well in expanding upon a well known concept by creatively combining elements that usually don’t work well with other and paring that with a story that was not just heartwarming but also inspirational as we got to see how the members of Tsukikage not just overcome the many challenges that lie in their path but learn to bond with each other as they fight hard to protect their beloved home and friends from the machinations of the hated crime syndicates. As a final score I believe that Release the Spyce easily deserves a final score of 9/10. always had unusually sharp eyes were to not just witness a team of ninja girls infiltrate a building while out walking but also not only be drawn into their ranks but also discover that beneath the hustle and bustle of the city that she grew up in and loves a secret war for the soul of the city and its people is currently being waged. Though hesitant at first the sense of love for her city as well as the sense of justice that defines her soon compels her to join the group and enter the shadowy world of Ninja spies where each mission no matter how straightforward it may sounds requires a combination of boundless caution, flawless teamwork and effective usage of the groups creative gear to succeed. While the subject matter of ninja’s is relatively common within the anime world due largely to the mystique that surrounds that profession animes that focus on the more traditional nature of ninjas which is spying and the gathering of information for their cause and in the process thwarting the enemy’s plans are rare ones indeed. Whats perhaps rarer than this however are Ninjas that in addition to having such traditional duties also have access to special skills that rather be used to fight large scale battles across different continents are instead used to help them defend their city from the predations of the many enemies that try to claim it. In an age where ability users allow them to take on entire organizations and countries in no time flat seeing a group of ninja spies make use of a combination of their unique abilities, teamwork and gear as they try to fulfill the original role of gathering intel and trying to piece it all together to find and neutralize the enemies plot to their home was something that I really enjoyed seeing it and was a definite breath of fresh air in the subject of ninjas and ability users. The first episode of the series was one that really impressed me and while it did well in introducing both the main setting and the team it also did well in showing the kind of power that the members of Tsukikage can command when they make use of fieldcraft, teamwork and the unique abilities that they command. As a result of this strong showing, I decided to stick with this anime and I'm glad that I watched it to the end.The overall story of Release the Spyce takes place in the modern day within the city of Sorasaki a large city whose unique location has allowed it to expand rapidly in recent years and contributed to transforming it into a metropolis that provides its inhabitants with both safety and economic prosperity while at the same time providing a home for hundreds of people. Among the people that call the city their home is Momo Minamoto a young teenage girl whose keen eyes and a unique sense of smell and taste that not only allowed her to meet the secret guardians of the city that she loves but also open her eyes to the fact that like her respected father who died defending the city she too can take up the mantle of becoming a defender of the city and help protect those people and things that are dear to her. As Momo goes through the training of becoming a spy and take part in the many ops that the team undertakes in their quest to defend the city she will slowly come to realize that while the training that she goes through may be harsh and that the missions in which they undertake may be tense and fraught with danger she knows that only by embracing the teachings that she got from training and only by learning to place her trust in her comrades will she be able to not just change as a person but also become an effective protector of the city and its people. But Momo will not be doing this alone for joining her in her mission is her comrades within Tsukikage that include the cool- and level-headed Yuki, the kind and warm Hatsume, the quiet but understanding Goe, the cheerful and confident Fuu and the carefree but surprisingly talkative Mei.Together these girls must while living the life of a high school student must not only make use of everything that they learned in training but also every ounce of intelligence, creativity, and teamwork that they have as they wage a deadly shadow war against the myriad number of factions that try to bring harm to their beloved city and stop them from corrupting this peaceful and prosperous city to achieve their own nefarious goals.Momo MinamotoMomo Minamoto portrayed by new seiyuu Yukari Anzai in one of her first main roles to date is one of the main characters of the series and is the main protagonist of the series. A second-year high school student that attends the local Sorasaki high school Momo in initial appearance can be seen to be a positive, energetic and determined person by nature that approaches each new day with cheerfulness and a smile on her face. While a positive person by nature it can be seen that in the beginning, she was someone that got nervous easily which when combined with her curious and innocent nature also had the effect of making her look cute to others as well. While she can be seen to be rather quiet in the beginning it can be seen quite easily that Momo is someone that is said to love the city of her birth as well as the many people that live within it very much and would do her best to protect them. At the same time, she was also noted to be someone that was law bound and preferred to obey all the rules and regulations that she encounters in her daily life which comes from both her strong sense of justice and the respect that she had for her late father who served the city as a policeman. However, despite this strong desire to become a policeman and follow in the footsteps of her father and her determined nature Momo hides within her a deep fear that restrains this desire of hers due to the belief that she won’t be effective in this role showing that she also has a chronic shortage of self-confidence in her. As a result of this, it's perhaps unsurprising that Momo would admire those people that not just possess boundless levels of self-confidence but also a sense of calm that shows their determination in taking their assigned path in life.While Momo always knew that she had both an excellent sense of smell and taste she never in her wildest dreams were to imagine that one day these unique traits of hers were to allow her to enter a life where she can not just protect the city that was so dear to her but also serve them as their guardians just as her father did. At first while dumbstruck by not just the scale of the resources that are available to the agency and somewhat put off by the cold attitude that her assigned master Yuki gives her Momo gradually learned to embrace the new sense of purpose that she had discovered after discovering not just the existence of the Tsukikage but also of their role of protecting the city from the shadows as well. While finding the training hard in the beginning which wasn’t helped by the coldness that she got from her mentor that had the effect of creating doubt within her this gradually began to change as a result of not just seeing the types of enemies that the team must face but also of the passion and determination that her teammates have for the role in which they play in ensuring the safety of the city. While still worried to a certain degree Momo gradually learns to overcome the fear that had previously held her back and begins to slowly build up the sense of determination that she needs to be able to make use of when out on missions. As a result, while still seeing the training and the missions as hard Momo rather than seeing them as something that she will struggle with instead see’s them as challenges in which she must overcome. While initially seen by the team as lacking in the ability to stay calm and being wary of their surroundings as the series goes on and Momo’s skills improve she not only becomes able to remain calm under the most stressful of situations but also remain alert of her surroundings as well. Arguably the most important change that came out of Momo finding the determination that she needed to motivate her was her desire to take the initiative during operations while also making use of cunning to lure her enemies into traps where they can be dealt with piecemeal. These changes to Momo’s skills as a member of Tsukikage as well as the gradual change in her attitude to both the teams purpose and her own role within the team I felt served well to show the kind of journey that she went through as she went from a positive and cheerful girl that let her indecisive nature restrain her to a girl that was not just determined to protect her city and her friends from the enemy but also be willing to not just work hard to improve herself but also use these very skills to strike against the enemy using her own initiative.Yuki HanzoumonYuki Hanzoumon portrayed by veteran seiyuu Manami Numakura of Rail Wars and Aoki Hagane no Arpeggio fame is one of the main characters of the series and is Momo’s mentor within the Tsukikage organization. A third-year high school student that attends the same school as Momo and the rest of the team Yuki on initial appearances can be seen to be a calm, cool and level-headed person by nature that approaches each situation with utmost seriousness. A composed, intelligent and understanding person by nature Yuki while not lacking in social qualities is someone that can be seen to have a level of maturity that is rare within high school students which is shown well in her conduct during missions in which is able to remain calm and composed while making accurate decisions when under pressure. While able to able to display a friendly and sociable side to the people that she encounters in life Yuki, for the most part, is someone that prefers to remain alone or at least with people that she can trust and as a result is seen by many within the school funnily enough of the ideal image of an upperclassman. Despite her standoff attitude however, Yuki is shown to be a perceptive person by nature and able to easily determine when someone is burdened with something and while not always able to help them solve their problems is able to at least hear them out and provide the best advice that she can think off. All of these traits put her in good stead as not just a member of the team but also as their field leader when deployed on missions a role that I felt suited her perfectly. In contrast to Yuki’s default attitude, the attitude that Yuki displays in combat is one that is seen to reflect well on the number of years that she has been a spy as well as the training that she had received as part of that role. In combat, Yuki is shown to be someone that’s not just confident but also inspirational and able to use both her innate sense of caution in conjunction with her fast thinking nature to lead her team to victory no matter the odds against them. This is shown well within the many fights in which the team managed to overcome over the course of the series which shows her talents as both a leader and a tactician.As the series goes on and more of Yuki’s personality is revealed Yuki’s personality gradually changes. At the beginning of the series while seen to be both capable both as a student and as a member of Tsukikage Yuki was noted to be someone that was very difficult to get close too due to both her quiet nature and the coldness that she shows to strangers. As a result of this, the relationship that she had with her apprentice Momo proved to be a tough one that both struggled with at first. However, after seeing the depth of the determination that lied within Momo and her desire to not just be of help for the group but also be of use to her this frosty relationship of theirs began to change. While shown to be someone that placed her priority in the completion of missions and training than having fun as most high school girls her age would have done at the beginning of the series this aspect of hers gradually began to change as the bond between Yuki and her apprentice began to strengthen as the series went on. While still retaining the harsh training schedule that she had created to train Momo it can be seen that the training while certainly harsh was one in which Yuki took great care to be as through with both in the knowledge that she imparted into Momo and the consequences that can come about should she not heed them which is shown well in the aftermath of the mission to Okinawa. With this, it can be seen that Yuki is determined to train Momo and make her the best possible spy that she can and showing well the increased bond that has been formed between the two. While still largely retaining her workaholic nature Yuki as a result of the improving relationship that she has with Momo also began to realize that while being hardworking and studious is a good thing there must also come a time when you need to take a rest and have some fun to unwind.  The character of Yuki I felt was an interesting one whose gradual transformation from a quiet, composed and someone that treated others coldly to someone that was not just considerate and warm but also willing to take steps to bond with her fellows and learn to place her trust in them was a change that I thought was well done. The gradual softening of Yuki’s icy nature when combined with the developing bond that is forged between Yuki and her apprentice, I felt made great use of the mentor-apprentice relationship theme that serves as one of the series main highlights.Hatsume AobaHatsume Aoba portrayed by veteran seiyuu Aya Uchida of Trinity Seven and Devil Survivor 2 fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Tsukikage. A third-year student that attends the same school as Momo and the rest of the team Hatsume on initial appearances is seen to be a kind, warm and friendly person by nature that treats everyone that she encounters warmly and with respect. While a friendly person by nature Hatsume is also shown to be a positive and energetic person that despite possessing both beauty and intelligence is shown to be rather modest in how she sees herself. However, despite the friendly and warm personality that she projects to others it can be seen that Hatsume is also someone that is calm and composed in nature and possesses a great deal of intelligence that she makes use of as both the team’s chief inventor, controller and hacker roles that seem tailored made for Hatsume’s personality.  A curious aspect of Hatsume’s personality that manifests itself often within the series is that while she’s very good at explaining things to others she can often get sidetracked and get too engrossed into it something that I felt was quite amusing and matched well with her character.As the series goes on and more of Hatsume’s personality is revealed her personality gradually starts to change. From the beginning of the series, it can be seen that Hatsume is someone that can be said to take the forging of friendships rather seriously and indeed it can be seen to be something that’s akin to the core motivation that drives her entire being.  Though largely as a result of both the kindness and warmth that serves as Hatsume’s core personality traits this is far from being the whole truth for Hatsume instead see’s the bonds that are formed when friends are made to be one of the most precious things in the world and that for every bond and thus friend that she makes the more sense of positivity she can create in the world a motivation that serves to drive her to try to make as many friends as she can in life. In line with this sense of wanting to spread positivity to the world via friendships is Hatsume’s belief that given time she will be able to make friends with anyone that she meets whether they are friend or foe which while dangerous is indicative of just how determined she is to spread positivity to the lives of others by befriending them.  While this desire of Hatsume can be seen to be a weakness of sorts given the nature of their jobs it, however, can also be seen as a strength as well for she can use this desire to save those that she has bonded with and in the process possibly gathering intel as well an act that is shown well in Hatsume’s attempts to reconcile with her childhood friend Theresia. The character of Hatsume I felt was an interesting one whose passion for trying to make friends with everyone that she meets and in the process helping them solve the inner problems that they are burdened with I felt was one that contrasted well the role that she has not just as a team member and inventor for the team but also as part of an organization whose job was to take out crime syndicates. While the job itself may be one that’s grim and fraught with peril the fact that some of these enemies can be befriended and turned back from their role, I thought was an interesting idea and one that was used quite well within the series.Goe IshikawaGoe Ishikawa portrayed by new seiyuu Yuri Noguchi in her first main role to date is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Tsukikage. A second-year student and a classmate of both Fuu and Momo Goe on initial appearances is seen to be a quiet, friendly and shy person by nature that finds it hard to interact with all but the closest friends. However, despite her quiet nature Goe can be seen to be someone that’s both perceptive, understanding and considerate of the feelings of others. While each member of the team can be said to be multirole Goe has shown herself to be a capable sniper and often provides sniper cover during the team’s ops. Due largely to the fact that her master Hatsume is able to provide her with the kind of familial bond that Goe has never experienced before then it can be seen that Goe is very loyal to her mentor and would try her best to help her with her duties when possible.At the beginning of the series due in part to her quiet and shy nature Goe often gets eclipsed by her fellow classmate and teammate Mei but despite this, it can be seen that beneath this nature of hers Goe is someone that is caring in nature and is willing to do her best to help her friends. While not one to openly state it out Goe is someone that views the bond and friendship that she has with her teammates and to Tsukikage as something that she considers dear to her. As noted before Goe is very loyal to her mentor Hatsume and indeed seems to view the bond that she has with her mentor to be something that’s akin to a prized possession. As a result of this, she is shown to be particularly sensitive to the bond being tested and is shown to react rather adversely when that happens which in her case sees her becoming much quieter and at the same time enter a state of depression. This shows very well the type of bond that exists between her and her mentor as to Goe her mentor can be said to be the person that not only saved her from a life of solitude but also one that gave her a new purpose in life which is to help in protecting the people in the city by working as a member of Tsukikage. This is shown really well within the series when Goe was affected by a gas attack that was committed in the city. The character of Goe I felt was an interesting one that while contrasting well with the likes of Momo and Mei also served to show not just one of the reasons that can cause someone that Join the organization but also the types of bonds that can be formed between a mentor and their apprentice.Fuu SagamiFuu Sagami portrayed by veteran seiyuu Akane Fujita of Orange and Akashic Records fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Tsukikage. A 16-year-old girl and a freshman that attends the same school as Momo and the rest of the team Fuu on initial appearances is seen to be someone that’s cheerful, quiet and confident in nature that approaches each of her tasks with utmost seriousness. At the beginning of the series due largely to the fact that before Momo she was the newest member to join the ranks of the Tsukikage Fuu’s relationship was Momo was a frosty one. However rather than expressing any sort of actual hatred towards her it can be said that this sense of dislike stems from both the pride that Fuu has for being a member of the group and the wariness that she has towards people that while chosen and held in high regard by her seniors have yet to prove themselves worthy of trust. As a result of this as the series went on and Momo began to not just prove herself to both the team and to Fuu this sense of distrust for her gradually began to vanish and be replaced by a genuine sense of respect and trust that is forged between them. While an intelligent and fast thinking person by nature Fuu is noted to be someone that has a great amount of pride both in her skills as a member of Tsukikage and in the organization itself. As a result of this Fuu while confident in her skills also takes great care to interact with recruits that have managed to pass the tests and have become a full member by trying to bond with them and get to know them both as teammates and friends and at the same time always ready to inject some fun into situations when needed by teasing them. While certainly part of her pride it can be seen that this is also part of her attempts to ensure that the new members have what it takes to fit in and become someone that contributes to the team effectively. However, Fuu while certainly possessing a lot of pride is not someone that allows it to make her conceited and instead is someone that has learned to use it both in moderation and as a source of her motivation. While acknowledging that her skills as a spy are top notch Fuu isn’t afraid to admit that her skills can be improved and indeed she is willing to take up roles and jobs that allow her to improve the skills that she finds lacking. This within the series is shown well in the fact that she’s working in a maid café in order to not just improve her skills at reading people but also in her ability to disguise as others.At the beginning of the series while noted to be someone that was wary of others and not someone that can be easily satisfied as the series goes on it can be seen that Fuu actually has a softer side to her that she presents to those that she has not just bonded with but also befriended. In this side of Fuu’s personality, Fuu is shown to be someone that’s friendly, kind, considerate and willing to help those in need. While the pride that can be said to be her defining personality trait is still present to a degree this is offset by the rather amusing fact that she can easily lose her confidence and composure when she becomes embarrassed a fact that did well to show that despite all her skills, she is still a high school girl as well. While possessing strong bonds of friendship with the rest of the team and with Momo as the series goes on it can be seen that Fuu also has a very deep bond with her mentor Mei. However, while strong this bond of theirs can also be seen as a unique one due in part to their contrasting personalities. Unlike the bond that exists between Yuki and Momo, the bond between Fuu and Mei can be seen to be somewhat unique as it resembles more of a sibling relationship between a younger sister who’s more responsible and stricter and an older more laid back and messy sister that takes everything in stride. While the two of them are often seen arguing with each other a lot usually in the form of Fuu lecturing her master on things she had done it can be seen that Fuu sees this bond that exists between them as something that’s dear to her and indeed views it as the other half of her motivation to do well in her duties as a member of Tsukikage. The character of Fuu I felt was an interesting one that I felt was developed well as the series went on. Her gradual evolution from someone that was both wary of outsiders and unwilling to bond with them to someone that not just realized the effects that strong friendships and bonds can bring to both her role as a spy but also to her social life was something that I thought was done well. Her relationship with her master I thought was also somewhat unique as Fuu while serving as the apprentice also acted as somewhat as a foil for Mei and help maintain the balance within Mei’s desire to have fun and relax with her duties as a member of Tsukikage.Mei YachiyoMei Yachiyo portrayed by veteran seiyuu Aya Suzaki of Battle Girl High school and Trinity Seven fame is one of the main characters of the series and is one of the members of Tsukikage. A second-year student and a classmate of both Momo and Goe Mei on initial appearances is seen to be a positive, friendly and talkative person by nature that approaches each day with cheerfulness a trait that mirrors her teammate and classmate Momo. A joking and carefree person by nature Mei is someone that can be said to be the joyful heart of the team as while her attitude can be seen to indicate that Mei does not take her duties as a spy seriously it can be said that the opposite is true. Despite her nature Mei knows very well the types of stress that can come from the job of being a spy that takes on fearsome crime syndicates and as a result takes great care to project a carefree and joking nature to her teammates as a means of both inspiring laughter within them and at the same time help take off the pressure that comes from seeing the things that the enemies does. While carefree however it can be seen that Mei also has a serious side to her as well that she shows when the situation calls for it. In this Mei is seen to be confident, intelligent and fast thinking and depending on the situation can also inject some playful elements into it as well. This last part is shown during the teams first op in the first episode where she began posing despite the battle raging around her. Due to this nature of hers, it's perhaps unsurprising that Mei like her apprentice also has a part-time job that allows her to not just improve her skills but also use it to gather intel. In the case of Mei, however, while the job certainly allows her to fulfill the latter it can also be said that the job also reflects Mei’s true desires to be free to do whatever she wants which in this case is to perform and sing for the joy of others. Interestingly her skill at singing is impressive enough in that she could have taken the path of being a pro singer rather than a spy.As the series goes on however it can be seen however that despite her carefree nature Mei is someone that is shown to be a caring person and is someone that can be seen to care deeply about her friends. This is shown well in the relationship that she has with her apprentice Fuu as while the two of them often argue mostly due to Mei’s actions it can be seen that Mei in reality values the bonds that she has forged with her and as a result dislikes it when she sees her break the rules and take independent action. This especially is shown well in her desire to stick up for her and in the process protect her something that I felt was especially heartwarming.AMVIn terms of animation I thought that the animation that was used within the series was pretty sharp and while it didn’t try to use too much color and complex effects, I thought that its emphasis on simplicity was its greatest strength. The various locations and terrain that the team visit over the course of the series I thought made great use of this concept as while each of the locations that were featured within the series while featuring a great deal of variety that reflected well on the main premise of the series also made use of many locations that can be said to be both common within cities and easily relatable to high school girls that serve as the girls day lives. This simplicity also lends itself to the character designs of the series main and support cast as well as while the uniform designs for both the girls school uniforms and combat outfits were distinctive, they were relatively simple designs that aimed to be both functional and at the same time allowing us to easily differentiate between the different girls easily. In terms of combat animation, I felt that the series’ many fights and the many operations that the team goes on over the course of the series were well done as these while featuring many unique enemies and situations that emphasized on the use of teamwork between the girls also made great use of the various mission types that the team can go. At the same time, this was helped greatly by the large number of gadgets that the team can call upon. These gadgets, in particular, I felt while cleverly designed and featuring a great variety of tools also gave the team the much-needed flexibility that they needed to complete their missions successfully without drawing too much attention. Gadgets that I particularly liked within the series include the face changing masks, tranq guns, the hidden boot knives and the hacking tool that was disguised as a selfie stick. In terms of enemy designs, I felt that the designs that were used to show the main enemy fighters were somewhat unique and while doing well in showing their intended role on the field also did well to contrast with their opposite numbers within Tsukikage. Noteworthy examples include Byakko who despite her appearance actually resembling an elementary school student was actually a veteran merc and Dolte whose large bulk hid not just how cunning she can be but also how tenacious she can be on the field as well. This concept of having a character whose physical designs do not match their true skills is perhaps best shown in the various designs that are used by Tendo the leader of the main hostile faction that acts as the teams main opponent within the series as while on the outside she acts and has the demeanor of perhaps a secretary this only serves to hide her inner self who is not just cunning and calculating but also a powerful swordswoman whose skills are above even Yuki.In terms of music, the series made use of one opening and ending theme which was Spatto! Spy & Spyce and Hide & Seek that was sung by the main seiyuu’s of the cast in the guise of Tsukikage. Both of these songs I felt were rather unique when used in combination with the visuals that are shown with them. The opening theme due to both the lyrics and the visuals while being catchy also had the effect of reminding me of the animes that I seen back in the ’90s and had the effect of creating a sense of mystique and mystery as you can imagine the team trying to shine light into the many shadows that their foes hide behind. The ending theme also had a similar effect but in contrast to the work of shining light into the shadows to find their foes it had an effect that reminds me of a mission complete and of the girls returning to their daily lives as they relax and spend time with their friends. The series OST I felt did a pretty good job at providing solid backing music for the many types of situations that the cast encounter over the series with its trademarked theme that plays when the team starts their mission being a particular highlight of it.In terms of voice acting, I felt that the series main voice cast all did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters whether they were main ones or support ones. In particular, I felt that Yukari Anzai, Manami Numakura, Aya Uchida, Yuri Noguchi, Akane Fujita and Aya Suzaki all deserve special praise as I felt that they all did an excellent job in portraying the characters of Momo, Yuki, Hatsume, Goe, Fuu and Mei respectively. For Yukari Anzai and Yuri Noguchi who despite being new to the industry managed to pull off impressive performances in portraying the main characters of Momo and Goe, I hope that they were able to gain valuable experience in this series that would contribute in starting their careers within the seiyuu industry.At the same time, while I didn’t cover them within the review, I also thought that Shizuka Itou, Aina Suzuki, Mikako Komatsu and Saori Hayami who portrayed the characters of Tendo, Byakko, Katrina and Dolte also did an excellent job at portraying their assigned characters.Overall conclusionIn overall Release the Spyce was an anime that I really enjoyed and was definitely one of the more unique animes that aired this season. Its main strengths in my opinion was its unique premise, strong story, well designed and developed characters, creative and tense fights, its ability to fuse various elements that often conflict with each other together, a novel way of using the villain of the week type of enemy and excellent voice acting.The subject of Ninja’s is a well-trodden one within the field of anime and due to the myth and mystique that surrounds the profession has seen it be used in a great variety of anime types be it as traditional intel gatherers or as ninjas that have access to various special abilities with the famed Naruto series being perhaps the best example of the latter. In this reasonably packed genre, how would you introduce an idea that would make use of the concepts of high school girls, ninja spies, abilities and gadgets? And the answer is here in the anime Release the Spyce.The overall premise of the series which is without a doubt one of the highlights of the series gives us the opportunity to see what will happen if you introduce not just characters but also an organization that in their guise as defenders of the city combine not just the traditional duties of a ninja with that of a spy that has the ability to not just sneak into heavy defended locations to gather intel but at the same time be able to special abilities and gadget’s to not only fight their way through enemy traps and ambushes but also aid them in foiling the enemies plans directly rather than pass it to a higher order. This idea of having ninja’s that are not only able to sneak into the most heavily guarded of locations to gather intel that will aid them in their fight against the crime syndicates but also allow them to deal with them directly I felt was a relatively fresh idea that expanded upon the traditional ninja concept.  While the premise of having ninjas that can potentially use their abilities to overpower their enemies and get intel through sheer physical might is certainly a risk to the series I felt that the way in which this hurdle was overcome was an interesting one as rather than a power that can be used that way the power of the spyce to which is the source of the power itself is short lived and its effects are localized and thus can be seen to be akin to a temporary power-up that’s so beloved of ability based animes and as such cannot be relied upon entirely and thus requiring the girls to make use of other tactics and skills like teamwork and their unique skill sets and gadgets to overcome the challenges that bar their path. The fact that the power of the spyce is also localized also allows it to stay true to the theme and their role as spies and not warriors.The overall story that made use of such an interesting premise was another thing that I particularly enjoyed seeing within the series. While the overall story did an excellent job of showing how Momo and the rest of the team gradually learned to not just embrace their roles as members of Tsukikage and the many personal and professional struggles that they had to overcome to along the way that led to them to forge strong bonds with each other I felt that the series also made great use of the villain of the week concept of storytelling. While traditional villain of the weeks is usually used as stand-ins for the true villains and have no other purpose to the main plot other than buy time for the main villain to appear in the case of Release the Spyce this isn’t the case. In this case, these villains while individually weak still required the team to use strategy against them and even in their defeat they still produced a piece of a puzzle that needed to be used to piece together the true plan that their enemies were planning in the background. This act of making each of these villains relevant in the larger scheme of things not only served to enhance their roles but also make the hunt to determine the enemies true plan that much more tense as the team had to not just determine which of the villains were their targets but also the role that they play in the larger plan as they piece together the evidence that they gathered. This was something that I thought took great advantage of the theme while also making the story that much tenser.Overall Release the Spyce was an anime that I really enjoyed that did well in expanding upon a well known concept by creatively combining elements that usually don’t work well with other and paring that with a story that was not just heartwarming but also inspirational as we got to see how the members of Tsukikage not just overcome the many challenges that lie in their path but learn to bond with each other as they fight hard to protect their beloved home and friends from the machinations of the hated crime syndicates. As a final score I believe that Release the Spyce easily deserves a final score of 9/10."", ""So Release the Spyce is a cute girls doing spy things, somewhat similar to Princess Principal or maybe rather to the cartoon Totally Spies. This anime is no masterpiece but it perfectly executes what it promises. We have 6 girls doing spy things.Story: 7Compared to Princess Principal we don't have such a mind-boggling story, rather with a different approach we start from zero, as our protagonist is new in the spy business and in the first episodes we can see her hardships during training and how she is gradually getting better. We also have some great action scenes in every single episode, so the show...is not getting dull.The show deploys a fair amount of darker tone as well, as they are dealing with drugs, illegal brothels, etc, but generally never too much, so the anime keeps its lighthearted atmosphere.There is also some mystery elements included, as the main villains face is never shown, also apparently one of the protagonists is a traitor, so we can wonder who it is.There is also ZERO amount of fanservice in the anime. Ok, that might be a strech, but non of this in-your-face sht. They are constantly jumping all over the place, and there is not a single panty shot.Art: 7I'm not an art guy, but I haven't found anything wrong with the show's art. Generally the character designs are nice, the fight animations are fluid.Sound: 8Now this one of the strong points of the anime. The opening song is really catchy. Also during the missions and fights there is always some fitting 'spy music'. It makes the spy scenes a real joy to watch.Characters: 7Characters aren't overly complex, but they aren't just cardboard cutouts as well. Especially the main character. We can see how she's progressing throughout the anime.The members of the criminal organization are no fools as well, they are using different tactics to make thigs go their way.Enjoyment: 9As I wrote above, the show is not a masterpiece, but doesn't even try to be one. It is a really fun lighthearted anime to watch and although there are slower episodes as well, it is never boring, it keeps the attention well. Even though it is not a comedy anime whatsoever, there are plenty of funny scenes each episode.Overall I give it 8/10, as this is one of my favourites this season. is not getting dull.The show deploys a fair amount of darker tone as well, as they are dealing with drugs, illegal brothels, etc, but generally never too much, so the anime keeps its lighthearted atmosphere.There is also some mystery elements included, as the main villains face is never shown, also apparently one of the protagonists is a traitor, so we can wonder who it is.There is also ZERO amount of fanservice in the anime.

I expected it to be the animated version of the ""release the kraken"" meme. Huge-ass cage opens up and this lil anime girl walks out and kills everyone. Every required ingredient for a masterpiece, I thought. Words cannot even begin to describe my disappointment. I shall try, nevertheless.Story:Anime ninja girls are doing some serious super spy level shit while guards be like ""huh, must be the wind."" and all of this happens while altered version of Mission Impossible theme song is playing  At this point, I was still totally thrilled. Only a matter of...time until the kraken gets out. But no, of course it had to disappoint by becoming ""so fucking anime"" and relying on western industry cliches that always occur under these settings. Hacking in progress, asspulled agent-widgets do all the job and apparently that\'s the whole point of this thing: to take every shitty spy movie ever and just turn it into an anime, and then further insert the damn thing inside school settings. The reason doesn\'t really save anyone from the outcome.Characters:They were all pretty interesting until they took off their clothes, which is pretty much the opposite I would typically say, but this time they just turned out to be generic animu gurls who are the easiest to tell apart by just looking at their hair color. We have the black long, blue, kinda purple and the ""anime-orange"" many canon pairing girls favor and main character who also has similar colored shirt. Judging from their side profile, despite their different height, they all have the exact same sized boobs, so that pretty much tells how much planning was put into their design.In terms of personalities, our characters are teenage girls who still go to school, and they appear about as normal as they come under school settings, so there is also that. This side of the story is also boring to follow because it is just lil girls being half awkward and half polite all senpai this senpai that. The industry rarely takes risks and this is yet one situation where risk -- or at least some sort of effort -- would have been better idea than this type serial production characterization.Production:I don\'t really have anything to complain about outside the anime girl design. Things like this didn\'t bother me at all in Princess Principal, for example, because the personalities pretty much were enough to carry the thing anyway despite the very ""anime"" character models inside settings that normally wouldn\'t contain this level of ""anime"". The side character villains all look pretty badass. The animation and darkness during ""missions"" favor the idea, but are not good enough to carry the entire thing, that\'s pretty much it. The music is great, tho. Wobs and memes, exactly what light action would/could need, lots of music is used and that\'s really making the action scenes entertaining to watch.As a conclusion: this thing could have easily been several times better and among the best shows from its season. time until the kraken gets out.

Despite being a pretty niche genre in the anime community they have grossly intrigued with great action scenes, fun and likeable characters and interesting narratives. Read, or Die TV and Princess Principal are my examples of this because not those shows had well-animated actions that perfectly. It was no surprise that Release the Spice was my most anticipated anime of the fall season as I really wanted the great spy action anime to continue and in the end, the show ended up my great spy action streak. It may not be as great as Princess Principal and Read...or Die TV writing and character wise but I still believe that Release the Spice is still a great spy action series that has a lot of heart.Story.Momo Minamoto is your average, everyday Ordinary High-School Student, who goes out for a walk one night and sees five suspicious figures running across the rooftops of the factory across the river. It turns out that her city is a secret battleground between Tsukikage, an organization of ninja spy girls dating back to the Warring States era and Moryo, a Mega-Corp with sinister motives. Momo is scouted to join Tsukikage... the members of which turn out to be five of her fellow classmates! From there Momo's life as a spy apprentice begins.The story itself may start off as this typical cute girl with guns doing cute things with guns as they do a bunch of spy work that was given, however, as the series progresses the goes into dark territory where the series dives into serious topics and themes which I won't mention due to spoilers.The one thing that separates Release the Spyce from other anime of its genre that there spy training and mock test. As much I liked seeing the Paper Sisters from and the small spy group do they spy tasks we don't see them train all much. This is Release the Spyce really starts to shine as from episode 2 we see the main protagonist Momo doing through spy test and trails to not only prove herself but to prove her mentor that she's fit for the spy position. This was such a great of pace as compared to other spy anime because it's generally a great introduction to the characters as well origination setting itself. The spy missions in Release The Spyce were pretty entertaining as each of the girls use clever strategies and tactics to achieve the mission goal.The final thing that I want to talk about was how the show set traitor towards the end very unpredictable as set character through the series had no signs of the traitor whatsoever but when set character was revealed to be a traitor I was left speechless because I really set character to be a traitor whatsoever thanks to the lack of suspicious facial expressions.If there were flaws with Release The Spyce, it would be the very slow pacing at times at the show sometimes seems to drag plot aspects way longer than they should Other than that I thought the story of Release The Spyce to be pretty good.8/10Characters.The characters in a release the spice are pretty solid. While they aren't complex chararters by any means but least they were pretty fun and likeable.Momo is a nicely written protagonist. She starts off as a clueless spy but as the grows a person whereby the end of the series she becomes a powerful spy girl.Tsukikage group are all a fun, badass and likeable bunch.Yuki: The strick badass swordsman spy of who is very skilled at martial arts. She's is Momo trainee where she uses harsh training methods in order to make Momo a more capable fighter in spy missions.Mei: The cheerful spy who is filled with life who trains Fu. Outside of spy missions she plays the guitar and holds street performances in order to gather intelligence.Fuu: The ninja spy in disguise who has an obsessive relationship with Mei. Outside of spy missions, she works as a maid in a maid to gain money.Hatsume: The genius spy of the group who is very friendly towards others as well as being extremely skilled with gadgets.Goe: The powerful but shy spy out of all the bunch who uses a sniper rifle at long ranged combat to take down her enemies. She also has a big love for cute things.If I had to pick my favourite character out of the bunch, it would be Mei I really liked her cheerful personality as well as having great chemistry with her apprentice Fuu.As for the other characters, I thought were pretty solid. They may not be as memorable as the main characters but I thought there entertaining characters who served they propose of the plot pretty nicely.8.5/10Visuals.Visually Release the Spyce is pretty good.The characters design while more on the moe side was nicely done. The background scenery is very good, and it fits the tone of the show well for the most part.The animation is smooth, consistent and well animated making the spy cases and the fights more thrilling to watch.8/10Sound.The soundtrack for Release the Spice was pretty good for what it is. The series uses a series of dubstep, electronic and smooth track pieces to give the action and slice of life scenes more weight.The opening theme Spatto! Spy & Spyce sung by the Seiyuus who voiced each of the Tsukikage is an amazingly catchy song where despite being out of place at times it's still a joy to listen to thanks to the upbeat. Easily one of the best opening of 2018 by a long shot.The ending theme Hide & Seek by sung by the Seiyuus who voiced each of the Tsukikage is a pretty good ending theme.Now for sub vs dub.Both are great in their own ways but if I had to pick which one is better it would be the dub. Not only the acting was very spot on but the dub general just fits better with the show set and concept.8/10Final Thoughts.Overall I really liked Release The Spyce. Despite it having saddening MAL score of 7.00 from the time of this review this series ultimately managed to be a financing experience.While it was nowhere near as amazing as Read or Die series and Princess Principal Release the Spyce was still a fun and great spy anime that I enjoyed from start to finish.Final Score 8/10 or Die TV writing and character wise but I still believe that Release the Spice is still a great spy action series that has a lot of heart.Story.Momo Minamoto is your average, everyday Ordinary High-School Student, who goes out for a walk one night and sees five suspicious figures running across the rooftops of the factory across the river.

It\'s airing this week, it can be cool !"".Maybe i\'m stupid, but i have some curiosity in anime, and the synopsis seduced me. So... here we go for this review.First, let\'s tell about the story (2):Well, the story is really, really poor. At this moment, when i write this review, the story is:Student seeing spies enter an organisation of spying where there\'s a traitor.Well, don\'t know...if you\'re thinking like me, but this hasn\'t anything. Yeah Yeah, it has some action or psychological potential issues, but the fact is the psychological factor is ruined because of one scene, where we see the traitor hair, so we can easily guess who he is. Next, the scenes post-ending reveal too much about a lot of things. (for exemple, the scene i was talking about is revealed after the ending of an episode.)The story tries to keep a non-existent suspense, and fail. I won\'t spoil right there, but the last episode is just a line of mindfuck where you\'ll just say ""What ? What the hell is happening right there ?""Now, Art (6):I think it\'s not great, but i think it\'s kind of cool for the 2018 standarts. And, like all my reviews, it\'s just my personal mind.Now, let\'s talk about the sounds (4):The Opening and the Ending aren\'t really memorable, but i liked the opening due to the nostalgia of ""Totally Spies"". That show the ""Funny Spies"" side of the anime, and i think that\'s not bad. The OST are so unmemorable that i don\'t even remember any of them. This is sad, because all the OST i remember are serious, and ruins the ""Funny Spies"" side that i was talking about.Let\'s now talk shortly about the characters (3):Well, there are some characters that aren\'t interesting, even if there are mains. I like the ""apprentice/mentor"" relationships between Yuki and Momo, but i prefer Mei and Fuu. I don\'t know if we gonna have something of the relation between Hatsume and Goe, but i hope.Those characters are all professional spies, but their actions sometimes in missions aren\'t logical. I mean, the MC can make a lot of mistakes, we can understand that, he\'s learning the job. But how can you explain that the others members of the squad want to make a party for the MC\'s anniversary IN MISSION, instead of stopping the villains ?At least, they don\'t notice a mole in their organization, we won\'t blame them for that OBVIOUS mistake. The only character that have some real intelligence is Yuki, always serious, always thinking about everything. The other are just stupid and naive as hell.Now, let me tell you about my enjoyment (4):Even if Release The Spyce have a lot of bad sides, i don\'t think it\'s really bad as hell, i just think that it\'s cool to watch without a lot of serious. Because if you watch it with serious, you\'ll just say everytime, everywhere and at every moment ""WHAT THE HELL ARE THIS SHIT ?"" and you\'ll never have an answer.Overall personal\'s rate: 3 (3.5)Hope this review wasn\'t bad to read. if you\'re thinking like me, but this hasn\'t anything.

Sure, it is rewarding and feels satisfying by the end, but are the other animes that miss this complexity worth being missed or not given a chance? The answer that I reached is no.Some animes are meant to be enjoyed in the same way you enjoy a little piece of candy. Do you get your nutritional needs met with that small piece of sugary, empty-caloried thing? Definitely not. But do you find joy in those seconds of melted sweetness? Yes.Release the...Spyce, despite being a spy anime, has nothing of the complex elements spy stories promise: blood, revenge, betrayal, and other dark themes. And you know what? It is completely fine. No one signed up for that anyway. There are literally hundreds of mysterious tellings of spy animes if that is your thing.It is completely wrong to hate Release the Spyce for not being something it had never the intention of being from the beginning.Release the Spyce is a very light intake on spies.You have a fluffy relationship between the spies, the girls are cute (action and design-wise), not too dark villains, a few elements of comedic reliefs, and a hint of mystery to keep us hooked.The plot is nothing to speak of because it seems that this is an episodic anime, meaning each arc is focused on one of the characters and their motives/developments, with one mystery going through all of the arcs.The animation is fluid and the action scenes are very well done. The colors are vibrant when needed to be, and the sceneries are so fresh and soothing to the eye.The characters are the main focus of the show. Yeah, sure, the organization and its goal of keeping the city safe is the premise, but what drives the story forward is how the girls interact, how they appreciate each other and group work.In fine, if you go into this anime waiting for blood and plot twists and cute girls dying (shame on you!), then don't blame it on the show for being disappointing because it did not promise you that at all. Instead, sit back and let yourself enjoy cute girls living the illusion of a spy life.

No really, it\'s there when you Google ""Worst Thing ever written by a human"". I could go on and on about how boring the show is, how disappointing it ended up being, how much it lacked commitment with its traitor subplot, or how useless and braindead everyone is without being fun or how Momo never really licked anyone despite it being one of the main gimmicks of the show, but I\'m going to spend the rest of this review recommending several alternatives to Spyce instead.Cute girls doing cute action things? Toji no...Miko\'s got you covered. Cute spy things? Princess Principal. But what if you want something from this season specifically with a trashy atmosphere with ninjas and is generally silly fun? Senran Kagura 2\'s got you covered completely.But what if you are a seiyuu-buta who absolutely wants to see Numakura Manami play a one-eyed girl who hides in closets and creeps on her apprentice 24/7 like a spy? Don\'t watch Spyce, watch Uzamaid instead! It accomplishes that and so much more while having a much more heartfelt and serious plot than Spyce could ever muster. Suzaki Aya voicing a traitor who brings down her friends and ultimately brings about her organization\'s demise? Happy Sugar Life just aired last season.However, you , and I know you, are just so hyped up for Namori\'s latest project and you must see something by her. Something involving spies and ninjas and traitors abound with intrigue, suspense and maybe, just maybe, a dash of fun sprinkled in between. Now have I got the perfect show for you.It\'s called Yuru Yuri.See? As much as Spyce loves to homage assorted spy films in its promotional posters, every element of it has been done better by so many other shows out there and it just serves to remind you of how much better other shows are at being Spyce than Spyce itself.Now that this is over, I would like to list my top 3 moments in Spyce. Are you ready boys and girls? It\'s gonna go by quick so pay attention as to not miss anything.3. ""Did you know? \'Spy\' is derived from the word \'Spice\'""2. ""VIKING AXE NUMBER 2!!!!""1.

"", ""First, sorry if my English is bad.[Release The SPYCE] [a little review and personal opinion]From the beginning of making the series (LN / Anime / manga) it did apply Mentor-Pupil ties, as explained by Takahiro as the 'Series Composition'. So it's very natural if the story is very focused on Tsukikage. Besides that, the story is indeed deep and systematic, in episode 10 makes the audience feel 'Shock Therapy'. It's not enough just that, I think it will be fully Happy ending but again Takahiro makes heartache.A proper ending, let's think, if the Mentor and Pupil are only separated by distance and place, it can...still be reunited but if the Teacher and Disciples have shared memories, on the one hand they don't know that being in the same place is painful.Many unexpected stories such as when May and Katrina planned double spies 2 years ago and many others.The coolest thing is when Momo vs Tendo, Momo uses the existing service, great when Momo smeared his sword using Sunblock to become Invisible SwordThe Minus of this anime is an inconsistent art, but for me it is not a big problem, because an extraordinary story has covered up the shortcomings.Nah, This is just my opinion, actually Yuki had asked for a reminder of the bullet eraser bullet to Hatsume beforehand, so the bullet eraser effect didn't work on her. Yuki lied to Momo. Remember, spies are liars.Yuki's goal was to do that so Momo could move forward and not ask Yuki to be spoiled again, so Momo could be independent and have his own pupil.Yuki once told Momo that Yuki wanted to see what Momo pupil looked like later. That means Yuki did lie to Momo that Yuki's memories were erased. still be reunited but if the Teacher and Disciples have shared memories, on the one hand they don't know that being in the same place is painful.Many unexpected stories such as when May and Katrina planned double spies 2 years ago and many others.The coolest thing is when Momo vs Tendo, Momo uses the existing service, great when Momo smeared his sword using Sunblock to become Invisible SwordThe Minus of this anime is an inconsistent art, but for me it is not a big problem, because an extraordinary story has covered up the shortcomings.Nah, This is just my opinion, actually Yuki had asked for a reminder of the bullet eraser bullet to Hatsume beforehand, so the bullet eraser effect didn't work on her.

Most of this anime is best described as good, but not the best. A kind of anime you would watch and then forget about a couple months later, but the thing surprised me the most about Release the Spyce is the melancholy I feel when thinking about it. It wasn't a sad anime. It's just that sometimes when I am falling asleep while listening to music, the ED song Hide & Seek comes on, and it evokes some emotions inside me....It may be because of the way the anime ended or the thought that the anime will probably never get another season, but that doesn't matter in the end. What matters is that the anime caused me to feel something that I can still feel when I think back on it. It is rare for an anime to have an impact like that on me. When I finished the anime, I would have given it a 6/10, but whenever I listen to the ED song, I can't help but feel melancholic. That feeling brings it up to an 8/10.

The OP kinda makes it look like it\'s just a silly girl spies show but IMO the track...is pretty nice. All action scenes were well made over the course of the entire show.And lastly the story and topics that take place in this show are quite serious and interesting. I\'ve read many detective novel, thrillers, etc. and this story was definitely comparable to some of the better stories I\'ve read.So for me it\'s a top 3 for this season & definitely a show you should watch ASAP if you haven\'t already. I think 9/10 score is very justified and that it\'s quite underrated. is pretty nice.

The concept is simple. Replace James Bond with a team of cute anime girls that can hulk out eating spices. That's exactly what you're getting here. However the show really embraced it's concept and ran with it, giving you a fun ride.So, the story for this anime is wrought with spy tropes.  You see everything coming from a mile away, but the point of the story for this series was clearly to get you from set piece to set piece. The humor is prevalent but rarely more than just okay....The characters pretty much all have a single dominant personality trait that defines them, with little else going on. With exception to the villain. The villain doesn't even have one personality trait. I swear, if she had a mustache, she would have twirled it.Yet still, I had fun with this show. The animation of the action sequences were pretty good. The girls were certainly cute but still bad ass.  I knew I was not watching something brilliant, but none of the missteps in the writer's room were jarring. They didn't do anything so stupid it could take you out of a show that is presenting itself as good dumb fun.To me, that's the saving grace of Release the Spyce. They knew they were never going to have a masterpiece here, so they had fun with what was there. Is this a must watch? Not in the slightest. Still, it's fun enough to where you will not feel like you wasted four to five hours of your life.

There seems to be little reason why the girls are so overpowered as compared to regular human beings...because they are supposed to be regular human beings. Regardless of what you say about training methods, it simply feels cheesy and cheap, with no proper foreshadowing towards any of the characters' so called hidden abillities/potential.I get that this is an anime that really just isn't meant to be taken with any sense of realism, but at the very least make things look somewhat believable. At least Black Widow's fighting style in the movies looked more believable than...this. Fact of life, women are physically weaker than men on average. And ignoring sex, being less than half the size of another person with no muscle development leads to very unrealistic and unbelievable fight scenes that feel cheap and overplayed. At the very least, use fighting styles that highlight making up for the physical differences in strength level, rather than having some chick be strong enough to pick up a man that likely weighs around 75-80 kilos with a single hand at arm's length like he's nothing. At least Batman looks like he can do that, she definitely does not. Even John Wick can't fight more than two or three guys at a time, and most of the time he does it with a gun.This really just feels like one of those anime that is centered around overpowering characters when convenient and never presenting any real threat or genuine fear for the situations they're placed in. At the very least I'd hoped they'd steer away from the general tropes about love and friendship but I guess the writer said nope. Their villains don't look threatening, their storyline is not interesting, there is no tension in anything that the villains or characters do, and there is no sense of foreboding regardless of the events that transpire.It really isn't because of any one part of the anime, but more a mixture of all the things from the art style to the music to the story, but this makes this a bag of bad things mixed together and presented to you in a jumbled mess. The story feels like it has no direction, and without a good story there is really little else to make this anime worth watching.Ultimately, please leave the wanking to when you're alone in your room, and don't place it into an anime. Stuffing 15-17 year old girls that look like they're 12 into skimpy outfits and having them fight crime is really not the way to go to create a real masterpiece in anime. John Wick had no story whatsoever, but still managed to become one of the best movies ever due to wonderful choreography and great action scenes. Having a highschool girl clock someone in the face with an arm half the size of his and sending him flying does not make for an entertaining fight scene.

With NO spoilers.I really enjoyed Release the Spyce, in lots of moments reminded me of Totally Spies! The score does not give merit to this show as it is actually enjoyable and gave me an overall good time watching. I only gonna warn you that the first 5 episodes are really great, then until the 10th it's a little repetitive.. but to the 10th till the last one, it really gave me some killing/emotional/wtf/great moments. Some said that the plot kinda got predictable, but for me, all the twists got me unexpectedly.Overall, I really enjoyed it! the soundtrack is really...cool, the OP is amazing (gonna miss it a lot), the characters although are not my style, didn't make me feel weird about it and the animation is cool. I recommend watching if you liked totally spies and if you want a chilling kinda cute and fast anime. cool, the OP is amazing (gonna miss it a lot), the characters although are not my style, didn't make me feel weird about it and the animation is cool.

I'm not usually a viewer of magical girl shows but this show alone has caused me to become addicted to the genre. It's not a comedy, not a deconstruction, not a kids' show, just a straightforward action show with fantastic writing. I'm not sure what the intended audience is for this show, given that it mixes cutesy highschool drama with actual violence and adult themes like whorehouses; which is a good thing in my opinion as it probably means the creators were just trying to express themselves, to...write a show for them rather than for someone else. There's a moment near the end that I disagree with, but otherwise the show's writing is flawless. And the soundtrack...You wouldn't think that rave music would gel so well with a show about Magical Girl Batman but it works fantastically. write a show for them rather than for someone else.

I promise I’ll crank these out more frequently now, especially since I’m pretty worry-free this winter break. Look forward to me struggling to articulate the greatness of some of my favorite shows ever in some of the reviews I have coming up.If you haven’t already, check out my updated waifu list! I worked pretty hard to update it, so I’d appreciate if you check it out and leave a comment!Enough getting sidetracked, let’s get straight to the point. I’m doing a review for the recently finished airing Release the Spyce, and I’m doing this for...two reasons: one, to clear up misunderstandings about the show for the people who dislike the show after having finished it due to the misguided expectations they had for it. Two, to get more people to watch this show and hopefully patch up its average MAL score. Just yesterday, Release the Spyce had a 6.70 average rating. Although at the time of me writing this it has drastically increased to a 7.00 average, shows like Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet from the same season has a 7.63 rating. And Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet is no more than your average, tropey rom-com harem show. While Release the Spyce is by no means a masterpiece, it was the highlight seasonal show of the season for me and I aim to express that through the following review. Let’s get started.To sum it all up in one short paragraph, here’s what my whole entire review is trying to say. I’ll go more into detail later if you’re still here to read it. To be honest, I didn’t start watching Release the Spyce during the Fall 2018 season until episode 9 had already aired. I had avoided the show because the revealing outfits of the girls in Release the Spyce led me to believe that it was just another “skimpily dressed girls battle in your run-of-the-mill battle girl ecchi show” like Ange Vierge or something, but I was way off the mark. Release the Spyce is a moe action yuri spy thriller. Now, you may be confused after hearing that. The bottom line is that Release the Spyce takes two seemingly incompatible things like cute high school girls and high-profile secret agents, mixes them together, and makes it work really, really well. Release the Spyce is a moe slice of life at its heart, with shounen and yuri elements mixed in as supplements. For people who haven’t watched Release the Spyce and are considering it, Release the Spyce heavily resembles most Cute Girls Doing Cute Things shows. If you enjoy CGDCTs like K-On, Gochiusa, New Game, Blend S, etc., definitely give Release the Spyce a watch. You definitely won’t regret it since it’s fundamentally structured like your typical CGDCT show, except the cute thing they’re doing being ninja spies.That’s it for the summary. Let’s elaborate on the things I may have glossed over in the summary for the sake of brevity.The first question about Release the Spyce someone may have is how can something be considered an action thriller if it has overarching moe (cute) undertones to everything? The answer to that is I don’t know, and I don’t care. It just works. Release the Spyce is able to take some awesome action tips from shounens like Naruto and mix it together with the campy cuteness of shows like K-On to create something cohesive, entertaining, and unique. It’s not a surprise since other shows from this season have done the exact same thing by mixing up two seemingly unrelated elements and coming up with something that works much better than it has any right to. To name some of my favorites, Zombieland Saga made an idol show about zombies and Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san made a moe yuri slice of life about loli vampires. Although it’s fundamentally still a moe show, Release the Spyce incorporates many media tropes from the action genre very well. You’re gonna get some serious My Hero Academia vibes with the first episode, with “do you want to become a hero/spy” being synonymous among the two shows that come from two pretty unrelated genres. If you were one of those kids that got all giddy watching the old Batman cartoons that aired on Saturday mornings or really like the Spy Kids movies, then Release the Spyce is definitely worth checking out if you don’t mind that cute anime girls are the focus of the show. To be honest, some of the technology that Tsukikage works with looks a whole lot more practical than a lot of the stuff Batman has in his belt.A VERY IMPORTANT thing to consider though, as you continue getting engrossed in this world of smartphone pistols, grappling hooks, holographic decoys, and invisibility lotion, is that this is a show about cute girls doing cute things. This especially goes out to the people who were “disappointed” by the ending. No matter how badass these girls are and how much the stakes are raised as the show goes on, the focus is on the moe and the yuri of the cute girls. So don’t expect some Tom Cruise jumping out of a burning helicopter to retrieve the detonator to a nuclear weapon or some insane 007 mind game. Release the Spyce may employ many elements from the action and spy genre very well, but that’s all it’s doing. It’s merely employing those elements, not identifying with them. Don’t be tricked; remember: all spies are liars. Got it memorized? Hating on a moe show for not fulfilling your ultimate fantasy of an anime action spy thriller is the same as hating imouto shows, watching Eromanga Sensei anyways, and then complaining about it. (someone please notice my Eromanga Sensei review)From here on I’ll move on to covering the story, art, sound, character, and enjoyment of Release the Spyce. To do this thoroughly though, there will be at least some SPOILERS or references that may become spoilers. If you haven’t already quit reading my review to go watch Release the Spyce, go do it now! It’s honestly a really good time. Whether you’re a moe fan that just tolerates action, an action fan that just tolerates moe, or someone that paradoxically loves both moe and action like me, Release the Spyce will be an extremely entertaining ride.Story: 007/10The story is honestly the weakest part of this show. I was serious when I said not expect some crazy 007 shit. There wasn’t some crazy plot twist and the show didn’t go all Madoka Magica on us, which led many people (haters, cough, haters) to be let down. That being said, the story isn’t bad at all. As someone who regularly watches moe shows where the narrative is sometimes episodic at best, the story of Release the Spyce is very cohesive, clear, and somewhat moving. Release the Spyce is about our main girl Momo Minamoto, or as she likes to be called, Momochi (lol Peach). Momochi’s father was a police officer that gave his life protecting the city, and Momochi is motivated to step up and protect her home of Sorasaki City to honor her father’s legacy. She looks up to her senpai Yuki Hanzomon because she’s your typical smart, talented, cool, and beautiful senpai that all the girls at the school want to be acknowledged by (yuri intensifies). It turns out Yuki is a secret agent of Tsukikage along with the other girls Momochi met at school and Momochi is scouted to join their ranks, even becoming Yuki’s apprentice (shishou yuri intensifies). From here on out continues Momochi’s story of growth from an introverted schoolgirl to someone who has founded her courage through her efforts and achievements. The cyclical resemblance of the first episode to the last episode is always something I appreciate in shows. Momochi taking her turn after Yuki to be the one standing up for the city and instilling courage in a kouhai definitely demonstrates deliberate consideration and awareness of the overarching theme of a narrative, something that separates mediocre anime from good ones. While it isn’t the most innovative way to lay the foundation for a show, it served its purpose well enough considering how this is a moe show driven by a demand for cuteness as much as it is by the narrative.HEAVY SPOILERS BEGINFor people still contemplating the meaning behind Yuki’s smile at the very end, I think it’s heavily implied from her reaction that she still remembers everything in spite of what she said about having her memory erased. All spies are liars, after all. The only evidence I can offer is slightly before the scene with Yuki and Momochi by the beach, where there is a cut to the old lady’s slight reaction to the butcher shop owner talking about the mysterious allies of justice that protect Sorasaki City, which implies she had memories of her time with Tsukikage as well. Make of it what you will; it’s definitely something they left up to personal interpretation.HEAVY SPOILERS ENDArt: 9/10I don’t really know what to say about the art, other than that it’s really moe. All the girls are very cute and the colorful outfits and hair colors of the main Tsukikage members serve to support this. I especially find the purple and the red on their school uniforms and Tsukikage outfits to be very good choices that bring out the nature of the show. Especially with the effect that spyce has on the girls in making their eyes change colors and glow, I can’t believe some people really forgot they were actually watching something moe.Addressing the non-moe parts of the animation style, the opening pretty much does a good job of showing how well Release the Spyce employs action tropes to its advantage. The first twenty seconds of the opening employ a bunch of stuff you’d see in an older 007 trailer, like the zoom in on the silhouettes of the main cast in a plain white background, the camera shutter and search light effects as the cast is introduced, and finally the infamous shot of introducing the enemies through the barrel of a spy’s pistol. With its use of shadows and darkness, Release the Spyce definitely knows when to tone down the moe elements to instill dramatic effect. Even a few of the fight scenes are well choreographed and animated to the point where you question if this is actually just a shounen show.Sound: 10/10spapapa papa papapapa papapa spy and spice! OST for Release the Spyce is bomb. The opening is probably just my favorite OP this season, like, I’ve been listening to it on repeat while I write this. Nothing more needs to be said about how much value it adds when the VAs participate in doing the opening for their show. The ED is less remarkable, but it also works well and fits in so much that I can’t imagine anything but having the starting jingle of the ED at the end of every Release the Spyce episode. Outside of the OP and ED, the other soundtracks are noteworthy as well. There are some seriously epic battle themes that really shouldn’t be overlooked in this show along with some groovy techno synth that plays for infiltration sequences. Release the Spyce once again makes a good reference to classic spy films with its proliferating use of the trumpet that really does call back to 007 when it’s played during the hype of one of their spy operations.Character: 10/10Calling back to its identity as a moe show, Release the Spyce boasts its characters as its strongest asset. Since the narrative of Tsukikage and the spy operations are heavily based on the relationships the girls have with each other, it’s natural that they receive so much attention. The shishou and apprentice system of Tsukikage really does kind of make it resemble Greek life with bigs and littles. Going off of that analogy, you could even call Tsukikage a sorority of sorts. The aspect of sisterhood and very close friendship is emphasized in the trust and chemistry all of the characters have with each other. While many of the characters are just kinda tropey by themselves, their interactions with each other are the most genuine aspects of this show that really make it shine. Especially between the mentor and apprentice couples, there is a deep relationship that is the focus of many of the episodes and gives enough yuri bait to fuel all the Release the Spyce fanfictions. Seriously, Mei and Fuu already moved in with each other, so they may as well just get married and have babies.Enjoyment: 10/10I’ve pretty much already littered the reasons why I like this show all over the review, so I’ll just quickly reprise. I’m someone that was introduced to anime through shows like Pokemon, YuGiOh, Naruto, and Dragon Ball Z. These shows are, for the most part, driven by action and hype. Since then I’ve diversified my anime interests to watch really anything as long as it’s well made, taking a particular liking to moe shows like K-On. It’s pretty irreconcilable to balance both a love for shounen and moe, and I hardly ever see these two genres intersect in a way that doesn’t completely fall apart. Release the Spyce is my first exposure to something that put these two things together, and more importantly, put them together well. Usually girls in some kind of action show are sexualized to a point where it’s just hentai, but Release the Spyce didn’t do any of that. Release the Spyce kept all of the bubbly moe friendship intact and even sprinkled in some yuri bait to keep things spicy. Release the Spyce had action sequences with epic OST that could get me hyped over the curious enhancing power of spyce that fuels the adrenaline-rushing, car chasing, roof hopping, and robot slicing goodness. And then the girls would go back to the café again to eat curry and spread more moe around. In an age of repeating tropes and brainless productions, an anime that took my two favorite things and put in real effort to seamlessly combine them was a ray of light piercing the darkness for me. It’s why Release the Spyce is my pick for best anime of the season and why any other moe/action fans should check it out. This show is much too good to just be another flavor of the season.Overall: 9/109/10 means that the show had everything it needed for me to have a really good time watching it, but it also means the show did not perform in a way that made it stand out as an all-time favorite to me. In that way, I would actually have to agree that Release the Spyce did somewhat disappoint me with its ending. Why the show didn’t receive a 10/10 for me is that the ending was mostly predictable and hastily executed. While the ending did cover a lot and I did mention that the cyclical ending really made it stand out, there were still some parts of the ending that didn’t sit right with me. Many people who were presumed to be dead just kinda came back without any tension or drama. While the show did come full circle with Momochi scouting someone new and inspiring them to join Tsukikage, it really lacked impact as well. It really could have been more refined, like fleshing out the epilogue by either showing her apprentice fawning over her like Momochi had fawned over Yuki at the very beginning, or including an homage to Momochi’s father as a testament to how much she grew. But ultimately, that final episode covered so much content that a completely separate episode probably would’ve been necessary to put my ideas into fruition. Seeing how the show was mostly a character-driven moe show, this is really something I can overlook.All in all, Release the Spyce is a very entertaining show that let me celebrate my favorite parts of anime. So, I write this in celebration of Release the Spyce, in hopes that this show garners more attention than it has now because it really deserves to stand out for the style and creativity it exercised when mixing moe and action together in a single show. The secret ingredient? Just a pinch of spyce. two reasons: one, to clear up misunderstandings about the show for the people who dislike the show after having finished it due to the misguided expectations they had for it. Two, to get more people to watch this show and hopefully patch up its average MAL score. Just yesterday, Release the Spyce had a 6.70 average rating. Although at the time of me writing this it has drastically increased to a 7.00 average, shows like Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet from the same season has a 7.63 rating. And Kishuku Gakkou no Juliet is no more than your average, tropey rom-com harem show. While Release the Spyce is by no means a masterpiece, it was the highlight seasonal show of the season for me and I aim to express that through the following review. Let’s get started.To sum it all up in one short paragraph, here’s what my whole entire review is trying to say. I’ll go more into detail later if you’re still here to read it. To be honest, I didn’t start watching Release the Spyce during the Fall 2018 season until episode 9 had already aired. I had avoided the show because the revealing outfits of the girls in Release the Spyce led me to believe that it was just another “skimpily dressed girls battle in your run-of-the-mill battle girl ecchi show” like Ange Vierge or something, but I was way off the mark. Release the Spyce is a moe action yuri spy thriller. Now, you may be confused after hearing that. The bottom line is that Release the Spyce takes two seemingly incompatible things like cute high school girls and high-profile secret agents, mixes them together, and makes it work really, really well. Release the Spyce is a moe slice of life at its heart, with shounen and yuri elements mixed in as supplements. For people who haven’t watched Release the Spyce and are considering it, Release the Spyce heavily resembles most Cute Girls Doing Cute Things shows. If you enjoy CGDCTs like K-On, Gochiusa, New Game, Blend S, etc., definitely give Release the Spyce a watch. You definitely won’t regret it since it’s fundamentally structured like your typical CGDCT show, except the cute thing they’re doing being ninja spies.That’s it for the summary. Let’s elaborate on the things I may have glossed over in the summary for the sake of brevity.The first question about Release the Spyce someone may have is how can something be considered an action thriller if it has overarching moe (cute) undertones to everything? The answer to that is I don’t know, and I don’t care. It just works. Release the Spyce is able to take some awesome action tips from shounens like Naruto and mix it together with the campy cuteness of shows like K-On to create something cohesive, entertaining, and unique. It’s not a surprise since other shows from this season have done the exact same thing by mixing up two seemingly unrelated elements and coming up with something that works much better than it has any right to. To name some of my favorites, Zombieland Saga made an idol show about zombies and Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san made a moe yuri slice of life about loli vampires. Although it’s fundamentally still a moe show, Release the Spyce incorporates many media tropes from the action genre very well. You’re gonna get some serious My Hero Academia vibes with the first episode, with “do you want to become a hero/spy” being synonymous among the two shows that come from two pretty unrelated genres. If you were one of those kids that got all giddy watching the old Batman cartoons that aired on Saturday mornings or really like the Spy Kids movies, then Release the Spyce is definitely worth checking out if you don’t mind that cute anime girls are the focus of the show. To be honest, some of the technology that Tsukikage works with looks a whole lot more practical than a lot of the stuff Batman has in his belt.A VERY IMPORTANT thing to consider though, as you continue getting engrossed in this world of smartphone pistols, grappling hooks, holographic decoys, and invisibility lotion, is that this is a show about cute girls doing cute things. This especially goes out to the people who were “disappointed” by the ending. No matter how badass these girls are and how much the stakes are raised as the show goes on, the focus is on the moe and the yuri of the cute girls. So don’t expect some Tom Cruise jumping out of a burning helicopter to retrieve the detonator to a nuclear weapon or some insane 007 mind game. Release the Spyce may employ many elements from the action and spy genre very well, but that’s all it’s doing. It’s merely employing those elements, not identifying with them. Don’t be tricked; remember: all spies are liars. Got it memorized? Hating on a moe show for not fulfilling your ultimate fantasy of an anime action spy thriller is the same as hating imouto shows, watching Eromanga Sensei anyways, and then complaining about it. (someone please notice my Eromanga Sensei review)From here on I’ll move on to covering the story, art, sound, character, and enjoyment of Release the Spyce. To do this thoroughly though, there will be at least some SPOILERS or references that may become spoilers. If you haven’t already quit reading my review to go watch Release the Spyce, go do it now! It’s honestly a really good time. Whether you’re a moe fan that just tolerates action, an action fan that just tolerates moe, or someone that paradoxically loves both moe and action like me, Release the Spyce will be an extremely entertaining ride.Story: 007/10The story is honestly the weakest part of this show. I was serious when I said not expect some crazy 007 shit. There wasn’t some crazy plot twist and the show didn’t go all Madoka Magica on us, which led many people (haters, cough, haters) to be let down. That being said, the story isn’t bad at all. As someone who regularly watches moe shows where the narrative is sometimes episodic at best, the story of Release the Spyce is very cohesive, clear, and somewhat moving. Release the Spyce is about our main girl Momo Minamoto, or as she likes to be called, Momochi (lol Peach). Momochi’s father was a police officer that gave his life protecting the city, and Momochi is motivated to step up and protect her home of Sorasaki City to honor her father’s legacy. She looks up to her senpai Yuki Hanzomon because she’s your typical smart, talented, cool, and beautiful senpai that all the girls at the school want to be acknowledged by (yuri intensifies). It turns out Yuki is a secret agent of Tsukikage along with the other girls Momochi met at school and Momochi is scouted to join their ranks, even becoming Yuki’s apprentice (shishou yuri intensifies). From here on out continues Momochi’s story of growth from an introverted schoolgirl to someone who has founded her courage through her efforts and achievements. The cyclical resemblance of the first episode to the last episode is always something I appreciate in shows. Momochi taking her turn after Yuki to be the one standing up for the city and instilling courage in a kouhai definitely demonstrates deliberate consideration and awareness of the overarching theme of a narrative, something that separates mediocre anime from good ones. While it isn’t the most innovative way to lay the foundation for a show, it served its purpose well enough considering how this is a moe show driven by a demand for cuteness as much as it is by the narrative.HEAVY SPOILERS BEGINFor people still contemplating the meaning behind Yuki’s smile at the very end, I think it’s heavily implied from her reaction that she still remembers everything in spite of what she said about having her memory erased. All spies are liars, after all. The only evidence I can offer is slightly before the scene with Yuki and Momochi by the beach, where there is a cut to the old lady’s slight reaction to the butcher shop owner talking about the mysterious allies of justice that protect Sorasaki City, which implies she had memories of her time with Tsukikage as well. Make of it what you will; it’s definitely something they left up to personal interpretation.HEAVY SPOILERS ENDArt: 9/10I don’t really know what to say about the art, other than that it’s really moe. All the girls are very cute and the colorful outfits and hair colors of the main Tsukikage members serve to support this. I especially find the purple and the red on their school uniforms and Tsukikage outfits to be very good choices that bring out the nature of the show. Especially with the effect that spyce has on the girls in making their eyes change colors and glow, I can’t believe some people really forgot they were actually watching something moe.Addressing the non-moe parts of the animation style, the opening pretty much does a good job of showing how well Release the Spyce employs action tropes to its advantage. The first twenty seconds of the opening employ a bunch of stuff you’d see in an older 007 trailer, like the zoom in on the silhouettes of the main cast in a plain white background, the camera shutter and search light effects as the cast is introduced, and finally the infamous shot of introducing the enemies through the barrel of a spy’s pistol. With its use of shadows and darkness, Release the Spyce definitely knows when to tone down the moe elements to instill dramatic effect. Even a few of the fight scenes are well choreographed and animated to the point where you question if this is actually just a shounen show.Sound: 10/10spapapa papa papapapa papapa spy and spice! OST for Release the Spyce is bomb. The opening is probably just my favorite OP this season, like, I’ve been listening to it on repeat while I write this. Nothing more needs to be said about how much value it adds when the VAs participate in doing the opening for their show. The ED is less remarkable, but it also works well and fits in so much that I can’t imagine anything but having the starting jingle of the ED at the end of every Release the Spyce episode. Outside of the OP and ED, the other soundtracks are noteworthy as well. There are some seriously epic battle themes that really shouldn’t be overlooked in this show along with some groovy techno synth that plays for infiltration sequences. Release the Spyce once again makes a good reference to classic spy films with its proliferating use of the trumpet that really does call back to 007 when it’s played during the hype of one of their spy operations.Character: 10/10Calling back to its identity as a moe show, Release the Spyce boasts its characters as its strongest asset. Since the narrative of Tsukikage and the spy operations are heavily based on the relationships the girls have with each other, it’s natural that they receive so much attention. The shishou and apprentice system of Tsukikage really does kind of make it resemble Greek life with bigs and littles. Going off of that analogy, you could even call Tsukikage a sorority of sorts. The aspect of sisterhood and very close friendship is emphasized in the trust and chemistry all of the characters have with each other. While many of the characters are just kinda tropey by themselves, their interactions with each other are the most genuine aspects of this show that really make it shine. Especially between the mentor and apprentice couples, there is a deep relationship that is the focus of many of the episodes and gives enough yuri bait to fuel all the Release the Spyce fanfictions. Seriously, Mei and Fuu already moved in with each other, so they may as well just get married and have babies.Enjoyment: 10/10I’ve pretty much already littered the reasons why I like this show all over the review, so I’ll just quickly reprise. I’m someone that was introduced to anime through shows like Pokemon, YuGiOh, Naruto, and Dragon Ball Z. These shows are, for the most part, driven by action and hype. Since then I’ve diversified my anime interests to watch really anything as long as it’s well made, taking a particular liking to moe shows like K-On. It’s pretty irreconcilable to balance both a love for shounen and moe, and I hardly ever see these two genres intersect in a way that doesn’t completely fall apart. Release the Spyce is my first exposure to something that put these two things together, and more importantly, put them together well. Usually girls in some kind of action show are sexualized to a point where it’s just hentai, but Release the Spyce didn’t do any of that. Release the Spyce kept all of the bubbly moe friendship intact and even sprinkled in some yuri bait to keep things spicy. Release the Spyce had action sequences with epic OST that could get me hyped over the curious enhancing power of spyce that fuels the adrenaline-rushing, car chasing, roof hopping, and robot slicing goodness. And then the girls would go back to the café again to eat curry and spread more moe around. In an age of repeating tropes and brainless productions, an anime that took my two favorite things and put in real effort to seamlessly combine them was a ray of light piercing the darkness for me. It’s why Release the Spyce is my pick for best anime of the season and why any other moe/action fans should check it out. This show is much too good to just be another flavor of the season.Overall: 9/109/10 means that the show had everything it needed for me to have a really good time watching it, but it also means the show did not perform in a way that made it stand out as an all-time favorite to me. In that way, I would actually have to agree that Release the Spyce did somewhat disappoint me with its ending. Why the show didn’t receive a 10/10 for me is that the ending was mostly predictable and hastily executed. While the ending did cover a lot and I did mention that the cyclical ending really made it stand out, there were still some parts of the ending that didn’t sit right with me. Many people who were presumed to be dead just kinda came back without any tension or drama. While the show did come full circle with Momochi scouting someone new and inspiring them to join Tsukikage, it really lacked impact as well. It really could have been more refined, like fleshing out the epilogue by either showing her apprentice fawning over her like Momochi had fawned over Yuki at the very beginning, or including an homage to Momochi’s father as a testament to how much she grew. But ultimately, that final episode covered so much content that a completely separate episode probably would’ve been necessary to put my ideas into fruition. Seeing how the show was mostly a character-driven moe show, this is really something I can overlook.All in all, Release the Spyce is a very entertaining show that let me celebrate my favorite parts of anime. So, I write this in celebration of Release the Spyce, in hopes that this show garners more attention than it has now because it really deserves to stand out for the style and creativity it exercised when mixing moe and action together in a single show. The secret ingredient? Just a pinch of spyce.', ""I'll try not to be too wordy here. In an absolute nutshell, I love this anime. Sure it's story is kinda cheesy, reminding me of some of the 1980s western cartoons such as GI Joe, Thundercats or Defenders of the Earth. Colorful, packed with action, an overarching plot against a Big Bad enemy. Interesting characters with obviously different personalities and abilities. Great opening theme song and pretty decent soundtrack (well, maybe not Defends of the Earth on that last point). Indeed, its better animated than the three I mentioned, and better voice-acted.I won't lie and tell you that it has the best story, or that...the characters aren't the most interesting in anime, cause they're not. The story itself, because of its reminiscence of 80s western cartoons, is relatively simple and straight forward; it doesn't NEED to be complicated though. Its not a drama, its an action-thriller.There are certainly parts of the show where I get a little frustrated by odd time-skips, or explanations of things rather than not showing them (NOT referring to episode 11), but when I take the show on the whole I love it. I don't expect everyone to agree - its average rating as I write this is 7.0 where as I gave it a little smidge over 8 and I know plenty of people who write it off.Now, the next part I'm going to touch on is something I am *extremely* passionate about. And that is that this anime SHOULD BE TAGGED AS YURI. There is zero doubt in my mind that every single member of Tsukikage is at minimum bisexual. There are three obvious pairings who show romantic and very subtle sexual interest in each other. Indeed, the pairings of Mei and Fuu, and of Hatsume and Goe, are pretty damned overt. I will not accept people saying that 'theyre just close friends'. Bullshit. I am lesbian myself. I know lesbian romance/desire when I see it.Furthermore, and maybe this is out of the scope of the review, but if one were to take the time to read the manga spin-off it becomes even more overt. I won't spoil it, as it should be read, but its super clear that the two above pairings plus of course Yuki and Momo are just that. Couples. That Release the Spyce isn't tagged as Yuri frustrates me, because all the streaming sites (ok well, HiDive is the only one that carries it, so.. HIDIVE LISTEN UP I EMAILED YOUR SUPPORT STAFF MONTHS AGO ABOUT THIS) do not tag it as (in the case of HIDIVE) LGBTQ. Growl!Now, from the perspective of it being a Yuri anime? I think that it rates pretty high up among the best of them, able to compete with some of the classics. Is it as good as Bloom into You? Well no, nothing is at this point in time. But is it as good as Sakura Trick? Absolutely. I might even say its as good as Strawberry Panic in its own way. Better than Citrus. FAR FAR better than NTR and Kuttsukiboshi.If you like 80s-inspired action thrillers, funky-ass music (and a GREAT OP), and solid Yuri, then you must give Release the Spyce a watch. the characters aren't the most interesting in anime, cause they're not.

I was playing the intro theme and thought ""Man, If it has a soundtrack this good it\'s probably amazing!"" and was promptly disappointedStarting off with what\'s good: I do like the more high-intensity fight scenes in the anime, They\'re fluid, Well paced and clever. And the sound director Akiko Fujita did a really really good job with the musicThe concept of the anime is like nothing I\'ve ever heard of before, Forget magical girls, I want ninja girls in all my anime from now on. The animation in this really has its moments, I\'m probably gonna check out some...more of the studio\'s worksWhat I don\'t like is the characters, I know this is an anime but they a little bit too 2d. I might be wrong about later episodes, Maybe they get better, But I don\'t think I should need to watch more than 4 episodes to like a characterThe story is simple, Too simple, Like a cartoon. Maybe I\'m just a sucker for stone cold depressing drama in my anime but I personally think it\'s just a bit too silly in contrast to the occasional serious momentsShould you watch it?

It may be just the thing for you', ""I started watching Release the Spyce because someone said it was something similar to Toji no Miko (an underrated masterpiece). And yes, the truth is they are somewhat similar, if we are based only on the concept of 'high school girls fighting with a bit of yuri', but they are quite different apart from that.Story: 6/10Well, the story is interesting. The 'spies' theme is something I haven't seen in many anime, and this one somehow executes it decently. It places the story from the perspective of an average girl who starts out as a spy in the group 'Tsukikage', it presents us with an interesting...plot about an evil organization called Moryo that is related to certain drugs, and through the series, we see the Spygirls defeat various members of other organizations that are related to Moryo, but that in the end of the case are only used as distractions by this evil organization, which made me intriguing.BUT, here lies the main difference with Touji no Miko. While the latter at least gave you a kind of context about the world and where the superpowers of the tojis came from, in Release the Spyce we know that girls obtain superhuman abilities from the 'spyce', but it is never explained to us why this Spyce only It works on young girls, we don't know the complete past of Tsukikage and when and why it was founded, nor do we know what the 'spyce' really is and where it comes from, which leaves many things unknown. Obviously, it was 12 episodes, but I feel like several episodes were unnecessary and could have been used for worldbuilding.Art: 9/10I can't say much. The animation is generic and so are the designs, but is that bad? Not at all, I'm not picky about these sections. The designs are simple, but I found them cute, so that's fine. There were parts where the animation looked weird, but I didn't complain too much about it. Mind you, the fights were beautiful in my opinion, I enjoyed them too much.Sound: 10/10Umm, I think one of the things I liked the most was the OST of the show, as well as the OP and ED. They were just great, nothing more to say.Character: 8/10For a series that doesn't aim for much, the characters are really great. I don't believe in dividing the characters into 'three-dimensional' or the like, but I can say that these characters were to some extent realistic and well done. But, unlike the characters in amazing Touji no Miko, although in Release the Spyce each character has their own conflicts and thoughts, I feel like many needed a little more background. Momo is the best character in the series, obviously, not only is she the best girl, but she is the best written, but there are characters like Hatsume who were not a big deal.Momochi: Momo is a very good character. She is presented as an average high school girl, sweet, kind, cheerful, but somewhat shy, which is why she starts out as a social isolate in her second year of high school. She has a strong sense of justice, especially since her father was a cop, but at the same time she is a coward. By joining Tsukikage, we see how Momo strives to become stronger day by day, this thanks to the help of her 'shishou', she goes through hard training but gets used to it over time, we see her fail and make mistakes in some missions , but learn from these, to take the lead in the final mission. The end of the series shows great maturity on her part, because although she was unwilling to separate from her 'shishou' and that she lost her memories, Momo ended up accepting the decision, and transmitted the feelings inherited from her shishou to her next student.I don't want to extend too much, but the other characters were also interesting, with their own problems, but they, unlike Momo, do not show great development and lack a background.Enjoyment: 10/10Well, the series is not boring at all. Every episode is entertaining, comedy is good for this type of series, the fight scenes were the best, and it keeps you hooked if you are someone who enjoys this type of series.Overall: 8/10A better-than-average series speaking of CGDCT (although it doesn't have much moe), but it still doesn't surpass the masterpiece for superior people: Toji no Miko. plot about an evil organization called Moryo that is related to certain drugs, and through the series, we see the Spygirls defeat various members of other organizations that are related to Moryo, but that in the end of the case are only used as distractions by this evil organization, which made me intriguing.BUT, here lies the main difference with Touji no Miko.

To be clear: it is a ""fairly"" light hearted story about a group of ninja spy girls looking over the city and fighting an evil powerful organisation that works in the shadows.

I don't know how this anime gain score to more than 7? This anime have nothing than yuri girl.First is Story, In the beginning I'm interest with chasing drug trafficking, terrorism and strategy in every mission, I'm enjoy with them. But but but What that the end? Made smoke that brainwash people around the world? that made no sense! I'm no idea what villain motive all episode 1-10 and motive is this? All villain do is not according to that end! How it come? Finally for short, all of this anime is justice heroine with cringy villain, Main...protagonist always good and justice, villain is always bad and no any motive of doing, I'm going to brainwashed people around the world because I'm villain, only that. I don't found other of this, Social Criticism of this story? I'm interesting but story never use of that. Next is mei, sorry but I'm don't understand with traitor plot in this story, in episode 6 said had someone in group is traitor and leaking out personal information and in episode 10 solve is mei was traitor, but  they solve again that mei is made up. So why said about leaking out personal information in episode 6? Conclude traitor has for real? or that only made up? If made up, why epsiode 6 said that? like director want happy end, everyone shake the hand and run in lily field together! we are fighting together! WOW!!! Personally, I think this anime emphasize with this too much by no thinking about story.Art and Sound is good, I'm so enjoy with opening song.Then is character, I'm okay with background story of girls, but I think it's too much with use time 1 episode for 1 yuri couple, that made story vignettes, like all of this anime have only yuri and forgot story, when the end this anime stuffe story of brainwash smoke that use in episode 7 come in by no thinking about it. Relationship of girls, If you are yuri fan, you may love and enjoy. but for me, There is very annoying especially fuu, she is bad girl for me. Only couple that I like in this anime have only Momo and Yuki, I'm enjoy this relationship of them.Enjoyment, I'm enjoy with terrorism and strategy in the first of story, but they forgot main part story and made in the end horrible.Overall, If you are yuri fan, love yuru yuri, you may watch it with no problem, but if you going to watch this series because want something back, I'm recommend to avoid to this series. Personally, If this anime not had cute yuri girl, this series is nothing than cringy anime. protagonist always good and justice, villain is always bad and no any motive of doing, I'm going to brainwashed people around the world because I'm villain, only that. I don't found other of this, Social Criticism of this story? I'm interesting but story never use of that.

If made up, why epsiode 6 said that? like director want happy end, everyone shake the hand and run in lily field together! we are fighting together! WOW!!! Personally, I think this anime emphasize with this too much by no thinking about story.Art and Sound is good, I'm so enjoy with opening song.Then is character, I'm okay with background story of girls, but I think it's too much with use time 1 episode for 1 yuri couple, that made story vignettes, like all of this anime have only yuri and forgot story, when the end this anime stuffe story of brainwash smoke that use in episode 7 come in by no thinking about it. Relationship of girls, If you are yuri fan, you may love and enjoy. but for me, There is very annoying especially fuu, she is bad girl for me. Only couple that I like in this anime have only Momo and Yuki, I'm enjoy this relationship of them.Enjoyment, I'm enjoy with terrorism and strategy in the first of story, but they forgot main part story and made in the end horrible.Overall, If you are yuri fan, love yuru yuri, you may watch it with no problem, but if you going to watch this series because want something back, I'm recommend to avoid to this series. Personally, If this anime not had cute yuri girl, this series is nothing than cringy anime."", ""My first impression of release the spyce was that it was like Princess Principal but not in a European setting. Release the Spyce has its own charm. The story is just average I think. The art was fine too. The character designs are great and it has a decent animation. The soundtrack is absolutely great. The soundtrack and the characters just makes you like it. Haven't seen those types of animes in a while since the trend right now is isekai and most of the isekai animes aren't that good. Like seriously, we need these types of animes more where there's great soundtrack and engaging...characters without getting isekai'd. characters without getting isekai'd."", ""Writing this after watching episode 8.Story wise, it's fairly average. There is a good organization and an evil organization fighting against each other. Good organization doesn't know how to track evil organization so they're trying to get them after the evil organization acts. So far it is okayish. The good organization uses school girls, and the reason seems quite plausible... The main issue I have with the story is that pretty much each episode ends with a short struggle ending quite well instead of leaving us waiting for more. It's like, okay, evil organization has failed today to take over the world, so let's wait...until tomorrow! See ya! While sometimes they have explained how characters get information around the evil organization steps, there isn't something truly convincing about how they move forward with the story. So for now it has been a hit-and-run type story.Now onto art and characters. Character design is the usual moe/cute you see with some school girl anime doing cute things so it is not outstanding on its own. The animation on the other hand is really good. In a day where animation studios relies more and more on CG, it's quite impressive to find an anime featuring cute school girls doing cute-spy things with really well drawn animation sequences during fights. CG usage can be spotted, but it is mainly on mechanical things, while the characters are all well drawn.The characters establish very clearly the sempai-kouhai relationship during the series. They're more on the cute/moe side of the scale but they also do some real fighting, so it is nice to watch cute girls kicking some ass. During the series we can see some character development which is really nice, but there is nothing reeaaaaally outstanding. So simply expect good fights and some sempai-kouhai love.As to the sound, the soundtrack is HOT. I really like it. The OP is catchy and the ED is nice. The selection of BGM is really cool for the setting of the series. Too bad they didn't release the soundtrack while the series is going on.I usually watch series that really catches my attention through the season, and I also watch other series just for fun. Release the Spyce falls into the second category. It is nothing outstanding (aside from the catchy tunes used as BGM), but it is something I enjoy watching. I don't feel like it is a waste of time, I will watch it 'til the end. until tomorrow! See ya!

So does Release the Spyce live up to this title of ""spiritual successor"" to Princess Principal or did it do something entirely different from the spy genre?Well Release the Spyce follows the typical cute girls doing cute things...cept it\'s spy work. Release the Spyce is set in modern day Japan of Sorasaki where Momo Minamoto voiced by Yukari Anzai, a girl who loves her city and wants to protect it stumbles upon a secret...organization named the Tsukikage taking out the corruption in the city, while their bigger goal is taking out the root of the corruption linked to an organization named Moryo. Momo being an amateur at spy work but has an extremely keen sense of smell and taste to the point of finding your MOOD by licking your skin, trains to fully become a member of the Tsukikage.  But once that is done, we move into the character backstory of the Tsukikage members with some exceptions while giving us hints to a bigger and larger plot. So this is clearly cookie cutter stuff but there is a catch obviously. There is a traitor in the ranks of Tsukikage who is leaking info to Moryo...THAT is where the interest and intrigue to this kind of anime especially in the spy genre comes into play and...Release the Spyce worked this in was...mixed to say the least.See the traitor which LA will not spoil only gives out that she\'s a traitor near the tail end of the anime, sure that\'s a given but with all the hints, it was actually PRETTY hard for the audience to trace and find out who the traitor is before the characters themselves do, now LA was thinking along the lines of anyone suspicious of being the traitor most likely of Momo or her mentor Yuki being the traitor, well to say that even that prediction left LA surprised to who the real traitor was...was unexpected even for LA, but well executed, well both good and bad really, as in the bad again, not enough clues or hints otherwise not shown until the traitor was outed and almost ALMOST felt like the anime thought of it on the fly but good in the unexpectedness of the traitor herself and how it was dealt with in the aftermath...LA was and still was mixed to who the traitor was.Now character-wise, we have a sorta yuri mentor and apprentice towards our main cast of Tsukikage. Momo already having a crush on the leader of the Tsukikage and later mentor to her Yuki, where Yuki herself has a dark past concerning Moryo. Goe Ishikawa voiced by Yuri Noguchi and Hatsume Aoba voiced by Aya Uchida have the yuri thing in spades but in a more friendship kind of way, while Goe is the absolute ace when ti comes to power, Hatsume is the brains and intel, while she has another plotline involving one of Moryo\'s minions namely Thesersia voiced by Risa Taneda who was once childhood friends of Hatsume and with Hatsume\'s belief and behavoiur of befriending everyone, this becomes a hurdle for her to get past involving Theresia as she\'s obviously not so forward as Hatsume is and has beef with Hatsume in the past. Finally Fuu Sagami voiced by Akane Fugita and Mei Yachiyo voiced by Aya Suzaki, Fuu being the money-conserving and tsundere type to Momo and the master of disguises, while Mei is the carefree genki character who\'s incredibly athletic. LA\'s favorite character would go to Yuki however even if LA was suspicious of her.On the villains side, well there are four but really three main centralized villains of Moryo, the main villain herself Bunchou no Onna voiced by Shizuka Ito, a hidden figure who\'s behind the entire operations concerning Moryo, her minions, the aforementioned Theresia, Dolte voiced by SAORI HAYAMI no seriously, a musclebound hire woman working for Moryo and Byakko voiced by Aina Suzuki, a bratty halfpint focusing on martial arts. Now LA\'s favourite villain would go to Theresia just out of how much development she gotten in the anime, and while LA would had gotten for Bunchou no Onna, she is your typical laughing ojou villain but her voiced by Shizuka Ito just helped that much for her to still be memorable even if she was slightly cliched.In terms of animation done by Lay-duce, the animation down to the character designs, fight choreography and background work was decent all round, the character designs were polished and crisp as well as distinct from each character, the mood and background work helped with how atmospheric it was though it was mostly night stuff, the anime did go to other places at times and even still then the background work was decent for a nice change of scenery and the fight scenes were mostly swordplay, but with how modernized the setting is, there is the occasional explosions, chases and gun firing used diversifying the battles. Nonetheless Lay-duce did a consistently decent job on the animation department.For voice work, LA was rather pleasantly surprised....from the villain side of things, LA just loved the villains voice actors as they had some of the more interesting voice actors and how they played their role in Release the Spyce, Ohhh the main Tsukikage cast was great too, from Manami Numakura as the stoic Yuki to the tsundere Akane Fuigita as Fuu, but the villains voice actors were quite something, from Saori Hayami voicing out of nowhere Dolte of all roles and LA not even noticing it was her voicing her, Aina Suzuki as Byakko channeling her inner Jashin-chan from Jashin Dropkick and LA\'s favourite voice actors of this anime being both Risa Taneda as Theresia as well as Shizuka Ito as Bunchou no Onna as she was just MEANT for this role as the swarmy femme fatale laughing ojou MAIN villain of the anime. To say the entire voice cast was great for LA was an understatement.Release the Spyce\'s ending was sad but uplifting in a ways especially for Momo but how it was executed was finely done, though LA had a niggling suspicions about the traitor...in a ways, but nonetheless the finale made itself go with a bang quite literally though how Bunchou no Onna was dealt with kinda annoyed LA. Nonetheless the ending was decently handled.So is Release the Spyce a spiritual successor to Princess Principal, well Princess Principal was a double sided plot with it\'s characters and premise right from the get go and never let it go, Release the Spyce was more like fuse ready to be lit to the bigger plot and the build up leading to the climax was where Release the Spyce was at, both animes focused on it\'s characters and developed them, both involving spy work but in differing era\'s and places. With all the shortcomings and cliches Release the Spyce gave us, LA was still satisfied by it either way as it was an interesting look at modern day spies and their daily life of destroying corruption with a great twist of a traitor amongst the main cast. So yes, Release the Spyce though different in many ways to Princess Principal, is still a good spiritual successor to the cute girls doing spy stuff genre and as a standalone spy anime and an original anime at that, it definitely has it\'s strengths that outweighs it\'s cliched weaknessness through it\'s characters and it\'s surprise element, the traitor.Release the Spyce gives off the experience like it\'s namesake, once you eat that spice...you\'ll get an adrenaline rush with a kick of flavor. organization named the Tsukikage taking out the corruption in the city, while their bigger goal is taking out the root of the corruption linked to an organization named Moryo.

Its rating did change quite drastically at times but overall it was a great series.One the music for the series is the most catchiest I\'ve heard it a while and it always gives off the hero/spy vibe which really helped me enjoy the series to the max.The characters are lovable and the whole apprentice/master relationship really makes for some great scenes and really made me like the main two Momo and Yuki.It also helped slip in some yuri like scenes which I always approve of.The story is very basic bad guy vs good guy...but that\'s what makes it so lovable as you can just sit back and enjoy the cliché we\'ve seen all the time but with a new refreshing hero spy twist that you don\'t see often in anime.The series however also has surprising twists that I didn\'t expect as it did give off a hero vibe. These twists I personally I got very emotional over which goes to show how invested I was.Also just got to point out I like the use of wordplay with the title Release the ""Spyce"". Personally I just really like this.Overall Release the Spyce is a great hero series for anyone who likes stuff like Robin and heroes without powers. (If you don\'t count spice as a power) with its catchy as hell OP and overall soundtrack I definitely recommend people to watch this.Loved the series and overall give it a 8/10. but that\'s what makes it so lovable as you can just sit back and enjoy the cliché we\'ve seen all the time but with a new refreshing hero spy twist that you don\'t see often in anime.The series however also has surprising twists that I didn\'t expect as it did give off a hero vibe.

For the first five episodes, everything seemed fine, and we thought RTS was actually a great anime.But then, episode 6 happened.Episode 6 was where everything was turned on its head, as the seemingly lighthearted series turned into sexist fanservice.Episode 6 revealed the backstory of two of the anime girls, Hatsume and Theresia. It is revealed that in their childhood, the anime girls...were kidnapped, abused, and held for ransom by random thugs who aren’t even major villains. Hatsume and Theresia were only children, and they couldn’t fight back against the thugs beating them.The thugs received the ransom from kidnapping Hatsume, and they sold Theresia to the criminal organization. Repeat: they SOLD them. The thugs even got away unpunished, even though they abused young anime girls.We just witnessed torture porn. Even High Guardian Spice never became this bad.We tried to watch episode seven, but they made Hatsume and Theresia’s strained relationship a major plot point. We knew that even if the two anime girls were to make up, that wouldn’t stop the fact that their lives were ruined by sexist karma houdini thugs we only ever see in a flashback, and are likely still running rampant, harming more anime girls.Disappointing, because it could have been a good anime, if the creators didn’t have a sick interest in fanservice and torturing anime girls. were kidnapped, abused, and held for ransom by random thugs who aren’t even major villains.

Peach Girl,https://myanimelist.net/anime/325/Peach_Girl,"['“The portions of a man’s brain that control rational thinking crumbles like sand in the desert when faced with an attractive female.”There’s always one anime out there that you will at some point compare some characters  from other anime to. Be it because they’re the most frustrating you have seen, sweetest, or most delusional.The story has it\'s good and it\'s bad. The situations start of as, “sure it can happen,” to, “seriously, again?” It’s repetition is what kills this one to the point of you wanting to poke it with a stick to make sure it\'s truly dead.After the first few seconds where you...witness a girl getting groped on the street because she more or less looks like she takes cash for it. She is introduced as, Momo.  Our Momo, has a little dilemma, she has tanned skin she hates and orange bleached hair all because she is a swimmer. Our orange haired girl loves a boy, Touji (who according to her ""sources"" hates tans and bleached hair) and has a psychotic best friend with sociopath tendencies who makes her life as complicated as she possibly can. It doesn’t end there though, there’s also Kairi, the popular guy in school who adds him wisdom and pervertness to the show and gives us a few laughs  in between, because he’s the only one that gives any sort of humor in this one. Talk about a tough load to carry.I think the whole plot in this anime revolves around the fact that Momo is tanned and has bleached hair, so take that way and you’ve got nothing at all original. At all.Momo is actually an ok lead girl, she stands up for herself and aside from her questionable taste in guy’s, I think she has potential.  Though watching the back and forth she had going made me wonder if she felt like she was time traveling in her own life to try and  change how things turned out. That’s a better story then she just couldn’t make up her mind.  I think she got the short end of the stick seeing as she isn’t the only swimmer but she’s the only one with bleached hair and tanned skin.Sae has serious self esteem issues.  She is infuriating to watch and at some points I wish someone would beat her. Not to death of course because then they wouldn’t be able to beat her again.  She is the worst friend anyone could ever have. Well maybe not the worst since she never actually killed anyone. Fine, worst shy of murder. “That filthy mouth of yours spills out venom like nobody’s business.” That\'s our Sae.  But thanks to her Momo sees what type of people are actually around her.Touji, oh Touji, it’s too bad you didn’t have a brain in that head of yours, you could have done great things. It’s not his fault though, he’s just a gullible, nice guy who believes anyone but his girlfriend. His role was horrible and anyone would have looked like an ignoramus on it, through it, around it. You get what I mean.Kairi is the glass half full of the show, most of the time. He’s what make the last half more or less watchable. Guy with a questionable past and undefined future. He\'s the comfort and the pain but he\'s the only one that sees through Sae\'s facade. Making him the smartest person in a dumb class.The animation was average to below average. The characters looks stiff and sometimes act that way too, very two dimensional. I found it hard to get into because the dudes look like chicks, but you get used to it and eventually move on. The sceneries aren\'t memorable and I have definitely seen better, just look at Clannad. Oh how I miss thee...The soundtrack is below average, with the same music being repeated throughout various scenes in the episodes. The OP is catchy but even that loses it’s charm.  The ED is much better, maybe because it’s less upbeat and more harmonized. The English voice adaptation makes Touji sound like he\' high sometimes because of his inability to show emotion in his voice. That\'s harsh I know but still. Sae\'s voice if on for more than five minutes at a time will cause your ears to bleed. Hmm, they didn\'t put that in the label. Other voices were fitting and not too bland or out there.Had the show been better I probably would have picked up the manga for it. My mind couldn’t take anymore Momo+Touji+Sae+Kairi idealistic drama.Sometimes I think this one should have been called, “Lets Break Up So We Can Get Back Together?” I’m not exactly sure what kept me watching then. Or what drew me in to re-watch the ending years after. Maybe it\'s because in the end the right guy gets the girl, the guy you liked or wanted to get the girl all along. It’s not because of the (unoriginal) plot or character development, since most of them don’t grow and actually become selfish and immature as time passes. There\'s something that keeps you interested to see WTF will happen next. Either way, my rating from back then and the rating now are much different, after I have watched many more anime.Oh Momo, when will you learn. witness a girl getting groped on the street because she more or less looks like she takes cash for it.

It's enjoyable enough if you like the genre anyway, so I'd suggest it to people who like this sort of thing but I wouldn't say you'd have to rush out to get your hands on it.I kept on being reminded of Bokura Ga Ita as I watched this.  They're similar type stories in a way; especially in the main conflict of the heroine and the two men in her life (and also some plot points, frankly).  I think the overall quality of Bokura Ga...Ita was better than Peach Girl, but I thought that the heroine in Peach Girl, Momo-chan, was a lot more likeable than Nana (she *reallly* annoyed me in the second half of BGI).Story:The first thing that comes to mind is that the pacing of the story is a little odd in my opinion.  Sometimes it feels like all this time passes by in a blink of an eye and sometimes it's just plain slow.  Aside from that, you've got a pretty sweet -- if convoluted -- story about love, indecision, strength and trust.  And what it means to be in a relationship with someone else and how and why we choose the people we do.  Sometimes things get over the top, but that's more of a character issue (see below).Art:The art is generally nice.  The two men in Momo's life, Touji and Kairi, made me think of Yamato Nadeshiko Shichi Henge -- I think because of the heavily-lashed eyes.  It's also slightly reminiscent of YNSH in the frequent use of SD versions of the characters.Sound:Kairi's voiced by Kenichi Suzumura.  I LOVE him.  All the actors of the main four characters do a good job, but...  Suzumura is tops. =)  Saeko Chiba also deserves props for doing a good job of making a character who could have been overly mewling and annoying into a likeable person, despite all the tears.Characters:I thought they did a nice job of making the conflict here.  You can see where Momo comes from and you can see why Touji and Kairi are both so compelling and appealling to her.  I was definitely rooting for one over the other, but that's probably more about my own taste. ;)  The character I probably had the most problem with was Sae -- I mean, we're not supposed to like her anyway, but it might have been nice to have a better idea why she was the way she was... especially since she was SO over the top and extreme as a character.  I didn't like her AT ALL, which made her hard to watch -- if there was something -- anything -- that made me at least sympathize with her, it would have been more interesting, I think.  At the same time, a critical viewer could say that all of the characters are somewhat... shallow and under-developed compared to the very best of the romance/slice-of-life type dramas like Honey &amp; Clover.  They just are... and there's not much explanation why outside of Momo.Overall:I liked it, it was okay.  I think the parts I liked made up for the parts that I thought were a little lacking overall.  I liked Kairi's character and it kept me interested for the most part.  If you're looking for a sweet romance and you've worked your way through the great ones already, this is nice.  If you're looking for something really fantastic and haven't seen much, I'd go through Honey &amp; Clover, Nodame Cantabile, Nana, Ouran High School Host Club, and Lovely Complex first, at the very least. Ita was better than Peach Girl, but I thought that the heroine in Peach Girl, Momo-chan, was a lot more likeable than Nana (she *reallly* annoyed me in the second half of BGI).Story:The first thing that comes to mind is that the pacing of the story is a little odd in my opinion.  Sometimes it feels like all this time passes by in a blink of an eye and sometimes it's just plain slow.  Aside from that, you've got a pretty sweet -- if convoluted -- story about love, indecision, strength and trust.

But this anime is one of those love it or hate it anime. You either REALLY love the drama that goes...on, the characters, and the conflicts. Or you seriously hate how unrealistic, annoying, and overly dramatic it can be.This anime was EXTREMELY hard for me to score because there are times when I thought this anime was very poorly written, unrealistic, and had annoying characters. But other times, it completely turns around and I end up loving the anime! There are MANY elements in this anime that make it both strong, and weak. I predicted I'd hate this anime, but I ended up becoming addicted to Peach Girl. This isn't the most amazing anime I've seen, but it caught me and left me in tears. That's why I give this anime an 8StoryThe Good: There are a lot of love triangles going on in this anime. Momo x Touji, Toji x Sae, Momo x Kairi, Kairi x Misao, etc...When the anime is focusing on Momo and the two guys she's chasing after, Touji and Kairi, this anime is very nicely done. I love how the author was able to illustate Momo and her feelings between these two guys, and how these guys feel for her.The Bad: Ok... there are a LOT of points where the situations in this anime have been dragged out so much that it starts to become unrealistic. There are too many plot twists, and the anime tends to repeat the same story over and over. The author is trying to create these complicated situations that end up making no sense, and it's just over the top. Momo, the main character, keeps going back and forth between boys, to the point where you can't connect with the characters that well. The word &quot;I love you&quot; is VERY overused in this anime, along with kissing.This is probably something that'd make watchers drop the anime after the first 10 or so episodes, but if you keep watching, the anime starts to get better. A little.ArtI just want to say one thing to the animators: Just because it looked good in the manga, does NOT mean it'll look good in the anime. The art style of this anime was kind of hard to look at. Especially their lips, solid shading, etc... I have to admit that the original manga art is a lot nicer to look at. But the anime killed the art. I would have gotten into the anime more if the animation didn't look so choppy. The art in the anime is defiantly one of the weak points, but for me it was bearable.SoundThe music is very recognizable for one thing. It's not bad but what i sort of hated was how the BGM used the same tracks over and over. i mean, they play the EXACT same song everytime the characters go to school, wake up, or take a walk. And then the SAME song always plays when a break up occurs. It gets quite repetitive.The opening and ending theme song are nice. I also heard the english version of the OP and ED and thought it was much better than the japanese one. I don't think you can find it anywhere on the internet sadly...CharacterOk. This is defiantly the author's strongest, and weakest point. There are some characters that I absolutly hate, and some that I absolutly love.For example, Kashiwagi Sae: Momo's enemy. I'm sorry but, the way she thinks is so overly inhumane and b*tchy to the point where she tears apart the whole anime and makes it unrealistic. She tries to lie to Momo's boyfriend so she can have him all to herself, but her lies are not very well thought out and the other characters are too naive. Every time I see her, I feel like I hate the anime even more and more. I mean, there are characters that interfere with the main character but Sae is just... a female version of Makoto from School Days. But worse.On the plus side, there's Okayasu Kairi. He's probably one of the most unique and lovable characters I have ever seen in anime. One of those characters you wish you could meet in real life because his personality is just so carefree, lively, and hilarious. He puts a smile on my face and turns the whole anime around! Kairi is defiantly one of those well built characters that makes you love Peach Girl more and more!There are other characters who seem to be a bit... useless and unnecessary. The ones who are &quot;important&quot;, but the anime could still be told with out them. From Jigoro to Morika, I found no real point of having them in the anime.As for the main character, Momo, i honestly found nothing special about her, but she's not someone to hate. In a way, I don't see what it is about her personality that makes Kairi and Touji go head over heals for her, but the way the author illustrates it makes you able to connect with these characters.Dub vs OriginalIf you ask me, I see no difference. The only thing that was kinda weird was transitioning voices. In the english dub, Momo sounds like a strong and loud character, but in Japanese she sounds really soft and shy. It kind of affect her personality and the way I thought about her. I like Kairi's voice in the English version more than the Japanese version.Ending StatementsI did cry at many points in this anime, but I still thought it was OK. It's one of those anime that are addictive, but not exactly overly amazing. In a way, I feel like the author is sharing part of what happened in their life within this anime. I didn't end up hating this anime, but this should go on my top 30 anime list. Give this anime a try :D on, the characters, and the conflicts.

I didn't end up hating this anime, but this should go on my top 30 anime list. Give this anime a try :D"", 'the only thing that got me starting this show was Funimation channel. it seemed really interesting at first, although the story line is cliche. but i decided to give it a try. already from the first episode, i could tell that Momo was going to be a pain to watch. she was so obsessive with toji from the get go. but it wasn\'t until later on that you could really see her obsessiveness. she threatens to jump out windows, get\'s angry when she sees her boyfriend talking to someone else other than her, and she waits 5 minutes for her boyfriend. any later than that,...she assumes the relationships over. pretty obvious she\'s desperate for a boyfriend....she just get\'s plain annoying. her decisions were plain, and her love life over exaaggerated.everything about this story is unrealistic. i had heard many peopple say ""this show is amazing! i can relate to it so much!"" .......ok? u cannot relate to this story what-so-ever. it makes no sense. many plot twists seemed like they were just made in an attempt to keep the story going. like when Kairi decides to go on a whole trip walking the whole summer. yeah right, like his parents would let him do that in the first place, but basically the creators only made him leave so that they could try to make the drama greater by bringing in toji again. momo\'s feelings are always unclear. and she\'s such a sap and goes with the flow too much. if she cries and someone comforts her once, she immediately thinks ""this person was there when i was feeling down. i love him"".....SHE CANNOT CHOOSE!!!! if i were kairi or toji, i would dump her. i just don\'t see what they find so captivating and attractive about her. she cannot hold a decent relationship even if her life depended on it.basically, the characters could\'ve been so much more. Momo is out of the question. she is no doubt the most annoying person in this whole show. Toji is just some freak stalker who can do nothing but stalk Momo, hoping to be her comfort when kairi makes her cry. that could be depicted as sweet, but later on it just get\'s creepy. he\'ll begin popping out of no where seemingly having no plans that day, and you\'ll wonder what he does with his life. Sae is...annoying, yet smart. she gets annoying because all she wants is to ruin someone else\'s life, but then again, she is clever. she uses her resources wisely in order to get what she wants. and she has backbone. but still... she is pretty annoying. the only thing that kept me going through this show was Kairi. he seemed aloof, loveable, and a sweet sensitive guy. his methods to cheer up momo were cute. but then after a while, he too began getting on my nerves.i\'m not gonna say much about the art. the art was good. it was different than others. but it had it\'s awkward moments. they didn\'t seem to focus too much on the quality of the opening. in many occassions, Toji looked like either a bird or a fish. and the sound wasn\'t good either. at first the theme songs seemed okay and fit the story quite nicely, but then they just got annoying again. like everything else in the story. the ending wasn\'t too good, and the opening seemed okay at first. but as you can guess, you get tired of hearing ""baby low tension"" it just loses it\'s catchiness.so as you can see, this show was a fail of slice of life. the creators tried to make it entertaining and easy to relate to, but it just didnt happen. i found myself groaning in disgust at most of the episodes, and the only reasons i actually finished this show was because1. there was nothing to watch2. something in me still believed that this show could get better3. i didnt want to leave it unfinished.characters were bad, soundtrack bad, storyline bad, and...yeah that\'s basically it. she assumes the relationships over. pretty obvious she\'s desperate for a boyfriend....she just get\'s plain annoying. her decisions were plain, and her love life over exaaggerated.everything about this story is unrealistic. i had heard many peopple say ""this show is amazing! i can relate to it so much!"" .......ok? u cannot relate to this story what-so-ever. it makes no sense. many plot twists seemed like they were just made in an attempt to keep the story going. like when Kairi decides to go on a whole trip walking the whole summer. yeah right, like his parents would let him do that in the first place, but basically the creators only made him leave so that they could try to make the drama greater by bringing in toji again. momo\'s feelings are always unclear. and she\'s such a sap and goes with the flow too much. if she cries and someone comforts her once, she immediately thinks ""this person was there when i was feeling down. i love him"".....SHE CANNOT CHOOSE!!!! if i were kairi or toji, i would dump her. i just don\'t see what they find so captivating and attractive about her. she cannot hold a decent relationship even if her life depended on it.basically, the characters could\'ve been so much more.

She has be shown to have a tanned skin due to her beeing a swim team member in the past. Come on !! They could have shown some competitions of swimming. Her achievements in...the field, and how she couped up in adjusting in society somehow despite her skin colour. But NO. Nothing of that sort. Its just girl likes guy. He likes her back. But there's her so called friend there always to ruin her life (So darn hated her in the show.) They break up somehow. There's another guy who also kinda likes her. Then she starts liking him too.

I never did.All I got was one girl (Momo) is obsessed one guy, loses him, get's stuck on another guy, runs back to the first guy when she gets a chance, then changes her mind and goes back to the second guys.Besides establishing that the characters were cliche' (the over-sacrificing good boy, the loud boy who never does anything right, the mean girl, and...the confused main character bubble head) there was absolutely no character development.If your watching this because you like a-good-love-triangle-that's-really-more-of-a-love-scribble, or b/c you like dramatic relationships, or because you simply want to enjoy a good anime, don't watch this.

Try to watch LC instead of this.One human can really only fall in love one time and one person. "", 'Lol. This isn\'t that good of an anime. It\'s got a pretty poor story and it\'s so dramatic and unreal it\'s almost hard to watch at times. Characters are weird and spazzy, manipulative, needy, and just not written well.

Honestly, for a high school girl, Sai is pretty much the Hitler of this genre and goes as far as to get Momo almost raped just so she can be ""the best girl"" and despite this, they actually come out on friendly terms in the end despite Sai blackmailing Momo\'s boyfriend, getting her...""boyfriend"" to rape Momo, managing to turn the entire school on her, etc. It\'s just so wild it\'s entertaining.Honestly, if you want to sit down and watch something extremely stupid, dramatic and all-over-the place, Peach Girl is the anime to watch.

It\'s pretty much a soap opera. But instead of the mafia or something, you get insane high school girls. It\'s more funny for this than anything.', ""One of the most toxic shows a teenager can watch. I had read the Manga and the spin-off manga in junior high; I remember I enjoyed it at the time. When I started my anime Adventure, now as an adult, I added this to the list. I honestly couldn't remember a thing about it. It's bad.Every character is a horrible person. It wants you to think that there is only one bad person in the main cast, that being Momo. As you watch each character make a decision, it is always the wrong decision. People might chalk this up...to them being teenagers, but this is beyond the normal scope of how high schoolers  behave. People lie, keep unnecessary secrets, constantly talk bad about one another, sexually harass each other, make manipulative plans behind friends backs... it's terrible. Not just as a character study but as far as writing goes, it's all poorly planned out &written.I dropped it on episode 4 when the main character (who you're supposed to be rooting for btw) threatens to kill herself by jumping out of the window, because her boyfriend won't listen to her. While two other characters plot to literally molest someone in the hospital.What a horrible things to do to somebody. The drama is too much these people have been together for less than a week and they're literally willing to die.It's unfortunate because this series could have been a really good look into what it is like to look different, stand out too much, and to not feel pretty. Would have been interesting to see a dark-skinned main character represented for teen girls who lacked confidence.  it could also have been a really good guide for children and teens being bullied and how to get out of it. And if they wanted to represent the relationship is toxic I wish they could have gone the route of showing how to get out of it properly and maturely.Not much to say other than it was a disappointment. Would not recommend to anyone would definitely tell teens and kids to avoid it in just because I worried it would send wrong messages. to them being teenagers, but this is beyond the normal scope of how high schoolers  behave.

If not, I wouldn't suggest this one.Story: 4/10There was nothing special about this show except the fact that the female lead, Momo, is tanned which actually didn’t influence or affect the main story. Additionally, she has a so-called “friend-enemy” or “frenemy” who is exerting so much effort to ruining Momo’s romantic and social life for a petty reason. For a rom-com, drama (which, BTW I really do enjoy), the story was quite shallow and dull. All you’ll see in 25 episodes is Momo repeatedly and indecisively shifting from...one love interest to another in her love-triangle.Art: 6/10The art wasn’t bad nor spectacular. The only art feature that distracted me throughout the series was the lips though. I wasn’t used to the upper lip being evident that it somewhat sidetracked me from the general appearance. Aside from the lips, everything else was acceptable. I enjoyed the flat, 2D art effect they gave Sae when she’s depressed or out of her normal self.Sound: 4/10The sound didn’t enthrall me. After watching the whole anime, not one soundtrack stuck to my head despite it's repetitiveness. But in terms of voice actors, they really complement the characters appearance and emotions.Characters: 3/10I found the characters very annoying, lacking qualities an average person has. During my duration of watching the anime, the characters just kept on triggering my temper and irritability to boil. The protagonists (Momo, Kairi, Toji) appear to lack common sense and are all indecisive. Instead of doing the logical and rational solution, they just exacerbate the issue by doing what they “feel” is right but actually is the opposite, which gets on my nerves. The antagonists (Sae and Kairi’s older brother) on the other hand, are conniving, manipulative, yet very clever and sly. These antagonists make me so pissed at not only them, but also the protagonists for easily giving in to their deceits and lies. In my perspective, Kairi was the only acceptable character due to his cheerful and happy-go-lucky attribute, but eventually shifts in the latter part.  The characters are basically the main reason why I got immensely frustrated with this series.Enjoyment: 5/10Although I was exceedingly frustrated while watching the series, it had this mysterious appeal that made me want to continue watching it, in high hopes the characters would develop better and and the story would improve. In spite of that appeal, it was still dragging, making me fast-forward the useless scenes.Overall: 4/10I gave this a 4/10 because it just wasn't appreciating; however, it did make me laugh in some portions of the scenes. Overall, I was disappointed in this one. If this was a movie and I had to pay for it in the cinema, I’d want my money back and wished I had watched something better.YOU’VE BEEN WARNED!! one love interest to another in her love-triangle.Art: 6/10The art wasn’t bad nor spectacular.

I'm not a big fan. However, when I read about it, I thought it was pretty interesting.Story: 7/10. The story, as you can figure out, is probably very typical and you can probably guess each of the characters' moves. Let's put it this way; if it were chess, the character would be losing. Badly.

Contradictory to most of the reviews here, I think this anime is worth watching.It was hilarious, annoying, sad, touching and extremely emotional. It had many themes that would make you question life, love, friendship and happiness.Yeah, you can say that Momo is a bitch. But she had her reasons. The whole story is like a matter of misunderstandings and awfully bad timings. But it shows what happens in real life. It wouldn't give you false hopes nor ideal situations where everyone can have their happy ever afters. "", 'WARNING: Review will contain spoilersThis is by far the most stressful anime I have ever watched. I honestly considered dropping it due to how stressed out i\'d get while watching it. The only reason i didn\'t drop it was bc of how captivating it was, now this does not mean it was good. There was just so much stupid drama going on i couldn\'t help but want to watch more; i needed to know what happened.I had also thought that this was the anime i\'d heard about when i was younger. Basically, I thought that Momo was going to get into a polyamorous relationship with...both the main guy characters, and i thought it would be really interesting to actually see an anime do that. However, i was gravely mistaken, but hey! the opening showed all 3 of them being all lovey dovey together, so i just figured.Story: The story was pretty cliche, i mean, you have a girl who\'s disliked bc she\'s different in some way, but omg guess what?? It just happens that all her love interests are actually really attracted to that trait. Wow omg never saw that coming. Although, some of the events that transpired were actually pretty dark/taboo compared to other romance animes, such as characters almost getting raped, characters getting beaten, character almost being tricked into shooting a porno, and a character getting pregnant. Generally those aren\'t things you\'ll see very oftenCharaters: Meh the character were kind of a dime a dozen. No one was really all that unique, but you also have to consider when this was made. I\'m sure they seemed a lot more original in 2005.Momo was a decent protag, however she couldn\'t for the life of her just talk out her damn problems, like holy shit. Half of what happened early on could have been easily avoided if she would have just been like ""hey i saw this happen, wtf?"" or ""hey this is a misunderstanding"". Omg and the fact that later in the anime she pulled a total toji when Kairi tried telling her abou this brother. //Rolls eyes so hard. Not to mention she kept going back to help her scum bag of a friend Sae. I mean, i like that she\'s so dependable, but she needed to stop letting Sae in to ruin her life.Sae was clearly the character that everyone was supposed to hate. She was absolutely horrible and would stop at nothing to ruin Momo\'s life. Even when they tried to make her likable in the end it didnt really work. She still spent her time plotting trying to get things to go her way.Toji was basically that ""naive, good guy"" who would believe anything anyone told him, aside from Momo that is. A lot of the early drama came from him always siding with Sae and buying into all her lies. Also he ""practiced kissing"" with Sae so he would be ready to kiss momo???? And then had the audacity to be mad a Momo for kissing Kairi, which was forced on her, before they even started dating UGHGH so dumb. I spent the majority of the anime rooting against him tbh. That is until Kairi fucked up just a horribly as he did..Now, Kairi is your typical pervy character who hits on all the girls, however deep down he truly cared for Momo and wanted the best for her. I honestly thought he was the most redeemable character in this show. He was always there for Momo and refused to buy into Sae\'s lies, and even stepped out of the way multiple times so Momo could be with Toji. He only really fucked up when he ended up having feeling for another person and acted on them while dating Momoim not completely sure how to feel about this anime. While it definitely wasn\'t anything spectacular it still managed to draw me into all 25 of it\'s shitastic episodes.

She keeps wanting the guys she can't have and trying to ruin Momo's life. When Momo sees her boyfriend with her or something she automatically thinks he's cheating on her.I wouldn't suggest this show unless you really enjoy excessive drama and love triangles.

I never have that much time so it took me a bit but this is an overall great anime. The characters can be loved or hated it just depends on where you stand. I stood thinking both guys were great and Momo was an amazing person. She deserved either of them and they both worked hard to get their girl. The ending was something you probably wont see coming and the last few episodes are very suspensful. The show is laughing...funny sometimes and shocked or crying serious at times. You will more than likely hate Sae. Unless you have issuse with the fact that Momo is an angel that gets in the devils way. If you have a heart for soory ones though then you may just change your mind.Story 8: When most of you review writers out there write a review you look at the big outline that forms the anime. Well when I judge a story I look at the little changes it from anything else bits. For those of you who want an outline, this is a story about the basic two guys get a chance with a girl and in the end she has to choose which one she wants. For those of you who enjoy a story that seems unque when you look at the little bits here you go, this is a very unique anime. Its about a misunderstood girl who manages to meet a horrible friend who is extremely jealous of here but our girl the one most root for cant see it. I mean our girl is so insequre and yet so amazing all at once but she cant see how special or beautiful she is. She then gets to guys who are madly in love with her by the end and take note these are some pretty great guys. We get to the end she chooses you love it or hate it and there you have it. Oh and did I mention theres also a sleazy brother, an epic nurse, a school who will fall down on its hands and knees for a pretty face, a supermodel who gos for the wrong girl and a group of highschool girls who will follow whoever is the best? Yeah youre gonna find a story you cant even believe. And by the end of it there will be a character made story so interwoven you wont even see how some of them are connected.Art 7: I liked the art it was good. Not to complex and brain hurting but very good and led to good entertainment.Sound 8: The sound and music type stuff was good. I loved the oppening and ending songs. Whenever I remember hearing them after an episode of the show I can smell the beach and the melody is soft for the ending so you always end feeling relaxed. Its good that the ending theme is so quiet because sometimes the shock of an episode is so great you need something to help you cool down.Character: I loved the characters they were great and very important to the story even the lower non-main rolls. The noodle shop guy was probably my favorite minor roll. He made me laugh. Its very easy to create a bias against the characters in this anime. I have always found this to be a very good thing in an anime because its easier to be happy, excited, angry, upset, or even a little shocked when you take up the side of a character in an anime. A very wise person once told me that if it doesnt make you laugh, or cry, or get angry, or feel any emotion at all then it isnt worth your time and you could be doing something better with your time.Enjoyment 9: I thought this anime was very enjoyable and it brought up some great points in life. It showed the amazing things anime shows and it is a true representation of what and why anime is so important to things like life and love and courage.Overall 9: This anime is definitely worth your time and attention. Its amazing and a truly great thing. funny sometimes and shocked or crying serious at times. You will more than likely hate Sae.

Momo in my opinion was the cause for the commotion towards the end, this is because she was way too indecisive about her feelings. She was hurt by Touji and so decided to give Kairi a chance. It was all cute and sweet when ti started, but things changed after Momo found...out about Misao, and from then on i thought she was rather pushy and selfish in the fact that she likes to judge before knowing!Momo becamse extremely selfish and unbearable for me to keep watching, just because Kairi was abit late for the meeting she decided not to wait anymore and left because she thought he was putting Misao first before her without knowing the story! And slept with Touji her old flame, and the relationship sparks once again between the two. This was pure annoying because she was too self-centered.The one scene in which I'd thought was a good and meaningful was when, Touji and Momo decided to go on a trip together in which Momo supposedly came late, and thought that Touji has left her, in which he didn't, and for that instance a message came to my mind, and that was Touji was patient! and he waited for her, and he listened to her reason, he said that''there was still half a day left'' this to me was like a BIG MORAL in the whole anime. What Momo failed to do was, think straight waited and listened, she refused to wait any longer thinking he was wrong for her!I really thought Sae was much better for Kairi at the end because Momo character changed!But that is just my opinion = ) out about Misao, and from then on i thought she was rather pushy and selfish in the fact that she likes to judge before knowing!Momo becamse extremely selfish and unbearable for me to keep watching, just because Kairi was abit late for the meeting she decided not to wait anymore and left because she thought he was putting Misao first before her without knowing the story!

Momo's best friend Sae is a conniving and manipulative girl who will do anything to make herself feel better than others-- including hurting Momo, lying about her and manipulating everyone into believing her. In an attempt to keep Sae from ruining things with her crush, Momo lies and tells her...she likes someone else. Momo is then caught in a love triangle when both her real crush and the boy she lied about liking actually like her back.The story was enjoyable enough despite sometimes being super over-the-top. I liked the pace of the story because I honestly never felt bored with what was happening. In Peach Girl, there is a continuous struggle and just when you think everything is solved something else will happen. Momo is a likeable protaganist. She does everything she can to put others before herself and is willing to help people even when they have hurt her very badly in the past (Sae). All of the characters had a lot more depth than most characters in this type of anime normally do. I liked the fact that all of the characters' personalities/actions were explained and you understood why they would react that way.

I liked it enough to write a review of it at 3am!"", ""When I began watching this anime, I checked it out because it seemed girly and fun. I have a thing for love triangles and this one seemed perfect. BUT I have to say it let me down terribly. So every one should take this as a WARNING review. I will include all the pros and cons of this show. Kindly keep in mind that I am writing this as a newbie to anime.The show starts out funny and without making much sense. I expected typical slapstick humour and a bit of romance. The first episode was hilarious but from then it went from being a...bag of mixed emotions to utterly painful to watch. This is my first in experiencing difficulty in watching an anime. It was like a bad Asian drama with crappy writing.I have never seen a girl as indecisive as Momo. Just when I expect that she will redeem herself, she does something which made me struggle to like her. I think the last 4-5 episodes did permanent damage to her character. The writing and her actions were way out of line. No matter how much I enjoy the 'being with two people at once' concept, Momo was the height of indecisiveness. She wasn't that great to begin with and these actions made her even less likable. She kept going back and forth between both guys which was plain tiring to watch. I actually have to say I disliked her immensely. I also have the complaint that she cried too much.Touji wasn't great till some episodes, but there was a time when I started liking him. Then he disappeared from the radar and when he came back, I didn't care about him anymore. There was nothing about his character that interested me. He and Momo got on my nerves pretty badly when they enjoyed being lovey dovey or making out.The only character I cared about was Kairi. If he hadn't been there, I would have dropped this show by the 2nd or 3rd episode. I really found him funny and loved his many sides. Then again the writer tries to throw in stuff and make him into an indecisive jerk. I was okay with that too. Then came some more dumb situations and all that was left was a poor version of Kairi who had become the victim of bad writing. His character had so much potential but the writer ruined it all by the end by making him mopey and annoying.Then there was Sae who I absolutely despised. She was a tad too good at manipulating people. She provided for most of the drama and was a catalyst for most of the plot. I couldn't believe it but she turned out to be very entertaining in the last half. She remained herself and toned down her evil side a little. I liked what she did to get the couple I wanted in the end together. Her actions aren't forgivable, but since she went through hell herself I thought it was alright.The only reason to hang on for the show is its ending. It was how I wanted and Momo finally picked the right guy. I still wasn't happy that she was making out with the other guy till minutes before she decides to choose him. I, as a viewer was still in doubt whether she still stuck to him forever or not. Momo wasn't very reliable.Anyway- the anime has great humour which also gets lackluster by the end. It is a roller coaster in a bad way, because say that you enjoy riding it but it always makes you feeling ill. The experience of watching this anime was similar. I enjoyed it but I am not too happy with it. I am just glad that it is over. I think I need a break from romantic anime. bag of mixed emotions to utterly painful to watch. This is my first in experiencing difficulty in watching an anime. It was like a bad Asian drama with crappy writing.I have never seen a girl as indecisive as Momo. Just when I expect that she will redeem herself, she does something which made me struggle to like her. I think the last 4-5 episodes did permanent damage to her character. The writing and her actions were way out of line. No matter how much I enjoy the 'being with two people at once' concept, Momo was the height of indecisiveness. She wasn't that great to begin with and these actions made her even less likable. She kept going back and forth between both guys which was plain tiring to watch. I actually have to say I disliked her immensely. I also have the complaint that she cried too much.Touji wasn't great till some episodes, but there was a time when I started liking him. Then he disappeared from the radar and when he came back, I didn't care about him anymore. There was nothing about his character that interested me. He and Momo got on my nerves pretty badly when they enjoyed being lovey dovey or making out.The only character I cared about was Kairi. If he hadn't been there, I would have dropped this show by the 2nd or 3rd episode. I really found him funny and loved his many sides. Then again the writer tries to throw in stuff and make him into an indecisive jerk. I was okay with that too. Then came some more dumb situations and all that was left was a poor version of Kairi who had become the victim of bad writing. His character had so much potential but the writer ruined it all by the end by making him mopey and annoying.Then there was Sae who I absolutely despised. She was a tad too good at manipulating people. She provided for most of the drama and was a catalyst for most of the plot. I couldn't believe it but she turned out to be very entertaining in the last half. She remained herself and toned down her evil side a little. I liked what she did to get the couple I wanted in the end together. Her actions aren't forgivable, but since she went through hell herself I thought it was alright.The only reason to hang on for the show is its ending. It was how I wanted and Momo finally picked the right guy. I still wasn't happy that she was making out with the other guy till minutes before she decides to choose him. I, as a viewer was still in doubt whether she still stuck to him forever or not. Momo wasn't very reliable.Anyway- the anime has great humour which also gets lackluster by the end. It is a roller coaster in a bad way, because say that you enjoy riding it but it always makes you feeling ill. The experience of watching this anime was similar.

A girl in love with a guy, and a ""friend"" who does everything in her power to make the main characters life miserable, and along with this another boy who is also in love with the main character makes the story all the more complicated. I hated the story! She had a ""friend"" as I mentioned literally make...the class mentally and physically abuse her, and yet the main character can still forgive her ""friend"" over and over even though her ""friend"" pulls the same kind of crap every time.

In other words the sound didn\'t leave even the slightest impression.CHARACTER:I hated every single character!! The main character was dense, and did everything she shouldn\'t have done. (Near the ending wasn\'t as bad, but it was still hair pulling) The ""Friend"" who kept on making the main characters like a LIVING HELL! I have no idea who the made her out the way they did, but I really wish the made her more lovable, because I feel bad about myself  for having sympathy for an incident involving the ""friend"", but any how i\'ll leave characters at that, because the two main male characters were no where near as bad.ENJOYMENT/OVERALL:Well I wish I hadn\'t started the anime to be honest...I liked the ending so I guess it wasn\'t as bad, but I highly recommend you stay away unless you LOVE drama, because this anime has a ocean of it, and it is extremely annoying to me, and I have watched plenty of drama anime, but this one was the worst anime not to mention drama anime I have ever watched. the class mentally and physically abuse her, and yet the main character can still forgive her ""friend"" over and over even though her ""friend"" pulls the same kind of crap every time.

Years later, I found out there was an anime adaptation, but I postponed watching it because I wanted to reread the manga and experience it alongside the anime.That was a MISTAKE. Comparing both of them at the same(ish) time only made the anime’s flaws WORSE.The original manga has its problems (which I’ll discuss when I write my manga review), but the anime’s far surpasses those!Almost nothing about the anime is worth:– not the animation;Which is ugly, broken, lazy, not at all...like Miwa Ueda’s cute art style. Many animations from the early/mid 2000’s were kind of like that, but this just looks waaaay worse than what you’d usually see. The result of this animation looks like a bunch of college kids who just learned how to animate took a dive into their very first official job.I don’t know any other anime made by Studio Comet – I think I’ve never watched anything by this studio – but I sure hope that they have improved. Otherwise, I won’t be watching any more of their stuff.– not the music;Boring and forgettable, neither the opening nor the ending were entertaining enough. I just skipped to the episode all the time.– not the adaptation changes;Yes, there ARE adaptation changes. Tons of it!!! They try to tame the story a lot, but how do you tame a story that was originally intended to be a bit risqué? Sex is a big part of this story (there are no sex scenes per say, but it's still important for the development of some characters/some relationships/the story itself), if you try to censor that because there might be kids watching, it will feel like a botched up version of the original work.I felt that those changes were pointless and all they did was make me dislike this anime adaptation more and more.Now, I may be sounding way too harsh so I will say two of the things that I actually liked about it:– The VAs;Everyone did a great job to portray these characters. Even though I read the manga in portuguese (and later in english), I could definitely match the anime’s voice actors with the voices I had given them myself. Sae sounded very sae-ish, Kairi was super kairi-ish, Momo sounded very fine and Toji was… well, Toji. I’m not a big fan of Toji lol– The fact that this is a COMPLETE adaptation:This caught me completely off guard, seeing as most anime adapted from a source (be it manga, light novel, visual novel, etc) have no “proper” ending or they make their own ending. In Peach Girl’s case, while the adaptation was poorly made, it was indeed a complete adaptation. With many changes, but the ending (and most of the important parts) were still the same!!Even so, I still think watching this anime was a huge waste of time. If you want to experience Peach Girl, I strongly recommend for you to only read the manga. like Miwa Ueda’s cute art style.

They are minor, but still uncover some of the plot twists.""Peach Girl"" is a typical shoujo. Sweet boys and girls, sweet artstyle, feelings-feelings-feelings, everything is abnormally simple, after all. However, surprisingly, ""Peach Girl"" managed to distinguish itself in a bad way even here.1) an AWFUL LY primitive storyline. I was fed up with the twists like “somebody sees X with another person and misunderstands”. It delivers at the very beginning, but starts to annoy soon, as the situations never vary. The last five episodes were a lucky exception, but still I couldn’t but think the show was...TOO long and thus boring. Fifteen episodes would be perfectly enough to cover ALL the plotlines, I guarantee it. – 4/102) the only characters I approved of were Touji and Sae. Touji was the “most male” character here, but in my opinion he was too patient towards Adachi. He definitely deserves a better girlfriend than she is. Sae caught my attention due to the path she managed to walk. Unlike other characters, she was able to learn and grow in a spiritual way though it took some time and efforts. Moreover, later she was able to change others, f.e. Ryo and Kairi. Besides, Sae was a great fun when she misbehaved.Adachi hasn’t impressed me as she cannot be called a strong personality though she looks strong from the very beginning. Risa from “Lovely Complex” is a lot stronger. Most of the time Adachi is crying or hesitating whom she likes most or arguing with her current boyfriend which is very pathetic. Plus, she depends on the opinion of other people greatly and tends to do what she is said to do without thinking herself. Well, she may seem to think but later acts spontaneously which turns out to be extremely stupid and childish. Moreover, she NEVER learns and keeps repeating the same mistakes again and again. I really doubt she managed to make her final decision as she still hesitated in the last episode. Basing on the number of times she changed her mind I may assume she does it again. With her indecisiveness she is always making the people loving her suffer which I really disapprove of.Kairi was okay at first but later changed to worse as soon as he fell in love with Adachi. He proved himself to be weak-willed as he gave up easily in his love affair towards Adachi. Moreover, he was crying and hesitating most of the time, as well as Adachi did. His manlike actions were rare and didn\'t impress in comparison with Touji\'s actions. I guess Kairi and Adachi are birds of the same feather, so the ending is quite fair. But I really doubt why Kairi was rewarded while Touji wasn’t, for Touji sacrificed as much as Kairi did?Besides, the character scheme included numerous love triangles and harems, but I doubt they are worth speaking of. The only thing I may say is that there was too many of them. In addition, most of the characters were whiny. – 6/103) the artstyle reminded me of “Lovely Complex”, however, here it was worse. Sweet colors and sweet pop-style characters, nuff said. The faces had abnormally plump lips (even the boys’ ones) which was supposed to look hot, however, as for me it wasn’t. The worst example of this cheesy Barbie-style was the ending. What’s more, some scenes, especially the most romantic ones, were simply moving pictures.  – 6/104) the sound didn’t impress me either. The seyuus’ work was ok, but the music was average J-rock. Nothing impressed me here. – 7/105) enjoyment and overall – according to my impression, it is a 6. I cannot say I disliked it completely, but still it wasn\'t as interesting and fresh as I expected.

In highschool.I'm the type of person who prefers their romantic story to be more linear, where I'm aware of the conclusion (roughly ofc), so I'm watching for the journey that leads to it. That being said, as much as I hate to admit it, this series intrigued me so much I ended up binge watching it. Is it worth it? Well, up until the last episode, I was ready to say yes and rate this one a strong-ish 9.This story revolves around a love triangle, more or less constant back-and-forths of feelings between...2 guys. While I'm not a fan of this, the story was reasonable, it was consistent, it showed me so many different emotions and relationships, from the superficial ones to the most in-depth ones. The early parts felt miserable, but all in all it was fun. But I feel like it was dragged on for too long, the back-and-forths were twisted too much until literally everyone felt as annihilated as possible. Like when a visual novel adaptation chooses the worst possible route in the game. I know these people are just a bunch of codes and pixels and such a story certainly satisfies the needs of those viewers who love their drama as big as humanly possible, but the writer should have some consideration to their feelings. The excitement gets killed when you just try hard to max out the number of the twists you can possibly add. It was saved by the last few episodes, a certain kind of scenario and situation everyone was waiting for had finally come, the epilogue phase has begun, the viewer is finally pleased, the story is concluded! ....... or so you thought, but no, they had to add one final twist! Considering the very ending planned to all this, it makes sense, I liked the idea, normally I'd call it romantic and smile about it in tears, but this ending is not suitable for such an overly dragged and twisted story. I just lost all the interest and immersion I had.If you decided to read my review and made it this far, I have to say, that despite my utter dissatisfaction, I can recommend you to watch this anime once.

But in the end, I was super happy that she fell in love with Kairi, even though she had been in love Toji serveral times. Also, when Momo and Kairi were younger, she...saved his life when he almost drowned himself, and on the last episode she saved him from drowning in the ocean while he was looking for his phone case which Momo made for him earlier in the anime.Kairi: I have always loved his personality, and he\'s always been there for Momo, and overall he\'s a really nice guy. But, when he and Momo start dating, his insecurities about the relationship are revealed to stem from his unrequited love for Misao, the school nurse and Kairi\'s former tutor. But, in the end he found out that Momo was one for him.

It\'s kinda like when you eat a bag of chips you eat all the time, and halfway through the middle,...you get tired of the same taste but still eat it cause it tastes good.The music was typical anime music, with nothing standing out. The opening and ending themes were nothing I would go out and downloaded, and I skipped them everytime.The animation was average. Nothing new and kind of boring. Except for how pretty everyone was. Especially Kari, who looked like a girl randomly during the show, but was still amazingly cute. Why do they always make one manly man and one pretty boy? Even though Touji was basically a pretty boy as well, they made him a baseball player and a more manly voice than Kairi to show that he was the ""manly"" one. LOL.The characterization was also bland but still enjoyable. Sae was a freaking psycho and I don\'t understand how someone could be that well-liked and still that crazy. They made her over-the-top, and she wasn\'t really understandable or relate able.Kairi was the saving grace of this show. He provided comedy and was the life of the party. Whenever he wasn\'t in an episode, I felt like something was missing. He might as well of been the main character for all the time I invested in his story and his character.[SPOILERS]The fact that she chose Kairi was the saving grace of this show for me. If she didn\'t chose him, and chose to go with Touji, who had been MIA most of the show or just a character to help the other mains to inspire conflict, I would\'ve been seriously pissed. I watched this a second time with my sister, and I think it\'s safe to say that most girls would want Kairi.All in all, an enjoyable anime and one I would recommend if you have nothing better to do. you get tired of the same taste but still eat it cause it tastes good.The music was typical anime music, with nothing standing out.

This is the kind of shoujo that I absolutely don't like. "", 'I would start by saying that Peach Girl explicitly conveys racial discrimination, but that would be inaccurate since they\'re all Japanese. Contrary to your belief that this review is going to be me solely trashing the component of Peach Girl which encourages light skin as more beautiful and aesthetically appealing to men, and how the leading heroine, Momo, is accepting of this prejudiced assumption shown throughout her emotional qualms of having darker skin— that will be my last mention of it. Despite the inherent negative message this sends to viewers, I review based on the romantic aspect, so let\'s stick to that.Peach Girl was...actually a fair anime, with a decent romance which develops nicely throughout the series. Momo, our tsundere lead is a charming character, and is easily relatable with the female audience given the realistic conflicts she faces daily—boy troubles. The initial idea is a bit cliche and overdone, but the good thing about Momo is that she has flaws, and her love isn\'t entirely preposterous. She is flawed, and has confidence issues, and the love interest she pursues, Kazuya, does not reciprocate her feelings. This eliminates the horrible pot-hole that far too many romance animes which have the potential to be successful fall into, a pseudo ""Mary-Sue"" character. Essentially a lead which may have flaws to the audience, but makes them irresistible to all other love interests, creating boring and predictable development. Momo\'s pursuit of Kazuya is not overly dramatic, but resembles what a real girl would face while going after the one they like.The familiar love-triangle, we all know it well. It is sort of a double-edged sword in most romance anime because as the audience, we develop attachments to one of the two possible suitors. Of course one must lose, and that can generate negative feelings towards the show, but at the same time it adds spice and thrill if executed well. Peach Girl is an example of a good execution. I will neglect any spoilers, but Momo\'s eventual romantic interest is not a complete loss for either side, and the events which transition to her decision are easily followed, and logical. People can empathize with her, so it leads to a greater sense of satisfaction when finishing the show.The characters were very well balanced. Momo is sort of that rough around the edges girl, who can be cute and charming. Her love interests: Kazuya and Okayasu, are not complete opposites in personality. This actually works to the show\'s benefit, because it doesn\'t feel as damaging when Momo chooses one over the other. Momo\'s ""best friend"", or more appropriately, her biggest foil, Sae, gives the audience several reasons to hate her wholeheartedly. At times her cruel actions are a bit overdone and add a bit too much acidity to the relationship, but Sae has moments which make the audience feel a bit relieved, and she certainly has a passionate side.Overall, Peach Girl was a good watch. Nothing which absolutely stood out from others, but the plot was fairly consistent, and the characters were generally likable. There were probably more dramatic and shocking moments than heart-fluttering romance, but if you\'re interested in a simple series which provides the bare minimum in romantic aspects, I suggest you give this a look. actually a fair anime, with a decent romance which develops nicely throughout the series.

I will say it had the potential to be one of my favorites. What killed it for me was basically the creators views on dark skinned people and the main character Momo. As I watched, I had so many questions and wondered what audience this anime was targeting.Why was the fact that she was tanned bad? Why is it because she was tanned or darker skinned she was considered a slut? Why was her skin color and obsessive use of sunscreen to keep from becoming darker even apart of the storyline. Why was Kairi wearing a confederate flag shirt....These are questions I asked myself as I watched this anime. It made me extremely uncomfortable. And made it hard to look past to enjoy this show.Outside of being offended at the clearly racist storyline. What I didnt like was the character Momo and how she changed men throughout the story. How she was so quick to judge and get upset with her love interest without hearing their side. How she allowed that demon bestfriend back in her life knowing what she was capable.  Thats just stupid. I dont care how nice she seemed to be or if she seemed to have turned over a new leaf. Once youve seen what someone is capable of you need to distance yourself from them. I have so much I want to say but I will wait until I have finished the show. These are questions I asked myself as I watched this anime. It made me extremely uncomfortable.

"", ""Overall: 7/10Let me just start out by saying, this drama will not be for everyone. It is VERY dramatic, so you will probably hate it or love it. I side more on the loving it, but maybe a big part has to do with the nostalgia of reading it in my middle school days and liking Okayasu Kairi. I think it starts getting good in the middle and finishes off well (I mean, the ending itself, at least). It can become unrealistic, but the enjoyment was still there.Story: 5/10There's nothing special about the story. It's about a tan girl with hair dyed by cholorine due...to her swim team days and gets judged wrongly due to her appearance. It just basically follows her as she goes through love and friendships. Again, there's LOTS of drama. But you get rewarded in the end with who she ends up with (which I believe the author got it right).Art: 5/10While there are some scenes that look pretty, the art is kinda hard to look at. The art didn't bother me when I read the manga, but it just doesn't look as good in the anime form. It's kinda choppy, but I got used to it after a while. That was just the characters though, the scenery was fine.Sound: 6/10I don't remember much about background music. I remember some scenes hit it right. And at first, I didn't like the beginning and closing songs, but they grew on me.Character: 7/10Some characters you will just hate, others you will love. I see Momo as just a normal girl. There's nothing striking about her personality, but maybe the author wanted to write about someone who was normal. Toji's the ever nice guy who's perfect but naive. Kairi's the pervy yet straightforward, honest, considerate, nice guy who always has Momo's back (who's won my heart!!!). And obviously from the get-go, Sae is one to be hated. She does improve by the end, and even helps the couple get together (and gets her own manga sequel). These characters to tend to become unrealistic (especially Sae), but what do you expect from an anime or a drama? Without them, it wouldn't be as interesting to watch.Enjoyment: 7/10Again, like I said, I probably enjoyed this more for the nostalgia. It reawakened my love for Kairi and what a great character he is (even with his slip up). If I had watched this without knowing what happened in the story, I would probably have dropped it (due to liking more light hearted romances). There were moments I couldn't bear to watch because Sae was just too evil, there were moments when I wanted to slap Momo or Toji, there were moments when I was so happy to have Kairi in the picture.

Originally I had started reading the manga series, and after I decided to give the anime a go.The story is one of those plots you're either going to be intrigued by or deterred from in my opinion. It all depends on if you can handle frequent downfalls in the story. Because in here, the main antagonist will be constantly wreaking havoc on the main character. Just when you think things are starting to calm down, there she is again making her mark! Lot of action, some suspense and quite a bit of sympathy...for the main character as she is hit with constant waves of hurt, frustration, heartache and betrayal.I thought the art was pretty good. I haven't really watched all that many anime that I thought the art was lacking though.The music was not my cup of tea. In fact, I found myself muting the intro and ending themes because the singer's voice was like chalk on a chalkboard to me. Too scratchy and even after the sound has stopped it still lingers in your mind. But minus the actual beginning songs (which are sung) the rest of the soundtrack (or rather, score) wasn't bad. It fit the emotional themes in the anime and in the end that's what makes all the difference.The characters were decent in my opinion. Minus the main antagonist until the very end of the series. You can't help but hate her and how nasty she is throughout the anime. Toji left me feeling rather irritated in the fact that he is oblivious to the antagonist's schemes. However, I couldn't help but like Kairi. As much as I wanted to dislike him, I ended up liking him even more the more I tried to dislike him. The main character Momo was tolerable. She has her sweet moments, but her short outbursts of anger got to be annoying and rather dislikeable.Once I got past the constant ups and downs of the series, I think it was a good anime. However, since there is so much turmoil I can't say whether I would watch it again. Overall, I think it's an ok anime to watch, but be prepared for a rollercoaster of a ride. for the main character as she is hit with constant waves of hurt, frustration, heartache and betrayal.I thought the art was pretty good.

It is a cliche romance love triangle. But it gets at least a 5 because of Sai. It is about a tanned girl named Momo who is constantly sabotaged by her ""friend"" Sai and is in love with two guys, Kairi and Toji. There are some surprising twists in the story but unless you really have no good anime to watch I would pass.ART: This is probably the worst part of the anime. Somehow the art is too real, it\'s bad. The art is kinda stiff in movement and I wish it had more of a somehow ""un-realistic"" look....But since you can\'t base an anime on its art, I let it go.SOUND: Sound is one of the better parts. The english dub of the title song gets on your nerves a little but the voices were good. Sai\'s voice was honestly the best.CHARACTER: Honestly, the characters were all pretty shallow. They made mistakes that irritated the heck out of you. They didn\'t seem to gain any lessons from their relationships. Momo(the main character) was overly dramatic and she seemed clingy in her relationships with both guys. Toji was just a boring stick in the mud who didn\'t believe Momo at all for half of the show. Kairi was a little better than Toji and he provided alot of the comedy for the show. Sai was the best though. She was pure evil and probably the smartest character in the show. She was hilarious in her schemes and the whole character was genius. I ended up watching the show because of her.ENJOYMENT: The enjoyment level is a little below average. I enjoyed all of the scene that took place with Sai. To be honest, most of the comedy came from what the show was lacking. It lacked a lot of things, most importantly, a plot that actually matters and has a real conflict. It was something I would finish in 2 days just to kill time. The romance does get a little interesting but other then that it was a pretty mediocre anime.OVERALL: Watch it if you want to see a genius villain and don\'t mind a bad plot.

Momo and Sae were interesting characters who had motivations, ups and downs etc.  But the two main male characters were a little dense at times though.  It was a fun show as they keep you in suspense up until the last show as to who would end up with whom.  Nothing too serious other than high school dating, but it's a nice way to pass the time. story, thinking of what the characters should do, and when they didn't, thinking: you dummy.

If I can be honest, this is a generic shoujo that can be fit in a teenage soap opera: Has romance with melodrama. The center of the story is with which one Momo will bMomo is the tipical protagonist of many shojo mangas: Sweet that easy forgives. Makes friends easy and have the rival of love. So... rival. Sae is the character that is there...only insprire hate. She is envous at Momo aparently because the seems happy and she not. She is the one that makes the story make a progress; then Momo makes decisions about what did Sae make before.Its easy to hate Sae but only that. As a espector you can't feel other way. It took 5 minutes or less to know about Sae's feelings toward Momo. There is no character development with this character. Talking about this point, character development is very low. The only thing Momo canlearn from Sae is to fell a bit shame about her situation. Maybe she has some family problems.Other characters are also difficult to treat. Tooji, our main and first boyfriend of Momo is a bit dumb. He prefers to bilieve first to Sae than Momo. And Tooji knows Momo before Sae. He has no reasons to believe in Sae knowing the knows Momo more time than Sae.Tooji is the handsome and good boy character. Kairi our second boyfriend of Momo is the oposite. (much like Anthony and Terry in Candy Candy). And as I said before, Momo is pur inocent, naïve and a bit dumb main protagonist. Sae is the oposite (continue with the example, much like Candy and Eliza).Its difficult to watch this anime if you are into anime for a while. Modern shoujo animes, more of them, can watch independent woman that romance is in second term (until they fall in love). Momo is only motivated to find a boyfriend, no matter who is it. You don’t love me? After suffer couple of days, I found a new boyfriend and I happy ever after living my new romance. No matter how many times, my rival and enemy makes me cry, I am the protagonist and I will always win. That resumes Peach girl.It can be fun if you are really hardcore fan of shoujo animes and like to make shippings.

Wow, what an emotional roller coaster!I\'m not going to write a novel on this anime but I do want to express my overall feelings towards it and why it is now one of my favs.What is the number one thing that everyone is searching for? Happiness maybe? Don\'t we all want to find happiness? One thing that this anime taught me is that in order to find true happiness, you must first be honest with your own emotions. You must question yourself first. Ask yourself about the...situations in your life? Why do you feel empty? Why are you alone? Why doesn\'t anyone like you? Why are you so popular? Why are you not so popular?.....When you find the answers, you will better understand where you stand in this world. You will also understand that there are people in your life that genuinely do care about you. If you don\'t have that yet, some day you will if you desire it.No matter how manly you are, or how popular you are, this series grabs you. A lot of people look at the animation and instantly drop it. I watched the dubbed, which was actually a lot better than the subbed version. This series will make you laugh, anger you, frustrate you, make you applaud certain characters, and you might even shed a tear. The opening theme maybe upbeat, but the lyrics make more and more sense as the series goes along. EVERYTHING ties together at the end. I\'m not going to spoil anything!This series taught me that no matter how scary the results may be, JUST BE HONEST. Tell the truth. It WILL change your entire life. Sometimes we are afraid of hurting other people\'s feelings. Sometimes we are afraid of hurting our own feelings. No matter the situation, just know that things will eventually work out for you. The last puzzle piece to your happiness WILL be found.Thanks for taking time out to read this! situations in your life? Why do you feel empty? Why are you alone? Why doesn\'t anyone like you?

The storyline for me was kind of relating back to real life as you see people do this but even though am a boy i did find it touching but then again romance animes with drama in it always get me really interested! :) "", 'PEACH GIRL REVIEW - UEDA MIWAOVERALL: 10/10PLOT: 10/10When I was in my school days, I remember watching this one multiple times. I\'ve even bought a DVD to repeat it. Now, I\'ve scanned an anime site and come across it again and I miss it, bigtime. Whenever somebody asked for an anime love story suggestions, there\'s no way I\'ll forget to comment ""Bokura Ga Ita"", ""Wolf Girl and Black Prince"", ""Hanasakeru Seishounen"", ""Tora Dora"" and other lot that we can say is famous on that genre. I\'ve totally forgot this one. This anime is not your common type of story which only shows the surface of...a relationship. It does not show a simple fight between two guy for a girl. The creator of this story successfully hook his viewer on thinking who will she end up with. This series is like an infinite loop of emotions and decisions that will tear their heart. It show how much you can do when you\'re inlove, how stupid can you be to hold on in something unbearable, how painful it is to regret your decisions, how greedy someone can be when it comes to their important one, how vulnerable, how weak. Lastly, how they can change for the better and how they mature because of that. Watching this again makes my heart go crazy. Both of the guy deserves the protagonist. They both love her sincerely. They both sacrifice, accept her flaws, protect her. No matter who she chose, it\'s a win win. It\'ll make you think, who will you choose if you we\'re there? Who\'s the best if they both are? Who will make her happy if they both can? This series will really make you jump from one guy to another. It is old but yeah, it\'s gold.CHARACTER: 10/10Did you have that person who did the worst thing ever in you but still, you care for them? That no matter how dark their core is, you just can\'t turn your back on them. You just can\'t get angry with them. The characters on this series are really something. It make me curse them, but still love them. You\'ll get very annoyed the way they think, their flaws, their incompetence, but hey? Isn\'t that what makes them human? It\'s really amazing that even though this anime mostly focuses of the love side, it also touch thr characters personalities and turn it into a much better one. I guess that\'s what love is. The creator really show the character development on this anime. He easily manipulate the viewer on the emotions his characters have. He twist it right and make them feel the way the characters feel.SOUND AND ANIMATION: 10/10I\'ve memorized the opening and ending songs! I don\'t dare skip it. The opening song is so carefree and I love how they show the beauty of the protagonist. While the opening is cheerful, the ending song struck my heart. It\'s kind of heavy and sad. Feels like something in my heart is crushing, like a multiple needles is slowly, wanting to push through inside of it. Apart from that, the voices of the characters are great, you feel really attached to it. Since it is kinda old, I don\'t think that the animation will be very much appreciated, but I love it. I love the proportion of the characters body. I love the lips of the characters as it is not only a straight line. I love the way the scenes are projected and change into the next one. I love Momo-Chan even if she\'s tan.ENJOYMENT: 10/10I so much enjoyed watching it. I laugh when I want to, I cried when it struck me, I shouted when they annoyed me. My feelings from watching this anime was really complex. Salute to Ueda Miwa! No words can express how I love this story. It\'s a combination of so many emotions struck deeply in my heart. I\'ll never ever forget this again if there\'s a romance recommendation.ENDING: 10/10The twist in the ending is too cruel. It is painful, yet it is the right thing to do. Picking someone you love is much much better that picking the one who loves you. You\'ll just end up toying yourself, thinking that it will end well and it\'s not. Worst of that, you\'ll just end up hurting someone who does not deserve you. Well, that is for me. The funny thing is, the one who make her life miserable is the one who also fixed it. Her number one enemy became the one who saves her from a lifetime regret. Even if one person ended up in pain, the author already made him strong enough to overcome it, I know. And though the story did not end up them getting married, having a family, and such, the bind they built, the decisions they make, the steps and pain they take to get there is enough for them to stay together. Thus, I therefore conclude, it\'s a happy ending! a relationship. It does not show a simple fight between two guy for a girl.

Let's just say this review is a bit biased so if you like the whole drama and love triangle/square/octagon/whatever thing stop reading here.  Also, let me be clear that i only watched Peach Girl up to the seventh episode, so it may improve from there, but I highly doubt it.The plot itself is rather unoriginal and trite:  popular girl vs. unpopular girl with the popular girl, Sae, trying to steal the unpopular girl, Momo's boyfriend.  Of course he...is completely oblivious.  Momo turns the school against Sae and resolves her issues with Togi, her boyfriend, in the sixth episode.  In my opinion they could have ended the series right there.The art and sound were okay. Nothing special, nothing atrocious.The character development was awful.  In the first place, I hate them all for being so goddamn stupid, but all you learn about any of the four main characters is that Sae is manipulative, Momo just wants to be loved, and Kyrie is a nice, supportive guy.

I will try to explain my thoughts, but apologize in advance since this is my first official review for an anime.What I thought were good parts of the anime were as follows. The character development was quite entertaining to watch, especially the interactions between Kairi x Momo. The story at times were very well written and realistic as the heart can waver due to various circumstances even though one would like to think otherwise. There were also many ships/potential couples in this anime which made it interesting to...watch and see who each character would end up with. Each of the main characters in the anime were strongly developed and they were very easy to relate to and grew onto me.Obviously this anime was made in 2005, so the art is not as high quality as the animes airing nowadays. Therefore the style of art is quite suited for the time it was made. Although I'm not going to lie, it got cringe-worthy at some times. watch and see who each character would end up with.

Peach girl could easily have been one of the best love animes I have watched this far, have it not been for two things; graphics and repetitiveness.The art style itself I have no problem with. It\'s pretty standard shojo with lots of eyelashes and flowers and stuff. There are lots of hilarious facial expressions during the comedy bits. And many of the still frames look absolutely gorgeous. The sad thing is, it is very inconsistent, well beyond the point where characters look like entirelly different persons from...frame to frame. Very amateurish. There is a high percentage of zooming, panning and tilting still frames, and the animation that do exist tend to be stiff. In my book, graphics are usually not the be-all and end-all of anime. But when it is this poorly executed it gets in the way of the immersion and ruins the experience. There are graphic masterpieces like Furi Kuri being a good bit older than this, so you can\'t really blame the age of this show. It\'s a huge shame, for the characters are generally well designed and a lot of lost potential shines through during the few really good shots.The story is great and engaging and all, but it would certainly have benefitted from a bit of compression into fewer episodes. As it is, all the back-and-forth ""oh, I think saw them hugging and I have no idea why, now my life is ruined"" makes the story a bit repetitive and less plausible. I think it would have been totally possible to diet all of this down to 13 episodes. Or, failing that, extended the comedy first half or fleshed out some of the secondary characters.I have to lift my hat for the great comedy in the first half. I didn\'t expect this show to be this funny, but it was totally spot on both as comedy in itself, and as a nifty way to introduce the characters and the setting before the drama takes off.There aren\'t a lot of characters, but the ones that we get to meet are with few exeptions deep, beliveable and likeable in their own ways. Especially Momo-chan herself, of course. She balances on a fine line between a couple of anime sterotypes with a straight back and does a hell of a job with it. Sae-chan is another really interesting character, a type of villain seldom seen in anime.Sound-wise, the OP quickly found it\'s way into my top 10, and the ED isn\'t half bad either. The BGM is alright and the voice acting is top notch.

she's resembles members of a particular social group that are viewed as unnattractive down to...their repputation, Momo is therefor unfair pre-judged, ontop of this, someone is ruining her reputation further; someone close by.Momo has decide she's in love with the popular sports-type boy, the popular joker has fallen for Momo = love trianlge.Character...Dispite the story not being too special and the characters seeming like the typical 'youths of school age who are in a rush to grow up', the characters are highly effective, we have:- The female lead - Naive isn't the word, she falls for mistakes anyone with an gram of common sense wouldn't, then falls for virtually the same mistake again, ontop of this, she's; selfish, quick to jump to conclusions and quick to over-react; bad combinations, however, we are always bought back to the fact that she's non-malicious; her heart is in the right place and unlike many other anime girls, she aknowledges her faults, she's allerted to her mistakes and the author hasn't sculpted the story to make her look like the victum every time things don't go right for her- Male love interest 1 - A male who is just as naive as the female lead; no real personality or atributes apart from being the typical 'strong silent' type. the 'jock' and bishounen(?)- Male love interest 2 - The joker who is suprisingly wize his surroundings; not naive like the two above, but bessoted enough to do anything for the female lead; litterally, lap-dog- The other 'woman' - a highly calculating big bad bully who could possibly be one of the best anime villians ever; she manages to be; highly passive aggressive (using ever aspect of passive aggression there is) aswell as confrontational, whilst looking like the innocent party; she's the type to make or break a personWhy watch...As stated previous; the cliche's (I'd say is the number one reason).They aren't the typical anime related cliche's such as ecchi related missunderstandings (guy falls on girls cheast or guy walks in on girl naked), they're the type of belivable and highly inconvenient type, such as; one character catching their partner with another woman/man and not asking questions, or character from the past showing up at a crutial moment etc; it's actually a fun activity in itself sucessfully predicting what's going to happen in the next few seconds.Predictability aside, I suppose the love tri-angle is played out quite well; it may not be too obvious to some who the leading girl would end up with, also, the ride to finding 'the one' wasn't a smooth one; others have came into the scene.As I stated previously; this may not be a comedy, but it is funny. their repputation, Momo is therefor unfair pre-judged, ontop of this, someone is ruining her reputation further;

it may not be too obvious to some who the leading girl would end up with, also, the ride to finding 'the one' wasn't a smooth one; others have came into the scene.As I stated previously; this may not be a comedy, but it is funny."", 'I usually don\'t write reviews but oh god this made me write one just to warn others:-(This might contain a little bit of spoilers )""Peach Girl is about an average high school girl, Momo Adachi, who everyone thinks is a beach bunny/slut because of her tanned skin"" ,completely ignore this line she is a slut .I mean like wtf love is not like changing a cellphone just throw the old buy a new one ,new one gave up pick up the old one again.Even if i could forget that lmao like really a person called your  friend f**ks you up and you keep trusting...him again and again just to get f**ked again nobody is dumb enough for that and this problem is with many characters not 1 . story was going good but after 6-7 episodes you can pretty much guess how it\'s gonna end if u have been watching anime in the past and went completely horrific till the end .Art was nothing exceptional but hey since it wasn\'t made recently can\'t complain much.Characters were simply unrealistic and their actions made no sense.Bottom line you might wanna skip this one unless you prefer over the top mindless drama. him again and again just to get f**ked again nobody is dumb enough for that and this problem is with many characters not 1 . story was going good but after 6-7 episodes you can pretty much guess how it\'s gonna end if u have been watching anime in the past and went completely horrific till the end .Art was nothing exceptional but hey since it wasn\'t made recently can\'t complain much.Characters were simply unrealistic and their actions made no sense.Bottom line you might wanna skip this one unless you prefer over the top mindless drama.', 'why is there literally a pdf file or r*pist in almost every episode?and why are the characters all so insufferable?however this was veryyy entertaining and filled with drama hence why i am still watching it LOL. i will say the main character is kind of dumb like bro just drop both those guys and get yourself a new nice man, nonetheless i will cut her some slack because she is only 16 and teenagers are usually just always in their head and are infatuated with the idea of love.also wtf is wrong with her friend LMFAO? unfortunately people like that do exist but damnnn.this...anime is also old so like im not surprised by the amount of questionable things that took place, so keep that in mind. anime is also old so like im not surprised by the amount of questionable things that took place, so keep that in mind.', 'I don’t think I’ve ever experienced an emotional rollercoaster like the one Peach Girl has took me on. I’ve had so many different opinions about this show while watching that I just didn’t know what to think at the end of it. But after giving it some thought, this is probably one of my favorite Shoujo anime!I originally wanted to drop this anime in the beginning. Early on I was fed up with how annoying pretty much all the characters were. It seemed like everyone in this show was a moron. Momo’s “best friend” Sae, constantly tried to stir up drama to make Momo’s...life a living hell. Yet even after realizing this, she still keeps going back to her. And why does Sae like to ruin Momo’s life? Well that’s just how she is. Now let’s look at the main love interests, Toji and Okayasu. Both of these guys are also complete morons. A lot of Momo’s anguish came from Toji falling into Sae’s trap, and basically becoming her puppet. He believes everything she tells him over his long time friend (Momo) who is also the girl he loves. As for Okayasu, I can’t say too much without spoiling anything, so I’ll just say that he takes what he has for granted.Even though I still think the characters are morons after I finished the show, they became likable morons. In their own way, the main characters all grew to become better people not just for the sake of others, but for themselves as well. Characters are given enough time to possibly change your view point of them, whether that may be for the better or worse. Giving characters time to grow is one thing that Peach Girl does so well. Unlike other anime with romance elements that involve more than one possible love interest, Peach Girl gives both Toji and Okayasu enough screen time for the viewer to decide on which guy they want to root for. Even if your favorite guy doesn’t win, at least they were enough time to actually feel like they mattered and impacted the story (In a way that would make it a completely different story if they weren’t there) rather than feeling like their entire existence in the show is pointless.For me Peach Girl was a hidden gem that I’m glad I watched. I laughed, I cried (not really but there were moments that just pulled my heart strings) I cringed, I was mad I was happy, and in the end, I was satisfied. life a living hell.

I tried it again a few months ago and I am glad I watched more; it just got more interesting. I love dramas although between this and Nana I'd have to go with Nana; I just wish I could find nana in local stores. Anyways back to Peach Girl- The relationships were good, but something has to mess them up otherwise there'd be no story. MOst of the time if the characters just communicated everything would have been fine lol. That pains me...sometimes.. I made it the end and overall it was pretty enjoyable and satisfying ending. I might pick it up as SAVE EDITION. sometimes.. I made it the end and overall it was pretty enjoyable and satisfying ending.

Also I randomly found this anime and decided to watch it for the sake of my enjoyment.SO basically Peach Girl is your average Shoujo anime about this girl Momo and her wonders of highschool drama life with psychotic bitch Sae, the loving best boy Kairi and STUPID DUMBASS TOUJI.Story: 6/10Let\'s all face it this is basically MOST of the highschool shoujo drama anime that we\'ve all seen in the 2000s with some girl falling in love and some guys trying to get kinky with her for some reason and a...group of girls or one girl getting jealous of the protagonist because they can only think about their desires. So we have this tanned girl named Momo having this crush on a guy named Touji (oh don\'t worry we\'re going to get to him later) she wants to confess her feelings to him but she  can\'t because guess what she is afraid that he doesn\'t like tanned girls because she heard that from a friend (not Sae) from a long time ago and turns out she also liked him. Anyway we also have THE MOST DECENT CHARACTER IN THE ENTIRE ANIME, Kairi, sweet loving best boy kairi who also has a crush on momo (BECAUSE WE ALL LOVE LOVE TRIANGLES) and basically he brings some comedic reliefs into the show and also see his character grow a bit later in the anime. Now out    of the way it turns out Touji also has a thing for Momo and they began dating together and lived happily ever af-  GOT YOU. YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ALL SUNSHINE AND  LOLIPOPS HUH WELL THERE IS ONE PROBLEM...SO Momo has a ""bestfriend"" named Sae that terrorizes them because she ALSO likes Touji (now you see where this is going) anyway they get into some love triangle shit and indecisive shit and Momo ends up with (I aint telling you shit go watch it and find out)Art:5/10Nothing really stands out in terms of the artstyle because this came out in the 2000s when some shoujo anime looked kind of cheap but it\'s decent like others. Also I\'ve been noticing this trend back in 2000s anime of making the shoujo boys looking like girls for some reason because sometimes I can\'t identify there gender btw it\'s not like traps where they just do this on purpose.Sound:6/10It\'s pretty decent with some 2000s j-pop rock vibe to it and it\'s just average.Character: 5/10Momo is like any other shoujo protagonist that has to deal with shit and boys and bla bla bla but she didn\'t just lean back and didn\'t do anything when she is being harassed or something she stood up for herself which I feel many shoujo protagonist don\'t have and just act like this dumb puppy anyway from that she is quite forgettable  moving on. Next we have THE BITCH QUEEN HERSELF SAE she\'s what made the whole anime so frustrating and SO CRINGE to look at like seriously DOES SHE HAVE SELF ESTEEM ISSUSES THEN YOU NEED GOD IN YOUR LIFE anyway she basically tries to tear their relationship apart doing literally ANYTHING to achieve that also WHY THE HELL IS MOMO STILL HANGING OUT WITH THIS PSYCHO AFTER WHAT SHE HAS DONE TO HER THEY BOTH NEED TO GET A RESTAINING ORDER OR CALL THE DAMN POLICE!!! Anyway on to TOUJI. OH MY WHERE TO FUCKING START first off he has to be one of the DUMBEST SHOUJO BOYS I\'VE EVER SEEN NO SERIOUSLY WHAT DOES MOMO SEE IN THIS BLOCK HEADED ONE DIMENSIONAL LUNATIC For example, before Momo and Touji were dating Kairi actually kissed her because why not and when Touji found out he got mad but when they were actually dating Touji kissed Sae because she told him he can use her to practice kissing on Momo (wow he is so stupid he would even fall for Sae\'s crap) FINALLY LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE HAVE SWEET CINNAMONROLL BEST BOY Kairi so he is basically the class clown of the show and can be stupid sometimes but not Touji levels of stupid and he get to see his love  for Momo develop during the anime sometime it can be frustrating other times it drags out but still the MOST decent character in the anime.enjoyment: 9/10Even though I said the anime is frustrating I actually enjoyed roasting the shit out of Touji and Sae because I just love hating on themOverall:6/10SO YEAH your very typical shoujo anime and yeah but if you like psychotic bitches and love triangle this anime is for you anyway toodles!!! group of girls or one girl getting jealous of the protagonist because they can only think about their desires.

Even up until the last two episodes (23 and 24), I wasn't totally sure!!!!I don't know what else to say but this - if you are like me, and for some reason, you like stupid romance anime like this, you will enjoy it.It's pretty obvious the kind of anime it is within the first couple of episodes. So,...if you don't like it by then, don't bother continuing. if you don't like it by then, don't bother continuing."", ""I am an adult male but as soon as I saw that there was an anime called ‘Peach Girl: Super Pop Love Hurricane’ - of course, I felt an instant urge to watch it. Who couldn’t resist a name like that? It didn’t help when I found out that ‘meg rock’ - who wrote the Monogatari OPs - also did the OP for this one.When I watched the first few episodes, I actually had mixed feelings about it. It seemed very mean-spirited. The main character Momo is this very pretty, charming do-good high school girl dabbling her feet into the world of relationships, which she...explores with her classmates Toji and Kairi. Momo is so sweet! She feels like a Marin Kitagawa precursor - she’s that sweet. But she is constantly harassed and emotionally abused and manipulated by the people around her, particularly by a girl in her class called Sae (who is a total narcissist and borderline psychopath. It was so hard to watch at times. I felt so bad for Momo! The girl from ‘Thirteen Reasons Why’ went through less than poor Momo! (However, Momo is much more stronger-willed than Hannah Baker for sure, and manages to get over things).But then, I think I realised what I think ‘Peach Girl: Super Pop Love Hurricane’ was going for. I think it was going for a kind of weird Kafkaesque tone. With this in mind, I escaped from the realism of it and….. I think I actually started to appreciate it more…. Oh my gosh, this must sound so weird. I don’t think I have ever thought that there was such a thing as a Kafkaesque rom-com haha. It’s very unique, for sure...But strangely… I think the anime works if you view it as such. It didn't work 100% but it did work. There are some scenes that go too far though, especially with some of the secondary characters around the middle and end of the anime. I can think of at least seven characters that should be in jail for what they did. I think the amount of suffering that the characters go through could be scaled down. It also could have gotten away with being a few episodes shorter.I did like the main characters a lot - Momo, Kairi, and Toji are all equally likeable to me. I even warmed up to Sae eventually. And I liked the ending of the anime too. I don’t think I would change anything about it.All in all, ‘Peach Girl: Super Pop Love Hurricane’ is a contemplation of the dangers of miscommunication, assumptions, and jealousy, especially in a relationship. The fickle and delicate nature of romance. The consuming and exhausting nature of romance. And the importance of openness with one’s feelings and emotions. It also explores things such as colourism, friendship, family, and letting go.I’ve seen articles comparing this anime to Toradora. It may be a bit more messy and less cohesive than Toradora although I did enjoy this more. I could never really enjoy Toradora - I found Toradora’s characters, whilst interesting, a bit messy. I felt that Toradora had a depressing and despairing undertone to it. Even though ‘Peach Girl’ is a bit dark too, its comedic timing was better and I laughed at least once every episode. Certainly none of the humour was mean-spirited (unlike in the show Family Guy, with how everyone treats Meg Griffin). Some of the jokes were very funny and some aspects of the animation aided this as well. I could even laugh at Sae a bit! Of course, there were certainly many wholesome moments as well.I’ll give it a light 7 (oh, and sorry ‘meg rock’ but the OP was terrible!

Honestly, Peach Girl has been one of the anime that has captured my heart way back when I was still a kid (well tbh, I am easily swayed easily by tv shows when I was a kid lol). Well moving on, I decided again to re-watch the whole series and I must say I was not really disappointed with my decision. Let me break down my review:Story: 8/10Story-wise it wasn\'t really that special or unique like that of Toradora (it is basically one of my favorite and standards when it comes...to shoujos haha), but I somehow find the plot of Peach Girl really interesting. I wanted to hate it but I cannot bring myself to hate it. The plot can somehow be predictable and there were some character loop holes - it wasn\'t perfect but very engaging and I find it very weird.Art: 9/10The animation itself for me was okay (knowing in fact that it was released on 2005), but I find the art style really unique especially during the break scenes and the ending mv. The art style was really sassy and quirky in contrast and despite of the compelling plot.Sound: 8/10I\'m not a fan of all the soundtracks of this series but I must say its ending OST (Asunaro Ginga) captured me and it has become one of my favorite anime soundtracks!Character & Enjoyment: 8/10To be honest there wasn\'t any character that I truly loved but there were characters that I truly enjoyed watching. What I meant is that, in this series for me, I did not find any character I could find myself falling in love with but rather I\'ve found characters that I enjoyed watching falling in love. It\'s not that I\'m a masochist to enjoy watching the characters fight over for a girl but I found myself really drawn to them. I\'ve felt the sadness and bitterness of each character but not because I see myself in them but rather because of the plot-engagement this series has given me.Overall: 8I cannot say it is one of my favorite shoujo anime series but Peach Girl will always have a special spot in my heart. Plot and character-wise its not flawless, it may seem cliche but I find it really engaging - and that\'s what we look for in a shoujo right? You\'ll not fall in love with a character but instead fall in love with them falling in love! For me, I find it really refreshing  (I\'m currently watching Maid-sama and I can\'t seem to stop watching it as well because I already fell in love with Usui haha, review to follow) anyway, Peach Girl isn\'t the series wherein you\'ll find yourself saying ""Where can I get myself a Kairi or Toji?"" and seriously go gaga over a character but rather seeing yourself falling in love with them falling in love. If you find my review a bit unclear maybe it\'s time for you to see it yourself, it\'s really worth the watch! :) to shoujos haha), but I somehow find the plot of Peach Girl really interesting.

If you find my review a bit unclear maybe it\'s time for you to see it yourself, it\'s really worth the watch! :)', ""God's grace be to you all.My first review, it's going to be whatever.I am also going to say first, I highly recommend this anime to ANY romance fan. The sheer fun of watching this is nice considering how fast paced the story is at the beginning, you'll always come back for more until it's all gone.What I liked is definitely the suspense of what's going to happen in the next episode..mainly this romance anime consists of cliffhangers, and 'cliffhanger addiction' if that's even a term lol. That's what makes Peach Girl so enjoyable, you literally cannot wait for the next episode to see what's going...to happen to Okayasu/ Toji/ Sae in their love triangles etc. This anime is a love triangle fest, and also a girl that can't make up her mind with the guy she likes, due to the atmosphere of confusion and fraud she kind of had, or she had..idk just watch it yourself.What I didn't like is how it becomes a little bit unrealistic (just a little bit). But you know what the Bible says, a little leaven leaventh the whole lump. Momo's decisions were just plain strange, her nature from the start of series when it was interesting suddenly in the mid part was gone, and all her friends had all these secrets that most of them just didn't make sense either. Sae was evil, but she made the story what it was, and she had nothing to hide because it was always exposed.. it was understandable, she had a real plot and a realish character compared to the rest of the cast. Toji...haha! Kairi, mmm I didn't get him either. Kairi's brother...what?Like some of the plot... it was ridiculous, and the ending didn't show me what happened to these characters anyway to understand them enough.The ending was supposed to be the K.O blow for me to give it a good rating, and it judged whether this anime was good or very good (probably if the ending was waayy more developed, it couldve proably made the experience way more enjoyable than it was supposed to be.) My meaning in understanding is that it just has to make some sense..it doesn't have to be a extremely clear view of who the person is and what happened and what's going to happen. I didn't get Momo enough, it was a 'good thing/ bad thing' type of deal.I managed to jerk a tear or two of happiness when the final moments happened at the last episode, it was nice and w.e for that moment, but then after that..the anime just felt incomplete, even though it was complete. All I'm saying is that it could've been WAY better.As for the animation,just..bad. I think sometimes animation can extremely hinder romance animes. Unfortunately, Peach Girl was hit hard, and the animation took a role to devalue this best moments, into horrible drawings. I was disappointed, and at times, really let down because of it.Overall, I definitely recommend it, just because how fun it was to watch Momo vs Sae, and the love triangle-drama! Peach Girl is a real marathoner in my opinion, most likely for you too!From me, this will get a 7 out of 10.(I have decided to rewrite this review soon, due to me thinking it can be much better by being more accurate and accessible to help others understand why they should be hooked or not to watch Peach Girl.)Thanks for reading, God bless you! to happen to Okayasu/ Toji/ Sae in their love triangles etc. This anime is a love triangle fest, and also a girl that can't make up her mind with the guy she likes, due to the atmosphere of confusion and fraud she kind of had, or she had..idk just watch it yourself.What I didn't like is how it becomes a little bit unrealistic (just a little bit). But you know what the Bible says, a little leaven leaventh the whole lump. Momo's decisions were just plain strange, her nature from the start of series when it was interesting suddenly in the mid part was gone, and all her friends had all these secrets that most of them just didn't make sense either. Sae was evil, but she made the story what it was, and she had nothing to hide because it was always exposed.. it was understandable, she had a real plot and a realish character compared to the rest of the cast. Toji...haha! Kairi, mmm I didn't get him either.

But here is an advice: just don't read the preface story of the anime.- plot twist, plot twist and plot twist- What the hell love is all about?- hmm, am I satisfied? Well, here is my answer.As i have watched Peach girl, i wondered how this could be a love triangle, but this is not definitely it. The main characters do not actually move forward to create a GREAT FEELING OF '' LOVE'' , where you might say: ''this is actually good romance buddy''.i think giving a 6/10 is a pretty good rating....You will find the hardships of the characters but mainly of  Okayasu Kairi who has in fact played the most important role in the series. He definitely surpassed the Female main character Momo Adachi for his lively and cheerful personality. He is the one who dissipates all misunderstandings and creates the evolution of the anime. Yet at some point in time, he is confronted with his own feelings. But he evolved rapidly in finding what he really wants and what he does not. Straight forward and to the point. He is surely the one to love compared to the rest.Unfortunately, my feeling wont wash away though i have attempted to love the main female character. Despite Momo Adachi is kind, sweet, beautiful, and gentle, she is nothing but a Dense, Selfish girl in the inside. She keeps the audience uncertain about how she really feels as a person who loves someone honestly till the end. As soon as the anime ends, you will eventually think that she won't last long with the guy she is with, though she finally came to make a choice. As she keeps on changing lovers and i would say she is a very simple and easy girl.  She keeps on misinterpreting the situations and somehow gets involved in hurting others around her unconsciously. My bad, if ever you want to love someone, she is surely not doing it right. In the end she says'' I have the right to find happiness, cause i want to be happy'' We understand her, but NOT in a Romance anime genre. Happiness and love should be two sides of the same coin my dear. You failed.Okay, okay... I will give her some credits for being so strong till the end, for fighting and finally finding her true self, though some of her thoughts are lightly expressed. What is really important here is that she finally came to her senses and made things right and that's great.For few who wants to know, Sae is not  considered to be the best friend of Momo (the main Female Character) at the beginning.  Sae is the subject responsible for creating the confusion in the anime. She does not stop until she realizes that she is torturing herself. Most viewers will find her to be a horrible character, with no ethic or self respect but, she is definitely one of the most intelligent and self realizing character. Sae alone is not entirely responsible for those bunch of plot twists, but she does have a role to play.As for Touji Kazuya, he is shy and dependable. Though immature and seems to be a stalker, as he pops of nowhere and creates confusing in the anime in the end. From my personal opinion, he chooses the easiest path in the anime, and makes little effort to really make him deserved to be loved. But we do not despise him for being an incompetent.As a whole, the anime provides some entertainment that should not, yup i said should not be taken seriously. Several happenings in anime are dealt without measuring the consequences of the characters actions.  The characters past and characters roles restrict the fast progression of the series.Just don't take things seriously and you will be fine. Go on. You will find the hardships of the characters but mainly of  Okayasu Kairi who has in fact played the most important role in the series.

She was an annoying and jealous bitch in the beginning, going as far as blackmailing Touji.But after Sae ""left"" the picture, seriously, it just dawned on me on how dumb Momo is. Never have I felt more frustrated than seeing her lie to herself and being torn apart between Touji and Kairi. Like come on, seriously! Just get with the guy you love already!But then again, if it wasn\'t for those small ""annoying"" moments in between the show, we wouldn\'t have had a ""good"" show to watch per se....Anyways, to keep this review short and sweet, I just want to say that if you want a show that will make you experience an emotional rollercoaster then by all means go ahead and watch it.I won\'t say that this show is holy and magical and will teach you some life lessons that you will never forget but it is the typical high school love romance that can sometimes be a little unrealistic.If you like the theme drama then I would really recommend this. I really enjoyed this as well.

Just yesterday I saw the same episolde over 10 times and that's not usual of me considering I give up a lot of shows or I watch them at least 5 times and get tired of it but deep deep deep inside of me . . . . I cannot wait until the next episode of Peach Girl comes on it's the best ever!!!! Though I will tell you this once...you watch it and see how much of a pain Sae is just compare her to someone you hate and imagine you are humiliaing them in front of the whole school that's what i do!!!! you watch it and see how much of a pain Sae is just compare her to someone you hate and imagine you are humiliaing them in front of the whole school that's what i do!!!!"", ""Peach girl, how do you discribe this anime? Well, the word drama is a VERY good one!Story 8/10The story is about a girl named Momo and she has a hard time because of the lies  that are going around about her. This is all because of Sae, who is actually jealous of her. This will be al little bit of a spoiler: There are 2 guys who love her: Kairi and Toji. And Momo loves them both, but because of Kairi's the past and a lot of of other things (the hard time Sae gives her and other stuff) there's a lot of drama...in it. Because in the whole anime she just changes her boyfirend... And that frustrated me a bit. But it was good enough to keep me watching because it was interesting.Art 8/10Nothing really special to say about the art, it was good. BUT, there was 1 thing that I didn't like about it, and that where the lips of each person, I thought it just didn't look very good....Sound 8/10The sound was good, the opening was OK (I watched the dubbed version) the opening got me a little bit irritated, but that was just a little.. I won't say anything more about it.Character 9/10The characters were actually pretty good.Sae is the mean girl, so she REALLY frustrated me in the beginning, but (spoiler) she actually gets nicer as the episodes pass. And at the end, I even liked her. But the beginning episodes were almost all about her and that was a bit too much for me...Momo is the main lead and has a pretty strong character, but she still cries a lot... well, she loved both Kairi and Toji, which was a bit weird actually. When I was watching I was like: just chose one!!! (I wanted Kairi to be with her) She just changed her opinion the whole time because of things that happen. And than she is broken-hearted again and crying, of course. I still liked her though. Maybe I'm  just saying she is bad, but I don't want you to think that she is the worst person I've ever seen as main person, which she is defenitely NOT.Kairi is pretty funny, nice and caring but he has a past he has to deal with, which will cause a lot of trouble in the episodes.Toji is a nice guy, but, when you have him as a boyfriend.. You know, when you are with someone you love, you should trust them, right? That's something he didn't  do in the beginning. And then you have the Sae problem in the beginning. Which will bring also drama in the serie.Enjoyment 7/10Well, I enjoyed it, but all the changing from boyfriend and the drama that comes with that and the problems with Sae was a bit too much for me...Overall 8/10There's good romance in this, I liked almost everybody at the ending, and there's a lot of kissing in it, maybe a bit too much...But I recommend it to you, you should watch it :) in it.

That this anime is nothing short of ""a wasted opportunity."" What could have been an interesting, thought provoking and emotive concept of high school life, friendship and young love was, I feel, ruined by the poor execution and over enthusiasm of its creator.At first I found this anime very relatable, as it dealt with the struggles of love and trust. However, as the show progressed these emotions were replaced with annoyance and aggravation as the endless twists and turns of the story, morphed it into a complete joke.In all honesty...this anime was over worked. Even in the very last episode there was no real shape to the story or characters which both shifted and changed from minute to minute. This, instead of adding depth to the story, destroyed the aspect of reality, its major redeeming feature and made the whole plot considerably unbelievable. this anime was over worked.

It took me awhile to get around to watching this anime because the plot didn't sound all that interesting to me... I take that back. It sounded interesting in a stupid kind of way. Anyway, I finally got around to watching it and watched it in two days.If anyone is crazy about romance than this is the perfect anime to watch. It might not be the most original at times but it definantly doesn't get boring to watch. However you do have some moments where you wonder how realistic it...is.

That includes the bad parts.[Short synopsis + personal thoughts](SPOILERS IN TEXT) The story started out happy but by then i already knew what was going to happen.-- She was in love with someone and in the first episode he said he was also in love with her. Once i heard him say that i checked the episode count... 26. Once I saw that number I knew damn well it wouldn\'t stay that way just for the sake of it being...a romance anime. But it was worth sticking with it. The Heroine MC was in love(Or at least thought she was) with one of 2 Hero MC\'s and the other Hero MC was in love with her but the feelings were unrequited-- So it was your basic love triangle; For the first 10 or so episodes She(Momo) was going out with Touji, then some shit happened and she was going out with Okayasu from ep 13-18, Then Momo went back and forth between the two for a whole 3 episodes until she decided to choose Touji. After choosing Touji they agreed to go on trip together which of course turned into an overnight trip but this was all after learning the truth about what happened with Okayasu so she started feeling guilty and thinking about Okayasu... As she was getting laid. Then Touji really didn\'t like it and told her to choose. And in the end she choose Okayasu-- The end.[Character Opinions] I was so ecstatic she chose Okayasu in the end though i\'m not exactly sure why.. If I had to guess it would be because Touji just seemed too perfect I wanted to see him get ruined. Touji spent a whole year with another girl just to protect Momo from getting expelled, as this was happening Momo and Okayasu were going out and even though they were Okayasu was openly after another girl-- But not in a bad way like he didn\'t love Momo, but in an admirable way since the other girl- Misao was his former homeschool teacher and the first person to really accept him for him. But it was probably because of this, Okayasu was true to himself but undoubtedly conscious of other people;(For example)  When Momo chose Touji because of his mistake he didn\'t tell her the truth because he just wanted her to be happy, and it was that genuinity that makes me like him a lot more than Touji.  The main side character(If that makes sense) Sae was someone who most people would hate- She went behind peoples back(Including her best-friends) stole there boyfriends spread rumors about them she was someone your not supposed to like. But I think she was my favorite character, not because her situation was the best but because she was always open... When she was depressed she didn\'t hide it, when she has a problem she confronts it head on- Sae was the true representation of greed.. having everything but not being happy because it wasn\'t what she really wanted.. she was truly great after she found something she cherished and she was the total wingman the entire story without her nothing would have happened the way it did.[Conclusion] This anime is mainly based on three things.. insecurity, miscommunication and ego. Lots of the characters were hypocrites for example-- Touji said ""Let\'s start over"".. Those exact same words 3 times, but when Okayasu tried it he told him to backoff and that she was sick of it. This anime was the best drama anime I\'ve ever watched and It was incredibly suspenseful and enjoyable. If there are still people reading this then I recommend watching the anime, and thank you. a romance anime. But it was worth sticking with it.

It wasn't terrible but it wasn't perfect, it's in a short list of anime that brought a tear to my eye and I'm glad I watched it! Spoilers ahead..Story 7/10: So.. Romantic anime wise the story is actually pretty decent, from a good story line point of view it sucked! The score is based off of the romantic anime wise story line and I'll tell you why it kind of sucked but was awesome at the same time. So, we jumped into a story where this girl has had a crush on a guy since middle school and blah blah blah happens and they...end up together and I'm like cool! A good romantic couple that will start of strong! But then it was all based on romance and I completely understand that the anime is a romance anime but I would of loved for something a little bit more to come from it.. Like festivals, sports, clubs, fighting (Not just one punch thrown) and so on.. It just felt boring and I'd find myself skipping through most of the episodes where they would just be talking and not doing anything. Ima tell you how much I hated the Momo character aswell soon.. So jumping straight to the end because honestly I can't remember most of the anime but I'm glad it had a happy ending and she chose Kairi because he was clearly the first choice! The ending was probs my favorite part about it and I really enjoyed the romantic scene aswell! Overall the story was decent but could of been better, I felt like we could of had alot more backstory to each character especially considering there were 26 episodes.. but oh well!Art 6/10: The animation was ok but kind sucked.. didn't seemed well done at all but it was still easily good to watch and still had a sense of nostalgia to it aswell kind of..Sound 7/10: Don't really care for sound/music so I don't have much to comment on it but it seemed decent from what I heard..Character 7/10: Oh boy here we go.. So main character Momo.. I loved her all throughout the entire anime all the way up until the point where she got back with Toji.. Just saying this part is just going to be a rant about the characters, so reviews on how they were but.. I completely hated her after this point, completely abandoning Kairi because he was late a few? Completely going to the beach and I'm assuming sleeping? With the guy just after he missed your meetup? I completely lost respect for her after this, she was redeemed by a millimeter because she went back to Kairi but it just felt stupid that Kairi took her back especially after going through all that stuff she did we Toji after him.. STUPID!Kairi, I completely loved the dude all throughout.. Loved his go getter happy attitude he had and it even made me have tears in my eyes when I see him cry after seeing Toji and Momo. Felt so sorry for the dude being put all through that and trying to act normal when he was breaking inside. Also Sae coming in with that clutch at the end, completely redeemed herself as well explaining what happened! Ma girl!Overall:  It is a decent watch and I would recommend it to people looking for a good romance story with a love triangle that will leave the manilest of men with tears in his eyes. If you're looking for this then go right ahead and dive in for this awesome story of a girl trying to find happiness! end up together and I'm like cool! A good romantic couple that will start of strong! But then it was all based on romance and I completely understand that the anime is a romance anime but I would of loved for something a little bit more to come from it.. Like festivals, sports, clubs, fighting (Not just one punch thrown) and so on.. It just felt boring and I'd find myself skipping through most of the episodes where they would just be talking and not doing anything. Ima tell you how much I hated the Momo character aswell soon..

She is a full-on hater. Sometimes when I wonder if I have trust issues, I think of Sae. Momo had active ops praying for her downfall. Her naivete toward Sae\'s true nature led to recurring pain. This show helps me feel at peace with losing ""friends"" who are jealous of your success, imitate you, pretend to care so much about you, all while seeking to crush you. If this review seems overdramatic, that\'s because...the level of betrayal in this show is at the level of Griffith...nay even Judas. Sae is a A++ depiction of a narc-abuser friend. the level of betrayal in this show is at the level of Griffith...nay even Judas. Sae is a A++ depiction of a narc-abuser friend.', ""So when I was searching out the list of shoujo anime, I bumped into Peach Girl. Honestly, I totally didn't expect it to be that dramatic but I'd say often even overly-dramatic. First episode was great, I expected some funny romantic comedy that could give me chills. But after a few episodes, it suddenly got real serious. It's not like I wasn't enjoying it. There aren't many shoujo with such a dramatic atmosphere that it can sometimes make you a bit uncomfortable. But once you start watching this type of anime, you'll soon find out that not everything in it should be taken too seriously...since its own goal is to make dramatic story full of (un)expected events, love problems and therefore it isn't that realistic.The main heroine Momo seemed like a nice girl in the first episode but gradually started acting like a indecisive brat who can't decide between two muffins, two love interests in this case. I kinda didn't get why her skin stayed tanned since she wasn't in front of sun that often afterwards. But then again, her boys' behavior ain't any better. They keep saying they should solve their issues like a grown-ups but noope, they keep acting like a bunch of horndogs trying to win over their prey.The main villain Sae should be one of the most hated anime characters ever because she's just so evil that you must watch it for yourself.Kairi was probably the only likable character for me. He wasn't as dumb as his friends.The animation is pretty good. I don't regret watching it, it was quite enjoyable. There were some WTF facepalm-worthy moments but I got used to it. The ending tho. It dissapointed me and if it wouldn't be that incredibly lame, I'd give more points. since its own goal is to make dramatic story full of (un)expected events, love problems and therefore it isn't that realistic.The main heroine Momo seemed like a nice girl in the first episode but gradually started acting like a indecisive brat who can't decide between two muffins, two love interests in this case.

Also there are 2 pretty boys and girl Momo - the main character. It\'s hard to understand which of them she will choose in the end, so it makes final unpredictable. Momo is good girl and she made me like her, though I usually don\'t really like kind and naive girls, which are always in anime:) There is also bad girl - Sae Kashiwagi and she\'s real evil! If you\'re hot-tempered I don\'t think you could watch this anime completely, because Sae annoys sooo much! She tries to...separate Touji and Momo all the time, and I would kill her, if I was Momo! But they don\'t do this way, because they\'re kind and fool, and it annoys even more than Sae\'s intrigues! Even after million deceptions and disclosings, they still fall for the bait! Their actions are devoid of sense!The only one character is enough clever and sober-minded - Okayasu Kairi, the second boy. He always see though Sae and always help Momo. He\'s really noteworthy and much more pretty than Touji:)Anyway, if you like romances and something like ""Kimi ni Todoke"" or especially ""Kare Kano"", you should watch it! separate Touji and Momo all the time, and I would kill her, if I was Momo!

Sai because I wanted to pull her eyes out because she was so mean, and Momo because shes a drama queen lol.The story was ehh, the art was nice though :Dbut STILL she went on and off with the 2 boys like 2304345 times!!It was annoying, but the art was nice haha. ', ""Peach Girl is something you may enjoy if you like Soap Dramas.There are the funny scenes you get in an anime, the very good animation and art get with anime and the usual teenager in high-school problems you get anywhere.This anime will keep you hoping the Protagonist will win and keep you on the edge of your seat. If its not one melodramatic situation or another, its the characters themselves.I enjoyed this anime even though I hate those drama filled shows.I'd recommend just watching the first episode and not feeling drama-love-hate towards one character or another. "", ""I love the anime. The love triangles, the skanky bully, the parts were the bully falls in love and understands her mistakes, the plot just keeps throwing twists at you and it's exhilerating. My personal favorite from the beginning was Kairi (Touji was too stiff for my tastes), he's so playful and supportive, and dispite liking the girl, he does his absolute best to help her and Touji make it work and (except for one occasion) doesn't try to underhandedly steal her away. He's a real friend that will stick with you through what ever issues. Also, the drama REALLY made you connect with the...main character. Give it a check out, it won't disappoint. main character. Give it a check out, it won't disappoint."", ""I absolutely adored peach girl it's a hidden gem it has great character development and involvement. Momo is just a typical pretty naive teenager going through major insecurities and changes in her life it's not just about a sticky love triangle but more about her finding herself and what she wants I 100% relate to Momo I think we all have met a Momo.Sai keeps things interesting you hate her and begin to like her then hate her all over again.I loved how relatable all the characters were and it can be funny at times too peach girl is the kind of show you...want to watch when you are bored and looking for something girly funny and super nostalgic.Peach girl will always be with me. want to watch when you are bored and looking for something girly funny and super nostalgic.Peach girl will always be with me."", ""I like big butts, and this got plenty of them. Her peaches be banging! Her hair be flowing in the wind, this girl can step on me any day. So the bitch girl, she aight. Best yandere in the series in the series bro. I call her a yandere cause she killed my heart!! She always be tricking the main character to have sex with people, she is really stupid. The infinity gauntlet is the best weapon in the show, Iron Man is the best character. You must watch. The bitch girl tricks the main boy into eating Tide Pods everyday of the week, he...always falls for it. He is really stupid, but he is MY senpai uwu. Also I forget what he looks like. The stupid dumb dumb boy is really weird he always smiles, because he like that peach. Back to her peaches, DID I MENTION THEY'RE BANGING?! They orange and very juicy, they feel nice in my mouth. They burst in my mouth and feel nice. Also did I mention I was talking about the main guy, his peaches be tasty bro. Thickest peaches I've ever seen on a man, biggest bulge on the planet, yes bigger than Captain Levi himself. His peaches be banging!! Back to the bitch girl, her peaches aren't banging, they are disgusting! If she had banging peaches she'd be the best damn character in the show. She wouldn't be a bitch, but here we are and her peaches aren't banging bro. I know it's pretty sad. But you should watch this show because everyone else's peaches be banging.~THE END~ always falls for it. He is really stupid, but he is MY senpai uwu. Also I forget what he looks like.

Each character has their own story and adds so much to the overall anime, the show does highlight more serious issues too, but...it is just a part of the anime and young teen life,  I will forever treasure Peach girl it just meant that much to me❤️ it is just a part of the anime and young teen life,  I will forever treasure Peach girl it just meant that much to me❤️', 'I know some people may not like this romance anime because there are a few instances of miscommunication between the characters, but CMON can someone name a romance anime where this doesn\'t happen? Peach Girl is one of the best romances out there solely because the drama is the best, the storyline flows and makes sense for these characters, and the characters are actually likable - even the mean ones have a purpose.Spoilers Ahead:I\'ll start off by saying, I can\'t stand Sae, but I freaking love her because she serves her purpose! She\'s evil and she knows it! She\'s one of the best villians...I\'ve seen in a romance anime. She\'s psychotic and does it well.Momo is a decent woman lead. She\'s very strong, sweet and beautiful. She can be ditzy sometimes because I can\'t count how many times she believes Sae, but she also stands her ground, so I guess it evens it out. She isn\'t the worst girl lead, I actually like her majority of the time.Okay, okay...now...Kairi. Kairi is the BEST BOY!!!! AHHH, I love him. He\'s probably the main reason I finished the entire show, just so I could see who Momo chooses (yes, this is a love triangle anime). Kairi is so sweet, he loves Momo through her worst times and yes he has his own issues but he actually WORKS on them, and is open and honest with Momo instead of breaking up with her without her knowing what is going on *cough cough* Toji *cough cough*.Toji is a good character because I feel he serves his purpose of being the ""first crush"". Toji is sweet, but throughout the show he was about as dumb as a box of rocks, I swear the man has 10 brain cells. Maybe I am just a Kairi fangirl, but since Day 1, Kairi was the ONLY person who believed in Momo when all the drama was going on, he stuck with her, he let her love someone else and was fine with it, and he\'s hilarious! See? I started talking about Kairi again - Lol.And, Ryo (Kairi\'s brother) he\'s evil, but he\'s so hilarious to me at times. I\'m glad there was a character that humbled Sae. Sae finally met her match. Also, Misao is a strong, GROWN woman - I loved her!The storyline is easy to follow, and pretty simple. If you love drama, amazing boys like Kairi, and love triangles, you\'ll like this anime. You\'ll have to watch to see who Momo picks. The show is full of drama, but it\'s so watchable. I give it a 9/10! I\'ve seen in a romance anime. She\'s psychotic and does it well.Momo is a decent woman lead. She\'s very strong, sweet and beautiful.
