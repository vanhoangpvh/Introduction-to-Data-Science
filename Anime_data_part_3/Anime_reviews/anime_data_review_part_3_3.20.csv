Yoru wa Neko to Issho Season 2,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54198/Yoru_wa_Neko_to_Issho_Season_2,"[""Let's be real, this show can be summed in one single word: CAT. But alas, this is not Steam, and so I can not just leave a one-word review and call it quits. Instead, I'll have to dive into a tid bit more detail.Welcome, my furry friends, to Nights with a Cat (or Yoru wa Neko to Issho) season 2. Season 2 is truly not much different from season 1, both being compromised of 1-minute shorts following the hijinks of two siblings and their silly grey cat; indeed, the only real difference lies in the new closing theme. If you enjoyed season 1, or you...just really like silly cat animations, then you should absolutely give this season a go! It's the same light, fluffy fun as before, and honestly, that's exactly what I wanted with this. So let's go curl up and watch some cat videos, all right? :3 just really like silly cat animations, then you should absolutely give this season a go! It's the same light, fluffy fun as before, and honestly, that's exactly what I wanted with this. So let's go curl up and watch some cat videos, all right? :3"", ""I'm a simple man. I see kitty, I click on kitty, I fawn over kitty. Cute kitty. Cute kitty doing kitty things. It cute. Even if it scratches and bites, it cute. Want to pet and scritch its floof. It cuuuuuuuuuuuuute :3I absolutely adore this anime. The unique animation, the realistic yet super cute-looking cat, the typical things cats do. I love it. My only gripe is that the sketches are just a little too short and the theme song is just a little too long, especially since each episode is two and a half minutes long. But still, even though my gripe over the...length keeps me from rating this as a masterpiece, it's still very good. Plus, I can give the benefit of the doubt, as these episodes probably aired during commercial breaks or something like that.Anyway, if you are a simple man like me and you love kitty, watch it :3 length keeps me from rating this as a masterpiece, it's still very good.

Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou,https://myanimelist.net/anime/31370/Tonkatsu_DJ_Agetarou,"['Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou is my clear choice for underrated anime of this Spring 2016 season, it\'s a shame that few people gave it a try because it\'s a really enjoyable anime.Agetarou works at his family\'s tonkatsu (a Japanese food which consists of a breaded, deep-fried pork cutlet) restaurant, he doesn\'t like it much, but destiny made him discover the disc jockey world, and, for his surprise, he realizes more and more every episode how similar is cooking and working in a tonkatsu restaurant to being a DJ in the details about them.Something that I really like about this anime is the ""bro"" feeling it has,...everyone is just so cool to the others and there is little to no drama, when Agetarou fails, he won\'t go in a neverending despair, nor blame anyone for his mistakes, he accepts it and looks for a way to improve, and, with the help of the great and likeable cast of side characters, he always comes back and shows what he learned, this makes for a really entertaining and positive experience every episode in his way to become the best disc jockey.The art may look ugly, and it arguably is, but it just fits the series so well that can\'t be complained about, the sound part is amazing, I find myself moving to the rhythm of the music every episode thanks to the catchy themes this anime has.Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou is an anime that totally deserves a watch and if you\'re looking for a feel good experience with lots of fun and cool characters, this anime is just for you. everyone is just so cool to the others and there is little to no drama, when Agetarou fails, he won\'t go in a neverending despair, nor blame anyone for his mistakes, he accepts it and looks for a way to improve, and, with the help of the great and likeable cast of side characters, he always comes back and shows what he learned, this makes for a really entertaining and positive experience every episode in his way to become the best disc jockey.The art may look ugly, and it arguably is, but it just fits the series so well that can\'t be complained about, the sound part is amazing, I find myself moving to the rhythm of the music every episode thanks to the catchy themes this anime has.Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou is an anime that totally deserves a watch and if you\'re looking for a feel good experience with lots of fun and cool characters, this anime is just for you.', 'You see all sorts of musicians in anime - jazz, rock, death metal, classical, pop... But until now there has not been, to my knowledge, an anime series devoted to electronic music. Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou has righted that wrong at last and put electronic music in the spotlight where it deserves to be. As a fan of electronic music, I really cannot begin to express how much I enjoyed the series.It takes electronic music seriously, it shows both the artistic and the scientific side of it. Being a DJ requires vast knowledge about different types of music, the ability to imagine how various tracks can...be put together and the technical skills to operate the equipment. But this anime also shows one of the main aspects of electronic music - its creativity. Anything can become rhythm and melody, from the pitter-patter of raindrops to the sizzle of oil in the fryer. Music is everywhere, but it takes a talented person to discover it, and Agetarou is just that person.His wonder at discovering the DJing world is infectious, you cannot help but root for him, because he goes through things most people understand - chasing his dream, learning things about the world, trying to connect with people... The anime has a rather accurate depiction of the path of a young DJ, including the difficulties he faces and the obstacles he has to overcome, including stage fright, inexperience and envious rivals.The art differs very much from the moe aesthetics and does not have and 3D, so it might take some time to get used to it for some people, but I personally found that the rather simplistic art style often reminds of graffiti, contributing to that feel of night clubs and underground parties.  The music is on point, some of those songs will stay in your head for a long time.  The series has quite a bit of humour too, just take a look at those character names - Big Master Fry, DJ Oily, there is definitely a theme there.And I really like how despite tackling serious themes with accuracy, the anime stays light-hearted and has a general feel-good atmosphere. Agetarou has good friends and a nice family and is surrounded by helpful people, and is himself an overall nice guy, and at times it really brought tears to my eyes when his music once again showed the best in people and united everyone.All in all, this anime is a must-see for any fan of electronic music. And if you are not a fan, you should still give it a try, maybe it will change your perspective on this type of music! Good chill. be put together and the technical skills to operate the equipment.

Good chill.', 'Imagine having to succeed the family food business without the motivation to cook anything. What would you do in this situation? For the mischievous Agetarou Katsumata, the answer is clear: become a professional DJ, and show the world how mixing electronic music can make you a better chef!Anime has essentially covered every music genre—rock, pop, and even hip-hop—but electronic music is a first for the medium. As its likely pioneer for anime, Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou does well in presenting the life of a rising DJ star through an expert lens. While Agetarou fights his way to the top, we see the ambition, creativity, and...technical knowledge needed to succeed in the professional world of DJ’ing. Becoming a DJ comes with the spectacular club life, dancing girls, and addictive fame, but none of that will last if Agetarou refuses to work and learn. It’s not easy reaching stardom when nervous breakdowns and vicious adversaries hinder your goal, but even with all the obstacles getting in Agetarou’s way, the bright young lad seldom fails to think of a Plan B. His street smarts and social skills make him one of the most entertaining leads in recent memory.For its main appeal, Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou splits its focus between our protagonist’s night life and his daily errands as the successor of his family’s tonkatsu shop. With his obnoxious father egging him 24/7 to learn the art of tonkatsu preparation, Agetarou must find a way to ease the burden of his responsibilities. And so he does—by becoming a professional DJ! Although its synopsis illustrates the show as the biography of a rising electronic music artist, the gist of the story is an analysis on the similarities between disk jockeying and preparing tonkatsu. The sound of meat searing in the fryer; the tapping of the spatula; and the rhythm of the knives: these kitchen procedures are skills that are comparable to the art of disc-scratching and record-mixing. Whereas Agetarou rejects the idea of becoming a chef at first, his realization that his talents in the kitchen and dance floor intertwined with each other leads him into a journey to master both disciplines. With an equal perspective on both sides of Agetarou’s dynamic life, Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou feels like a refreshing mix of comedy, music, and a little bit of shounen.Agetarou and his dual life is certainly fascinating, but Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou wouldn’t have half of its charm without its great side characters. Agetarou’s eccentric family are the first supporting cast members to hit the screen—and boy are they a riot! We have our hero’s dad who can’t give him a break and his little sister who fears for his future love life. During times of trouble, Agetarou consults his neighborhood friends—a gang of unruly youngsters—for some farfetched advice. By far the most memorable side character though is the peculiar Iori Oiri, known better by his stage name “DJ Oily.” Other than Agetarou himself, DJ Oily is the most important character of the show. Not only is he responsible for the boy’s character development, but he is also the wittiest mentor figure you’ll ever meet. It’s hard not to chuckle when the experienced DJ teaches Agetarou his tricks of the trade that are useless, irrelevant, or even downright illegal.The incredibly catchy soundtrack is another main draw of Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou. From the smooth beats of “Cold Chillin’” to the calming rhythms of “Rainy Lenny,” the music collection is nothing short of impressive. I often find myself bobbing my head whenever Agetarou mixes one of his tracks. The type of electronic music in this show is unlike that by contemporary DJ’s such as Tiesto or Avicii; rather, the tracks resemble the old-school grooves of Fatboy Slim and Daft Punk. Whether you’re an electronic music buff or a casual listener, you’ll likely surf for the name of these tracks online after each episode. Be sure to watch with headphones for the full experience!Sadly, Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou will likely remain under the radar because of its controversial artstyle. Instead of cute girls and handsome men, we get a cast that looks like the Japanese version of Beavis and Butthead. The color palette for the show is very murky, and the wonky animation clearly identifies it as a budget project. For the majority, such a noticeable departure from this generation’s artstyle is enough to draw their attention elsewhere. However, a few episodes in will reveal that all of this is done purposely. For a show bearing the premise of a western adult cartoon, it makes sense that the visuals must go with the flow. Some will accuse the studio of being cheap—a claim that is simply untrue. As you go deeper into Agetarou’s story, you’ll realize that the visuals fit the show like a perfect pair of jeans.Although Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou starts off on a high note, the show’s entertainment value steadily wears down during the second half. Instead of the usual episodes revolving around Agetarou and the challenges he faces as a rising DJ, the story turns into a slice-of-life comedy that feels like filler. For a show comprising twelve episodes with a runtime of only ten minutes each, it’s quite surprising that a drastic change in direction exists. This is not a problem for those who watch Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou mainly for the comedy, but it feels like such a waste since the growth of Agetarou is a prominent aspect of the show. Because of the show’s identity crisis, the ending suffers from a feeling of incompletion.Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou is a refreshing attempt to introduce anime fans to the world of electronic music. The show not only contains a good balance of humor and charm to support its captivating character-driven story, but it also presents a strong moral that stresses the importance of personal dreams and family responsibilities. Though the show suffers from a weak second half and finale, its witty cast and catchy soundtrack carries the story well enough until the end. technical knowledge needed to succeed in the professional world of DJ’ing.

But outside of Japan, the word typically refers to any and all Japanese animation. Of course, there is a typical ""anime art style"" that comes to mind when thinking about contemporary Japanese animation. This style (realistic body proportions, colorful hair, thin outlines, large eyes, etc.) comes to mind because, arguably, it is used in almost all modern anime. This has sometimes led to some Western, non-Japanese works (Teen Titans, Avatar: The Last Airbender) to be described as ""looking like anime."" But, how can anything ""look like anime"" if...anime is, by definition, any animation? Now, let\'s not turn this review into a discussion on the semantics of the word ""anime."" Let\'s simply go with the latter definition: any and all Japanese animation.Still, anime is not limited to a specific art style. That is important to remember, because when shows like Ping Pong: The Animation or Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou pop up every now and again, some people tend to be a bit taken aback by the atypical art and animation style. People have become so used to the usual style of anime art and animation that they may immediately dismiss a show like this. But to me, this show is breath of fresh air. ""Refreshing"" is the word that best describes this show to me. I actually look forward to shows with unorthodox animation and art styles such as these. They are a treat to watch, not because I am necessarily tired of the ""typical"" anime art style, but the uniqueness of these shows keep things fresh. In a sea of anime shows that have not only the same art style, but often the same interchangeable characters, tropes, and settings, anime like these tend to stand out a lot for me.But not only is it Tonkatsu DJ\'s minimal and cartoony art style (which I personally love) that makes it stand out. The anime has an incredibly fast pace, probably due to the fact that is a short based on a gag manga. This keeps things quite upbeat and essentially makes it impossible to get bored. The subject matter is also fresh. This is the first DJ anime I\'ve seen, and I certainly hope it won\'t be the last. Most music anime nowadays tend to be about generic idol groups, so something as niche as DJing is incredibly welcomed. The references to club and DJ culture are also greatly appreciated. If you are one of those anime fans that leave the house, you may also notice that some of the characters actually have relevant designs and fashions. Some of the OST is great, and you can tell there was genuine effort put into it. I could imagine turntablists legitimately scratching to some of the beats on there. Cold Chillin\' is some quality stuff, and Rainy Lenny actually sounds like a rare groove! However,  I would like to say, Tonkatsu DJ does not have the most impressive animation. Though the fast pace sort of compensates for it, there is a lot of repetition and not much fluid movement. You can tell this thing was done on a budget. But I have to applaud the people involved for the final product despite any monetary limitations. Shows like these are what keep me interested in Japanese animation. anime is, by definition, any animation? Now, let\'s not turn this review into a discussion on the semantics of the word ""anime.""

If you like music, you will love this show!  I got some avantree blue-tooth over-ear headphones right before I started watching this (nothing crazy, just a 50 dollar pair).The tunes are great, the atmosphere is fantastic, and the story keeps you wanting more.  Originality is oozing from this one!  I went in with an open-mind, because the animation is different, but that turned out to be one of the beauties about this hidden gem!  It is similar to the style of Ping Pong, and...equally as good (if not better IMO)!I came into this expecting nothing, but every character had their own personality, and own beat to match.  The main character was charismatic; unlike more and more naive and annoying main characters I feel i am subjected regularly with new animes the past few years.  He is flawed, but adapts and learns from his flaws.  People are drawn to him because they see his passion for DJing.This is the sleeper of the year, and I am very upset that it is so short.  The music is excellent and the atmosphere is great.

When I was in Japan last summer I saw Tonkatsu DJ Agetarou merch everywhere.Each episode is about 9 minutes, and follows Agetarou\'s rising career in DJing as he works in his family\'s Tonkatsu restaurant and seeks to master both skills.It\'s something of a teaching anime, where you\'ll learn about the craft if DJing and of tonkatsu if you aren\'t familiar with already.The energy and vibes...are so good, and it doesn\'t need any added drama to make it engaging. The characters are cute and fun and kind to each other. The representation of ""DJ Master Fry"" is hilarious. I only wish there was more music to add to what\'s there.From my own scoring system:2/3 for characters and relationships (the focus is not on relationships)3/3 for content (kind of plot kind of not)3/3 for formal elements (the show is stylized just right)1/1 for my special award because everyone is so chill are so good, and it doesn\'t need any added drama to make it engaging.

I'm sure it flew under the radar for many reason. The art, the story, the quirky nature of it all.Those are the exact things that make this show that great.The art is scrappy, fitting of it's subject matter which deals with djing and club culture. Also all of the episodes are shorter than most so it is kind of refreshing to see this as a show that was slapped together. It feels really raw and it hits all the necessary points in the right way.Watching Agetarou become a DJ...over the season was a triumph in itself.

Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou: Quiet Country Cafe,https://myanimelist.net/anime/976/Yokohama_Kaidashi_Kikou__Quiet_Country_Cafe,"[""Skip these, definitely watch the first OVA set.The second set of YKK OVAs is significantly not as good as the first. Main reason: the dystopian elements of the world were absent. Here's this beautiful, water-covered world, and they mostly only show parts that may as well be current-day Japan. The art is just bog-standard and sub-par. There's nothing you haven't seen 100 times before and drawn better elsewhere.Also, there's the lingering ass shots. They even introduce Misago in the second half of the second of two OVAs, just so the show can have some boobs. She has no lines, interacts with no-one, and the only...acknowledgement of her existence is a random line from other characters. I don't know whose idea it was to frame so many shots as potential fanservice, but they fundamentally didn't understand what YKK was about. acknowledgement of her existence is a random line from other characters. I don't know whose idea it was to frame so many shots as potential fanservice, but they fundamentally didn't understand what YKK was about."", ""Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou: Quiet Country Cafe (or just Quiet Country Cafe) is a sequel to Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou and an OVA adaptation of the manga of the same name. Having been made four years later, in 2002, and by a different studio (SME Animation Works, which would later become Aniplex), there are quite a few noticeable differences between the two OVAs as well as from the original manga source material.Story: 9 (Great)The story doesn't necessarily pick up from the previous OVA, and can stand alone on its own without having watched the other OVA before hand.Alpha Hatusueno is a very human-like robot in the form...of a young woman, who has befriended Kokone, another female robot much like her. Alpha runs a cafe on the outskirts of a Yokohama devastated by rising water levels as she waits for the return of her never-see owner; however, a strong typhoon approaches, and threatens to wipe the cafe off the map. Her human friend Ojisan comes to &quot;rescue&quot; her and wish her away to his gas station which can weather the storm better, but Alpha is still left to worry about the future of the cafe and of herself.After the typhoon, Alpha decides that it's time to leave Yokohama and explore what the world beyond has to offer. In her absence, some of her friends will move on and explore the world in their own ways, while others will not be so willing to let go and explore Alpha's world in her absence.The first episode corresponds to Chapter 62 Typhoon and Chapter 63 My Place in the manga, while the second episode is a massive condensation of what some fans like to refer to as the Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou (or Yokohama Shopping Log) arc, comprising the next 15 chapters, with more focus being given on some chapters than other (some chapters are compressed to just a few seconds). The second OVA also adds details not present in the manga - for example, focus is added to Kokone's relationship with Alpha, arguably changing the nature of that relationship in the process. The OVA also seems to suppose that the Misago is an Alpha-type robot, a notion Ayase shot down in the manga, plays up some of the dynamics between Takahiro and Makki (a welcome change) and other subtle changes YKK fans might be able to catch.The remaining things the OVA changes from the manga in regards to story are generally done very well. Through the dynamic subtleties and nuances added through animation, the characters and story flow are able to expand and show additional depth. Though the story does suffer from the massive compression, like the OVA before it brings to life the story of Alpha's journey.Speaking of which, Alpha's journey is given subtle yet significant changes as well. The manga presented it mostly as an exploration of Alpha's world through her eyes, but the OVA's presentation is set up more for exploring Alpha herself with her world as a backdrop (perhaps to compensate for the compressed time in which to characterize her). Personally, I actually like the OVA's presentation better in this regard, since Alpha herself is one of the reasons why I was drawn to the manga in the first place and why I find it so endearing.Also, +1, yay, overtly lesbian Kokone ;) Also, boo, -1 for seeing Alpha using the restroom :pFun fact: Persimmons never grow to be that size, which, at best, are only able to grow to about the size of a grapefruit and are normally the size of tomatoes. YKK fans who have read chapters taking place after this would probably consider it an interesting clue as to some of the events responsible for Yokohama's devastation in the unseen past.Art: 9 (Great)In my opinion, the art doesn't quite match up with the manga and is even a slight retrograde from the previous OVA (despite being done four years later and by the predecessor of Aniplex, who would later be attached to such groundbreaking projects and personal favorites as FullMetal Alchemist and my favorite anime of all, Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann. The character designs are especially noticeable; don't get me wrong, they're still great, but somehow they strike me as being more &quot;generic&quot; compared to the manga. Not to mention, once again, for some reason, the colors still seemed washed out.The scenery and backgrounds do get some improvement and benefit from the digital art technology that was becoming more in-vogue and mainstream in 2002. It really is something to see these locales come to life, to the delight of any YKK fan.Sound: 10 (Outstanding)The sound is pretty much unchanged from the first OVA, including the soothing, calm gekkin music. We're also treated to a new ED song, Furawura, Furawura (Wandering, Wandering which is just an amazing musical piece, and definitely worth sticking around for (not to mention the story continues after the ED, and even incorporates the ED into the storytelling). It is a rather saccharine scene to watch Alpha review her memories as the song plays.Character: 9 (Great)The characterization is overall great, and overall benefits from the transition to animation as with the previous OVA, but at the same time this OVA takes liberties to change perhaps the one key relationship in the entire manga. Particularly, the OVA goes out of its way to change the nature of Kokone and her relationship with Alpha; in the manga, for example, the relationship is presented in a rather neutral manner, allowing the readers to make up their minds on their own and fill in the details. There's an in-joke within the YKK fanbase that Kokone is a raging lesbian who has a hard-on obsession stalking Alpha, but for the most part their relationship is just presented as being on some level above a regular friendship. This OVA, on the other hand, takes the &quot;raging lesbian&quot; in-joke perhaps a little too seriously for some YKK fans to swallow - Kokone goes so far as to fondle sleeping Alpha's breasts in the opening of the first episode, and in the second episode appears to be having a little too much fun and anxiety (and perhaps even obsession) being in Alpha's room.Alpha, on the other hand, is treated with more respect, and we gain a true sense of intimacy with the character (the good kind, for us, not the kind Kokone apparently wants). The viewers really do begin to feel what kind of person Alpha is, what brings excitement to her life, what her hopes and anxieties are, and some of the loneliness and nostalgia she begins to feel as she decides its finally time to head home. Once again, the animation, for the most part, uses the new medium to its advantage to add and intensify the characters through movement and voice.Enjoyment: 10 (Outstanding)Quiet Country Cafe isn't perfect; it isn't a perfect transition to animation and it's not even quite as good as its predecessor, but we're still treated to more of what many YKK fans have been wanting since the end of the manga: more of Alpha and getting to know her rich character in greater depth. Whether or not you'll enjoy the somewhat re-imagined characterization of Kokone or the attempt to compress 15 chapters into 30 minutes, you'll still come away with a great feeling of warmth and satisfaction from what this OVA has to deliver.Final score for Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou: Quiet Country Cafe:9: Great of a young woman, who has befriended Kokone, another female robot much like her.

Absolutely stunning environments and great character movements almost brings it alive in front of me, and somehow I wish that I was able to jump into the screen and just be lying there on the grassfield and watch up on the blue sky, counting the white clouds that move by.Just like the prequel, this is just the right anime to watch when you want to relax and get the pulse down. Accompanied with a hot cup of coff&eacute;e you are definitely on the right track! ', ""I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this after watching the first one. The animation in this outdid the other. The backgrounds were absolutely gorgeous; the swaying of grass, the smooth water, trickling waterfalls were all animated beautifully. The characters were nicely rendered as well.Like the OVA prior, it is again completely relaxing and pleasing to the eye. Nothing much happens as well, except for through the everyday life of Alpha a typhoon hits and she decided to move out of the comfort of her abode and explores more of the world. Now after watching this I want to go read some more of...the manga. Even though I find the manga bit better, now I  see that such a nice feeling doesn&rsquo;t come off as well from paper and ink. The animation is just too beautiful in this&hellip; it&rsquo;s certainly Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou&rsquo;s best aspect.The sound is nice, too. I like the background music especially. It reminds me of a barbeque... don't ask me why.. maybe it's because it reminds me of music we'd play on the records when we'd have a barbeque. (That makes me sound old but actually I'm still of adolescence XD).I think I still like the old OVA better. The second one&rsquo;s animation is much better, but I like the way the characters come off as in the first, and what happens, for some reason. Not so sure why myself. Anyway, if you want something nice to watch, if you&rsquo;ve had it with violent shows, or you just had a bad day and need some relaxing time, this is the anime to see. the manga.

Despite how effortless it may look with the natural flow of curvy lines his pen traces, you could very well see the thought put into every bit of detail within a single panel or illustration. The second OVA, Quiet Country Cafe, may not have consideration of how important these factors are into exhibiting the transient effect of the manga, and the end result is something that falls below average...than what the source material has much to offer.Being two episodes adapting several chapters from the manga, it aims to have a theme about Alpha temporarily leaving the cafe after it being swept up by a large typhoon, albeit the other chapters that were adapted doesn’t really bear any connection to this beginning-and-end motif. The Misago even appears briefly with regards to a segment adapting Takahiro’s perspective, yet with no relevance whatsoever. In this mishmash of random chapters being adapted it sadly takes away the fact that no matter how slow or lacking in story YKK is, it has a clear direction with each chapter meant to complement the other, yet standalone in its own right. It may have to do with this OVA consisting of simply 2 episodes, but the previous OVA also had the same amount but is structured and executed better according to its themes—a presentation of what Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou is. Quiet Country Cafe lacks none of these, making up a messy, out-of-context set of stories.With a watercolor palette, the background art of Quiet Country Cafe is remarkable, blending well with the relaxing atmosphere accompanied by the Choro Club’s very playful pieces. The distinctiveness of the music plus the softly-colored set pieces within this OVA may as well be an unforgettable combination of audiovisual stimulation...if not for the lacking animation direction and jarring character models. Ashinano’s character designs, specifically his female protagonists definitely live by curvy—from the body to the face to the eyes—but the OVA takes it too far. Alpha looks like a blob, with neon green hair that is not even remotely close to her manga shade of green. In addition, the animation goes for some sneaky fanservice shots here and there, which would be fine in a normal anime, but this is supposed to be Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou—a work void with these elements. It takes away the wistfulness of the passage of time and distracts you with primal instincts. I do not discredit fanservice, but there are times when something needs to be put in its place, and it absolutely does not belong here.The true saving grace of this OVA lies in its soundtrack—as mentioned, with the Choro Club’s anime debut, their rendition of Cafe Alpha and several entries to mix along with the environment establishes the atmospheric mood it’s aiming for. It may be arguable on which of the two soundtracks between the first and second OVA stands out, but it’s undeniable how both have contributed to the simple and laid-back feel in the animation. As for personal preference, Choro Club’s depiction of Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou sounds a bit too similar to their work in the Aria series, which is why comparisons between two iyashikei works abound more. Another thing worth praising about Quiet Country Cafe is Hekiru Shiina’s reprisal of Alpha, which I believe did a fantastic job of portraying her—cheerful, yet also composed. Much of the voice cast did their characters some justice, although not to the same level Shiina has managed to justify Alpha.Quiet Country Cafe may not be a wholesome successor to the first OVA, but in its portrayal of what composes the source material is remarkable. There may not be much to gain from this series in terms of technical and artistic prowess, but if you love the manga, it is more than enough reason to give it a try. than what the source material has much to offer.Being two episodes adapting several chapters from the manga, it aims to have a theme about Alpha temporarily leaving the cafe after it being swept up by a large typhoon, albeit the other chapters that were adapted doesn’t really bear any connection to this beginning-and-end motif.

I've read the manga, and I'd give it a 10 any day (this may be a sort of bias). I also liked the first set of OVAs, but haven't watched recently enough to say much about them. I immediately noticed that the animation in this set seemed more crisp, and was optimistic. I didn't remember the specific sequence of alpha and kokone riding their bikes from the manga, and was put off when kokone grabbed alphas boob(?).The pacing was ridiculously slow. The still shots and pans of nature, while pretty, made me feel like I was watching...a manga. I'm not inherently opposed to a lack of dialogue, but the silence wasn't really used to do anything. A short chapter or two from the manga were stretched out to fit the form of a thirty minute OVA, and it really showed.The lack of source material was compensated for with several original shots, many of which focus on Alpha's figure. I get the notion that (although I have no knowledge of the original OST's commercial success) the studio saw a seemingly dull, conflictless OVA sell, and assumed that it sold because of its characters sex appeal.I've heard some people complain about the music, but I like it for the most part. There is a certain scene when a song playing from the radio seems too loud, and it took me out of the experience.This certainly wasn't horrible, and I wouldn't say it was a waste of time to watch. It is still calming and easy on the ears. The second episode is definitely less slow than the first. I would strongly recommend reading the manga before watching these. a manga.

I would strongly recommend reading the manga before watching these."", ""(Review originally from Letterboxd)From the director of the criminally underrated coming-of-age nostalgia piece Ocean Waves comes a full-on animated tone poem about a young woman living a quiet life in a quasi-post-apocalypse.To say that Quiet Country Cafe is understated would be itself an understatement. The dialogue is sparse, the story can be summarized in two sentences, and the worldbuilding is so vague that the sci-fi elements could be completely missed if not for one specific scene. It's all about the mood, and it works marvelously at evoking that tranquil feeling, warm yet tinged with an inner core of sadness.Exploring the world, hearing the wonderful soundtrack...play out, watching protagonist Alpha see new things and figure out what she wants with her life... it's nothing new or revelatory, but it still left lingering feelings of-- something-- inside me long after the credits rolled (with a lovely ending theme song too).Unfortunately, the entire production is marred by the major factor that the animation budget is just too small, and the story is cut a little bit short for what it seemed to be aiming for. It's a two-episode OVA, so even with the ending theme songs added in, it's barely seventy minutes in total, just over the edge to be a feature film. It felt like it really wanted to go further, and I imagine there is probably a manga version of this story that goes on much further anyway. I didn't want it to end! And, sadly, because of the budgetary limitations, a lot of the beauty isn't that well-captured; the animation just isn't good enough to compensate for the scope.Also, it's mostly in the first half of the first episode, but there's a lot of creepy pervy camera angles and pans that made me uncomfortable; they were completely out of place and really detracted from the tone poem feeling of the rest of the movie. Please don't do this, animation directors.If you like quiet, country, and coffee, look no further than this movie here. It's short and beautiful even if it doesn't reach the fullest of its potential.Honestly, I'd like to see this remade somehow, either in a feature film adaptation or a live-action adaptation from Korea/Taiwan or from an indie director in the U.S., or maybe even a video game? It's definitely the kind of story that would translate very well to other mediums and other styles of storytelling. play out, watching protagonist Alpha see new things and figure out what she wants with her life... it's nothing new or revelatory, but it still left lingering feelings of-- something-- inside me long after the credits rolled (with a lovely ending theme song too).Unfortunately, the entire production is marred by the major factor that the animation budget is just too small, and the story is cut a little bit short for what it seemed to be aiming for.

We see that Alpha has moved on in search of experiences and her personality and emotions grow. It seems that in order to make this move and discover life, she needed a push. Through this transformation and symbolic destruction of her previous life, we experience new emotions with her;...worry, fear and optimism.I still enjoyed the art, much like I did in YKK. It felt like an 80’s anime much of the time, despite being released in the early 00’s. I was given some satisfaction from slight use of richer colors compared to YKK, but would've liked to see more. Sadly, YKK:QCC seems to have abandoned the world detail and lighting that made YKK so unique. The art is overall slightly worse, andtwith the loss of the detail and lighting, I can’t rate it as high as the first part.Sound is great throughout the OVAs. Acting is well done (Japanese) and the music branches out into bossa nova and some classical while still retaining smooth jazz. In my opinion the music remains a perfect compliment for this slice-of-life show. The music was much more plentiful and enjoyable compared to the first OVAs and I will likely be adding some to my relaxing playlist on Spotify.In my review of YKK, I talked about my concept of “surface characters.” This idea carries along to many of the characters again. In reality, this remains something that is not bothersome as the story really revolves around Alpha learning the meaning of life. Speaking of which, her growth is much more apparent and enjoyable in the second part, making the second set of OVAs more agreeable. Although the storyline continues to move slowly, it doesn’t feel nearly as slow as YKK due to this aspect.So why did I get more enjoyment out of YKK:QCC versus the original, YKK? I’m sure partially because I was a little more prepared with what to expect going in. More than that however, is that the use of additional music and a more complete feeling of growth in Alpha makes the second part more tolerable. The situations are much more interesting and even the minute long scenes of her enjoying a moment feel more relaxing to watch.So would I recommend this anime? Yes, still with, but slightly less, reservations than YKK. You’re treated to better relaxing music. Well drawn scenes are still present, although not as good or detailed as the first two OVAs. The storyline moves a bit faster, making it more tolerable and the story feels much more optimistic about the future. Most of this makes YKK:QCC slightly better than the first part in my opinion and worth a watch if you're looking for a slice-of-life anime. worry, fear and optimism.I still enjoyed the art, much like I did in YKK. It felt like an 80’s anime much of the time, despite being released in the early 00’s. I was given some satisfaction from slight use of richer colors compared to YKK, but would've liked to see more. Sadly, YKK:QCC seems to have abandoned the world detail and lighting that made YKK so unique. The art is overall slightly worse, andtwith the loss of the detail and lighting, I can’t rate it as high as the first part.Sound is great throughout the OVAs. Acting is well done (Japanese) and the music branches out into bossa nova and some classical while still retaining smooth jazz. In my opinion the music remains a perfect compliment for this slice-of-life show.

Also I haven't read the manga so my perspective on this is informed on the 1998 show.Quiet Country Cafe, while it isn't bad at all, lacks a lot of the qualities that made the original OVA charming, I would only recommend watching this if you really loved the first YKK OVA and want to see more. As someone who has neither seen nor heard of YKK, when I watched the 1998 OVA I was absolutely blown away by the breathtaking landscapes, wonderful (yet sparse) soundtrack, and...overall uniqueness found in nearly every aspect of the show. It was a melancholic, yet hopeful, slice-of-life about a young woman living in the final age of humanity, spending much of her time learning what it means to be alive in a world that has grinded to a halt. Alpha's internal monologues and meaningful conversations with the very small cast really helped me understand the kind of loneliness that would pervade a time like this, and helped me understand how to properly live with oneself when there isn't anyone else around. Quiet Country Cafe, while certainly having its moments, didn't provide nearly the same experience for me.For starters, while I still thought that the landscapes of the series were amazing (the final shot of Mt.Fuji without any snow on it was so beautiful and sad), they had a lot less definition and suffered from that issue a lot of 2000s anime have where the colors just aren't very vivid and nothing draws your eye, which I felt really did a disservice to a series that I feel focused primarily on the visuals of a world almost entirely abandoned or underwater. As a matter of fact, the characters felt really blah too; Alpha's model was completely recolored to be less vivid and at times was strikingly devoid of any kind of shading or details, as were the rest of the cast.Additionally, I felt that the art was indicative of a shift in tone for the overall show; it lacked the contemplative nature of the 1998 OVA, swapping silent scenes meant to emphasize the emptiness and beauty in Alpha's life with music that felt almost omnipresent and was really lighthearted in comparison to the former OVA (it was still really good music tho). The silence wasn't just broken by the music, either, as Quiet Country Cafe seemed to revolve around the much more cohesive story of Alpha trying to repair her broken cafe and find herself while doing it. It lacks the leisurely pace of the former by focusing primarily on what's HAPPENING to Alpha or what she plans on doing next, all the while barely providing us a way to relate to her and take in the world she inhabits.This brings me to the main problem of this OVA: it isn't really thoughtful. The main draw of the former OVA was its ability to let us dwell on the state of the world *with Alpha*, as most scenes are taken up by at least a third of silence, allowing us to empathize with the meaninglessness and emptiness of Alpha's life as well as the beauty and danger presented in the outside world. Instead, a lot of Quiet Country Cafe focuses on the actions and much more frequent dialogue of the characters as music plays in the background, while the few moments of silence are less contemplative and more...well, boring. That's another issue plaguing Quiet Country Cafe: it somehow has a faster pace and more of a story than the former OVA, but it's way more boring. To add insult to injury, the few (incredibly boring) moments of silence and calm also often happen in tandem with weird fanservice shots that just blatantly ruin any kind of serious or melancholic tone the show had left; like i dont want to be staring at Alpha's ass, that's not even close to why I, or really anybody, would be watching the show. It was so weird and jarring to see characters that were previously not sexualized be subject to so many fanservice shots out of nowhere, especially when they introduce one character with her boobs out, who says nothing and never reappears. Going off of that, the introduction of Takahiro, Matsuki, and Misago's storyline made zero sense, as it never went anywhere despite implying that there was more to the story, making their whole experience seem like it needed wrapping up.Anyway, I was really disappointed by Quiet Country Cafe, which is a shame because I really loved the 1998 OVA dearly, but that's not to say it was bad. I think it was still a pleasant show that hasn't completely forgotten that the point of the story is about living with yourself and being ok with loneliness. It certainly has its moments, but I think as a whole, in the 4 years between the creation of these two OVAs, the creators seemed to have lost sight of their original intentions. It just seemed like it lacked a lot of the thoughtfulness and care that I loved so much about the first YKK OVA. overall uniqueness found in nearly every aspect of the show.

Tales of Symphonia The Animation: Sylvarant-hen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1731/Tales_of_Symphonia_The_Animation__Sylvarant-hen,"[""Story:Well, this OVA of course comes from the video game Tales of Symphonia. So, the story is the same, however theres quite a few parts left out. However, I don't think it is quite right to say that just because of that the story isn't that good. This is the animation, not the game. Sure, it's based on it, but it's not gonna be an exact copy of it.It starts really being a kind of 'save the planet' storyline, as a girl who is the Chosen One and her friends set out for a journey to a tower where she'll become an angel and rescue...the planet. However, after Lloyd (the main character) learns something serious about becoming an angel, the story takes a pretty big twist, which it pretty interesting. The OVA ends really like only about half-way through the game, so it does not give you a feeling of closure whatsoever, but that's exactly why more episodes are supposed to be made at a later date.Art:The artwork is similar to the cut scenes from the video game. Which means it's pretty good. Everything is nicely drawn, and the motions are pretty fluent. It's more of a simplistic style, which is actually quite nice.Sound:The voice acting really couldn't have been better. The voices really fit the characters greatly. The background music isn't spectacular, but serves its purpose and is fairly good. The OP, I feel, couldn't have been better for this OVA. It, for some reason, just felt so perfect for the overall mood and tone of the show. The ED is actually a song that Collette, the Chosen One, sings in the series, so I guess it was a nice idea to have it as the ED.Character:The characters are all pretty cool, and each have a different personality, making them very likable. They didn't really get too develop themselves very much, which is unfortunate and disappointing, but I don't think it is fair to degrade the show for that, since it's simply 4 episodes.Enjoyment:Enjoyment would have been a 9 if the battles were better. That's really my biggest disappointment. The fights were very short and curt, and rarely involved a lot of intricacy or really just intensity, especially the battles against the seals. However, despite that, it's still a pretty enjoyable watch since there's a lot of emotion and, well, it's really just fun to follow it along, even if you haven't played the video game. the planet.

She is joined by her friends and they go on the journey for her to become an angel, which she needs to become to save the world. Now, I won't say this OVA won't be enjoyable if you haven't played the game, but you will notice that there are big gaps in time which they are supposed to be filled in in the...game. And if you've played the game, you'll be disappointed only because it has sooo much potential to be a very good anime series, but it cuts short :( Assuming you haven't played the game, there'll be some plot twists, and should keep you interested.Art: If you've played the game, then you've seen the movie cut scenes that show up every now and then, and seeing as how Gainax produced those scenes, it's understandable that it was high end animation. Although Gainax doesn't produce the OVA, the quality stays. The characters are drawn well, and all the animation is smooth.Sound: I assume sound means the soundtrack and voice acting, both of which I felt were okay. I enjoyed the voice acting more than I did the music, mainly because of a very good cast. You'll recognize many of the voices, and I they fit the characters well. The soundtrack wasn't bad, but nothing memorable, personally, i got kind of bored the OP, and ED.Character: The characters never had a chance to progress, mainly because the series was so short. There was some progression, such as with Sheena and Lloyd, and change of character with someone else..., but there wasn't much gradual change. The characters are fun to watch, there are many personalities, serious, nerdy, naive, kind, etc. with all of them complementing each other.Enjoyment: Ever since I played the game a few years ago, I loved the movie cut scenes, and always said that they should make a series just from this, and now that they did, I had to watch. Although it did not nearly meet my expectations, I did enjoy it, in fact it had me wanting much much more. But as a person who has never played, I'd imagine that they would enjoy this series moderately, seeing as they'll obviously notice plot gaps, and a pseudo-ending.Overall: I give this series a 7 mainly because I thought it had an unimaginable amount of potential, but alas, this OVA series seems more like a promotional trailer for the game. And seeing as it is an OVA, it's too short, making the creators progress the story too quickly. I'd recommend anyone to watch this, and it may even make you want to play the game. game.

Now it\'s time to see how hard Tales of Symphonia hurt itself, at least for the first part.The Short Version:(+)The music is delightful.(-)The entire thing feels rushed.(-)The characters aren\'t really fleshed out.(-)You can tell they just want to get past the beginning of the...game in the first episode.(-)The art quality is below average for its timeThe Story (6/10):The story is a simple thing to grasp in this show, one of the main characters is more or less chosen by \'God\' to become the Child of Regeneration and save this world from it\'s own destruction, basic \'Save the world plot\'. But there are points in the story that WILL throw up a ""Dafuq?"" flag in your brain. An early example is what would be the first boss battle in the game, where some ""baddies"" have appeared in the MC\'s village and threaten the populace, the MC and head baddie duke it out, the hero wins, but then the show cuts to the villages salvaging their burnt down houses, this is the point where I thought, ""Hang on, where the fuck did the rest of the baddies go? Did they die? Or did one of them just go, ""Well I\'m going home, whose coming with?"" Then the rest of the lads followed him. There\'re a couple of these moments throughout the OVAs but there\'s not enough of them to leave you questioning the entire show, just a fair amount of it.Another thing with the story is that it horrendously rushed, like someone on the development team just said, ""Ok, I know we need to make this good, but let\'s just get through all of the beginning of the game so we can get to the better stuff A.S.A.P.""

It wasn't the first Tales game to receive an anime adaptation with both Phantasia, which some of you may recall from one of my previous reviews, and Eternia getting adapted before it, but it was the first to have the anime adaptation handled by Ufotable, the same studio responsible for Kara no Kyoukai, Gakuen Utopia Manabi Straight, & Fate/Zero. Yeah, it's a bit strange, but most anime adaptations of the Tales franchise have been handled by different studios. So,...how did Ufotable handle the series?Story:We open with our heroine, Colette, getting ready to undertake a journey of world regeneration to save her dying world. An angel, Remiel, descends to give her instruction and send her on the way. With the aid of her teacher, Refill Sage and a mercenary hired by the church, Kratos Aurion, she heads out on her journey. Colette's friends, Lloyd and Genis, both want to accompany them but are left behind. Until their village is attacked by people who want Lloyd's Exsphere, a mysterious object. At which point they decide to leave for the safety of the village and rendezvous with Colette and the others to aid her in any way they can.So, it's basically the same plot as the beginning of the game. Now, you've probably already noticed the major problem, the pacing is horrendous. All of those significant events I just described are in the first episode with little time between them. Events are thrown at you one after the other with no time to get a good grip on what's happening. The plot points also aren't expounded on very well. If you haven't played the game you will find yourself wondering what just happened on several occasions. Which is why it's probably a bad idea to condense a good third of the narrative of a plot heavy, multi-disc Gamecube game down to a four episode series. Sure, they managed to do it pretty well with the plot of Phantasia but that was a SNES game and much lighter on the plot.In all fairness, the anime does do a decent job of hitting all the major points in the part of the game they cover and the narrative, though rushed and condensed, does still hold up pretty well and has some really strong scenes, albeit somewhat weakened by being rushed through. They also chose a good stopping point considering that they had more OVAs to come.Characters:The OVA has all the characters you see in the series, except significantly less developed since a lot of their conversations and other character scenes get cut. Still, the series has some great characters. Refill, Genis, Sheena, Kratos and Lloyd are all great characters. No, I'm not including Colette. Honestly, she annoys me. She's one of those self sacrificing characters who worries about everyone else and is supposed to be pure and innocent. I've never been a fan of those characters. They just come across as kind of trite and boring to me. It's even worse in the anime version since she doesn't get any of her funny lines from the game.Art:The art is really good. The character designs, action sequences and background details are all really nicely drawn and animated. Really, there's only one complaint I can make about the OVA. The action sequences, though mostly good, have too many blur line scenes. You know the type. Character is shown in an action pose, multi-coloured lines appear behind them and no contact is made between them and the enemy, assuming they even bother showing the character and their enemy in the same frame.Sound:They got some really good actors. Mizuki Nana, Konishi Katsuyuki, Orikasa Ai, Touma Yumi, Okamura Akemi and Tachiki Fumihiko take the roles of our major characters. The music is also really good with Mizuki Nana and Kawai Eri doing lyrical work.Ho-yay:There's not any ho-yay in this. Making the ho-yay factor a 1/10.Final Thoughts:Tales of Symphonia the animation is made for fans of the game. If you're someone who hasn't played it, the pacing is going to leave you confused and without a lot of the context behind events. If you are a fan of the game, you'll probably enjoy it okay as a supplementary work. For myself, I'm giving it a 6/10. It's a decent OVA with some good moments but it definitely suffers from the pacing. Next week I'll take a look at Potemayo. how did Ufotable handle the series?Story:We open with our heroine, Colette, getting ready to undertake a journey of world regeneration to save her dying world. An angel, Remiel, descends to give her instruction and send her on the way. With the aid of her teacher, Refill Sage and a mercenary hired by the church, Kratos Aurion, she heads out on her journey. Colette's friends, Lloyd and Genis, both want to accompany them but are left behind. Until their village is attacked by people who want Lloyd's Exsphere, a mysterious object. At which point they decide to leave for the safety of the village and rendezvous with Colette and the others to aid her in any way they can.So, it's basically the same plot as the beginning of the game. Now, you've probably already noticed the major problem, the pacing is horrendous. All of those significant events I just described are in the first episode with little time between them. Events are thrown at you one after the other with no time to get a good grip on what's happening. The plot points also aren't expounded on very well. If you haven't played the game you will find yourself wondering what just happened on several occasions. Which is why it's probably a bad idea to condense a good third of the narrative of a plot heavy, multi-disc Gamecube game down to a four episode series. Sure, they managed to do it pretty well with the plot of Phantasia but that was a SNES game and much lighter on the plot.In all fairness, the anime does do a decent job of hitting all the major points in the part of the game they cover and the narrative, though rushed and condensed, does still hold up pretty well and has some really strong scenes, albeit somewhat weakened by being rushed through. They also chose a good stopping point considering that they had more OVAs to come.Characters:The OVA has all the characters you see in the series, except significantly less developed since a lot of their conversations and other character scenes get cut. Still, the series has some great characters. Refill, Genis, Sheena, Kratos and Lloyd are all great characters. No, I'm not including Colette. Honestly, she annoys me. She's one of those self sacrificing characters who worries about everyone else and is supposed to be pure and innocent. I've never been a fan of those characters. They just come across as kind of trite and boring to me. It's even worse in the anime version since she doesn't get any of her funny lines from the game.Art:The art is really good. The character designs, action sequences and background details are all really nicely drawn and animated. Really, there's only one complaint I can make about the OVA. The action sequences, though mostly good, have too many blur line scenes. You know the type.

I was excited when the video game I liked so much was becoming an anime. It may not be in the top 100 animes, but it sure wins my heart!Everything in the anime is just like the video game! Same characters, same plot, it does have some differences in the scenes that play out. The characters look the same as they did in the game. The music and sound are great for the anime. However it sucks how the entire story is split into three different animes and is shorten to only...4 episodes in the first two and only 2 in the third one. But I will always love Tales of Symphonia no matter how it's made. 10 out of 10. 4 episodes in the first two and only 2 in the third one.

Thanks for reading.Story ~ 7/10The story is based off the Gamecube/PS2/PS3 game ""Tales of Symphonia"". The story is split into three OVA series. (Tethealla-hen, Sekai Tougou-hen)In the first part, the characters are introduced and the journey begins. In the first part, is is the standard ""Hero on a journey to save the world"".There are quite a few technical terms used that can leave newcomers to the series feeling confused.Additionally, much of the backstory and other scenes are left out, leading...to possible confusion for newcomers.Art ~ 7/10The art is alright, but nothing incredibly amazing.Sound ~ 7/10I can\'t really remember much of the BG music, not memorable at all.However, the OP and ED themes are both excellent. The OP theme may sound like gibberish, but it is probably the \'Angelic\' language mentioned in the game.Characters ~ 8/10The characters from the game are very deep, but not much time is spent developing them in this anime. Also, there is a lot of backstory that isn\'t included and so some aspects may be confusing.Enjoyment ~ 7/10I enjoyed this anime as a companion to the games, but I don\'t feel that it stands very well by itself.Overall ~ 7/10I think that this anime is best for people who have already played the games. With the recent HD re-release for PS3, Tales of Symphonia Chronicles, the game is far more accessible than before.So, I\'d recommend to play the game first, and if you liked the game, then you may also like this anime. to possible confusion for newcomers.Art ~ 7/10The art is alright, but nothing incredibly amazing.Sound ~ 7/10I can\'t really remember much of the BG music, not memorable at all.However, the OP and ED themes are both excellent.

If you are interested, don\'t be shy to check it out! (Link\'s in my bio)Also: I\'ll be posting the same review for all three seasons, since I made a general review for the series, not the seasons in separate.Ok, so if you guys don\'t know, Tales of Symphonia is one of my FAVORITE animes, along with the rest of the Tales of Series. After i finished ToS, me and a friend had found other animes in the series as well, which we both love to death.So my friend said  she found an...old Gamecube game that her father owned called ""Tales of Symphonia."" It was an anime RPG about a girl, Colette, was chosen to be an angel, and the Chosen to regenerate the world. A few days later, I saw she was an anime on YouTube, and it was a good thing a stopped her there, because that was when things got really sad and intense, and she probably wouldn\'t have looked that happy in first period that day. But anyways, we started watching the series from episode 1, and we finished the series in a few weeks time. For a short anime, Tales of Symphonia is a very good anime, that is  really worth watching and re-watching over and over again. I\'ve only watched the series 3 or 4 times, but my friend said she\'s seen it around 30, maybe 40 times.Anyways,  let\'s get started on the review! Hope you all like it!WARNING!  THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!Story: 10/10Ok, so I\'m sorry if I\'m taking this not hard enough, but like I said before, I LOVED this series. It\'s one of those short stories where you rewatch them over and over again. And only for 11 episodes, it surely brings out its potential.Tales of Symphonia takes place in the kingdoms of Sylvarant and Tethe\'alla. where three races of people lived; humans, elves, and half-elves. The half-elves believed  that their race was treated unfairly, and formed a pact, called the Desians. The Desians were defeated long ago by the hero, Mithos, and the goddess Martel, but, over time, their power had weakened, and the Desians has risen once more. Meanwhile, Colette Brunel, a 16-year old high-school girl, has been chosen to become the Chosen Angel of Regeneration. Her friends, Lloyd Irving, Genis and Raine Sage, accompany on her journey of regeneration, only to find that out that her journey was more like a sacrifice, if you know what I mean. Now, the gang must try to get her back, while saving the world from hatred. Recruiting a new team of allys, Lloyd and his friends set off to save Colette. and the rest of the world.Like I said before, this is a beautiful story. I\'m not going to go much into detail, due to some really big and sad spoilers, but it\'s a really good story to the anime, and I definitley give it a 10/10.Art: 10/10Again, I really feel like I\'m being to easy on this anime, it\'s just I love this anime a LOT. The art style is beautiful in this anime. The special effects, the battle scenes, the designs, EVERYTHING. And I gave it a 10 for art, because everything was beautiful. I\'m sorry I\'m giving everything on this a ten, I just really fell in love with this series as a whole, art, characters, everything.Another thing I really like about the art is the character designs. My favorites are paticualry Sheena\'s, Colette\'s, and Presea\'s. They\'re very unique, compared to your typical combat skirt, or suit of armor. Like I said, maybe I\'m being to easy on this anime, maybe I\'m not. But anyways, another 10/10 for the art.Sound: 9/10Ok, I really love the soundtrack to Tales of Symphonia. I have all three theme songs on my iPod and I listen to them ALL the time. It\'s just you don\'t want to listen to some of them too much, especially right after you finished the series. It kinda stirs up some of the sad scenes from the series (*cough cough* DEATHS *cough cough*) My friend says she hardly ever cries, but this was the first anime that was really hard to watch in public. Even so, there are some themes in the ToS soundtrack that make me smile, while others get me teary-eyed. Whether you see that as a good thing or not, I really enjoyed the soundtrack, even though it gets you in tears at times. So basically, I\'m giving it a 9/10, not another 10 suprisingly.Characters: 10/10Okay, so like I said before, I LOVED everything about this anime. The cast is AMAZING. Like, theyre the kind of cast that you grow attached to, no matter what kind of character they are. And by that, I mean your characters can range from the pervy and outgoing Zelos, to the quiet and strong Presea.  And I\'m going to admit, I love each and every one of them. It\'s just one of those animes where I can\'t choose just ONE favorite character. Like, this is one of those animes where you love ALL of the characters. So yeah, basically another 10 for Symphonia.General/Enjoyment: 10/10Yeah, I know, not really a big surprise here. I said this many a time before in this review, I LOVED this anime a lot, and there\'s really no flaws that I saw in it, unlike the past couple of animes I had just given reviews on. And if you\'re like me, and loved the series just as much as me, I\'d reccomend trying the game if you can afford it, as well as others in the series, like Tales of the Abyss, Zestiria, and Vesperia. Yeah, what I\'m trying to get at is that it\'s a really good series, and I think at least everyone should at least try it before they bite it. It has a little of everything for everyone; drama, action, adventure, a little comedy and romance... Yeah. Anyways, yeah, a big One-O goes to this anime, its a great anime, and I highly reccomend it for anyone. old Gamecube game that her father owned called ""Tales of Symphonia.""

Oh boy, am I glad I did! Epic sword fights, a heart-wrenching story and beautifully designed characters in a fantasy setting? Yes please!Tales of Symphonia (as a series of 3 OVA chapters) is very much a story of 'heart',...the belief in oneself and friends against seemingly impossible odds with some amazing plot twists along the way.

I debated on whether or not to play the game before I watched this, but I think I enjoyed watching this first as a primer to what to expect. I was actually really surprised at just how much charm this very short OVA managed to pack in. The animation is cute and gives the cast a lot of character.While to be honest, I couldn\'t tell you what makes these characters more unique than any other RPG save the world party, and there wasn\'t much...time to get to know them, I still found myself loving them so quickly and easily. Their banter and dynamics were well defined, and I think that just goes to show how character-driven the game must be if it\'s coming through this well even in such a short adaptation.I was especially enamored with the relationship between Lloyd and Colette, which seemed a lot stronger than just a simple ""has a crush on each other, wants to protect each other."" There\'s really a foundation of true friendship between them in the easy way they interact, and I found it extremely endearing.I will likely not watch the rest of the OVA sections until after I play the game, but this peek into the world of Symphonia really did whet my appetite for the game, so in that respect, it does its job admirably. time to get to know them, I still found myself loving them so quickly and easily.

The ""Tales"" series has been very dear to my heart since my childhood. Yes, it is near impossible to fit all of a 80+ hour game into a short list of OVAs. However, just based of the nostalgia factor and the content alone that makes Tales of Symphonia a success makes this anime worth a shot. The character development and storyline of this game is what makes it great....You can feel a connection to each character individually. You are able to feel the love between Colette and Lloyd from the very beginning and watch it blossom overtime. Each character has their own story and reason for what they do and I think the anime does its best to capture that. Once again, it is extremely difficult to place EVERYTHING within the game into an anime. The same can be said for any movie/tv show adaptation such as Harry Potter. There will always be those that complain about some part not being featured. Despite this, I still suggest you give this show a chance, it surely deserves it.

Vampire in the Garden,https://myanimelist.net/anime/39518/Vampire_in_the_Garden,"['Humans and vampires, stories of folklores that bend and twist the mind in an never-ending sea of timeless fictional pieces of war. And Wit Studio\'s next venture into the Netflix anime catalogue with Vampire in the Garden, much to say that it was less hyped than the ""Bubble"" movie that came out last month (which honestly was very mid), I have to say that I felt awfully cathartic and incapacitated with feelings and emotions that are truly deserving of the NC16 rating that this has. And as much as the whole series felt depressing, it was very depressingly good to say the least.Vampire in the...Garden tells the story of 2 girls: the regular Momo Warm working in an industrial military city whose passion riles up from saving a young vampire whom has a music box of a tune that sounds its resonance, and that young vampire Fine whom other than being the queen of the vampires, desires a life led with humans to be loved, one that\'s once relived from her past memories, only to see it birth a war between mankind and vampires to the stage it was today. Both girls want out of their oppressive lifestyle and desire to find a paradise of their own where human and vampire can peacefully coexist, otherwise seen as betrayers of their own kind to find an ""Eden"" that doesn\'t exist. It\'s of no surprise to cast Megumi Han and Yuu Kobayashi as both Momo and Fine as the centerpiece of this series, and for all intensive purposes, their performances lend great aid to reflecting the series as a whole: the two outliers whom just want peace out of seclusion, fighting through every situation and not giving up on each other when the going gets tough, even at death\'s row.Unsurprisingly, this is what I would expect of Wit Studio\'s production, this being produced by Wit Studio and Production I.G. co-founder-cum-producer Tetsuya Nakatake, director Ryoutarou Makihara (whom hasn\'t directed anything since Shisha no Teikoku, a movie released in 2015) with assistant Hiroyuki Tanaka (who used to help direct Attack on Titan when it was produced at Wit Studio), music director Yoshihiro Ike (of Takt Op. Destiny and Dororo fame) and Tetsuya Nishio in both character design and being the chief animation director. Speaking of the character design, there is one person whom looks almost like Jiraiya from Naruto, and that\'s because Tetsuya Nishio is the original character designer of the TV series, so you know that this man is a god amongst men. This series being mostly centered in around arctic and industrial areas, gives me a mix of Attack on Titan and Vinland Saga vibes, to which if you\'ve ever watched those series, you\'ll know what I mean.It\'s genuine that I say that after the somewhat failure of the movie Bubble, Vampire in the Garden is what I truly hope that ONA stories like this capped within 2 hours plus can become: an engaging story that does not feel too short nor too long, characters that we can be engaged with to tell their stories of circumstances and the much-needed resolution, a nice production and some good music. Everything must be balanced together, and this is what I got to truly experience a well-rounded original story that leaves me wanting for more.This is some impressive stuff.

It\'s of no surprise to cast Megumi Han and Yuu Kobayashi as both Momo and Fine as the centerpiece of this series, and for all intensive purposes, their performances lend great aid to reflecting the series as a whole: the two outliers whom just want peace out of seclusion, fighting through every situation and not giving up on each other when the going gets tough, even at death\'s row.Unsurprisingly, this is what I would expect of Wit Studio\'s production, this being produced by Wit Studio and Production I.G. co-founder-cum-producer Tetsuya Nakatake, director Ryoutarou Makihara (whom hasn\'t directed anything since Shisha no Teikoku, a movie released in 2015) with assistant Hiroyuki Tanaka (who used to help direct Attack on Titan when it was produced at Wit Studio), music director Yoshihiro Ike (of Takt Op. Destiny and Dororo fame) and Tetsuya Nishio in both character design and being the chief animation director. Speaking of the character design, there is one person whom looks almost like Jiraiya from Naruto, and that\'s because Tetsuya Nishio is the original character designer of the TV series, so you know that this man is a god amongst men. This series being mostly centered in around arctic and industrial areas, gives me a mix of Attack on Titan and Vinland Saga vibes, to which if you\'ve ever watched those series, you\'ll know what I mean.It\'s genuine that I say that after the somewhat failure of the movie Bubble, Vampire in the Garden is what I truly hope that ONA stories like this capped within 2 hours plus can become: an engaging story that does not feel too short nor too long, characters that we can be engaged with to tell their stories of circumstances and the much-needed resolution, a nice production and some good music. Everything must be balanced together, and this is what I got to truly experience a well-rounded original story that leaves me wanting for more.This is some impressive stuff.', ""I’m an absolute sucker for vampire stories. Always have been, always will be. Shows like Vampire Knight and Hellsing were some of the earliest anime I can remember watching. There’s something just so captivating about a pasty, white, basement-dwelling, nocturnal, blood-sucker with good looks and even sharper teeth. Even when Tom Cruise starts walking the night, it still looks and sounds pretty cool. So, to me, it doesn’t matter if your vampire plot is tropey, boring or juvenile, I’ll still enjoy it if the main character has some aversion to garlic, crosses, sunlight, or some unholy combination of the three. Hell, I even started reading...Call of the Night, which sucks, but satiates my desire for coffin-sleeping, bat-morphing, reflection-precluding, immortal, skinny white chicks. But what does any of that have to do with Vampire in the Garden? Well, there’s a garden, but there are vampires in it, so it already ticks the biggest vampire show check box without me even having to watch it.In all honesty, I completely forgot this show was coming out. I remember when it got announced, but in about 3 minutes, it had left my memory entirely for the foreseeable forever. Maybe Mal’s bell notifications actually do come in handy sometimes because, as you probably can guess, that’s what reminded me of its existence. Anyways, I was pretty excited for this show based on the involvement of one man—and if you’ve read the redundant parts of the previous review, you’ll know where this is going—that man being the centrepiece of the three gods: Mr Tetsuya Nishio. A man whose expert designs have—if you’re not some Boruto sycophant—recently re-invigorated themselves in the public conscience with Kamiyama’s Visions vignette and, if you were REALLY paying attention, Oshii’s Vlad Love. As you can probably tell by the way I’ve somehow segued into just praising Nishio without actually discussing the topic of this review, the man’s work means a lot to me, so his involvement with this project instantly piqued my interest. After all, character designers are inherently the most important part of an anime’s production, right? I mean, have you seen anything with Range Murata or Yoshitoshi Abe’s names slapped on the staff list? It might be presumptuous for me to say this, but aren’t the character designs the mode by which the script writer’s ideas are given life? Are the character designs not a visual representation of the lines upon lines of dialogue that allow the audience to graphically distinguish and connect with the cast, as superficial as that connection may be? The aesthetics and ‘look’ of a character is what immediately gives the audience an impression of what a show could be about. You can infer a lot from a good character design, and in my humble, humble opinion, Tetsuya Nishio is in the business of good character designs. For fucks sake, he took Kishimoto’s already brilliant design for Naruto and translated it into being one of the most instantly recognisable designs in animation history.Well, ok, Vampire in the Garden time now. At the very least, I can tell you that, just like Tom Cruise, it looks and sounds pretty cool. WIT did a fantastic job on this thing. Masakazu Miyake brought all the thunder (that's probably not the right word to describe background art) back from Mushoku Tensei, applying that same level of quality to an otherwise vastly different, and certainly more specific, setting. There’s a bunch of different ways to say something looks great, but I’m gonna settle for the one: it looks great. What more is there to say? However, from whatever score I've given this, you can probably tell I've got some itsy bitsy complaints here and there, like, for instance, why does the CG animate so bad? How do people sit through something like, I don’t know, The Sky Crawlers, for ease of comparison, and claim that CG ruined the film? Compared to TSC, this has gotta be some kind of joke. It looks like there was zero thought of realism or physics put into the way the CG vehicles move. Like, it’s forgivable, but it certainly takes me out of the action. It just seems so silly, especially because the texturing otherwise looks really cool.Plot-wise, it’s your standard vampire affair, nothing vastly out of the ordinary. Though, maybe something out of the ordinary would have helped it, because the plot was by far the weakest aspect of the film. I just found myself struggling to care about anything—all the emotion felt like it was carried on the back of Megumi Han’s brilliant performance as Momo, and if you've seen Momo's back, you'd know it's pretty small. The plot progression was just so filmic and predictable. It wasn’t till that handsome stud Kubo got some well-needed development that I found myself actively engaged, but by then, it was far too late, and the film had basically entered its final few scenes. Overall, Vampire in the Garden feels, looks and sounds like something I would have loved if I was eight or so years younger, with all its graphic violence, easy to follow story and frantic katana x vampire sakuga fights. My qualms pertaining to this film feel like a repeat of the last Netflix anime I watched: Orbital Children, and you can bet the cause is almost identical. For some fucking reason, Netflix chops its films up into stupid episodes instead of leaving them as a bigger, stupid movie, which is how it should be: stupid. Look, I’m just going to pretend it was Netflix’s fault because I wanted to like this movie a hell of a lot more than I did, but I just don’t have it in me to lie to you people ;) Similarly to how I bemoaned in my Orbital Children review, this really should have been an 11-13 episode series. It would have given suitable breathing room for the cast to develop relationships and flesh out motivations at a well-reasoned pace. Seeing that same potential squandered, in the same way, is just disheartening.Well, is that it? I think that’s all I wanted to say. To summarise, Vampire in the Garden was blessed with some of the best production values and talents of the 2020s but failed to keep the ball rolling after tripping and falling into the same direction-inhibiting pit-falls that its predecessors have yet to climb out of. I hesitate to say I’m disappointed since Orbital Children garnered the same sorta-middling response from me, so at some level, I was expecting something almost good but not quite engaging enough to deserve that accolade.

The only halfway decent character was the uncle and he didn't get any development until the end. They studio tried to put too many slow moving scenes along with too much material which ends up with a lot of stuff being crammed into a short runtime. The characters become unrelatable from this pacing as you don't really understand their actions. To put it in perspective it makes no sense that Momo the main character would leave with Fine and in no...time at all have an us versus the world mentality when vampires had been her enemy her entire life. Granted she does not view them with hatred but she does have a bias against them as seen in her first interaction with Fine.I had some hopes for this anime at the start but even though it was only 5 episodes (and I always finish short anime since it's not that big a waste of my time) I was seriously about to drop it, but alas I stuck with it cause why not just finish it. You also get some strong yuri vibes if your into that, personally I don't care for it but if the story is good I'll watch it. So take it as you may and watch it if you want but it doesn't get my stamp of approval. time at all have an us versus the world mentality when vampires had been her enemy her entire life.

The Best thing you can do to see if it's for you or not is watching the first episode, which is one of the best first episodes I have seen in a long time.It does get a little weaker around episode 3 and specially 4, but it picks itself back up for the final episode so I wasn't too bothered by it.Bottom of the line is, if you want to go in completely blind, do it. it's worth your time,...but if you're still unsure, keep reading:********************************************************************the story is about a world were vampires and humans are at war while both sides are kind of both at fault and victims at the same time.

I even go as far as saying for a show that is only 5 episodes long the character writing is kind of impressive.but that isn't even close to being the most impressive thing about the show. The star here is easily the execution. I'm talking about the directing, pacing and music. they work flawlessly in a final product that I can only describe as cinematic. so much so that I thought the first episode was the most cinematic and masterfully directed episode of Anime I have seen since the made in abyss movie.which says a lot considering how made in abyss is visually stunning, and what I'm talking about is a god damn movie.And it's not just the visuals and direction, the music and it's placement is simply perfect.

It only tells what it wants to tell in it's short runtime, which really could've have been more impactful as a movie but is still a pretty decent watch.The story takes place in a world where humanity is at the brink of existence... (Bit of a tangent here, but I find it funny how often this line is getting repeated like, HUMANITY IS AT BRINK OF EXISTENCE, like I forgot how much weight that line carries and how much I...got used to it xD...)Anyway, vampires started to take over the world in both mass and land, while humanity corned itself with nothing but a tower of light as their hope (& guns). Humanity uses some kind of holy light and guns to fight the vampires, while the silver haired vampires just kills humans by sucking their blood, who also have the ability to fly *and* can also transform into some beast when injected with some kind of drug.. Yeah, humanity's clearly loosing. Humanity also abandoned music and all other semblance of culture. to avoid vampire keen senses, while vampires adopted all of humanities abandoned culture into their own. While the silver haired vampires dance in the moon-lit nights, humanity... does nothing but survive.While all that might sound pretty generic and 'done-to-death' premise, the real interesting part is not about the setting but about the journey of two women from each side.The main focus of the story is about two characters, **'Momo' & 'Fine'** (it spells more like 'Fin-a'). Momo is a human solider who hates her lifeless military job and wants to find more about art (mostly music). She has a lively personality under her dead lifestyle. The only thing she loves more than anything, is he friend 'Merina', but you know how innocent friendships in war settings end...'Fine' is a vampire and possibly a queen or similarly high ranked individual in the vampire society, who looks livelier than anyone in the room, but is actually dying inside, partly because she refuse to drink blood anymore and partly because of her regrets (which I'll get into it later).Both of these women hate their own society for taking away their freedom and at the end of episode 1, when Fine asks Momo to run away with her... (you guessed it). But this run away quickly becomes a journey to find a paradise, a paradise where vampires & humans, sing and dance together. Throughout the runtime, you'll see the laughs, the joys, the fears, the tears, the dreams & the hope these two women carry with each other in their journey, as small as it had been.The anime decided to leave their past, in the past, means it doesn't bring up either Fine's tragic flashback or any other side characters backstories and just hints at what could've happened through flashes of memories that doesn't long more than a few seconds. You'll only know what happens right now and you have to get the full story of what's happening & what happened by those small hints. This isn't as complicated/confusing as it might sounds. The creators decided to speed-run, what could've been a 1/2 episodes worth of flashback into 1/2 seconds of mere flashes onto their past and you can more or less interpret what happened with those small hints.This is on the same level of entertainment as Bubble, except the action is average when compared to Bubble while the drama is better than Bubble, though only just passable. The dub was not bad and pretty alright. And the soundtrack, especially the lead VAs opera (is what it's called, I think) at episode 2 is beautiful.And here this ends.

While it's all winter-themed, I never got tired of looking at the snowy mountains and landscapes, nor the bright lights of civilization contrasting with the cold, stormy night. The music is also a treat to listen to! Both the soulful, melancholy tunes and the jovial European-inspired ones are quite enchanting to the ears! The world itself is quite unique and interesting as well. It had a lot of potential that was, unfortunately, not quite met.The story and writing itself...is sadly the weak point of this work. There were engaging concepts that could've been explored, but never came to be. The pacing is also a mess. Everything happens so fast, to the point where things like character development feel sudden and unconvincing. Motivations and actions are either sloppily explained, or not given any reason whatsoever.There is some enjoyment to be had here, mostly in the visual and auditory senses. But if you're hoping to be wowed by a charming, well-written tale, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. is sadly the weak point of this work.

I want my time back.', ""This show is bad. While there are some interesting ideas and potential for an interesting story, it's most severely harmed by its limited run time and inability to flesh out the world and characters. If they're lucky, characters get 1 trait and the vaguest hint of motivation, but several are confounding. Despite this, the emotional climax of the story still managed to move me, just not enough to negate all concerns about earlier questionable plot choices.The character designs are fairly unremarkable, aside from transformed vampires, which are appropriately horrifying; and the animation is generally good enough, with the exception of conspicuously noticeable CG for hand...and finger movement in a piano sequence, and episode 4 utilizes of number of slow pans over still frames for characters dancing and frolicking. The English dub (at least the first episode) is very stiff and unnatural across the board. I watched the remaining 4 episodes in Japanese and it was a significant improvement.The opening moments of the story explain how humanity has been driven to the brink by vampires, and humans are struggling to reclaim the world, while a few early scenes with the vampires imply the morality isn't so clear cut, but the show never really explores how the world reached its current dystopian state. The show is also kind of flexible with how dangerous daylight/UV is to vampires. It's a major plot point in the first episode that the city is protected by a wall of (spot)light(s), but Fine gets blasted with UV light multiple times and seems only minimally effected by it (this may be because Fine is the queen of the vampires, but there are only about four lines referencing this in the entire show, most of them in the first episode).The protagonists Momo and Fine flee their warring oppressive human and vampires communities to find a utopia where both species can live in peace, and before they find it, they find a regular city where it's split in half by a river where the two sides have some kind of peace worked out, which kind of undercuts the earlier premise.Another issue with the plot is that Mome and Fine arrive at the fabled peaceful mixed vampire/human village at the end of episode 3/start of episode 4, so you know that with 2 episodes to go, something will go wrong. If you made three guesses as to what that something is, you'd probably get at least 2 of them right, because the show isn't exactly groundbreaking.As for Momo and Fine's relationship, which is clearly intended to be the core of the story, it's disappointingly underdeveloped. It hints at a romantic connection between the two of them, but because of Fine's past trauma from how her previous relationship ended leads to her repeatedly distancing herself from Momo emotionally, and relying on traveling montages to establish their bond, it's hard to explain why they should be together.Ultimately, the show is brought down by incomplete and underutilized concepts and characterization.

Instead they must get paid for delivering the same old ingredients in a different wrapper.So much promise, so little delivery.', 'One time, a few years ago, I mentioned to some people in a fandom that I wasn\'t a particularly big fan of a show because I felt that it came across as too treacly and saccharine, with the main character embodying a lot of those qualities. But apparently a lot of people didn\'t like this and proceeded to accuse me of only liking tragic edgy shlock and claiming that I hate it when kids shows have an optimistic tone. If anyone\'s seen some reviews I\'ve done for the various seasons of Pretty Cure, I can attest that that\'s not true. I just prefer the shows...I watch, books I read, and games I play to actually have substance to them, and not just lean too far into both extremes, such as being too sugary and saccharine or being too morose, dark, and bleak. Unfortunately, Vampire in the Garden, a new Netflix anime made by Wit Studio, is the latter. If anyone is looking for a good example of a show that\'s absolutely drowning in pointless edginess and misery porn, Vampire in the Garden pretty much embodies all of those qualities, and not for the better.Basically, the story focuses on a world where vampires and humans are locked in endless conflict, and because vampires have heightened senses of hearing, humans have forbidden music of all kinds. Momo is a young girl living in one of the few human strongholds left, and while she\'s had experience with killing vampires due to her mother\'s job as a military general, she grows weary of all the fighting. When she gets into a fight with her mother over a music box, she runs away and encounters the supposed queen of vampires, Fine, and the two escape together. Although their initial encounter is rough, the two slowly become friends and bond over a shared love of music. But their newfound friendship is considered taboo by both humans and vampires. Momo and Fine hear an urban legend about a paradise called Eden, where humans and vampires supposedly live in peace, so they decide to try and find it, hoping to escape the conflict that they\'re embroiled in. But their journey is not a happy one.Yeah, the whole premise feels like a cookie cutter YA novel trying to capitalize on the vampire trend, similar to what the Twilight books wound up doing years ago, only here there\'s no romance. But the premise like this can be done well, and others have managed to pull it off well. But Vampire in the Garden is not one of them, and there\'s so much wrong with it that it\'s not even funny. For one, the series is fairly short, only going for about 5 half-hour episodes, so the pacing is very fast, having very little in the way of breaks and quiet moments. Now, I know a lot of series that have less episodes and even shorter episode run times, but have managed to make optimal use of them in order to do what they wanted, with some examples being Yoru no Kuni, the various PokeToon shorts, and even Pokemon Twilight Wings. But here\'s the thing: All three of those short series I mentioned have one thing in common, which is the reason that people like them show much, that reason being that the three shorts managed to make you, the audience, care about the characters and their plight, mainly because the shows themselves cared about them enough to show how they grow and achieve their goals in the end, even when the roads to getting there weren\'t exactly pleasant. Which leads me to the main reason why Vampire in the Garden fails as an anime: It\'s so obsessed with being as bloody, violent, edgy, and downright miserable and morose as possible that it\'s completely impossible to care about the characters and the situations they\'re in.Honestly, watching Vampire in the Garden felt like I was stuck in a bloody mud pit and couldn\'t get out. Everything about it feels like whoever produced this wanted to make it the most miserable, morose, unnecessarily angsty anime possible. For one, none of the characters save for the main two are even remotely likeable, and even the two leads are bland as hell, barely changing much throughout the show, and any changes they do go through are so predictable you can see them coming from a mile away. The show makes absolutely no effort to develop its characters or give them any depth beyond their most basic archetypes or short flashes of their backstories that just are just there for more forced drama. Most of the characters end up dying anyway, and the show thinks it\'s good at making you care about them, but its method of doing so involves shoehorning in a LOT of melodrama, a lot of it in the form of characters constantly screaming, crying, angsting, and being angry with no end in sight. Any moments of levity and quiet are really short and often followed up by, you guessed it, more fighting and blood and angst, leaving practically no time to catch your breath. Also, can I just say how much I hate Momo\'s mother Nobara as a character? Most of her screentime consists of being a hardened military leader and yelling at or slapping Momo around. The show is trying to make the case that she wants to save Momo from the vampires, but with the way the show presents her, it never felt to me like she truly cared about Momo and was only trying to save her for her own benefit. And even if Momo did act willful and ungrateful during their argument, does that really justify Nobara slapping her and treating her like shit over really petty things? Any time Momo and Nobara are seen together, Nobara is either angry at her or pulling a gun on her, and any attempts she made to apologize to her all felt shallow and fake as a result of her inconsistent characterization.Which leads me to Vampire in the Garden\'s biggest flaw: Momo and Fine\'s journey winds up being rendered completely meaningless and pointless as nothing in the show ever changes from when it first started. From beginning to end, Vampire in the Garden shows nothing but the vampires and humans at war with one another, and any solutions to the problem are rendered either too good to be true or wind up never having existed in the first place. Combine that with all the blood, gore, violence, and characters being absolutely nasty to one another, this makes the series feel completely meaningless, as the characters we\'re supposed to care about never manage to achieve their goals, with their whole journey being in vain, nothing ever gets better for them, and any happiness they find winds up being an illusion. The war between the vampires and humans never gets resolved, and most of the cast dies at the end, making Vampire in the Garden nothing more than a painful slog of nothing but seemingly endless misery and tragedy porn. Actually, Vampire in the Garden is literally just relentless, neverending misery porn, nothing more. Honestly, the only good things Vampire in the Garden has going for it are its detailed backgrounds, animation reminiscent of early 2000s stuff, and the soundtrack which consists of mostly classical music and opera singing, and even those can\'t save the show from just being a relentless angst fest with no light at the end of the tunnel. The whole series feels like it\'s constantly beating you with a hammer while screaming ""FEEL SAAAAAAAD!!"" and it just doesn\'t work because it has nothing else to offer.Look, I like my fair share of tragedies and bittersweet endings every now and then. But making a show be literally nothing but non-stop angst, drama, and misery, without any meaningful reason for the audience to care about your characters and story, and have it end with basically nothing changing in the end, really doesn\'t work. At all. I just watched a French movie recently called Long Way North, and while that movie had plenty of tragic moments, it at least had the characters accomplish what they wanted to do in the end, so everything they went through wasn\'t in vain. The movie In This Corner of the World took 70% of its screentime to establish its story and characters and make the audience care about them first, knowing to save the tragedy and sad moments for later, making it hit harder than it would have had the movie used it earlier. One of my favorite movies of all time is the 1997 Dog of Flanders anime, and it starts off happy-go-lucky and sweet but slowly becomes more tragic as it goes on, and it also has a sad ending, but it actually had a point to its tragedy, to establish how classism hurts both the privileged and the working class people. Hell, what many consider to be one of the best video games ever, Mother 3, is universally praised as being one of the saddest games ever, and didn\'t need to rely on having absolutely nothing but constant sorrow and drama for 30 hours straight. My point being, if you\'re going to make your story a tragedy in some capacity, don\'t make the tragedy all there is to story, and have more to offer than just that. Vampire in the Garden has literally nothing to offer except endless angst that\'s ultimately pointless in the end. I once wrote a fan fic years ago that many people claimed was pointlessly dark and edgy, and some of their complaints about it are valid, but if there\'s one thing I can say about it, it\'s that I at least TRIED to have there to be more to it than just angst and drama. I made sure to at least develop the characters and throw in moments of needed levity, even if I didn\'t always succeed, and stuff like this and Magical Girl Site are way worse and edgier than my old fic could ever be.Vampire in the Garden is on Netflix right now, and maybe it can be something you can use to introduce a teenager  to and have them transition to watching anime that\'s more mature than stuff like Pokemon and Naruto. Otherwise, Vampire in the Garden doesn\'t have anything to offer unless you\'re masochistic enough to endure seemingly endless angst, gore, and melodrama.Edit, 5/22/2022: I found out I was admittedly wrong about one thing. Apparently there was a stinger scene at the very end of episode 5, after the credits, that I didn\'t see on my first watch. Because I didn\'t see this stinger, I thought that Momo\'s journey wound up being completely in vain, making the series feel completely pointless, but it turns out the stinger has a much happier outcome for Momo than I thought. Because of this, I\'ve decided to be a little bit generous and bump up the rating slightly. That being said, my overall feelings for Vampire in the Garden remain the same, and had the series been longer, bothered to put in some more moments of levity, and flesh out all its other characters, it might have been something good or even great.

Though short, I felt that the pacing was pretty good and not unnecessarily drawn out like other shows, the ending was impactful with just the right amount of sad/happy vibes. The animation was alright, nothing special. Characters felt realistic and it was easy relating to them. What really stood out was the OST, absolute masterpiece. Would have preferred a couple more filler episodes but overall a solid 8/10, gave me maquia vibes all over again. "", 'It\'s a shame that this anime isn\'t longer or paced better.There are a lot of things that I find enjoyable about this anime; the music, the heavily implied sapphic romance between the two characters (only to find out Momo is 14 years old), vampires, the search for a better place among a world in ruins. I love many of these tropes and wanted so badly to rate this as an 8 by the last episode, but I was still left feeling like this anime could have done so much more than what it gave.This anime reminds me a lot of Wolf\'s Rain in...the way that the main characters are being chased through a world that\'s been pushed to its limits, while searching for a rumored land that may or may not even exist. Vampire in the Garden dubbed this peaceful place ""Eden,"" where vampires and humans can live together. What I find interesting is that in the beginning Momo and Fine are searching for a geographical location that they can physically go to. However, by the end of the show, Eden is implied to be wherever Momo and Fine are together. The idea that together they are their own Eden (and something seperate from the war) is a strong message to end on that also makes sense considering both Momo and Fine are only their true selves around each other. While the narrative implies a romance, or at least deep connection, between Fine and Momo, it\'s worth mentioning that Momo is 14 years old vs Fine whose age is unknown (but most likely much older).The problem is that there is a disconnect between the characters and the audience. This show does not take the time or have the time to let the characters connect with each other (in turn, let the audience connect with them too). I think this is a problem in lack of run-time. Coming in at 5 episodes -- less than half a 12-episode season of anime -- this anime can\'t afford to spend much time on memorable, slow scenes with the characters that would otherwise make the ending really impactful.Aside from the plot and pacing problems, the music is absolutely fantastic! I really like the musicbox song and the piano/singing duet. And I think music being part of the vampire culture is a nice touch to the world building. Even if it was never really explained why Vampires claimed music as their own.All in all, could have been a good show. But the short amount of episodes hinders this anime\'s chances of being anything more than decent. the way that the main characters are being chased through a world that\'s been pushed to its limits, while searching for a rumored land that may or may not even exist.

This story, however, is different than any other review. This anime had nothing but wasted potential. The characters were interesting, the story and plot was captivating enough to keep me drawn to it, and the art was fantastic.This story was good, I enjoyed Momo and Fine characters, although they both had their fair-share of annoying or what (?) moments. My favorite character in...this story, was between Fubo (uncle) and Elisha. Before anyone says anything, I couldn't remember a single characters name outside of Momo and Fine's... that's rare for me.The problem with this story isn't the characters, it isn't soundtrack or animation, or plot. The biggest problem was the pacing. They offered interesting backstories, Fubo wedding, Fine past, and how Nobara became the way that she is. But this story didn't answer any of them, not one. It was irritating, they continued to give EXTREMLY vague insight on their past, and not focusing on these characters backstories wouldn't be an issue... if they weren't so fixated on showing us it. But out of everything, what irritated me that most was how they treated these characters. ---- SPOILER INCOMING ---***SPOILER INCOMING --- Allegro was an amazing design and character.. and if I hadn't looked him up, I could not have told you what his name was, nor the purpose of his character. He was there as Fine's right hand man, he was the one next to her, giving her advice, and staying loyal to her.

Before anyone says anything, I couldn't remember a single characters name outside of Momo and Fine's... that's rare for me.The problem with this story isn't the characters, it isn't soundtrack or animation, or plot. The biggest problem was the pacing. They offered interesting backstories, Fubo wedding, Fine past, and how Nobara became the way that she is. But this story didn't answer any of them, not one. It was irritating, they continued to give EXTREMLY vague insight on their past, and not focusing on these characters backstories wouldn't be an issue... if they weren't so fixated on showing us it. But out of everything, what irritated me that most was how they treated these characters. ---- SPOILER INCOMING ---***SPOILER INCOMING --- Allegro was an amazing design and character.. and if I hadn't looked him up, I could not have told you what his name was, nor the purpose of his character. He was there as Fine's right hand man, he was the one next to her, giving her advice, and staying loyal to her.

I don't think I need to say much about the art considering this is WIT, but what stood out was the backgrounds. Each scene told a story of its own, whether it was the dusty ruined halls of an abandoned mansion, or an extravagant clean dance hall. The sounds for the most part were good,...but noticed they used the same sound for pulling a grenade pin and opening a syringe.

I never knew they animated for Attack On Titan (Seasons 1 - 3), Ranking Of Kings & So Many More.Minor Spoiler Warnings: Just in case people want to actually watch the show before reading this review.So I went into this show blind expecting it to be a passtime, waiting for other shows I was excited for to be released. It is short only 5 episodes but it packs a good punch only if you let it.First thing that could turn people off is...the relationship of our characters, a human and a vampire running away from home because they are both sick of the war ravishing their lands. Now it does sound a bit far-fetched but it relates to normal human behavior, everyone has a tolerance for how much they can take before they are done with it. I mean if I saw dead bodies all the time either from the enemy or our allies I would be the same way.However there are minor parts where the story tends to fall apart if you think about it. The Vampires & Humans have their own system of events and situation happening across the decisions of the vampire and human relationship. The biggest problem with it is, it doesn\'t have the time to go over both pressing issues.The Vampires want the vampire back and the human\'s want the human back but it doesn\'t really convey anything important. It is said, it happens and we never hear from them ever again. Like the human for instance is the captain\'s daughter: ""Momo"" They bring the issue up like the captain will lose her rank because of this but nothing happens...same with the vampire side. Cool world building aspects that just don\'t get expanded...at all. It upsets me because you got good ideas but no long term issues.The art is what I would expect, is it mindblowing? No, but it does have its cool moments from time to time. But really if you are just going to be watching a show because you want it to have cool over the top animation. This show doesn\'t do that, it is a show focused on its character building.Sound wise, I think its good. Music being banned so there are very little instrumentals is a cool design technique to use. It uses classical music and tunes, which isn\'t bad, but it isn\'t my cup of tea. But I still think it fits a lot more than it should for this show.Overall I enjoyed it, the problems come from some of the worldbuilding aspects falling apart once they are established from when you watched it to when it ends. If you binge through the show you may or may not notice it, but it does have its good moments.The story is my biggest gripe because it makes sense but doesn\'t have enough episodes to get its ideas across. Its not bad but it does have issues which are never addressed. Overall, give it a watch if you want a show to pass the time.I rate it a 8 but my opinions may change in the future. the relationship of our characters, a human and a vampire running away from home because they are both sick of the war ravishing their lands.

As someone who absolutely loves vampire ANYTHING, when I logged onto Netflix and saw it I could hardly contain my excitement. The first episode was pretty good, things were still fairly original and there were a lot of little placements of things that left the possibility of more things happening. the first episode put a lot of detail into the world like a first episode should, it left me with questions and the series opportunities to build on them, but the questions weren't ever built on!

The mom, the friend in the beginning, the brother to finee, these would help the characters out so much if we were given a actual reason to how they really effect the characters. Also, 5 episodes. so dumb, go big or go home. If we were given a series that was longer or this were simply a movie it would have been so much more memorable. this series is fine, finee? lol. watch it or don't, it likely won't stick. series uses becomes so bland if you are familiar with any anime or media tropes. the pacing of the story was alight, but the wow factor that could have so easily been reached if there was any sort of individuality.

I think that’s my conclusion. Allow me to explain.There’s definitely a lot to like on display. The music and sound design are great, no problems there. The art is very strong despite simple, slightly uncanny character design. The character dynamic between the two leads grew on me as the story progressed, and I found that their emotional beats really resonated. I love me a good road trip, even though this one was kept pretty snappy. In fact, the show’s rather economical storytelling allows quite a lot to happen in a mere 130 minutes. The fast pace rarely...lets up, including some rip-roaring action scenes that I thoroughly enjoyed.It is this economical storytelling that also leaves much to be desired, though. Many scenes lack proper flow, with a couple actually leaving me questioning what happened. The world lacks cohesiveness as well, with many specific details about humans and vampires either not making an impact where they should, or not making particularly much sense to begin with. Heck, character decisions and motivations don’t make a lot of sense and are largely driven by the plot. And oh lordy, the plot. Let’s just say the writers didn’t let a silly thing like physics get in the way of what they wanted to happen.Just like the whole show, the animation is good in parts (the dancing!) and bad in parts.

For example, Momo's uncle's background could be entertaining, but they're only shown a few scenes of him and his vampire wife. Or the storyline of Fine girlfriend (?), could be also interesting, but we know for sure that they know each other and that she is dead....Also, the journey which Momo and Fine had to take is too short, they're traveling for one full episode.I thought it will be more about the differences between humans and vampires and trying to be together even if another person has disadvantages.

I mean, I'm a sucker for vampires (haha) but I think it holds up regardless. However, it's not without its flaws.Main story is about a human girl and the vampire queen, both sick of the constant fighting and killing on both sides, deciding to flee and search out an 'eden' where humans and vampires can live in harmony. The plot doesn't break the wheel or anything but the real focus is on the two main characters, both their bond and their personal trauma. While it's compelling I feel that this show would have really benefitted from more episodes, both to...give more time to their developing relationship and delving into their past.I would have loved to see more of Fiine's past (and the people in it, yeah you'll know who I'm talking about). I also think if there had been more time spent seeing Momo pushed to breaking point her decision to run would have made more sense (as it is she's dissatisfied with her job, gets in one argument with her mum, then decides to leave her settlement for what she's been assured is certain death). And of course, seeing more of Fiine and Momo connecting would have been a treat. We get some montages, but overall they go very quickly from strangers to people completely dedicated to one another.More episodes would also allow us to see more of the world, get a greater sense of distance travelled and the people out there...Both protagonists are likeable (though I particularly enjoyed Fiine), but the side character suffer from a lack of development due to the limited screen time. Would have been nice to understand more about Allegro and his relationship to Fiine. Would have also been nice for Momo's uncle and his crew to be more than a plot point (there to hunt them down rather than be characters in their own right). And an antagonist I won't name for spoiler reasons turns out to be pretty one dimensional, when adding more nuance to their behaviour and motives would work in the story's favour.The art is lovely, and the animation has some absolutely beautiful segments (I adore how fluid the vampire's wing transition is, and how they fly). Music is good, backgrounds are pretty, no complaints there. Visually this show is very strong.Now, the ending may not be for everyone... personally it didn't do it for me, felt a little bleak in a way that contradicts the idea the protagonists (and the show tbh) seem to push - that humans and vampires can live together peacefully. But I suspected for a while that things may go that way. Maybe it would feel better if we'd had more time to follow their journey. Unfortunately, that's something we can't know.Overall I really enjoyed the show though, and it's a shame it's not longer.

Years of consuming product and getting excited for the next product, have totally brought the collective tolerance for crap down. Let me start by acknowledging that the production value is good, visually it\'s nice with all the sets of East European furniture and some nice landscapes. Sound-wise, acceptable I\'d say, voice acting for this was so/so. Time for the meat (from this metaphorical meat and potatoes), the main reasons for this \'rant\' I guess, even though I\'m not even mad, I\'m...just apathetic and numb. Which is actually in a way worst. The story, plot, and characters. Starting with the plot. I mean nowhere original but serviceable, exceedingly similar to Irina: The Vampire Cosmonaut in many ways, though obviously very different (Cosmonaut). Here we have an authoritarian government, unexplained war, the pursuit of freedom, and some other minor plot threads. But non are really covered with any competency, and all are just \'dressing\'. Characters are next. I mean, what can I tell you. I said this already but we get what we deserve. Cardboard cut-outs with surface-level motivations that are flippant, (says one thing does another). Let\'s examine Momo, who grew up in a \'gated\' authoritarian society, where they are thought to hate vampires, and has a military mother. And you tell me ""Come with me if you want to be free"" is enough, just look at the real world for examples: the Asian communist countries or the past, the mind bend is hard to overcome. Plus we get no context to the world or the characters before the start of the anime. Which brings me to the story, what story though? Sorry for being a bit cheeky, but seriously what story... The characters move, sort of say, from place to place but they don\'t really get developed past basic and immediate, almost convenient aspects. And then we get a time skip at the end, come on you can go off the script sometimes, you don\'t have to follow the tutorial outlined in \'Writing for dumbos\' and \'Ten basic plot threads you need to know\'. I don\'t know if this review does anything for anyone, and probably won\'t sway minds, but for anyone with a similar opinion, here it is: in words. just apathetic and numb.

And then we get a time skip at the end, come on you can go off the script sometimes, you don\'t have to follow the tutorial outlined in \'Writing for dumbos\' and \'Ten basic plot threads you need to know\'. I don\'t know if this review does anything for anyone, and probably won\'t sway minds, but for anyone with a similar opinion, here it is: in words.', ""Vampire in the garden is one of those anime that comes out of nowhere and just blows everyone away. While the story had it's flaws like everything else and the art style seemed a little bland but the anime was trying to tell a story and have some very good music to go with it. They were not trying to make the next big action block buster.I'm not an emotional person but this five episode anime honestly made me cry at the end. I don't remember the last time something evoked emotions in me like this anime did so good job wit studio this...anime is a hidden gem and I'll definitely be recommending it. anime is a hidden gem and I'll definitely be recommending it."", 'I\'m still not sure what happened, but it feels like they forgot to make the other half of the show.Vampire in the Garden is a breath of fresh air for the vampire genre, or at least that\'s what I expected it to be. The motif of ""predators trying to co-exist with their preys"" has been overused so much in the last decade to the point they don\'t even know how to exploit it anymore and it SHOWS in this series.It had a good start building up the relationship between the Momo and her bestfriend, and WIT just nailed it again with the grim post...dystopian world being portrated very beautiful and immersive. But as the show went on all of those just became a backdrop for this very weird plot development and pacing from one short episode to another rapidly, to the point by episode 4 I had already forgotten everyone\'s name except for the 2 main characters, or was that they were never mentioned? Five episodes is nowhere near enough time to make you feel anything for these people, and also because of that nothing was ever fully explained. Fine\'s backstory was revealed about 30% at best, her brother/lover/prince\'s non existent, Momo\'s non existent, her mama\'s non existent, her mama\'s brother\'s non existent, the evil village\'s non existent. The entire show was literally about the duo fleeing across the continent from one place to another and suddenly our main girl decided to went above and beyond to protect her predator after what felt like the 10 minutes they just met.I would recommend people to watch this, only if they had a free afternoon. And don\'t try to linger long afterward because there is really just nothing to process, everything is all laid down in an extremely simple way.3.6 not good, not terrible. dystopian world being portrated very beautiful and immersive.

This will be a short review.Story:- 2/10What story? Momo only apparently discovers music from a music box she finds while on a mission and really likes it. Enough to want to leave the home she’s known for years and her Mother? What motive is that? She also decides all of a sudden to go with a vampire when she’s been brought up to hate them. The whole plot is the two running away from both vampires and the military it was a great...premise, but the execution was awful. It was a mess.Art:- 7/10The one thing that kept me watching was the amazing animation and art that Wit Studio always puts out for their Anime, but that’s the only thing good about this show.Sound:- 1/10I can’t recall a single piece of significant music that I found awe-inspiring.Character:- 2/10There was not one character I like in this. The human characters I hated, the main characters were boring and there weren’t really any other vampires that got screen time a part from one. The only character I like was Allegro because he was the only interesting character in the whole show with his past relationship with Fine, his hatred towards humans and he had a dog too. A vampire who likes dogs and cares about them is different than them just being used for food; though we didn’t get the dog’s name sadly. The Uncle seemed interesting, but his development was at the end and I really didn’t care anymore. Momo and Fine I could care less about. Momo’s Mother was borderline abusive due to the fact she didn’t understand why her daughter ran away in the first place and continued to have her soldiers hunt her down; even crazy ones who would get her hurt either by accident or on purpose.Enjoyment and Overall:- 5/10Even if this review has been fairly negative I enjoyed it quite a bit, but only to a certain extent. And it’s mostly due to everything I wrote above. I give this Anime a 5 because of the lackluster writing in the motivation of the characters, the lack of knowledge of who the characters are and not letting the audience care about these characters enough. You can watch it if you’re a fan of vampires but I advice don’t. It’s a waste of five episodes you can waste on something else. premise, but the execution was awful.

It has heart felt emotional moments, action, and a little bit of world building. It's also a bit of a tear-jerker.  At five episodes, the series is quite brief, and very easy to binge.Some have compared it to a long movie, honestly it reminds me of an OVA. Each episode tells a relatively self-contained story that fluidly bridges into the next one. A lot of the reviews criticize the series for being short, which I think is actually one of its strengths. The series quickly makes you invested in the characters, particularly the leads Momo and...Fine. Their struggles and relationship are the core of the story the show is trying to tell, and I think it does a good job of organically fleshing out both over its runtime. If it was significantly longer I think it would risk dragging or feeling padded.The setting, with its freezing landscapes, post apocalyptic elements, and human-vampire forever war, is also engaging, but clearly secondary to the protagonists and their story. This oddly ends up working in its favor, as the world benefits from being shown on-screen rather than explained through exposition.I've re-watched the show a few times, and found something new to like about it each time.

The longest episode is the first at 30 minutes, and the rest have more reasonable runtimes of 23 minutes, meaning you could easily run through this whole show in one sitting and see it as an episodic movie more than anything.Let’s talk about a few scattered things before getting to the meat.The show is as offbeat as its premise- a sad old vampire lesbian and a sad young human lesbian ride off to find paradise in a post apocalyptic Russia. I almost want to put it in the same bins as YA...fantasy and *shivers* Vanitas no Carte, but every time I think I’ve got it figured out, it’ll do a little something to impress or make me scratch my head.The soundtrack is a bunch of wandering atmospheric music with nary a hint of Japanesey-ness- think Vinland Saga without the emotional swells or melancholy piano, but it grows on you and fits the show fairly well.The vampire-human conflict starts out seeming absurdly simple: vampires are evil and love art and music so humans hate art and music and are also near extinction, and while this is never really overturned, it’s not the main conflict that our leading ladies go through, so it’s forgivable. Although, they did leave a lot open that I think really should have been either never brought up or addressed at some point.The setting is cool, and not just the background. What I mean is, the artists had a lot of fun creating a post-apocalyptic Russia and imagining how different settlements would get by or how characters would navigate within those environments. From oppressive utilitarian cities to an adapted nuclear submarine to that one map from call of duty: warzone, there’s a good bit of variety. Granted, for a show about vampires, they failed to create an interesting style/culture for the vampires themselves (they mostly just live in run down places and like to use faint orange lighting while humans have aggressive, ever-present steampunk green lighting.Every now and again they really cut corners with the animation (episode 4 in particular had a lot of still frames that could’ve used some liveliness), there are also several nice touches of animation like Momo’s weird singing, the variety of outfits they wear, and the way people swing their little shotguns around before firing them.No one in this show knows how to fight or shoot a gun. They can have dramatic conversations in their fights alright, but there’s not a single battle in this show that won’t leave you scratching your head saying “wait, what?”There are a few moments where the story seems to just… neglect time and space and characters seemingly teleport several hours/days/weeks journey from one spot to another for the sake of plot.Okay I think that’s all the little things, so let’s talk about the show, spoilers and all.Vampire in the Garden is a show about oppressive societies and two women’s attempt to break free. Both Momo and Fine have been forced into roles they don’t want, and despite their differences, are trying to find a better way forward. Naturally the forces that be can’t allow this to happen, thus leading into the misadventures they go on. It’s a road trip where someone is always riding your tail. Thankfully, our two leading ladies never get too intimate. They can be lesbians, fine, I liked Steven Universe, but one is 14 and the other is a vampire (at the very least a grown woman) who first takes an interest in the child because she reminds her of her old lover. You see why that could’ve gotten weird, right?The drama is always focused on Momo and Fine- will they be able to find a paradise where they can finally live in peace? Any serious conflict between them is resolves pretty early on, so the most of the show is the two of them dealing with conflict from the outside.The show likes to ask whether vampires and humans can truly live together without ever giving a real answer. Namely, why don’t the humans who love vampires just become vampires themselves? We’ve already established in the first episode that getting bit turns you into a vampire, so if it’s constantly an issue, why not just turn the human? The show never bothers to give an explanation why- they could’ve said “oh it’s because theres’s an inherent spark of warmth in humans that is lost when they become a vampire” or something corny like that and it would’ve been fine. We even know that vampires age, so it’s not like if you turn to soon you’re stuck as a kid forever, so there really doesn’t seem to be much of a downside, other than you have to wear hoodies all the time. By the end, we get a mixed bag on an answer, in that Momo and Fine really do care about each other and would stop at nothing (even though it never really addresses Momo’s unwillingness to drink blood or that one time she lost control and nearly died/killed Momo over it. Seems like that should’ve been addressed but oh well), though it’s not enough; Fine is killed, and Momo is left wailing once more. She finds that she has grown stronger though. She knows what she wants- presumably to create the paradise where humans and vampires can live in harmony- and in the post-credits scene we see that she eventually achieves that. It seems weird and out of place since they never really address any of the many inherent obstacles in human-vampire relationships, but good for Momo.Vampires get the short end of the stick throughout this. It tries to make the case that they’re not so different- sure they dress funny and go out at weird hours and listen to that weird music- but they’re still people! Only… no one in the show, even the main characters seem to view it that way. None of the “good guys” kill any humans, but we see plenty of vampire killings, and boy are they bloody. The vampires are either living in high society or poor, desperate, and possibly criminal. Not really any neutral or good vampires are seen, besides Lady Fine.There are many plotholes left hanging at the end of the show, that either never should have been brought up or should have been addressed at some point. fantasy and *shivers* Vanitas no Carte, but every time I think I’ve got it figured out, it’ll do a little something to impress or make me scratch my head.The soundtrack is a bunch of wandering atmospheric music with nary a hint of Japanesey-ness- think Vinland Saga without the emotional swells or melancholy piano, but it grows on you and fits the show fairly well.The vampire-human conflict starts out seeming absurdly simple: vampires are evil and love art and music so humans hate art and music and are also near extinction, and while this is never really overturned, it’s not the main conflict that our leading ladies go through, so it’s forgivable.

Xanthe's and Larissa's voice acting was out of this world, easily on par with the japanese cast. It may have even been an 8 had there not been so many plot holes.But after that the whole thing fell apart. They kept using the same plot gimmicks to pull at your emotions, and when Fine's about to die by the 5th time it gets old real fast. So that's why this wound up as a 4.I'll rewatch up to episode 3 to get the bond between them, but other than that don't...watch past episode 3. watch past episode 3."", 'In the bluntest way I can put it without giving away too much it\'s pretty much Romeo and Juliet, but two girls instead of guy and girl. I won\'t go into detail of what kind of love they share as that would be spoilery. However, given the title, and the trailers, it\'s definitely not Capulet vs Montague, but Vampires vs Soviet-like Military brandishing AK-47s.Story- 7/10It\'s good, not great. I\'ve already read a story like this in the aforementioned Shakespeare reference. And so has practically everyone else either in school at some point or in some Saturday morning cartoon or Hollywood movie. I was...disappointed it was going a route like this.

The couple resides in a version of Earth where most of humanity is forced to live in a fortress. It is evident from the first few minutes that humans have been engaged in a decades-long conflict with the vampire race, which surpasses them both in strength and numbers. If it weren\'t for the use of a large spotlight in the center of the human fortress, and those that surround it, that center would have been destroyed years ago.The war has led humans to prohibit all their ""noisy"" culture (music, movies,...etc.) because ""vampires have superior hearing,"" and therefore a hidden fear of music, especially, arises. Humanity is a closed, cold, and repressed society whose main goal is survival.I find the soundtrack fascinating, and in this work, it has a greater importance than in other works because, as mentioned above, humanity does not listen to anything, and there are kids who don\'t even know what it is. In this regard, the anime manages to immerse you in this ""mud"" with a mix of soundtrack and real music in the film, simply perfect, just as excellent is the animation in general in all five episodes.The two protagonists are well-written, and what they do is believable, which is a great merit of the work. They interact and live in this world. In these five episodes, the studio manages to tell a story that has a beginning, an end, and that is always interesting. It is not afraid to exploit dead times, such as that of a song played on the piano that could be a waste of time, here instead everything serves a purpose.However, there is a problem with the characters\' relationships. As already mentioned, the relationship between the protagonists is well-written and engaging, but unfortunately, the other relationships seem to be developed superficially and unconvincingly, if not even nonexistent. This represents a weak point of the work, as the relationships between the characters can be fundamental for the success of the story and for the empathy that the audience can feel towards it.The series also suffers from a lack of depth in the world and the story that surrounds it. Viewers are thrown into a complex reality without many explanations, and there are too many details of the story that remain unknown or unexplained. Personally, I really liked the world created for this anime, in my opinion, they should have extended the series to fully experience the story and setting.In general, ""Vampire in the Garden"" seems to be a series that has had production and writing problems. Although the result is a good product, and the animation is of high quality.In conclusion, I can say that the plot of this work is original and exciting, it is definitely worth giving it a chance. etc.) because ""vampires have superior hearing,"" and therefore a hidden fear of music, especially, arises.

It gives little backstory. All we know is that a disease created vampires, and they are fighting the warmies (humans). There is also little backstory on Fine, and on Momo. We only see Fine's past lover a few times on a couple flashbacks, and they are very short, giving us little detail. The ending was predictable with the amount of episodes, it was bland and boring. I think they could have included a better fight. I don't think the story is too...unique per say, you see this kind of story in much better detail in other vampire animes. Some parts where good there is just too much missing. Would recommend if you want an anime with beautiful animation, but be prepared for disappointment in the plot. unique per say, you see this kind of story in much better detail in other vampire animes.

The story was supposed to be tragic but it just ended in a weird way. Don't really recommend it unless you just want a short anime to pass the time.Although like I already said it has a really pretty animation and unique style, it's really fluid and the story is somewhat related to music and the main melody is really cool.It's also really weird how vampires are killed and the main character just keeps...on standing like nothing harms her, she does die in the end but it was really strange and it didn’t make me feel anything at all. on standing like nothing harms her, she does die in the end but it was really strange and it didn’t make me feel anything at all."", ""I really liked it, except for the lack of character development and the rushed feeling. I think despite the lack of time to develop characters they were good enough where it made up for it a little. It's a shame because I feel like if it had gotten even just 10 episodes instead of 5 they could have been really really good, the music, animation, sound design, and artwork were all very good, the story did a good job conveying emotion and even without proper character development I was still pretty invested. Just wish there would have been more meat to it. It's definitely worth...a watch. a watch."", ""It was a good show there is no shame in that but we can all tell they were trying to have this a runaway hit this year they some what nailed it but missed in other ways.Look the characters, setting are not the problem I think, it's that we are not given enough time in this world with the characters to understand everything now after you first watch most will say that was awesome but after people think about for a while like I did some holes become apparent. They should of had it at 7-8 episodes because the story happens way too quickly. We...don't a full feel of the main plot/side plots and the same goes for the characters. I kept asking what happen to this person or that person that show would somewhat give an answer but it would be either hand wave that why kind of thing or nothing would be said or shown.

To begin with the story, the premise is ironclad; A world where Mankind is on the verge of extinction due to the advent of vampires, and the Humans have built a soviet-style megastructure in an attempt to keep them at bay. The story itself which uses this foundation to build upon is actually pretty standard, and while it's still quite enjoyable it's mostly carried by aesthetic pull, and due to the rather typical nature of the story arc the chances of a rewatch are low,...but even then wouldn't be because of the story. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as it is indeed an enjoyable watch regardless, just not very remarkable in terms of its story. The strengths of Vampire in the Garden lie elsewhere, like in its art. The art of Vampire in the Garden is absolutely stunning most of the time. The sheer visual impact of the Human and vampire factions had me floored as soon as they're established in Episode 1. The austere, soviet-style aesthetics of the Human world, coupled with the rich, opulent, almost 19th century aesthetics of the vampire world, makes for a positively exquisite contrast. Not only do you have the multilayered contrast of military and aristocracy, modernism and classicism, and of course, Human and vampire, but also some insanely unique contrasts, like the Soviet and Tsarist aesthetics that each society is clearly based on. To speak again more broadly of the art as a whole, the backgrounds are intricate and breathtaking, down to the smallest industrial bolt in an austere assembly line or an intricate samovar in the corner of a vampiric study, all the way to the great mechanized mass of the Human's tower of light or the richly decorated ballrooms of the vampire colonies, filled with intricately carved wood and finely-dressed partygoers. This immaculate aesthetic sense permeates the anime, and can be found in almost everything, from the action-packed and expertly choreographed action scenes to the portrayal of squad-based battle tactics. However, not everything here receives such high praise, unfortunately. In fact, the 20 percent or so that is bad is so bad that the rest of the enchanting art direction cannot even hope to distract from it. This show's two greatest sins are the 'dreaded mask', and unwatchable CG. The dreaded mask is something that I've noticed happens in anime every now and then, where characters either cannot express emotion correctly or express it strangely due to poor facial animation, leading to it looking like they're wearing masks. This is especially true here. I've never seen this style of facial animation used, and while it's certainly unique and distinctive, and works most of the time, when it doesn't work it really doesn't, and ruins the moment whenever it flares up. Sometimes it looks like their eyes are looking in different directions, and other times their faces are contorted to the point of being almost funny in moments when the mood should be sad or horrifying. But, while that is a problem which is at least understandable, the CG is downright unforgivable. Put simply, this CG is some of the worst I've ever seen. This CG would have been bad 10 years ago, it even barely meets the standards of 20 years ago, and I don't know how they let it go to release like this. The CG car scene, the CG snow, and the times they animated the flying vampires in rigid, unmoving CG, are all so embarrassing for the show and nauseating for the viewer that it's simply mind boggling that the people who made the drawn art and the CG people were even on the same team. It's almost like the CG people thought they were working on a direct-to-DVD Pixar ripoff, while everyone else functioned at a level of aesthetic genius. I've never seen this level of internal artistic conflict in anime, and it's strange to say the least. Moving on, the sound is quite good, the sounds of life meeting all the standards for quality, while the music and voice acting are both above average, pairing nicely with the visuals. Finally, the characters are pretty good, and while they aren't groundbreaking they're certainly compelling enough to maintain a certain level of investment throughout. Overall, Vampire in the Garden is an anime which excels in many places and falls behind in others, but regardless is an engaging watch that I firmly recommend to any fans of vampire anime or Russian aesthetics. but even then wouldn't be because of the story.

In Vampire in the Garden, in a way, they still are: they have fun, they do what they want, they kill and eat people and don\'t give a damn. So why can\'t I actually like this thing?The story is about these two girls, Fine, who is a vampire queen, and Momo, who is the daughter of a human general, that take a like in each other. However, vampires and humans are at war, and because of this the world as we know it is reaching its...end. So, Momo and Fine want to find a place, called Eden, where vampires and humans can live together peacefully.The plot sounds good and the background is interesting. What frustrates me is that the series never reaches its full potential.When I reached the fourth episode, I thought like ""ok, next episode it\'s the end of part 1, then we\'ll wait some months for part 2"". Instead, episode 5 just ends the thing and it\'s really anti-climatic. I think that there was still a lot to say, about this world, about these characters. The fact that music is forbidden because vampires have a very good hearing and that, with time, paintings and statues too started being seen as ""vampire culture"" and as such, they are forbidden too, sounded a bit strange, but it was good. Momo wants to live a ""real"" life, and what kind of life would be interesting, for her, without pleasures like art and entertainment? This is not ""living"", it\'s just ""surviving"".

If you like vampires stories and wlw (I guess) you will definitly enjoy it. The visual is pretty amazing and the sound is quite as good. However, the story is nothing new, and is definitly rushed, leaving little time for the viewer to get to know the characters and their motives. Characters and issues are only introduced on a superficial level, and I wonder if there is only the short lenght of the show to blame for that... I had...a great time nonetheless, but I must admit that the anime did not offer me more than what I expected out of it: stunning visual and a tragic story including a lesbian vampire. a great time nonetheless, but I must admit that the anime did not offer me more than what I expected out of it: stunning visual and a tragic story including a lesbian vampire.', ""I don't write a lot of reviews but I was randomly scrolling through Netflix animes to see what to watch and I watched the little trailer/clip of the show and I was actually intrigued enough to watch which doesn't really happen often. I didn't double check or anything but it's fairly obvious it was done by the same animators who made Boruto which also turned me onto it to be fair.When I originally looked at the reviews before watching it to see what I was getting into, I was a little nervous because of all the mixed reviews. In reality, this is way better than...a lot of things in the similar genre that I've seen. I enjoy it for the short 5 episode story that it is, and I feel like others are looking over that. Vampire in the Garden reminds me a LOT of the anime No. 6 which has a slightly higher score than this anime despite Vampire in the Garden doing a better job with the concept in a shorter amount of time, in my opinion.Both No. 6 and Vampire in the Garden have that slightly dystopian, slightly apocalyptical atmosphere. Both have characters where it is them verses the world, both have some sort of threatening monster the main characters are trying to fight against, both have very subtle lgbtq representation, etc etc. Vampire in the Garden gives a little more simplicity in the story that I think I was looking for in No. 6 and didn't receive. No. 6 was very confusing without a solid idea of what was going on until barely the end. Vampire in the Garden besides the slowly revealed backstory that went pretty smoothly and I felt like I was connecting puzzle pieces with each new reveal verses becoming even more confused. I enjoy how short this was and even though some concepts and characters were trimmed a little short, specifically the uncle and Fine's assistant guy, I believe keeping it short built into the simplicity of it.I would like to try and keep this spoiler free though, so I'll finish off saying that I think this is worth a watch if you're wanting a short story man vs the world with good animation and it doesn't require too much thinking unlike other anime in this similar genre. a lot of things in the similar genre that I've seen.

Of course, however, there are going to be certain humans and vampires who don't conform to the common beliefs of their respective factions. Our protagonist Momo just so happens to be one of these certain humans, and so decides to run away with a vampire named Fine to find a human-vampire paradise.Story: It's nothing to write home about.

A rarity in the modern world where the average anime fails to form its own identity.Too many anime are crop cutouts of overused clichés, and driven by random gimmicks. Just to be clear I think clichés can work when used well, and in the case of Vampire in the Garden, the cliché works extremely well.We all know the vampire story, a elegant creature that feds on blood, fears sunlight with super human strength. You cant get more cliche than a standard vampire story. What makes this anime worth...the investment is that it abandons trying to explain the world, or how things got this way.

This review is based on the second time I watched it so keep this in mind !Story (9)The story is so unique , beautiful , heartwarming and so deep if you follow and understand it well . You may think that it's childish but it's really not ! It includes adults , and it's full mystery too... The story behind the Kirumins , and Both the Mikogami and Hatori families too are so deep , a bit complicated but also so beautiful !! The story mixed both emotional and comedy scenes in a such perfect way !!Art (10)I just adored the Art style of this Anime series , It got even the small details to be so beautiful , cute and matching with outfits and backgrounds ; such as the small cute hearts in Riko and Rimu's (that you won't see that much ) eyes or the stars in Nagisa and Ken's eyes are so cute !! Also the costumes have so much details in it that will keep you starring at them for the whole scene ! I'm pretty sure that you'll love it !Sound (8)The OP even that it's the same for the whole 50 episodes , but it's so freaking catchyyy !!!! You'll never get bored of it ! And I think that it was a good idea to not change it after a few episodes , and I can also say that I didn't skip it for a single time !! I think that it's a kind of wierd Thai song !The  ED themes are so calm and cute , specially the second one ! I really did enjoyed them !The background music is so coool ! It keeps you excited and it really does fit every single scene ! Specially the transformations ones !Character (10)Every single character in this series has its own charm . I don't know how to describe it , for example Riko is a really curious , noisy and courageous person , while her sister is  shy , kind  and deep  and she becomes a totally different person after removing her glasses ( I mean prettier ) .. Ken is special , and also a person who loves challenges a lot and his best friend Tamao is a genius but not a boring person , and he is so funny dealing with his crush on Rimu , and when she thanks him or worry about him , he turns red and his glasses crack ( as metionned in his descreption ) and this two guys with their unique charecters were able to be seen as a main charecter, and the same goes for the other supporting ones ... Adults in this series such as parents , teachers , bulters ... etc are most of the time supporting the group of kids ....Enjoyment (9)I really did enjoyed this series a lot but it's not a ten out of tem enjoyment because of the dissapointing ending ( I don't wanna spoil ) But it's a still one of the best Anime series I've watched ..Overall (10)Long review right ? hahaha shocked when I realized that the version I watched missed so much scenes , and changed some lines ...

I'm pretty sure that you'll love it !Sound (8)The OP even that it's the same for the whole 50 episodes , but it's so freaking catchyyy !!!! You'll never get bored of it ! And I think that it was a good idea to not change it after a few episodes , and I can also say that I didn't skip it for a single time !! I think that it's a kind of wierd Thai song !The  ED themes are so calm and cute , specially the second one ! I really did enjoyed them !The background music is so coool ! It keeps you excited and it really does fit every single scene ! Specially the transformations ones !Character (10)Every single character in this series has its own charm . I don't know how to describe it , for example Riko is a really curious , noisy and courageous person , while her sister is  shy , kind  and deep  and she becomes a totally different person after removing her glasses ( I mean prettier ) .. Ken is special , and also a person who loves challenges a lot and his best friend Tamao is a genius but not a boring person , and he is so funny dealing with his crush on Rimu , and when she thanks him or worry about him , he turns red and his glasses crack ( as metionned in his descreption ) and this two guys with their unique charecters were able to be seen as a main charecter, and the same goes for the other supporting ones ... Adults in this series such as parents , teachers , bulters ... etc are most of the time supporting the group of kids ....Enjoyment (9)I really did enjoyed this series a lot but it's not a ten out of tem enjoyment because of the dissapointing ending ( I don't wanna spoil ) But it's a still one of the best Anime series I've watched ..Overall (10)Long review right ? hahaha"", 'Warning: This is my first time writing a review, so I might stumble over my words a bit. English is also not my first language, so my grammar might not be the best. I tend to ramble, but hopefully I managed to make this short and sweet.This review is spoiler-free!When I first heard of this anime, I was a bit hesitant to watch it. The costumes looked a bit weird to me, and the synopsis made me think this was a parody, which is not something I usually enjoy.However, as I am a huge magical girl fan, I couldn’t just pretend this didn’t...exist. I plan to watch as much anime of this genre as possible, after all. So I gave it a small chance.“Two episodes” I told myself. “I’m going to watch just two episodes to see if I find it interesting.”It did not disappoint. I was hooked halfway through the first episode.The main characters are adorable and full of personality; the story is intriguing; the ‘villains’ are funny and silly at times and even the costumes grew on me. It’s a shame how underrated this is, even amongst fans of the genre.All in all, this was incredibly relaxing to watch, and I couldn’t recommend it more if you like magical girls and wholesome, charming anime aimed towards children. If this anime caught your attention but you are unsure if you should watch it… Go for it! Who knows, you might fall in love with it as much as I did.That is all I wanted to say regarding this. Thank you so much for reading and bye-bye! exist. I plan to watch as much anime of this genre as possible, after all.

Akuyaku Reijou Level 99: Watashi wa Ura-Boss desu ga Maou dewa Arimasen,https://myanimelist.net/anime/54837/Akuyaku_Reijou_Level_99__Watashi_wa_Ura-Boss_desu_ga_Maou_dewa_Arimasen,"[""Now this is unexpected.Unexpected in how good this story actually is. As we've seen a number of shows, where they try to escape the red flags of doom, or don't care and flaunt and flash their OPness to the world. Or even those that seem real generic, that you just roll your eyes and look away. Sure, the context of story might be decent, but you've seen it a number of times before, and each time it gets less and less interesting. This on the other hand, adds an interesting twist to the product, which makes it far more enjoyable as a product, then it...would have, if it just followed the sual.Story and characters: 8What I really love with this, is that it doesn't just jump right into the meat and potatoes. If anything, it's like as if they gave a tutorial of the product first, and showcased what it's all about, before diving into the true main talking point of the show itself. As if it's a long cutscene, before we get you, and you get to create your character kind of vibe. A well done twist of the usual being moved into another world/game.But what stands out to me, is the writing of this. It's not like the usual, and really stands out more. On one hand, it'll give you good characters that mesh well together, even if it can be a tiny bit pushy in some areas, but it's more understandable given the nature of the built up world. But imagine instead of a usual over the top full on she's front and center cause she's the popular one, here it's more the opposite, something which our main character is really trying her hardest to avoid. It's like you've been given the main character role, but instead of going with the main story path, you go and do the side missions first, and try your best to avoid any connection to the actual main story that is presented here. That touch alone for me, adds so much interest and value, that after watching the third episode, I'm left wanting to jump to Manga or such to read more. Props to the anime.Art and sound: 8Quality all round. The animation is solid, and there is real attention to detail to make things really stand out and presented well. Combine that with great voice acting, and a quality sound team. Meshed all together to make a great blendf for the product. The colours used for the magic attacks really left me impress for an example of all this. Just shows the attention to detail that has been laid out for this anime.I'm really impressed by this show, and if the first three episodes give me that much hope, and wanting more, then it's going to be a great show to continue watching, so you should watch it too. would have, if it just followed the sual.Story and characters: 8What I really love with this, is that it doesn't just jump right into the meat and potatoes.

Characters don\'t really have very much characterization:The entire plot tries to focus around the next hero\'s party, which makes sense why they would work towards that because the plot proclaims that the demon king will attack. The problem with this isn\'t the...fact that the characters do stupid nonsensical stuff, the issue is that the story doesn\'t actually focus around the main character ""Yumiella Dolkness"" for a decent portion of the series, especially after episode 6.This is a problem since most of the ""hero\'s party"" are somewhat useless characters that don\'t make a difference to the plot. The only characters that actually somewhat matter to the story are; Yumiella, Alicia, and maybe Edwin. The other hero party members, William and Oswald, are basically all meant to draw a fake romantic conflict between Alicia and Edwin. That being said, there simply isn\'t enough time for you to get enough development to like these side characters to actually get to really liking them, plus it actively destroys the MC\'s own character development and likability since there is less development and screen time actually showing these characters gain traits.2. The plot feels a bit skewed:This almost entirely only comes into effect at the end of the season, the finale with the demon king was very uneventful for an ending, and didn\'t come across as all of what it should\'ve been. The last episode felt rushed, while the rest of the series felt very slow, possibly due to the amount of time the anime focused onto side characters, as I said in #1, but it also doesn\'t help that the characters were pushed out to fight a character that the viewer has no knowledge of, and the anime didn\'t make a good impression with the demon king.This isn\'t to say that this show was any bit unwatchable, it\'s actually pretty good. The lack of distinct focus on the plot and narrative really just hits this show right in the guts, making it feel much less worthwhile than contemporaries.Overall, this is a good anime though, it just has some issues, and had a lot of potential.🗿 7.5/10 🗿 fact that the characters do stupid nonsensical stuff, the issue is that the story doesn\'t actually focus around the main character ""Yumiella Dolkness"" for a decent portion of the series, especially after episode 6.This is a problem since most of the ""hero\'s party"" are somewhat useless characters that don\'t make a difference to the plot.

This has been a phrase ongoing and about for just about any kind of source work needed to inject a fresh look into genres that with so many potential formulas, has become pretty much copy-and-paste ideas, which give a sour taste at the afterthought. This is pretty much true in all sorts of media, even the AniManga industry, and especially when new...genres take flight and the potential is there, no matter how good or bad it is. For the Isekai genre, that is the Otome Game/Villainess theme, which has seen its share of highs and lows. This season, the Villainess theme is on a high, thanks to novelists Touko Amekawa\'s Loop 7-kaime a.k.a 7th Time Loop and this show: Satori Tanabata\'s only work that is Akuyaku Reijou Level 99: Watashi wa Ura-Boss desu ga Maou dewa Arimasen a.k.a Villainess Level 99: I May Be the Hidden Boss but I\'m Not the Demon Lord.""Acting like an Otome Game, but also breaking its fundamentals"". I love how Villainess Level 99 just wants to make its viewers think they\'re on a traditional route, only to give a middle finger and subvert expectations soon thereafter. This is quite the common theme going into this show, which features its titular MC of Yumiella Dolkness who does the whole boring Isekai reincarnation shtick but remembers her roots of playing an Otome RPG, only that she\'s not the specified demon lord, but only a hidden boss that still stands in the way of its titular hero and her companions on the tried-and-true ""We must defeat the Demon Lord"" objective/goal. The thing is, her mindset of being dived into the game and living a peaceful life away from trouble, that is a problem on so many levels: her dark hair and dark magic which are considered vile by the kingdom and its inhabitants, and literally everyone will stand at least 10 feet away from her, even if she doesn\'t have any evil intentions. So then, she decides to level-grind for her entire childhood, only to realize that she\'s quite literally maxed out her character status at Level 99 once she reaches into school, breaking the expectations of her entire magic academy (since Level 10 is the highest expected). With the consequences laid out, Yumiella must now find her place within this ""new"" Otome Game plot, prepare everyone for the forthcoming of the Demon Lord and negate the preconceptions of her dark hair and magic. What a wrench into the ""quiet and peaceful"" life, for Yumiella has duties to do, all while trying to get along with the people around her.""The gamer soul is fueled not for the main story, but on side quests"". This is pretty much Yumiella\'s MO workaround when it comes to the traditional Otome Game story of ""Light Magic and the Hero"", where she has to now satisfy a lot of requirements to get back to her pre-programmed route, while hastening the background routes in the process.Let\'s start with the assumed hero and her companions: Alicia Ehnleit is the Hero of the game, and obviously the anti-thesis of Yumiella due to her light magic. However, like the rest of the student body, she is assumed to be a max of Level 10 at best given her rare light magic, something which Yumiella finds concerning because of her fate to face the Demon Lord much later in the game. At first, both the hero and the villainess do not get along (which SHOULD be obvious) due to their disparities of light and darkness, and Alicia is left with the capture targets, the original love interests of the game, which now programmed with the fact that Yumiella has to basically rewind herself back to where she was within the game, it really is a distaste of proportions leaving her even more vulnerable to face the Demon Lord in the future.Interestingly enough, where the capture targets are supposed to assist in the original game, the new timeline basically took them for scraps and made them very ignorant and selfish, separating both Alicia and Yumiella in their hopeful collaboration and constantly harassing the latter about faking her true level while smoothing relations with the former, which is the total opposite of what the usual Otome Game RPG will be like. Starting with Edwin Valschein, he\'s the second prince of the kingdom, and a magic swordsman with the affinity of all classical elements: fire, wind, earth and water. His two attendants are the magic prodigy of Oswald Grimsarde, which can handle all elements better than Edwin, as well as William Ares, a master swordsman. It\'s easy to refer to these 3 young upstanding but self-centered nobles as The Three Stooges, because they do have their reputation behind their names, though this is nothing but one word for Yumiella: catastrophe. Edwin is the least of faults since he only abuses Yumiella verbally, unlike both Oswald and William, where they strike at Yumiella physically, giving her a taste of their superiority complex. Of course, Yumiella doesn\'t mind, since all she has is her Level 99 skills and dark magic to speak for itself, which as the story progresses, made her more a viable target, but also a valuable comrade who is the only magic user who can face demons her size.They say, ""revenge is sweet"", and this is none further placed than through Eleonora Hillrose, the daughter of her father Duke Hillrose, the leader of the noble faction. Everyone in the magic academy has a side they stand on, but this does not apply to Yumiella as the neutral party, and this causes said girl to pick on her to try her best to recruit Yumiella into her faction. Conversely, she is into Prince Edwin by the lovestruck and naivety of feels, but as is with the Three Stooges, she also has her clique to go by. Though this would turn out to be a false facade as they are also jealous of her upbringing and are willing to do anything to lose her standing with Edwin, which Yumiella has to come to her rescue due to the common interest and love for dragons, citing that she is far better than the ""clique"" she has, thereby earning her as a best friend.""Dragons chomp people\'s heads for a greeting, as well as a romance subtext plotline between the unlikeliest of characters."" Speaking of dragons and best friend, this subversion might just be the highlight of Villainess Level 99 as a whole. We all know Yumiella as the Hidden Boss but not a Demon Lord, and she has a loyal follower: Patrick Ashbatten. The son of a lord who\'s good at wind magic, he\'s the only one who didn\'t coward himself out of the fear of Yumiella\'s true Level 99 status. As the story progresses, Patrick trying to understand Yumiella\'s unusual and peculiar method of doing things that could result in the death of her and/or others, he just couldn\'t crack her head and thought process of everything she does, even becoming her caretaker in the process. Despite that, where the female Hero typically has her love interests, this time, EVEN the villainess ALSO has her love interest, though an obvious one-sided affair but with potential. The aloof Yumiella, who is intensely dedicated to her leveling-up craft, and yet have the Kuudere trouble of the terms of expression despite meaning well with her kind-heartedness, the one who holds no loyalty to kingdom politics nor family (who basically shunned her), as well as the confident Patrick, they\'re the rarest of couples, yet their banter makes the relationship work against all odds. Also, Ryu may be a dragon that Alicia is supposed to find during a game event, but Yumiella by hook or by crook, hacked that event and made it hers, nurturing it with dark magic, leading to its dark appearance just like her master. And like Yumiella, it too is regarded as a source of calamity, but it takes after her and is properly tamed and affectionate to everyone. But it\'s greeting of nonchalantly chomping heads can be seen as one of the many out-of-pocket gag comedy things in the show that is hilarious and trust me, it never gets old.I\'ve expected of this when it came to the production: studio Jumondou may be a fairly old studio being established right at the tail end of December 2009, and has recently started working primarily as a studio since Spring 2022\'s Kono Healer, Mendokusai a.k.a Don\'t Hurt Me, My Healer!. 2 years on, and I\'ve come to accept that like last season\'s Potion-danomi de Ikinobimasu! a.k.a I Shall Survive Using Potions!, the studio has not one single prowess other than it being just like many B or C-tier studios out there. Regardless of past works, Villainess Level 99 being its 3rd main show, and I can finally say that Jumondou has hit its stride in adaptation quality. Yes, the usage of CGI is still terrible, however, with that said, this is easily the best effort that the studio has put out thus far. So, great job to director Minoru Yamaoka and the staff team for putting their best forth into this adaptation, especially to legendary series composer Fumihiko Shimo.The one thing lacking about Villainess Level 99 is in the sound department. Granted, there isn\'t much, but what is here, still is decent to good in acceptability. The former singer of Myth & Roid, Mayu Maeshima, she may have her strengths for Re:Zero theme songs, and this show...is no different at all. Outside of Re:Zero, ""Love or Hate?"" is easily one of the best OP songs of the season with its dark-sounding blitz and power, and I love it to pieces. Yet another out-of-pocket moment, comes with the ED song with the pairing of Yumiella and Eleonora boasting about the love of their lives, I for sure as hell, did not expect the level of tenacity when it comes to professing romance, even going as far as to make it a song. Simply ingenious (though the song is rather meh).""Expect the unexpected"". That\'s all I\'ll say about Villainess Level 99, and it\'s such a while that I haven\'t been able to be entertained this much, let alone a sub-genre that in my opinion, has been mindlessly jacked up like its Isekai/fantasy genre counterpart.

The anime starts overflowing with clichés in every direction, but it\'s intentional and strategic, in line with the work\'s synopsis. I had never heard anything about it, but it seems to have a lot of potential. If you read the synopsis and started watching the episode, you might have had the same reaction as me... ""the synopsis is from another anime""... like...

Maybe its the right time to finally realize that female isekai is not necessarily supposed to be about winning out some guy (or a girl)? Maybe some girls also want to be self-sufficient and powerful enough? And yeah, Yumiella doesn't try to maintain good relationship with everyone, and its not because she's stupid and supposed to get you annoyed and angry (as stated in some reviews) but because some people just don't think spending time and resources on people they don't like is reasonable if they have power and possibility not to do so.Otherwise, I reckon animation and music were ok, on a level expected of such a show I would say. Except for those hideous 3D dragons in the latest episodes of course.

First thing that is pretty inconsequential but actually pisses me off is the long and overly specific titles. It is a title, not a premise. Why couldn’t this just be called Villainess Level 99? That’s all we need. It tells us the main character and the premise of them being OP. If we want to know more we could read the synopsis or, I don’t know, watch the fucking show. This next complaint might just be a cultural difference but it is the utter unoriginality in anime....And what I mean by this is that there is an entire genre to “getting trapped in a otome video game as the villainess”. This is such an oddly specific concept and yet for some reason, there are countless anime and manga on it, each with just a tiny little caveat that makes it ‘unique’. That’s the extent of the creativity that goes into these shows. It’s the same thing except ‘she’s op in this one’ or, ‘she’s in love with the hero’. It’s the same damn thing. I have watched the first episode of every anime that came out this season and 90% of them were isekai or some fantasy world setting. I only finished 3 of those shows. Everything is just a tweaked version of the other. But the unoriginality doesn’t stop there. Because every anime is an adaptation of a manga. It’s a teaser saying to read the manga or for people who are just too lazy to read them. It’s a waste of an entire medium. Saying the show is unoriginal is not fair because actually, it’s the manga that’s unoriginal. On top of that, the premise of entering an otome game is unoriginal. It truly is just a self-insert. It’s looking at another person's work and saying “I would have done this if I was the character.” Every person thinks that and if you really want to see shit like that play out for whatever reason, go to Wattpad. Why are these actual studio productions? I feel like most manga now are just fanfictions. That’s why they are all power fantasies. It’s unoriginal and hinges on validating and playing out fantasies instead of actual compelling storytelling. This show is nothing. Every character is bland, it’s inoffensive, it’s predictable (it ended exactly as they said it would 3 episodes prior), it gave you the mindless rush of “yeah, show the people who doubt you!”, the cgi sucks dick and I’ll probably forget it exists by tomorrow. The only reason it’s so high is because it’s just inoffensive. I don’t hate it, I enjoyed parts of it. I don’t need to talk about specifics because of how unoriginal it is.

Some parts that would take over half an hour of reading, would be covered in less than a minute of animation, some parts entirely skipped.Since I know what was missed, I can't honestly say if things will feel out of place to someone who didn't read the source material, but I have...to say that from my perspective its just very rushed.If I were to judge the story only on its merits I'd give this a 9. But I had to do a -1 for the rushing, and another -1 for animation quality.The production value was pretty low, it was obviously done on the cheap side. It's watchable enough if you are interested in the story, but if you are the type to want to watch for pretty visuals, this anime isn't for you.

From the few Otome game anime that I've watched, it never clicked right. It was always a bit too girlish and unoriginal. But then, out of the blue, a new fighter joined the arena, it's called... *clears throat* Villainess Level 99 : I May Be The Hidden Boss But I'm Not The Demon Lord ! (At this point in this current day and age,...it's not that much of a long name isn't it ?). After watching this anime for the whole winter 2024 season, I came to the conclusion that this anime was quite enjoyable, I even learned what 99 is in japanese with the amount of times it's said in the anime, “Kyu.ju.Kyu”To start with, instead of doing things cringy, it understands what it is and makes meta jokes about the average Otome game story, how it's generally pretty shit and easy to foresee what's gonna happens next, added to the base fact that those anime are generally girls getting truck-kun'ed into their favourite Otome game that they played on the switch the night before. For somes anime, it's just one minute at the start and then becomes irrelevant into the main story, making it kinda just like a fantasy ? Well, this anime clearly isn't just all that, Yumiella keeps refering to her massive knowledge of having finished the game and 100% it to make everything goes as smooth as she wants, but then.. you get to see that the events gets changed with her actions, how will she adapt to this !? You'll need to watch this anime to find out. But for real, the comedy is on point and is generally nicely sprinkled sometimes in the anime, Yumiella is also a badass character, since she's level 99 (the max), it's basically impossible to stop her, her darkness magic is unrivalled  and makes up for a lot of events unfolding in the story, like imagine that : in the beginning, we get told that the most op character so far is level 60 only, and it's exponentially way more powerful the higher the level is. Of course, fucking op characters was a novelty in the Isekai genre in 2016, but the mix of people scared, people who wish to get her powers, friends made along the way, the fact that she wants to stay lowkey all makes up for something nice. There's always fucking epic magic fights every few episodes, all in the goal to kill the demon-lord (how original indeed). To somewhat wrap up what makes the story not bad in my opinion is also the other side characters, they are all quite different with each their goal, and somes character development is made throuhough all of the 12 episodes which wraps up nicely two whole years of high school.To continue, all of the parts around the meat, the ones that support the story, the visuals and sounds, they aren't revolutionary, but they are fine. Of course, considering that this anime is made by Jumondo, who made one of the worst visually appealing anime of 2022, Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer, we wouldn't expect something made by the best of the best, which is also explained by the 3D monsters (shocking I know from a somewhat shitty anime, but as us shitty anime watchers, we can go through this and find the small fun parts of it) used in the anime. The other visuals are honestly fine, it keeps a consistent visual (which is always great to have, I'm looking at you COTE) which is quite polished, you could argue that the emotions aren't well represented on the faces, but it's hard to do that when the premise is that the MC is as apathetic as possible, which also makes up for somes interesting moment xD, but that's the initial goal. It also kinda uses chibi a little too much which may be a way to cut corners, but if it's to keep the rest decent, I'm all in. On the other side, I wanna mention how both the OP and ED are fucking bangers and are somes of the best this season imo. OP sang by Mayu Maeshima, who was in Myth & Roid before, who did a few Re:Zero song and even did the last OP of it by herself, so it was a certified banger. The ending is more special, a girl singing suki and dancing is an easy recipe for greatness, or should I say Dolkness ?To conclude, this anime isn't boring, and that's the good part ! I had a fun blast watching it, it gave me hope and made me interested again in the Villainess genre, with it's somewhat basic everything, but good execution overall. It might not be the shiny stone or unbeknownst to everyone the best anime this season (when you see Frieren having 0,3 score higher than FMAB, it's hard to beat hihi). But as something pretty chill to watch and simple, it worked well and I'd recommend you to watch it as a good introduction to this genre or perhaps if like me you had lost hope long ago and cameback to the original 50 words long isekai name reincarnation into another world with the most overpowered powers in this another world for christ sake. it's not that much of a long name isn't it ?).

In addition to make things funnier, Yumiella has ""broken common sense"" and so she often does something that makes everyone else panicked with her OP skill although she...does not have intention to boast or to show how OP she is. She is well... a bit of crazy and twisted (but in fun way).This is also considered anime that has reverse harem genre but (fortunately for male audience) the males are not going for (crazy, twisted) MC.

If you’re at all a fan of the genre, you’ll find this one entertaining.The biggest thing separating Akuyaku99 stand out from its competitors is the MC, Yumiella. Whereas most protagonists in this genre are based on the main character of a video game, she’s based on a secret boss and wants to stay that way. She...wants nothing to do with the spotlight and just wants to live out her days in peace. Sadly, due to her being extremely OP she’s not really able to. Seeing her try to stay lowkey and not bother anyone, while getting harassed by royalty, nobles and the general populace literally for just existing was definitely an experience. Her deadpan comedy and bland facial expressions make everything 100x funnier too. Imagine the entire world overreacting to the most basic of things while a character is just sitting there with a straight face wondering what’s going on.It’s so enjoyable seeing Yumiella try to get the spotlight on the actual protagonist of the game. The relationship that develops between the two is quite wholesome and I also liked seeing Yumiella make everyone who assumed she was evil, based on preconceptions of her power level and hair, feel really dumb.That leads me into my one big issue with this series, the supporting characters can be quite stupid. Everyone besides Patrick and Yumiella are cognitively challenged, I swear. If you know someone is the strongest person on the face of the earth, why are you provoking them, harassing them and just being a general ass to them? Yumiella receives so much hate purely for existing due to the insecurity, jealousy and fear of most of the supporting characters. It was mind boggling at times.The other issue I have is the animation. The CGI in particular is not great, and it shows. The series can get away with it because it’s not really action oriented, but in scenes with Yumiella’s dragon, it definitely shows. The animation in general is also pretty bad, but the comedy and Yumiella as an MC makes up for it for the most part.While not Konosuba levels of hilarious, seeing Yumiella deal with all the stupid people around her and just trying to lay low is very funny. If you’re looking for a good laugh and want a villainess show that doesn’t just focus on romance and traditional Shoujosei tropes, this is one for you.Akuyaku99 gets 8/10 wants nothing to do with the spotlight and just wants to live out her days in peace.

The protagonist is the face of the work and she doesn't need anyone else to make it entertaining. To exemplify what the dynamics of this work is like, let me use as a reference a game that we can all know, Pokemon. Imagine for a moment that you are already champion of the league, that you have all your Pokémon...at level 100 and you decide to return to route 1. On this route it occurs to you to look into the eyes of a small bug catcher who decides to challenge you to a duel. . He takes out his best combatant which is a level 5 Caterpie and you can't do anything except take out your level 100 Charizard. The only thing that will happen is that you will mop the floor with the poor rival. Yumiella is the level 100 Charizard and the rest of the characters are level 5 Caterpies, the only thing Yumiella can do, even if she restrains herself, is make fools of the rest of the characters who dare to challenge her.Jumondo is a studio that I didn't know about but I liked how they worked on the work, especially with the chibi models of the characters. It is what gave more charisma and personality to the work because they contributed a lot to that trait of naivety and innocence of our protagonist. The work may have negative aspects such as not using other characters in their entirety, but its intention is not to tell a story with them, the true intention is that they are cannon fodder to make Yumiella look good. The story is not trying to be ambitious so it can be forgiven for these kinds of details.In conclusion, Akuyaku Reijou lv99, if you let yourself be carried away by the atmosphere it proposes, if you are convinced by the humor they use and if you get attached to the protagonist, it can easily become a comfort anime. One of those animes that you would like to revisit even once a year. Because both the novel and the manga are still airing, it is unknown if the anime will decide to continue the story. Even if they decide not to do it and leave it as a single season, the ending is round and closed enough to be satisfied with what they gave us until the last chapter. So far this theme of a girl who is reincarnated as a villain has not disappointed me and I hope that future stories continue along the same lines. at level 100 and you decide to return to route 1.

It\'s not exactly groundbreaking stuff - we\'re talking your classic Isekai Demon Lord Slaying with a sprinkle of Otome and Comedy thrown in. It\'s the kind of plot you\'ve probably seen before.The animation? It\'s decent, nothing mind-blowing, but definitely not bad either. I\'d say it\'s a solid 7 out of 10. You won\'t be wowed by it, but it\'s smooth enough to keep you engaged.Now, let\'s address the standout feature of the show: Yumiella\'s undeniable cuteness. Without a doubt, she deserves a perfect 10 out of 10 in this regard. From her endearing character...design to her Boss aura and stoic, phlegmatic facial expression,  Her interactions with other characters, particularly with Patrick, add a layer of charm and warmth to the series.And speaking of Patrick, he undeniably earns his title as the ""best boy"" with a solid 10 out of 10. His dynamic with Yumiella is a highlight of the show, providing moments of genuine emotion and humor.Despite my personal inclination to give it a 7 out of 10 due to my fondness for Yumiella, I must acknowledge that this score might be biased. While the story may not break new ground, and the animation isn\'t groundbreaking, the undeniable charm of its characters, particularly Yumiella\'s cuteness and Patrick\'s endearing presence, make it a worthwhile watch. design to her Boss aura and stoic, phlegmatic facial expression,  Her interactions with other characters, particularly with Patrick, add a layer of charm and warmth to the series.And speaking of Patrick, he undeniably earns his title as the ""best boy"" with a solid 10 out of 10.

I was nicely surprised with the characters , Yumellia...( my aunt) is my fav character of the season easily with her socially akward personality , intimidating presence and sometimes cute interactions, Patrick the love interest who went from this beta male like guy to one of the strongest characters in order to rizz her , the deutaragonist Alicia is the happy go lucky shoujo heroine ( she is overhated tbh ) and her reverse harem of douchbags lol , and there is the stupid ojousama ofc which I heard will get her arc later , and finally the most notable character the final boss who i thought was gonna be a generic demon , but  turns out to he was one of the better characters , I wished he had more screen time .I surprisingly really liked the tracks they used especially the main one with all it remixes and some noticeable others too , pretty rare for these kind of low budget shows . Speaking of low budget , the presentation is decent at best   artstyle is a downgrade from the manga which itself is a downgrade for the LN , majority of monsters are cgi ( at least its better than the shield hero turtle lol ) , my biggest issue with the show tbh .I heard they didn't follow the source material which means we probably aren't getting a s2 , but I will definelty check the manga after it reaches later volumes of the LN .

Honestly, this is a bit of a cliche.The character designs are all made in detail, even if they are NPCs.Especially for male characters, usually in anime with an Otome game theme, the male characters are made too flashy or you could say Ikemen. But it's not like that here, so for me, who hates Ikemen characters, this anime really suits me.In my opinion, the storyline is not too convoluted, and...not too focused on how the game's storyline progresses.There isn't much drama, let alone telling about the past which isn't too important.The comedy is also quite funny, especially when you become a Chibi character, although most of the cuteness consists of innocent Yumiella.The main weakness is in the Action section, if only this section were made more epic, this anime would definitely be the best.Especially in some scenes and depictions such as Dragons and several other enemies which were created using stiff CGI, the impression becomes strange when looking at it.There is nothing different about the magic used, for example using Black Hole, Dark Lance and various other types of magic which are already cliche. not too focused on how the game's storyline progresses.There isn't much drama, let alone telling about the past which isn't too important.The comedy is also quite funny, especially when you become a Chibi character, although most of the cuteness consists of innocent Yumiella.The main weakness is in the Action section, if only this section were made more epic, this anime would definitely be the best.Especially in some scenes and depictions such as Dragons and several other enemies which were created using stiff CGI, the impression becomes strange when looking at it.There is nothing different about the magic used, for example using Black Hole, Dark Lance and various other types of magic which are already cliche."", 'Although it may turn out to be a generic otome story where the protagonist enters a game, turning out to be the villain and has to escape the terrible end of her character.It turns out to be an entertaining story, easy to watch, the chibi parts are very cute and I feel that it comes out a little out of the ordinary since the protagonist is not looking for romance, she only focuses on completing the story by helping everyone level up to finish the story as soon as possible to live a peaceful life, although there are parts in which she implies that she...does not want to interfere in the plot of the story, several times she is misunderstood by her companions and not being very expressive ends up causing bad things. misunderstandings and live a peaceful life does not want to interfere in the plot of the story, several times she is misunderstood by her companions and not being very expressive ends up causing bad things. misunderstandings and live a peaceful life', 'If you\'re looking for something fun to watch that doesn\'t have too much angst (although it does have some), this may be a good anime to try. It\'s also a good anime for people who can\'t get enough of the ""reincarnated as a villainess"" trope that\'s become so popular recently. That being said, there are a few details to keep in mind while watching it.The first of these is the animation. For some reason the animators decided to use a mix of 3D and 2D animation for this anime. When the 3D animation (generally used for non-humans) is used in a scene with 2D animation...(human characters or landscapes), the animation styles clash. The anime lost a star on my rating for this reason.That being said, the story made up for the poorer quality of animation. While it didn\'t have too much that was unexpected (the overpowered, reincarnated villainess does her best to survive when she thinks she\'s supposed to die), the story was quite enjoyable. It also uses the ""reincarnated villainess"" idea slightly differently than what\'s been done in other anime. For example, it doesn\'t give the main character (aka. the villainess) the heroine\'s harem, which some audience members might appreciate. (Note: this doesn\'t mean there\'s no romance at all, but it\'s also not the main plot point of the story) (human characters or landscapes), the animation styles clash.

There\'s a small amount of rather questionable CGI being used, but luckily it is very minor indeed. Many of the action scenes also lack proper animations, but as a whole it still brings just enough to create an enjoyable experience.The show also makes liberal use of cute chibi art for comedic...effect, which is probably my favourite part visually. Chibi is never not cute.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 9/10------------------------------------------Overall sound and music is fine, but voice acting, especially that of the protagonist really elevates the experience in my opinion. The heroine (or villainess in this case, I guess) VA really brings the character alive, with an amazing mix of deadpan delivery and genuine excitement. The contrast of switching between speech and inner monologue creates some really interesting dialogue that makes following the story and the character a lot more fun.Story - 8/10-------------The story as a whole isn\'t overly noteworthy as this very concept has been done numerous times in the past. A young woman dies and gets re-incarnated into a recent Otome Game she played. However, the details and execution is quite fun. Despite being an Otome Game based Isekai, our protagonist does away with the whole concept and instead we have a rational and capable main character that decides to change her pre-determined fate through raw power alone.Turns out, she\'s not much of an Otome Gamer, instead being better described as an RPG power-leveler who enjoys grinding for power and items more than anything.Overpowered MC theme is also very common in these types of shows, but this anime takes a slightly different twist where the powers of the protagonist are not hidden. From episode 1, her full power is revealed, which creates for quite the different experience than in most similar shows.I wouldn\'t say it\'s necessarily for the better, but I can appreciate the variety.The story also features a romance sub-plot which is luckily kept fairly low key, as it would otherwise make the show fall too much into the Otome Game genre trope.Characters - 8/10---------------------As a magic school anime, based on the Otome Game theme, the show features a rather predictable cast. Female main character, and secondary ""main"" character. And then a bunch of guys who fight for their favour as in any Otome game.I am happy to say that the protagonist is quite well done in this show. She\'s highly intelligent, extremely capable and confident, and doesn\'t get swept up into unnecessary romance immediately. She\'s also sufficiently harebrained at times to give her many comedic moments to keep the mood light and fun.Outside of the original ""main"" character and her group of admirers, we also have a potential love interest for the protagonist, and their relationship will be the driving force behind much of the show. It\'s funny and cute, with the romance subplot never becoming overbearing.Additional characters like the local ""girl leader"", and principles and teachers and such will make appearances, but most receive negligible screen time and are not fleshed out.---Total - 8/10---Villainess lvl 99 is a fun take on the Otome Game Isekai genre, and should appeal to all fans who enjoy this kind of thing.

She knows she is the hidden boss, and decides to carve a path that will lead her life away from the hero’s party and give her a peaceful life.The plot revolves a lot about Yumiellas trying to live a normal life, which is way harder than it originally seemed to be. Suddenly people...know how strong she is, some people need help, and she thereby keeps being dragged into all kinds of situations. The plot is generally very light hearted and in some ways bland, which has the positive side of it being easy to watch, but not that enticing to watch.The characters are very much built on stereotypes and is both more open then a pure stereotype, and very firm in its role. Yumiella is mostly a very simple person, and sometimes shows a greater depth, which could have been shown some more.When it comes to animation it is rather basic and the monsters are sometimes very simplistic animated, which makes it less exciting to watch fights with monsters. Otherwise the animation is very average and not that special.The special thing about this show is the atmosphere, it is very clear how Yumiella sees things and the atmosphere it brings with her.

My first contact with this work was reading the manga, 2 months ago.At the time, I thought it was pretty light and fun to read. This adaptation in fact is quite fun until about the end, when even the comedy aspect felt butchered.Although I haven\'t read the light novel myself, I refuse to believe the drop of quality is because of the source material. The dialogues and the minor ""break of expectations"" were quite funny until the last episodes, so I assume the end was rushed to fit in 12 episodes.I\'d suggest to read either the manga or...the light novel instead of watching this, just because of how bad it ended. The animation wasn\'t really that good. Good writing and seiyuus can only do so much to save an adaptation. the light novel instead of watching this, just because of how bad it ended.

Though it is not a bad thing as it allows us to enjoy these animes regardless. Villainess Level 99 is an isekai-otome game themed anime, it contains your usual Isekai formula: Overpowered MC, a fluffy interactions between the characters, romance, and most of all a happy ending. This anime started strong as it gave a glimpse of Rising of shield hero vibes because the Female MC was shunned at first, however retracted midway of the episodes to a more conversational interactions, which pushed me to rate it as 7. It is...not a bad thing as these conversational interactions is where the fluffy interaction between the characters comes in to play, it contains comedy, romantic excitement and many more. That being said, as a fantasy themed anime it does have some actions scenes, however it lacks any thrill of excitement as majority of these scenes are just wallpaper worthy frames. Also the fact that the Female MC is overpowered eliminates the ""Struggle"" in the plot which eliminates any form of the threat presented to the viewers, so regardless of how grim the situation the characters are in will not result to any problem. Overall, if you\'re looking something to watch and stumbled upon this anime you are in for a treat just don\'t expect that much, and if you are someone who\'ve watched a lot of isekai animes specially otome game themed ones might as well skip due to the elements being repetitive, it has it\'s own uniqueness yes but you might find it boring or a waste of time. not a bad thing as these conversational interactions is where the fluffy interaction between the characters comes in to play, it contains comedy, romantic excitement and many more.

You will be surprise how well-crafted this anime.Story 8: I didn't read anime's synopsis and reviews. I just watch it randomly. In eps 1, I thought like some trash cliche anime where the heroine is too kind, looks weak, and meets some handsome guy. But I still hold-on until 70% of eps 1 where the whole scene that I have watched are inside visual novel game and somehow the real heroine is introduced at in the end of the episode, she is a villain-looks. It's really surprised me that made my neighbor mad because I sound...noisy. Anyway, the story set on cliche genre about playing a visual novel otome game in medieval fantasy but in villain-looks perspective. The eps 1 hooked me that I wanted to watch next episode.Characters 9: All character well-crafted, it's top notch writing. It has many characters and seems like they have a good traits. The characters have their own goal, motivation, and conflict. Our heroine is is always ten step thinking versus other characters. I mean, because she has already played the game more than ten I guess. Because of the experience, our heroine take any conflict and resolved it easily. Not just the game experience, our heroine is also has a good communication. She talks what she needs, and always in logical side. She is typical lazy MC where their motivation will be up if it benefit for them or in a danger. She is lovable heroine where it's somehow kinda idiot but smart, also kinda creepy but cute. It's really different typical cool-silent type girl.Animation/Art 7: The characters design were good. However, they have CGI, used in creatures that hard to drawn by hand. The CGI doesn't match with background and framerate, thus making it distracting.Sound/Music 7: I never skip opening music, it's really banger! For the sound like battle, everyday, etc I don't remember much, I think they used less, or no music at all. I think it's good because the shows should make viewer awkward because the heroine, in positive way.Enjoyment 8: I really enjoy the anime. I was always every week for the last month to watch this anime. I hope, I can see the heroine again.Overall 8: Recommended to watch, it's cliche story, but MC already know that, so she will handle the cliche things with her personality and that's what make the anime interesting. noisy. Anyway, the story set on cliche genre about playing a visual novel otome game in medieval fantasy but in villain-looks perspective. The eps 1 hooked me that I wanted to watch next episode.Characters 9: All character well-crafted, it's top notch writing. It has many characters and seems like they have a good traits. The characters have their own goal, motivation, and conflict. Our heroine is is always ten step thinking versus other characters. I mean, because she has already played the game more than ten I guess. Because of the experience, our heroine take any conflict and resolved it easily.

What I had hoped for was for her to have a good personality that could lit the fire of growth in other characters...to bring out their emotions.There are better ways than to just being lazy and give her a bland look to her, witch just really just makes it hard for me to like her as a character and just hard for me to take her seriously when they joke about her power. I was very sad at what I had watched and had the potential to be ASTONISHING like how her healing come at a price of looking grotesque 🤣🤣🤣Oh, right, (if anybody can) could you plz tell me IF YOU SEE ANYBODY IN REAL LIFE ACT LIKE AN ACTUAL ROBOT THAT HAS NO FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. HELL, I\'D PROBABLY HAVE A CRUSH ON YUMIELLA IF SHE ACTUALLY SHOWED SOME EMOTION. But I don\'t because she\'s a bland b word protagonist. You all know how all actions have consequences, right? Despite her being powerful there are very light consequences when it comes to her power, I think that power -weather that is physical or non physical- should have consequences like her black hole spell in EP 5 should have a greater consequence as a girl who doesn\'t know how to control her power.But if anyone has anything to debate plz don\'t be afraid to respond to me, and just know that I wanted to love this show soo bad that I\'m willing to continue watching the anime. to bring out their emotions.There are better ways than to just being lazy and give her a bland look to her, witch just really just makes it hard for me to like her as a character and just hard for me to take her seriously when they joke about her power.

The MC is brainless, very stupid even though he is an reincarnated person and knows the nature of each character. and what annoys the MC the most is his no-nonsense nature of using a monster-summoning trumpet. MC, who said he wanted to be an inconspicuous person, instead stupidly acted like that. An anime that is not recommended to watch because it makes the audience emotional with its stupidity.For story, hmm of course like otome anime as usual. ', 'Long paragraph incoming (sorry, not sorry):One of the worst letdowns that I had in a while, which made me surprised how fast I could switch from kinda liking the vibe of the anime and the story, to instantly realise that this was trash, the worst kind. I like some good thrash, but not when they are thrashing the source material\'s story in such an obvious way that even if I didn\'t read the source material or know anything about it, I understood instantly that something is wrong. It was pretty good the first half of the season, basic story, not that deep, pretty chill, kinda...slice of life... then the animation kinda took a down turn that was off putting me pretty hard with the CGI... but it\'s not the first time I\'m seeing stuff like that, so I can get over it... then, at the end... one of the most rushed episodes that I\'ve seen in a while... Literally felt like I was watching someone making a summary of what happened in the source material. Again, okay, I\'ve seen stuff like this done, while I do consider it a big problem that offputs me, I could still say that it\'s okay, cuz y\'know, anime is sometimes, if not most of the time, an ad for the source material... but then I was starting to realise, for such a plot that was previous, this stuff just doesn\'t line up. I couldn\'t believe my eyes what I was seeing. Besides the fact that everything was rushed and there was almost nothing to justify anything the characters did, they introduced some stuff that I would never see it coming from an author that was able to write the story of the past episodes...What did they introduce? Power of love. Power of friendship. Characters doing actions just because the original game had a certain story, so there is litearlly a ""plot"" controlling characters. Some improtant plot moves that I wanted to see and was waiting for to happen coming out of nowhere... And to remind you... all in a really rushed way, mach speed type of rushing, so the experience was made worse 10x. But I guess you\'re thinking now: ""hey, that is acceptable, there are animes out there that do that"". Oh no, my sweet child, my problem was the part where I heard what happens in the source material (light novel), and feeling like I had a really cool experience stolen just because. Now that\'s what made it 100x worse for me, to the point where it left a disgusting taste in my mouth. Why did they have to ruin everything like this? Literally just adapt the damn source material and don\'t just go off on a tangent so different that it changes everything, especially one so damn f bad... but hey, I guess they won, they made me get interested in the light novel... especially cuz from what I read, they adapted only the first volume of the light novel in this anime.Story: 5The story was an 8 originally, but then the last 3 episodes happened and everything changed... Thanks for the forced happy ending I guess, surely hope this was worth just not following the light novel at the end... Hey, at least the first part of the anime is pretty good. I like the comedy as well.Art: 6Okayish animated, but the CGI, especialyl cuz there were quite a few scenes of it, even the first damn scene in the anime was CGI, put me into a meh mood.Music: 8Probably the only redeeming thing was the OP cuz it sounded cool. That\'s it. ED? Meh...Characters: 7Again, originally and 8 or maybe even a 9 if I felt better, but no. They ruined it. Still like the FMC, but they just ruined my image of everything in the anime.Enjoyment: 5Ugly taste in my mouth at the end... wish it wasn\'t like this, I was really enjoying the anime, quite a bit, especially the comedic parts...Overall: 5Right now it has 7.15 from 47.765 votes Ranked #3522 Popularity #1900 Members 112,449 as of 02/04/2024.

It kept me entertained all throughout the show.Plot: Pretty much like the title states. MC gets reincarnated into a Otome love story RPG fantasy game that she played before except she's reincarnated as the villainess. Though through her life she decided to want to do nothing with the villainess role nor the otome's MCs and just reach max level showing off her power without meaning to. Though the more she tried to stay away the more she kept getting involved.I honestly though it would've been more like some other shojo love story anime, which I think I find I'm just not into...based on the ones I watched, like The Saints Magic Power Is Omnipotent, though while it did have some love story elements it was less about that and more analyzing the situation on how can she make the story better, and have herself involved to where she doesn't get killed in the end. In the beginning what kept me interested is she was proving people wrong with her power that she is pretty much OP. What kept me around is how oblivious she can be and the small funny takes that happen because of this.Music is fine, but there's better bops.Overall Good anime. I enjoyed watching it. It seems more like a one-shot anime which is fine, though has potential for a S2, but ending it where it ended is fine as well. based on the ones I watched, like The Saints Magic Power Is Omnipotent, though while it did have some love story elements it was less about that and more analyzing the situation on how can she make the story better, and have herself involved to where she doesn't get killed in the end.

Even though I really like the production company Jumondo, for the work of art that is Acchi Kocchi, in this one they did a medicore job.Not saying that the anime is bad, far from it, but it is a tremendous lost potential. I don't know if I can complain too much since they took milk from stone. They took an unknown light novel and did a very decent job, the sad thing is knowing that the anime...could have been INFINITELY better if they had tried a little harder, I really like the style of the anime but I think the art direction left a lot to wish, lazy CG, a generic ending and other things took away the shine of this anime, I loved the character of Yumiella Dolkness, in my mid-season review I even said that I would name it after my daughter, but the character construction is executed In many basic ways, they could have done better.The plot progression is another weak point of the work, I believe there are episodes that would make sense if the anime had 24 episodes, an end-of-season drama and a silly episode about eating cakes have the same screen time, the romance was also extremely rushed. I know that the plot has enormous potential and several light novels that were once unknown like Steins;Gate had perfect execution. I'm sad because I'm almost certain that it's impossible to have a second season since the ending was made precisely because it was an ending, but the good thing is that from now on I'll be following the light novel. That said, I still think that the anime had much greater potential than it was used for. could have been INFINITELY better if they had tried a little harder, I really like the style of the anime but I think the art direction left a lot to wish, lazy CG, a generic ending and other things took away the shine of this anime, I loved the character of Yumiella Dolkness, in my mid-season review I even said that I would name it after my daughter, but the character construction is executed In many basic ways, they could have done better.The plot progression is another weak point of the work, I believe there are episodes that would make sense if the anime had 24 episodes, an end-of-season drama and a silly episode about eating cakes have the same screen time, the romance was also extremely rushed.

That is why Yumiella becoming lv 99 so early one causes a Domino effect that changes the future of the game story. So introducing a ""The game plot controls Alicia\'s body"" makes this whole premise moot. Yumiella\'s actions in the story, Alicia\'s lack of level, and other...events that cause Alicia to not grow as an individual lead to a very interesting character development that makes future adaptations of the novel close to impossible.Also, the Demon King Fight was tainted. The whole extra 10 minutes of Alicia attacking Yumiella was awkward to watch. They should have kept things in the original order, as well as shown Yumiella\'s reluctance to kill the Demon Lord. As he was the first Human she ever killed.I suggest watching this anime up to episode 9, then reading chapters 5 and 7 of the novel.I would say that this was close to becoming one of the best adaptations I have seen, but this major flaw just leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. events that cause Alicia to not grow as an individual lead to a very interesting character development that makes future adaptations of the novel close to impossible.Also, the Demon King Fight was tainted.

The pacing of the story is good and brings forth each character\'s story a bit, while always keeping the focus on the main character. It has a lot of ups and downs, plot-twists, and even redemption for the character\'s wrongdoings.Character development: Outstanding for the genre! It\'s definitely this anime\'s strong point! Each character...in the anime has a development and grows as the story progresses, and by the end of the anime there won\'t be a character that you can truly hate (even though some are really nasty to the main character in the beginning!) because they all have properly suffered the consequences to their acts and reflected on it in order to become better versions of themselves.Romantic development: Really cute! The romance starts shy and you will be more interested in the main character\'s circumstances than in the romance, but then the fact that someone is crushing on her becomes a really great development for her! From someone with no friends and no hopes of being ""normal"", to someone that even has a boyfriend, this romance has the right spice to make the story richer.Overall: It\'s a must-watch if you are a fan of this genre! Its unique story and great character development are really refreshing, this anime doesn\'t know the word ""cliché"", you will have a great time watching. in the anime has a development and grows as the story progresses, and by the end of the anime there won\'t be a character that you can truly hate (even though some are really nasty to the main character in the beginning!) because they all have properly suffered the consequences to their acts and reflected on it in order to become better versions of themselves.Romantic development: Really cute!

The first 3 episodes were so hilarious to me that I was immediately hooked but by 12 I found myself saying “so that’s it?”.Pros:- funny moments- likable characters (well 3 of them are)- female MC in isekai with no fan service- happy ending...Cons- “Help! I’m being attacked by bad CGI!!”- Nothing really happened? If it leaned more into slice of life I would understand the slow plot but it was honestly just funny moments put together in a show- Irrelevant plotline: they focus on how crazy powerful her dragon will be but then we never see how crazy powerful her dragon is.- Irrelevant plotline: the blonde girl wants to be with the prince but then we see no action to drive that forward- Irrelevant plotline: sets up this big political struggle between central and regional nobles but then it’s never a plot point???? Sure we can say that her parents wanting to kill her is bc of politics but it’s not?? Like why spend almost half the episode of the queen explaining this and telling Yumeilla to not hangout with the extremist faction, only for it to NEVER be an issue??- Irrelevant plot line: the neighboring kingdom asking Yumeilla to join their side and she says “no” and they say “aw okay”. ????? Like why make that almost half an episode for it to never impact the plot.- WASTED PLOTLINE: Neighboring kingdom says “oh only your kingdom has a demon lord problem” which is interesting bc it’s like ooooo what’s the royal family hiding?? But then in the end it’s nothing that crazy. Like how cool would it have been that we learn the kingdom keeps the demon king around just to keep the royal family in power. Noooo they are just embarrassed by a past ruler being a bigot.- WHY COULDNT WE DRAW THE DRAGON?? WHY CGI????- Yumeilla being the strongest person they’ve seen is lazy writing bc you mean to tell me not ONE person in the HISTORY of mankind thought to use the growth amulet to solo grind and level up???? It’s not that ingenious.- ENOUGH WITH THE DENSE FEMALE CHARACTER TROPE!! Listen, I don’t mind it if the female is dense for reasons like trust issues related to a prior failed relationship or you grew up thinking you could never be loved. At first, I thought that’s were the plot was goin and was on board.

We don\'t know how the show will go, except for the big plot. But after that, it\'s kinda interesting how the show gives a little story about the relationship between every character. The main character is an antisocial character who doesn\'t know how to interact with other people, for some people it might annoy you, but for me, it\'s interesting because since she\'s an op character, and sometimes, gifted people have something taken from them...like their communication skill, their empathy, or their ability to understand their emotion).At first glance, I didn\'t like the color palette for this anime.

In this game, there is a main cast of characters that defeat the demon lord and after doing so have to defeat Yumiella. The Yumiella being an overpowered character has to navigate difficult social interactions and life because others are wary of her.Overview:The anime is slightly comedic with romantic undertones. Although it is an isekai with an overpowered character a good portion of the time is dedicated to relationships; the MC still displays her power and repeatedly proves doubters wrong. The anime mainly takes place...in a school for the first half.Possible CONS:- some characters are annoying/impulsive- Yumeilla selectively has poor social skills- the core story seems to progress a little slow- side characters don\'t have much depthPossible PROS:- despite having standard isekai tropes introduces novel ideas- doesn\'t focus too much on the previous life aspect (could be a plus)- isn\'t a ""smooth sailing"" isekai for the MC (for relationships at least)- MC isn\'t a complete idiotMy Opinion: PositiveI liked this because it fun and slightly novel while retain some characteristics of this genre that I find enjoyable. Although not the deepest anime with a strong cast of side characters I find them satisfactory enough to not hamper the overall feel. A key difference from the regular isekai is there isn\'t a whole lot of fee world adventuring and instead is mostly within a smaller setting.Why you might choose to watch:If you aren\'t looking for a show that has a bunch of drama or is heavy this isn\'t bad. This is mostly a fun almost fantasy-slice-of-life-type anime where the Mc is calm and goes through life, although in a different world.Other Anime You Might Like:Villainess isekai theme:- 7th Time Loop (romance + political)- My Next Life as a Villainess (romance + slice of life)Overpowered character theme:- Misfit of Demon Academy (harem + combat)- Daily Life of the Immortal King (romance subtext + action)- Kid from the last dungeon boonies (fantasy)Female lead isekai theme:- Tearmoon empire (fantasy + political strategic)- Ascendance of a Bookworm (medieval  + inventive strategic) in a school for the first half.Possible CONS:- some characters are annoying/impulsive- Yumeilla selectively has poor social skills- the core story seems to progress a little slow- side characters don\'t have much depthPossible PROS:- despite having standard isekai tropes introduces novel ideas- doesn\'t focus too much on the previous life aspect (could be a plus)- isn\'t a ""smooth sailing"" isekai for the MC (for relationships at least)- MC isn\'t a complete idiotMy Opinion: PositiveI liked this because it fun and slightly novel while retain some characteristics of this genre that I find enjoyable.

I liked how the main boys didn't fall our isekaied villainess and she didn't try to win over them either. Other than that, I didn't find anything remarkable. The comedy was fine, it didn't make me chuckle and the action was not that great either. There was a really good plot potential towards the end when the two main female leads could have been utilized well but I guess they chose to go with a cheesy route.I wish the main girl could have had more personality to her, she was indifferent to most things that happened.

As I do think it\'s well worth to watch I rather avoid too many spoilers in this case.Characters:The characters are very stupid and stubborn in many cases and throughout most of the story. Which might be ok for a few, but nearly all of them? No one really seems to talk things out as you should be doing, this leading to things to fester and become problems later on. Now, would it be specifically bad?...No. Actually it aids the story in some extend by making a ""lucky break"" type story where Yumiella takes full advantage of playing pretty much anyone else. It also helps in getting a lot of students to be a lot stronger so they can actually fight against the demon lords army. However this has it\'s drawback as well as the hero team itself ends up being weaker for some odd reason. This also  combined with the ""game story"" forcing things to happen, specially in the end. The typical ""scripted events"" type of thing.Now there is something to be said about the hero group itself, they hated Yumiella from the start and only started to turn their hate into something better around the end of the story. You would think with so many opportunities they would have been on a friendly basis a lot sooner. But I guess this is also part of the ""scripted events"" part idea. a second prince that\'s very biased and hateful for no apparent reason, a wizard that thinks he can somehow beat someone that has lvl 99 on everything with his all rounder tricks (impressive in context of the show, but rather silly to think so simplified), a brute force sword fighter that thinks his sword skills are the best while he should know better and a heroin that doesn\'t train properly or does anything useful other then being there even to the level of ignoring the scripted story only to use the scripted story in the very end (which is simply stupid and rather ironic).I would say this hero team are no more then a bunch of fools that get bested by a level 99 only because of their own stupidity and jealousy which leads to them not training properly or enough. This leads to a interesting story to the level of ""wth is wrong with you"" type of things which gets rather funny. It\'s a fresh look on a hero team which is actually working out pretty interestingly.There is a story with Linus which is rather short as he\'s a spy for another country. Which is after that event not even mentioned once, nor does Yumiella mention this event to Patrick who is from set country. Which boggles my mind a bit, you have the opportunity to figure out what\'s going on and then not grabbing that opportunity. It could have made for a good plot line later down the line. If not in a second season. This however are clearly the seeds of a second season which probably involve a war between both countries if not a 3rd faction added into that.The king and queen are really more used in words then in using them to get specific things worked out. The hatred of their son towards Yumiella for example could have been resolved a lot earlier if not already nearly instantly. Same for the others other then the heroin who clearly is triggered by forced check point events. Something that should have been addressed way earlier as this causes a big problem in the last episode very clearly.Graphics:Regarding graphics, it looks good over all but there are bits where you can clearly see something didn\'t go as planned. For example the demon lord itself having a very odd expression on his face that looks like he\'s looking cross eyed with a weird distorted smirk (see around mid point of episode 12) which is rather inexcusable for the level of the rest of the graphics this anime shows.Conclusion:For a show that is basically ""I re-incarnated and started as max level"" type isekai this story is pretty decent although it clearly has some things you need to look past. As there is a manga version as well, I have no doubt in my mind things were cut that would actually proof to be very valuable information for the rest of the story. which is a bit sad.Can it be better, well this could have been a master piece but the ball got dropped in a few points which clearly didn\'t do it any good. I would have loved to see this changed for the better but oh well. This regarding the graphics and logics in the characters mostly. However very much a decent story and well worth to watch.

Terrible shows where the author exhausts their premise by episode 4, thereafter devolving into a loop of the main character beating up weak enemies over and over, can be found in the 8s, while here sits Akuyaku 99 in the low 7s. Sad world. Maybe I watch isekai for different reasons than most people?What\'s good about Akuyaku 99 is its telling of a complete story arc. Very rare, unfortunately. The protagonist, Yumiella, meaningfully moves the plot of the video game she\'s reborn into, and in a way besides ""the named characters join her harem"" or ""the...background character becomes the hero"". The author doesn\'t make fights the center of the show, since that would be boring; as soon as it is established that Yumiella is OP, the drama revolves around the social problems a godlike character causes in this setting. People regard her with suspicion, then jealousy, then fear and revulsion. Groups try to flatter her, or manipulate her to supporting their political or social needs. The theme of why Yumiella should want to save this world that treats her like a dangerous semi-domesticated animal is explored. In the end, the resolution to this conflict is not terribly original, but it\'s thematically sound and comes with the fulfillment of the plot. Yes! This is a complete story! Gold star to the author.The two things that detracted from my enjoyment were a few annoying one-dimensional characters and the abysmal CGI animals.

The MC's relatively unique personality (at least for a villainess series) excepted, absolutely nothing about this show stands out or differentiates it from the utterly exhausted story beats and tropes of the genre. Characters are dull, boilerplate, and inconsistent to the point of nonsensicality; the plot is so cliché and unimaginative that you can probably predict half of the story from the title alone; and the animation is aggressively terrible with CGI so abysmally ugly that I genuinely had to double-check that this was a 2024 release....It genuinely surprised me how little effort was put into the writing and presentation, but what surprised me even more was that... I still kind of enjoyed it.What Akuyaku Reijou Level 99 lacks in every other area it makes up for, at least partially, with its comedy. The trite setting and the flat, oblivious manner of the MC mesh in just the right ways, creating one of the best atmospheres for dry humor I've ever seen in an anime. When the show really leans into this side, embracing its own stupidity and really hamming things up for poor Yumiella to deal with, it is genuinely hilarious, and got more than a few chuckles out of me despite my apprehension with the rest of the show. If that was all it was-- power fantasy with a self-aware twist-- Akuyaku Reijou Level 99 really could have been great, perhaps even rising to the heights of something like The Eminence in Shadow if the production values were a little higher. Unfortunately it lacks the wit and sense of style to really isolate the irony of the setting, and fails to follow through with the self referential antics, taking on a more serious tone at the most critical points of the plot. As a result, it doesn't go far enough with its premise, falling back on the more generic aspects of its storyline and ultimately failing to do anything substantial. While I still had some fun with it, I can't help but wonder how much better it could have been had the writer been willing to take a few risks and really take the setup to its extreme. I wouldn't necessarily recommend it, but if you can stomach everything I outlined in the first paragraph, it might be worth a couple laughs.

The only tolerable characters that aren't idiots are the gray-haired dude, the purple-haired teacher, the king and the queen.And to top it all off the males in this anime are just ugly, the ML seems to be Patrick and his color palette is just terrible he looks like and npc standing next to Yumiella, and the 3 boys - especially the prince are not eye candy at all, the only good-looking characters are the girls and the new principal.The story is pretty basic and it would be a decent watch if the characters were also decent, but they aren't.

I watched and enjoyed all previous 4 episodes but that wasn\'t the case here.This episode picks-up right after the previous one, Shin and the Order of Michael are attacking Leila castle while Akito and the gang are trying to stop them.This episode is one hour of overblown robots fighting robots where all the bad guys loose and the good ones march victorious with zero casualties, zero...attention to characters and zero respect to the main source material. Not to mention the pathetic insult to the Geass power that makes no sense.Code Geass anime was so great for portraying very realistic and interesting, complicated and deep characters, great story, soundtracks, mind games and intense action...There\'s nothing of this in this terrible episode.This episode isn\'t just bad on Code Geass standards but as an anime in general.

And that\'s about where it stops. The bad: dos equis machinia or whatever, you\'ll probably need a dos equis or two to enjoy the ending.Art 8/10: same art as code geass, I really love the art style, and an hour long segment just lets them get really detailed. Unfortunately, I might be able to watch anything with this art style.Sound 9/10: I fucking loved the fight music, and almost all the sound effects were amazing, but there were a couple of instances of lines just getting plain annoying, because of repeated words by the same groups of people over and...over again.Character 4/10: In Lelouch, almost everybody who had a line had character. And whenever someone died you felt something. Half the character in this series didn\'t have well defined or really any character beyond \'scientist #3\' or \'hot soldier #2-3\' (spoiler: yeah those two that just blew up? had the same character, and if they had died I still wouldn\'t remember their names). But those that were there, were fairly interesting. If their development didn\'t suck.Story 1/10: ""What the fucking fuck, who the fuck took that shit on the story? I was supposed to mail that in, today, well fuck it, send it in the way it is."" Spoilers! obviously. The series had a pretty interesting story until this and the last segment. I dunno why they decided to just give Leila a geass. That was stupid. Plus ""it\'s not a geass cause it\'s blue"" and ""geass fragment"" (a.k.a. we wrote ourselves into a corner and oh god how do we finish this). But not only did they give it to her, they don\'t give her any powers until she can just block others\' geass\'s AND summon the omnipotent human collective conscience (aka plot-armor re-imagined as what everyone wants)? BAH. They even had some line in there that said something about brain waves making a singularity and being able to create the universe again using a twisted understanding of the observer effect. This is honestly the most disappointing ending to an anime I\'ve watched. There have been times when I was angry, sad, happy, and all of the above, but never so utterly let down.Enjoyment 8/10: I really enjoyed the fight scenes, the music especially kept bringing me back, despite the ending being a complete colossal failure at almost every point, I did really enjoy it. It\'s more code geass! just watered down a little.Overall 5/10: Sigh. I had such high hopes, so maybe it\'s just that they got crushed so ... nope, it really doesn\'t even deserve this high of a score. This is the score that I want to believe it is so I don\'t feel like I wasted my time. The only way I can really reconcile this is that all of these segments were just hallucinations of Lelouch\'s while he and Suzaku were in jail. Either that or as soon as they say ""Akito has vanished"" that it\'s just hallucinations of Leila who\'s now traumatized at the deaths of her comrades.

Plenty of...entertainment value came from seeing all of his exaggerated tactics and ridiculous strategies at work during an ambitious struggle to defeat Britannia and overthrow its system. Lots of plot twists and crazy events. In fact, you could even argue this characteristic was a key part of what made Code Geass both so popular and so infamous across online communities.But, to bring things into perspective, that is almost the opposite of what Akito wanted to offer in the long run. Nope, this project wasn't really targeting the hardcore Geass fanbase at all. If Lelouch of the Rebellion provided us with a fabulous telescope of many colors, then Akito the Exiled gave us a mere microscope with a few study samples on the side. There might be some beauty in looking at a different creator's vision, together with its own unique flaws, but the overall experience is not going to be remotely similar and not all tastes will enjoy it.The last episode is perhaps the single clearest example of that. Rather than fighting a large scale conflict, the final battle took place around the siege of an old castle. This already established that the stakes would be comparatively low, and more centered on the survival of a small group of people, both European and Japanese. Not on the fate of an entire continent, much less the world. Despite the ostensible dangers of Shin's plans for global destruction, those weren't much of a real concern.The first half of the episode concentrated on the castle battle itself and that was quite exciting, providing plenty of attractions for fans of mecha combat sequences, especially if they can already embrace the increasing use of 3D in the hands of masters like studio Orange (no relation to Jeremiah, I swear).However, one could even argue that this concluding entry was less about the actual military outcome, which could be easily predicted with some imagination or past experience, and more about the real or attempted personal redemption of certain characters. Which isn't necessarily all that appealing. If you are the sort of person who thinks happy endings are lame or inherently inferior to bittersweet ones or outright tragedies, then you'll be extremely unlikely to have much appreciation for this approach.But, in truth, that didn't really bother me at all. Sometimes it's perfectly fine for a story to let most of the cast survive and allow them to become little more than exiles (ah, we can see the title makes more sense in retrospect), whose actions and fates will not change the status quo of the world. If Lelouch will always be remembered inside his fictional universe for what he did as Zero and how he pulled off an insane final plan, the cast of characters in Akito will most likely see their days end in anonymity.I would say the single most controversial factor in Akito the Exiled, from a general storytelling perspective, was the way in which Geass-related abilities were suddenly used in this last episode. Those magical or mystical aspects had taken a backseat to the action before, even though you could find some old hints about Akito's condition, the BRS system, Shin's past or Leila's abilities in previous episodes with a small amount of detective work. None of these aspects are coming out of nowhere. But it does seem like the co-writer and director of this project, Kazuki Akane, really wanted to compensate for not having a lot of magical powers influencing the narrative before this point.The result? We get to see a combination of very anime-style interpretations of quantum mechanics employed for the sake of messing around with space/time. Not to mention the introduction of other new concepts, such as an overseeing entity linked to the collective unconsciouness (She has no name, but I'd call her Jupiter-chan). Or a completely different way to obtain a Geass ability in the case of one particular character (Shin), and a more vaguely defined yet symbolic type of power for another (Leila).I can understand why some folks will react negatively to this. Familiarity often brings calm and sudden novelty can be risky. Even so, I feel those expressions of annoyance may simply be the result of confusion. A lot of these elements may certainly feel odd, especially at first, but I think it's possible to figure out how they are actually supposed to work with some patience and analysis. For instance: Leila's Geass power doesn't really have multiple abilities. It's essentially about communication. Therefore, most of the really crazy stunts aren't her fault. If that's not Leila, then who? Well, it's all because of the supernatural entity (Jupiter-chan) who is responsible for overseeing space and time. When you look at the big picture, it's slightly unexpected yet neither illogical nor random.To be fair, the original Code Geass series had also relied on the supernatural to resolve important storylines at times. Think back to the metaphysical Ragnarok Connection scenario, which was not resolved thanks to any political reality or brilliant tactical move, as well as arguably the most contrived yet most memorable moment in the entire TV series that happened near the end of the first season. But, at the same time, it is important to note the original story ultimately went back to the real world for its final conflict resolution in both cases.Here, the supernatural side of the story remained part of the mix during much of the second half of the episode. The BRS shenanigans, when taken to the extreme, literally combined a mental networking technology with the magical power of Geass in order to temporarily alter the fabric of reality. An interesting equation, on paper, but sadly never sufficiently explored in this spin-off.Something more intriguing, in my view, was the conversation between Leila and the space/time overseer. While we can still question the use of such plot devices to help resolve conflicts as a literal deus ex machina, I think the existence of said being helps expand this fictional universe, even beyond the limits of this episode's script. In other words, it strengthens the Code Geass lore by providing a sense of larger purpose and opens up new story possibilities. Individuals like V.V. or even dear C.C. never really had this effect, since they operated on the same level as humanity rather than above it. To put it another way...I want to see Jupiter-chan show up again.Oh, I was forgetting something! I will admit that the small and almost insignificant presence of Suzaku and Lelouch in this new story might have distracted the audience, with both unfortunate and fortunate implications, but for me they were always a sideshow in the context of Akito the Exiled. Just a way to give the fans a bonus feature. It wasn't going to focus on them, one way or another, and I think that isn't too unreasonable for a spin-off.Having said of all this, I would say the resolution provided by the final episode of Akito the Exiled is valid and not impossible to understand, but parts of the narrative do leave me wishing they had chosen something more practical instead. Or, failing that, changing the format of the project into a full TV series rather than a bunch of small movies released every other year.Art: 8/10This was really more of the same, so there's little to add. The general animation and art quality was moderately impressive, although I do believe certain scenes might have been edited in a rush (or not at all) in order to release the last episode in theaters. Presumably the physical disc release is going to smooth certain odd spots.Sound: 8/10Not much of a difference here either. Good sountrack, although the crazy jazz will surely tend to confuse and annoy those who haven't already gotten used to the work of the composer who has worked on all the previous Akito the Exiled episodes.Character: 7/10Let's get the obvious thing out of the way. The characters in Akito the Exiled are not as charismatic nor as larger-than-life as those in the main Code Geass TV series. They also don't have the same amount of development or characterization due to the limited running time. There's a lot of purely secondary or tertiary people in this final episode and the same thing goes for the rest of the series. Some of them could have played a larger role and others got brief scenes that are nothing more than decent. If I were to talk about all of them, I'd be here all day.Having said this, I think there's some pretty good stuff going on too. Akito's character development arc arguably ended somewhere between the third or fourth installments. This is simply the final stage. What we have here is an already changed man who no longer just wants to die and kill people. He views life in a more positive fashion and tries to see if his brother isn't entirely beyond saving after all. In the end, you could say his goal was mainly about resolving a brotherly conflict rather than a global war. I can see all of this sounding a little unoriginal or even repetitive for some folks, but in my opinion it was still a logical outcome for Akito. Beyond that, he gets to do a lot of neat fighting and that is always welcome.Curiously enough, Leila herself had more character-based scenes than Akito in this one yet didn't play much of a role in the combat resolution. What she really does do, however, is directly experience the bulk of the supernatural elements that were emphasized during this last episode. I imagine the specifics behind that magical turn of events will always remain controversial, but I thought the underlying meaning was interesting enough. That said, I admit that idealistic and selfless characters are rarely popular in the context of the CG property.You could say Leila represents the side of humanity that will not give up, even in the face of real or potential tragedies. She had many doubts at the start of this whole story and moments of weakness, unsure about what to do, but those were eventually overcome (with the help of others, such as Klaus and Akito or the gypsy folks too). In other words, that was her development.In the end, the core message of the story connects to Leila. She believes people can change, despite all the terrible or at least depressing things that have happened around her, her teammates or her own family. That's why she wanted to help Akito and even Shin, both during previous episodes and especially now. It also reflects her accepting former enemies as comrades. Even after seeing something horrible during this final installment (which might even come across as a little cheap, on the surface), she didn't give up nor succumb to despair.Instead, Leila finally decided to embrace her own Geass ability (and that, in turn, seems to have interested a higher power). Which also reflects how she wants to continue living in the world and not just destroy everyone around her like Shin. What exactly does her Geass ability do? Don't ask me about any explicit rules or lore behind it, that is all vague, but the relevant effect for the purposes of analysis is helping people connect with each other. In my opinion, that worked just fine for this story.That said, I do have some moderate disappointments here. It is true that Leila technically orchestrated the castle defense, but we didn't really get to see her setting up the traps nor giving the orders. Which makes Leila's role seem passive in that area, although it isn't inherently supposed to be.I will not claim Shin was a great villain, but his full background history (that family was rather messed up) did help connect a few dots. It explains why his Geass power was not only far too restricted but also very ironic. His weak point, both as a character and as a person, was that he didn't have any concrete ambitions (or motivations) for changing the world. Just destruction. I suppose he was not a completely evil being, since there was some good left in his soul before it was twisted in strange ways, but in the end he was more of an insane person than a healthy individual. Even poor Jean turned out to be more reasonable than him.Another character-related criticism would be the final fate of Smilas. It felt underwhelming. Predictable due to the chronology and even entirely deserved for his duplicity, in the end, but lacking some more build-up.Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 7/10I'll say that the last episode of Akito the Exiled felt quite lukewarm in execution when it came to the script, yet still fitting as a conclusion to the main characters and the themes of the story. It's a valid way to end the narrative, but not as strong in terms of impact as that of the main series. I would have appreciated more explanations for the magical elements too.One way or another though, I still had fun watching it. Not every revelation or decision concerning the storytelling was properly presented either, although a few specific sequences did reflect a lot of directorial or cinematographic skill. To make a long story short, this isn't your past self's Code Geass. Nope, not at all. It does some things better, or at least differently, but others were also worse. How much you care about particular aspects will help determine where you stand on it. entertainment value came from seeing all of his exaggerated tactics and ridiculous strategies at work during an ambitious struggle to defeat Britannia and overthrow its system.

I can see all of this sounding a little unoriginal or even repetitive for some folks, but in my opinion it was still a logical outcome for Akito. Beyond that, he gets to do a lot of neat fighting and that is always welcome.Curiously enough, Leila herself had more character-based scenes than Akito in this one yet didn't play much of a role in the combat resolution. What she really does do, however, is directly experience the bulk of the supernatural elements that were emphasized during this last episode. I imagine the specifics behind that magical turn of events will always remain controversial, but I thought the underlying meaning was interesting enough. That said, I admit that idealistic and selfless characters are rarely popular in the context of the CG property.You could say Leila represents the side of humanity that will not give up, even in the face of real or potential tragedies. She had many doubts at the start of this whole story and moments of weakness, unsure about what to do, but those were eventually overcome (with the help of others, such as Klaus and Akito or the gypsy folks too). In other words, that was her development.In the end, the core message of the story connects to Leila. She believes people can change, despite all the terrible or at least depressing things that have happened around her, her teammates or her own family. That's why she wanted to help Akito and even Shin, both during previous episodes and especially now. It also reflects her accepting former enemies as comrades. Even after seeing something horrible during this final installment (which might even come across as a little cheap, on the surface), she didn't give up nor succumb to despair.Instead, Leila finally decided to embrace her own Geass ability (and that, in turn, seems to have interested a higher power). Which also reflects how she wants to continue living in the world and not just destroy everyone around her like Shin. What exactly does her Geass ability do? Don't ask me about any explicit rules or lore behind it, that is all vague, but the relevant effect for the purposes of analysis is helping people connect with each other. In my opinion, that worked just fine for this story.That said, I do have some moderate disappointments here. It is true that Leila technically orchestrated the castle defense, but we didn't really get to see her setting up the traps nor giving the orders. Which makes Leila's role seem passive in that area, although it isn't inherently supposed to be.I will not claim Shin was a great villain, but his full background history (that family was rather messed up) did help connect a few dots. It explains why his Geass power was not only far too restricted but also very ironic. His weak point, both as a character and as a person, was that he didn't have any concrete ambitions (or motivations) for changing the world. Just destruction. I suppose he was not a completely evil being, since there was some good left in his soul before it was twisted in strange ways, but in the end he was more of an insane person than a healthy individual. Even poor Jean turned out to be more reasonable than him.Another character-related criticism would be the final fate of Smilas. It felt underwhelming. Predictable due to the chronology and even entirely deserved for his duplicity, in the end, but lacking some more build-up.Enjoyment: 7/10Overall: 7/10I'll say that the last episode of Akito the Exiled felt quite lukewarm in execution when it came to the script, yet still fitting as a conclusion to the main characters and the themes of the story. It's a valid way to end the narrative, but not as strong in terms of impact as that of the main series. I would have appreciated more explanations for the magical elements too.One way or another though, I still had fun watching it. Not every revelation or decision concerning the storytelling was properly presented either, although a few specific sequences did reflect a lot of directorial or cinematographic skill. To make a long story short, this isn't your past self's Code Geass. Nope, not at all. It does some things better, or at least differently, but others were also worse. How much you care about particular aspects will help determine where you stand on it."", 'Fuck it. After this review, I\'m gonna give this series the Tsukihime treatment*.*Tsukihime treatment: Pretending that something doesn\'t exist because it doesn\'t deserve acknowledgment.**Spoilers for Code Geass: Boukoku no Akito Final - Itoshiki Monotachi e**You know, what was I expecting? Really. What did I expect would happen. This entire series has been an absolute joke, unworthy of bearing the name ""Code Geass"", and people have been saying that this film was the worst of them all, so what was I to expect? Well, the last two films were enjoyable in comparison to the first two despite people calling them terrible in comparison to the first...two, so maybe I could\'ve been able to see this as somewhat misunderstood. Then again, this is Akito the Exiled, I think the concept of redemption and good writing is impossible for it to grasp. Now, I\'m not gonna pretend the main series was perfect, far from it, but even R2, which already had it\'s fair share of bafflingly stupid and convoluted moments, looks like a masterpiece compared to this atrocity, and it\'s predecessors. Even then, I thought film 2 was bad. No...film 2 is actually passable compared to this pigshit of an installment. Now, what went so wrong here as to make me want to surgically remove this, and by extension, the entire Akito series from the body of the Code Geass franchise? Well, let\'s find out, shall we?Picking up right where we left off, except we jump a week because apparently no one took action in a week. After Ashley fails to convince Jean to join him, she suddenly has doubts about her goal of helping Shin. Then, we launch into a full-blown siege. It\'s after the Euro-Britannians make it in that we get an infinite amount of problems. The directing is so bad that we usually don\'t even get to see where those grappling cable latches hang on to. Also, when Ayane corners Jean and has a laughable scene of trying to convince and then hug her, Jean suddenly thinks she\'s the one with power in the situation. Then we begin the final battle between Akito and Shin after Shin has knocked back Ashley and Ryou. Where was Yukiya? In recovery before going to his new unit and taking down a big cannon on that explodes and land on him before doing so, yet he still survives, but we\'ll get back to that.The second half is where things turn from bad to utter bullshit. During the battle of brothers, we see them teleport but still be there (probably thanks to Leila\'s bullshit geass), and it\'s at this point where we get a LITERAL DEUS EX MACHINA! Right after the entire command center sans Leila is riddled with bullet holes, we see this geass-related collective entity again in her beautiful glory, as she basically doesn\'t explain jack to Leila that is relevant aside from the fact that she still has a ""fragment of geass"" since I guess children can\'t be able to have full geasses (not unless you\'re Mao from Code Geass R1 but this series has done enough damage to the main one) but somehow reverses time long enough for Leila to completely rethink the situation to avoid her crew dying (despite the fact that it\'s the same amount of time she has earlier and she never thought of anything at the moment). I guess Leila\'s geass allows her to see a vision of her parents conversing with her without knowing it\'s her, and I guess she can see and project other people\'s memories, but none of this is explained well at all and we never get a definitive effect if the geass she has (albeit it seemingly does multiple things despite a geass being able to have only ONE POWER, like controlling, forcing one to kill, etc.), and somehow this allowed everyone in the main group to make cheesy speeches about helping Akito and telling Shin not to kill him, no matter how far away they are. Time for the final act, and the final nail in the coffin.We see Shin\'s and Akito\'s sorry excuses for backstory. Apparently, Akito was born from a different father, and when Shin walked in, he not only deduced who the real father is in an instant (despite the father looking nothing like the son whatsoever (not even hair color)) but also became nihilistic due to that, to the point of feeling betrayed by his mother and receiving a Geass that makes people kill themselves (except Akito because fuck logic, right?). About that being, who is what is it? It\'s fully established that you need a living being that has code in order for him/her to be able to give a geass to someone, not this abstract skull thing that just appeared into this works because whatever. Then, he kills his whole family because Jennie values death (but never takes his own life for some reason) and ""wants to set them free from this awful world"". As you can see, his backstory is edge-filled and stupid as hell. Also, he devolves into a madman and now both of them can see ghosts and visions of living veins shouting for Akito not to die (none of this makes any sense and none of this is explained), and then Jean appears right outta nowhere to kill Shin and take the fatal sword blow for Akito (because she had minor conflict and was convinced with just a simple hug). Also, yeah, every good guy is alive, even when they shouldn\'t be, like Yukiya. Also, remember the plot point about Smilas trying to become a dictator? Well, this movie forgot about it until the end credits where he and everyone are quickly killed by Ashley because tying up plot points in a pathetic and clumsy way since we forgot to address this big plot point during the edit the film, is what Akito is best at. Speaking of, Lelouch and Suzaku are told by Rolo (in a post-credits scene mind you) that daddy Charles wants to see them. This doesn\'t even resolve this dangling thread that jeopardizes R2\'s existence. It\'s all just left to dry in the hot sunny day!Development doesn\'t even matter anymore; nothing can save these characters from being dogshit. Let\'s start with Leila. Her geass is horribly defined and nothing but contrivances and deus ex machinas for the sake of the abomination called a plot, and it\'s thanks to this supervisor whose appearance and existence makes no sense in the context of the franchise. Plus, she\'s a lot happier this time around for some reason. Ayano, Ryou, and Yukiya also remain the same, and so does Ashley. The biggest problem lies with Shin. I already mentioned how retarded his backstory is, but there\'s the rest of how he\'s written, which still made him a generic ""not valuing life"" antagonist. There\'s really nothing to him but wasted potential for an interesting villain. Jean has a pathetically realized excuse for conflict and resolution, Suzaku goes out of character to choke Lelouch for no reason, and we\'re left with a pathetic cast of underutilized and underdeveloped twits that could\'ve been actually interesting and properly written. Oh yeah, and General Smilas is here too. Say hi before he dies because you only see him and his goons for all of 10 seconds in the end credits before they get destroyed. Not gonna mention anyone else either, they\'re not memorable and suffer from the same problems as Leila: no one was fleshed out or ever written to be compelling beforehand, so they\'re left to rot here.Somehow the CGI is more poorly integrated than before, and there are moments where the CGI blatantly dips in quality and integration, like when Ashley disposes of Smilas. The directing here is at its worst, with awful and unnecessary shaky cam and some awful shot composition here and there. The character art and animation are both as good as the previous two films though, so that\'s a plus (there, I gave this shitty movie a compliment; happy now?). We also get a sort-of sword fight between Shin and Akito (sort-of since it\'s one-sided and Akito doesn\'t even do much fighting after the first 30 seconds of swordplay), and some decently done death scenes of Jean and Shin (in terms of look and direction, not content), but overall, the last two looked better than this film.The only new addition to the mediocre Akito music library this time is the mediocre ED, and it\'s as boring as the other ones. Remember that I\'ll-fitting blaring trumpet piece? Well, here they play it in the most ill-fitting battle of the bunch. That piece is for chaotic moments, which doesn\'t really occur here. I really have nothing left to say. This movie doesn\'t even add new background OSTs to the mix like the previous two did, which also emphasizes how much worse the production of this one was in comparison to the last one, and this is supposed to be the final hurrah of the sub-series! Bah!I genuinely wish this sub-series didn\'t exist, or at least, that is was written to actually respect the logic of the franchise and not ruin itself or fail its characters. This final film really makes the other Akito movies look decent by comparison. I\'m done with Akito the Exiled, and I\'ll probably never see this sub-series again. In fact, why am I even raging? This thing doesn\'t even exist. None of these films exist, and if they did, they wouldn\'t have a right to bear the name of the franchise. I don\'t even know what I\'m doing here, ranting on a nonexistent product. Am I a madman? Clearly! Fuck this; I\'m out! two, so maybe I could\'ve been able to see this as somewhat misunderstood.

Fuck this; I\'m out!', 'This review is just about the last movie, but it sort of encompasses my feelings for the movies before this final chapter as well.Story(8/10)/Characters(9/10): The whole plot is about what the characters are going through and how they persist. Over time, the viewer eventually uncovers more and more about the the protagonists and antagonists. The final chapter plays a huge part in fleshing out the characters, what their motivations are, and what their pasts entailed. There is a lot of stuff to chew on in the final movie as far as the Geass universe and how it is connected to metaphysics. Anyone who has watched...End of Evangelion will see inspiration from the NERV raid, and it is very entertaining to watch a  base defense scenario. Honestly, there is a lot of inspiration from Evangelion. Some of the story elements introduced in this might feel forced and randomly confusing, but it inspires a sense of a mind f***, which is fun to experience.  8/10 is kind of generous for the story rating, but I felt since this was the climax and the loose ends were getting tied, this would be higher than what I would give to the previous chapters. It does leave me wanting a continuation to the Geass series.Art (8/10): CG is the only detracting factor. The rest of the animation is somewhere in between OVA and high budget movie quality.Sound (7/10): The BGM is what makes the Akito movies vastly different from the Geass TV series. Instead of epic choir music from the TV series, you have a crazy jazz saxophone blasting  in your ear and rumbling bass with a MIDI-like sound accompanying it. It\'s a very disturbing combination, and its intention is clearly to cause a disturbing, chaotic mood during the battles. The BGM is what made Geass stand out as a  ""Death Note"" type of show. And both Death Note and Geass had the epic choir music. So to go from a show and ""chess-battle"" genre that was totally defined by the \'epic music\' to something with a completely different vibe, yet same character artwork, does work in its favor. I feel it was someone\'s selfish intention to go with this music choice as a way to delve into ideas and themes differently than the TV series.Enjoyment (8/10): If you enjoy action and some conscious-sharing, this will be an enjoyable experience.Overall (8/10): Although the 4 year wait fresh in my mind while watching this ruined my viewing, I\'d rather this as an 8/10.

This one in particular.  I feel like I waited for three years to see where this story went, only to be left with a big huge steaming pile of crap.The first two OVA's were great.  I loved the characters and potential storylines.  Then the third OVA was a bit rushed and all over the place.  The fourth was incredibly rushed and left a lot of open-ended questions and lots of confusion.Finally we...get to this fifth and final OVA.  And I felt completely let down.  First off, I watched a really bad SUB, that even with my limited Japanese, I could tell that a lot of the meaning was mistranslated.  So the bigger concepts and final wrap ups were ultra confusing.That being said, while a better SUB would have helped, this last OVA was a random, rushed, ridiculous mess that as a major CODE GEASS fan, left me feeling insulted.There was so much potential in the first OVA!  Instead, absolutely nothing was resolved.Here is my breakdown:Story:  CRAP.  Complete and utter crap.  I think that my three year old cousin could write a better story.  Nothing made sense, no questions were answered, no plot lines were resolved.Art:  This is the only part of the OVA's that really left any impression.  Beautiful background art, lovely character designs, pleasing color palette.  I just wish more detail had been put into some of the fight scenes.Sound:  Honestly the music in these OVA's is subpar at best, and if I am being honest, I really hated it.  I really, really, really dislike jazz music, and I just cannot understand why you would layer intense jazz overtop of fight scenes???  where is the sense in that?  It actually makes the fights seem ridiculous and fake.Character:  (mild spoilers here)  What a waste.  Some great characters were absolutely wasted with the story line.  Rushed character development made a lot of the character interactions unbelievable.  Akito was so cold and creepy and unapproachable at the beginning of the OVA's, which made him interesting and mysterious.  Then at the halfway point he all of the sudden cares a lot about all of his comrades?  And they are shouting ridiculously at him through most of this last OVA?  Just... weird and disappointing.Enjoyment:  Do I even need to answer this?  Fine, I hated it and was totally disappointed.Overall:  Okay, so in summary, I am a huge Code Geass fan.  Like, I have watched the whole series at least 3 times.  Lelouch is one of my favorite anime male characters of all time.  So if you are a huge fan, don't mar the perfection of the TV series by watching these OVA's. get to this fifth and final OVA.  And I felt completely let down.

Quantum space-time teleportation because of brain-wave overlapping due to Geass interference? This was a downright rushed finale as obviously stated by the BS of ""quantum space-time teleportation to nowhere"" and ""going back in time a few seconds to save everyone you love"". The last time I saw this kind of BS was from the game Resistance 3. I\'m sorry, but the original Code Geass didn\'t pull this kind of BS out of their asses last time I checked. And it was a...typical happy-lala ending again, with everyone happy going home arm-in-arm, hugging and kissing each other goodbye (even their enemies), and so much as watching the sunset together after their intensive battle of trying to earnestly kill each other. What is this, Fairy Tail? At least Fairy Tail showed how they got to get along and in a proper way.I was expecting a darker ending as with the death flag from Akito telling them they should all be able to go to Japan one day ALIVE. But, this episode simply did a backflip on that.  Oh well, beggars can\'t be choosers. At least I got to enjoy the art and sound once more. The director probably chose to due a full-on hard stop to the story saying that this is it. And despite all the BS involved, it was very easy to understand the characters feelings... or maybe this is a bad thing. However, because I enjoyed it, I\'ll be generous about it.Episodes 1-4 - 8/10 up until this episode.This episode - 4/10Series overall - 5/10 typical happy-lala ending again, with everyone happy going home arm-in-arm, hugging and kissing each other goodbye (even their enemies), and so much as watching the sunset together after their intensive battle of trying to earnestly kill each other.

This time, there is nothing like a slight depression when you utterly finish a show, knowing that you have to say goodbye to a cast of characters, at least until you maybe rewatch it again. But for Code Geass, there is only happiness. I mean, yes, Lelouch really is amazing, he deserves his popularity, too bad that the surrounding series just isn\'t up to par though. But this is about the last part of Akito\'s story, so this  shall be our topic. First of all, no battered Leila in a ripped skirt, the...promo-pictures are lying, how rude. Sigh...let\'s do it.Story: I am done with this, in the end, it was still bad. Basically the movie consists out of the final battle between the Hyuga-brothers, and all their superiors and allies. This whole fight is actually really well done, unfortunately i didn\'t care for the characters at all, together with all their stupid decisions. Nothing seems to make sense, or maybe i am just not smart enough to actually understand it. There will be spoilers here beware, since i will talk about the things that i didn\'t understand. First of all, how did Shin get his Geass? From a skull? But that\'s against everything we learned in the main series. What\'s his power anyway, the same as Lelouchs or can he only order people to die? On this note, what is Leilas Ability?  Is it a Geass-canceller, cause it is also blue? The weird woman describes it as a fragment, but what can it actually do? It does so many things, that its impossible to see any consistent power. That was really well done in the main series, how lelouch always investigated the parameter and turned this mystical power into something easily understandable. The powers in these movies however just seem like really bad writing. I am actually getting slightly agitated while writing this, so i will just conclude it here. I hated it, at the end i was actually laughing at how bad the story actually is. I give it a 2, which seems inconsistent, but all the time, i expected some explanations. They never came, in hindsight i should probably lower the score of all the other movies. I won\'t, just a thought.Art:That doesn\'t mean that the movie can\'t score in the other categories. The Art is still on the same quality-level, i liked it. There is some actual nudity this time. Oh my, why couldn\'t it be leila or ayano though. I am sorry.The animation is nice at well, really liked those quick fights, but i mentioned that before.Sound: The same as always, i think they changed the ending, i really can\'t remember.Character: All the character arcs are concluded in this movie, i\'ll give it that much. Shin is weird, he basically hates the world and by killing everyone he wants to set them free from this rotten hell. Twisted and insane is what i\'d call that, but definitely entertaining. Leila lost her personality somewhere along the way, somehow she felt like a plot-device in this last part. Akito gained something, i suppose, don\'t really care. Oh and ayano is goddamn stupid. I also don\'t like how they are all cast aside in the end, to not interfere with the maincanon. But that complaint probably belongs to the story.Enjoyment: Well i kinda had fun at least, but actual enjoyment? That\'s going too far. i don\'t know anymore, just take your 6 again, you retarded movie, you.""So this is it, our final battle."" That\'s not actually taken from the movie. So, we did it. It took a while. I got a little teary-eyed when i finished Haruhi, but this here? Oh well, i already talked about it in the introduction. The thing is, if they ever do a third season, i\'d watch it. That\'s my conclusion, i think that conveys my feelings for Code Geass. Lelouch is cool, without him, this would all be abysmal and nobody would care. promo-pictures are lying, how rude.

Now I understand why people say this is the worst episode.The characters are poorly made, the story is way too cliché. The fights are pretty well made but everything else is either mediocre or dreadful. Don’t waste your time unless you like stories where friendships give you power and they become unbeatable. It does have some connections with the original series, cause it’s played after the first season but nothing really influences the...original series, so just because of that you shouldn’t watch it.Overall I pretty much hated it, the third episode was kind of okay but the rest though…even the OVAs of Code Geass are better than this crap! Give me a favour and don’t watch this! original series, so just because of that you shouldn’t watch it.Overall I pretty much hated it, the third episode was kind of okay but the rest though…even the OVAs of Code Geass are better than this crap! Give me a favour and don’t watch this!', 'Holy crap what the hell were they thinking? Sunrise may well have just come out and just said ""we don\'tactually know what to do with Akito the Exiled lmao"". That\'s how poor this final episode really is. Now this isn\'t a sudden 180, but the show did hang in the balance after the events of the last 2 episodes with the damn gypsies and other events. The show just proceeds to get down on its knees and slam it\'s face into the ground joyfully afterwards.Akito the Exiled finally shown the confrontation between Akito and his ""NII-SAN!"",...and we finally after years of this OVA would arrive at this answer. What are the true motives of Hyuuga Shin?! Why does he want his precious younger brother to die?! Because he doesn\'t want him to go through all the suffering of this cruel world! I killed them because I loved them!Leila also gets the magic ability to reset time for one convenient try and there was a weird event were Akito and co. disappeared and broke space but Hyuuga Shin\'s character was so egregious I hardly cared too much about it how silly this was at this point.OVA\'s 1 and 2 were a good addition to the main series while 3, 4, and 5 just rendered it another cash grab featuring one of the worst antagonists that I\'ve seen. Thanks Sunrise. and we finally after years of this OVA would arrive at this answer. What are the true motives of Hyuuga Shin?! Why does he want his precious younger brother to die?!

Thanks Sunrise.', 'First of all, there is one thing you have to know about me : I am a HUGE fan of Code Geass, and I also loved the first three OVAs of Akito the Exiled (I did like the 4th OVA, but not as much).So, for me to give such a bad mark to this episode, it means they REALLY screwed up big. I\'ll try my best to explain it (SPOILERS FOR THIS OVA, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED).STORYAkito the Exiled had a number of plots, all awesome :- the face-to-face between Akito and his brother, and the mystery behind their Geass and Akito\'s ability to talk...to ghosts.- the war between Euro-Britannia and the rest of the world.- the corrupt government of EU.- the mystery behind Layla\'s power.This OVA 5 had the task to wrap up ALL these stories. It\'s too much for an episode, even though it\'s an hour long.BUT we could expect them to finish one or two of these stories in a proper way, right? Well, it\'s not the case. ALL those stories are rushed and ruined. No exception.- Akito somehow doesn\'t want to kill his brother anymore.- They don\'t even mention how Euro-Britannia winds up after this story. Was it dismantled? Did it become independent? Did it join either EU or Britannia? We\'ll never know.- the corrupt government of EU is taken out in 10 seconds.- Layla\'s power is terribly OP.- It all ends HAPPILY EVER AFTER. Seriously? IT\'S CODE GEASS! It\'s not supposed to end up in such a cheesy way! No one dies! All the bad guys are taken out of the picture and all the good guys have a happy ending!!!Basically : everything is rushed, every story ends in a miserable way, and it\'s all too cheesy for Code Geass!ARTAkito the Exiled was wonderful, and this OVA makes no exception. The battle is terrific, the movements are fluid, the environments and visual effects are awesome.The only problem, as ever with Code Geass, is the chara-design. I still can\'t get used to that pointy chin xD! Though it\'s not that much troublesome, I do count it as the main problem in the visuals of Code Geass.There is, however, ONE THING I don\'t forgive this episode for : that slow motion scene in the middle of the battle. Akito and Shin suddenly fight slowly for some reason, BUT keep talking at normal speed, which is just ridiculous.SOUNDThe anime had such a wondeful OST, so I don\'t know what happened with the OVAs. Akito the Exiled has an horrendous OST, it puts jazz during battles and there aren\'t much variation in themes.Only the endings are cool, though I don\'t find them marvelous.CHARACTERCharacters have always been the strong point of Code Geass. Even secondary characters are awesome and well developed. Akito The Exiled was no exception... during the first 4 OVAs.In this final episode, the characters lose their charisma and become totally cliché. Shin was an awesome villain because he managed to take over the whole Euro-Britannia and declared war against the world ; but nothing that he did is important in this episode, where he\'s just a bad guy fighting the good guy. Also, it seems he was given the Geass by a floating skull. Yeah, a floating skull. I didn\'t get that part either.As for Akito, he went from ""I will KILL that bastard"" to ""I don\'t want to fight you, Big Bro!"", and winds up crying for his brother who actually tried to kill him.My point is, their story (as emotional as it can be) was completely screwed in this episode. It was supposed to be a deathmatch between brothers.As for the rest : Layla went from a badass commander in OVAs 1 and 2 to Princess Peach in OVAs 3 to 5. What was interesting was her Geass. As crazy as it sounds, this power does not betray the standard of Code Geass. Basically, a Geass power is a psychological power. But Layla\'s allows her to literally GO BACK IN TIME and even TELEPORT. How is that possible? Easy : her ""Geass fragment"" is actually a way to control the C world.This is not really well explained, but basically, when she goes back in time or teleport, she actually changes the ""vision"" of the C World, which is how she affects reality. Remember that EVERYTHING in this anime is just a play, orchestrated by God. Then, whoever controls God can affect reality.My point is, Layla\'s power is actually logical. BUT it\'s OP as hell. I don\'t understand why they came up with such an idea.That said, it does explain why this OVA winds up in such a good note : Layla\'s character is cheesy, and she gets to write history as she will, so of course she would make a happy end.Finally, worst of all : Lelouch and Suzaku, in the end, aren\'t useful to the plot. They were important in OVA 3, but they really could have been cut out from the other ones.ENJOYMENTThis has to be the worst time I ever had watching Code Geass. I loved the first OVAs, liked the 4th, and the anime was legendary. But this one? It\'s a huge mess. Every plot has ended in a miserable way.To end on a positive note : I do retain that massacre scene (you probably know which one I\'m talking about) and the battle. Overall, the episode is good to watch, but it ruins the series so much that I just can\'t like it or even approve its existence.If you liked the previous OVAs, I really suggest you stick to them.

It´s the equivalent of a Netflix adaptation of Code Geass.Story:1/10Art and sound: 8/10Characters: 2/10Enjoyment: 2/10 (complete disappointment)The writers removed all that made CG great, the characters, plot, not cliche background and villains, the Machiavellian strategies, and left us with the more generic villain of all times and the worst utilization of the Geass. Not to say that nothing makes sense lore-wise.Not to mention that at some point they tried to kind of explain the Geass using...some sort of mumble-jumbo using quantum physics and all the tech-big words they could find in Wikipedia.The ending it´s the result of very poor writing and it was very painful to watch (no spoilers) I mean in it in the sense that the conclusion was so predictable and cliche that one cannot stop wondering how come they made such a bad argument under the name Code Geass. some sort of mumble-jumbo using quantum physics and all the tech-big words they could find in Wikipedia.The ending it´s the result of very poor writing and it was very painful to watch (no spoilers) I mean in it in the sense that the conclusion was so predictable and cliche that one cannot stop wondering how come they made such a bad argument under the name Code Geass.', ""This is going to be my first review here and why not start with a very contradictory show?Code Geass as a whole is one of my favorites animes and when I found out about these movies I was pretty curious to see what it would be about. I admit I was kinda suspicious regarding it's quality due to the ratings of previous reviews, but don't let them fool you, these movies are great and worth your time. Going to write this review as a evaluation of the five movies as a whole.I found it pretty clever that they have somewhat expanded the Code Geass...universe, this time, making the E.U as main scenario, a nation that until now wasn't too much well explored on past medias. The first three movies were perfect when setting the mood, they can be kinda slow paced sometimes but it's a construction that needs to be there and it pays off in the end. The last two kinda throws everything up in the air, trying to give more of a scientfiic or rather, mystical approach on certain things regarding mind collectivness but I'd rather view it as just ''empathy'' for others, be it your friend or foe. Nevertheless it still holds up due to the awesome fight scenes and the tension it builds on the watcher. I myself was about to eat my nails off of anxiety and I love when a show do this to me.Some things are just in there and doesn't make too much sense but it didn't affect my enjoyment as a whole, at least for me. People saying it's and ''insult to the code geass fandom'' I totally disagree, yes it's different, yes I can see why some people didn't like but it has its charm and it's way too far to be considered a bad show. It's not about Lelouch this time, it's about other characters and their story, their arc to overcome their fears and problems. Yes, you have to be really open minded when going through this movies cause it's definitely not going to follow the exact same pace and plot as the main anime.

In this story, the wars between Europe and Britain are mentioned. In general, this series talks about the main character of the story, a Japanese teenager named Akito, fighting on the European side against Britain, Lelouch's commander for Britain with his memory erased, and as usual, the problems...caused by Geass.The correct order of viewing is this: Watch the first season of Code Geass carefully and watch the 2nd of the 3 films that summarize the series with 1:23:50, then watch these 5 movies, and then watch the 2nd of the films that summarize the series with 1:26:12 and watch season 2.In short, this is the order of viewing.Tr:Bu bir spoiler değil ve bu 5 filmden oluşan hikaye alternatif bir evren veya zamanla akası yok, sadece olarak 1. sezonla 2. sezonun arasında yer alan bir hikaye.Kısacası: 1. sezonda ana karakter, Majesteleri tarafından hafızası siliniyor ve bu hikaye de Britanya için çalışıyor.

Definitely read this review after finishing the series.Code Geass is my #3 anime of all time, for reasons which should be obvious for anyone who has seen the show. I had heard about this series but never cared to watch it, but I decided to give it a shot. More than anything I’m dissapointed. I honestly think that this could’ve a pretty good show if it was a 25 episode show or something like that rather than 5 OVAs. This show mainly suffers from rushing and laziness.The story is meh...but isnt awful. In general is pretty straight forward with some confusingly thrown in elements and pointless subplots but its excuseable for the most part, except the actual Geass aspect which I’ll get into later. As stated before this story could’ve been much better if given more time in my opinion.My main gripe is just the handlement of characters. I’m a firm believer that a character has to establish relevancy in a story before becoming a larger part of a story. Many characters in this show have nearly 0 established or important relevancy, and yet they’re given spotlight as if they’ve established themself as a character worth caring for. Examples of this are that one doctor lady with the husband in the coma, that one girl Jeanne, and General Smilas. The main cast is alright. Leila is a solid character and serves her purpose well, but everything involving her family could’ve been fleshed out MUCH better, but in general I like her. Akito is very bland and doesn’t add much other than good action sequences, overall he’s very cliche but isn’t bad per say. The band of japanese terrorists that join the party are likeable, but once again they are not set up well as characters. One thing that really annoyed me was in the second episode involving them. During an attempted ambush of the brittanians they start trying shooting at Leila & Akito. This whole situation just gets shoved under the rug once they start fighting the Britannians and is never mentioned again, and they all just go on as  happy go lucky buds. Shin Hyuga Shiang is a cliche antagonist with a weak cliche motive. He was introduced very poorly in once again, a forced relevancy manner, just showing up randomly, killing some random guy and all of a sudden hes a big deal. Everything involving him and Akito’s backstory is just filled with confusing bullshit that only leaves questions and no answers, wayyy worse than the whole sword of akasha shit, overall however Shin isn’t terrible. Another character worth mentioning is Ashley, enteraining as he may be, his motive for vengeance against Akito for killing some totally random dude we couldn’t care less about is head scratching, yet another character who isn’t bad but just poorly fleshed out. As stated before, nearly all of these problems could be fixed if this show was in an actual show format rather than OVAs and time restraint wasnt an issue.The Geass power is just whatever the writers it wants to be in this show. Everything involving it in this show is just wrapped in confusing bullshit that I honestly believe the writers smoked something when writing this shit. I cant even bother to try to wrap my head around it because its the equivalent of trying to form a clear image out of 7 different puzzle sets. The actual Geass aspect of this show is atrocious and just the result of the writers smoking crack and going “what if we add this.”The OST is lackluster, really nothing much to say about it, the jazz during the mecha fights was cool at first but quickly faded into that of TV static. The animation and art looks very good in my opinion. Improves upon the Code Geass art style in very good way and the 2D animated stuff is very pleasing to the eyes. The CGI is jarring and not very good at first but it steadily improves throughout the show, and the mech fights are great at times.My last thing to say is that the inclusion of Suzaku and Lelouch as Julius Kingsley is nothing but a reminder saying “remember! This is the same universe as Code Geass!” Something that could’ve been done much better and honestly maybe even cut entirely.Overall it sounds like I don’t like this show, and that may be partially true, but this show isn’t that bad. Entertainment value is high, the fights and action sequences are very good and the saving grace for it. Mainly I’m dissapointed and like I said before, I think this could’ve been a good show if they were given an episode format. In general I think this series of OVAs is a strong 5 to light 6 out of 10. If you want to enjoy some good mech fights, this series might be worth watching, but for narrative, characters, and everything else, this show is a waste of time and you’re better off ignoring it. but isnt awful. In general is pretty straight forward with some confusingly thrown in elements and pointless subplots but its excuseable for the most part, except the actual Geass aspect which I’ll get into later.

The band of japanese terrorists that join the party are likeable, but once again they are not set up well as characters. One thing that really annoyed me was in the second episode involving them. During an attempted ambush of the brittanians they start trying shooting at Leila & Akito. This whole situation just gets shoved under the rug once they start fighting the Britannians and is never mentioned again, and they all just go on as  happy go lucky buds. Shin Hyuga Shiang is a cliche antagonist with a weak cliche motive. He was introduced very poorly in once again, a forced relevancy manner, just showing up randomly, killing some random guy and all of a sudden hes a big deal. Everything involving him and Akito’s backstory is just filled with confusing bullshit that only leaves questions and no answers, wayyy worse than the whole sword of akasha shit, overall however Shin isn’t terrible. Another character worth mentioning is Ashley, enteraining as he may be, his motive for vengeance against Akito for killing some totally random dude we couldn’t care less about is head scratching, yet another character who isn’t bad but just poorly fleshed out. As stated before, nearly all of these problems could be fixed if this show was in an actual show format rather than OVAs and time restraint wasnt an issue.The Geass power is just whatever the writers it wants to be in this show. Everything involving it in this show is just wrapped in confusing bullshit that I honestly believe the writers smoked something when writing this shit. I cant even bother to try to wrap my head around it because its the equivalent of trying to form a clear image out of 7 different puzzle sets. The actual Geass aspect of this show is atrocious and just the result of the writers smoking crack and going “what if we add this.”The OST is lackluster, really nothing much to say about it, the jazz during the mecha fights was cool at first but quickly faded into that of TV static. The animation and art looks very good in my opinion. Improves upon the Code Geass art style in very good way and the 2D animated stuff is very pleasing to the eyes. The CGI is jarring and not very good at first but it steadily improves throughout the show, and the mech fights are great at times.My last thing to say is that the inclusion of Suzaku and Lelouch as Julius Kingsley is nothing but a reminder saying “remember! This is the same universe as Code Geass!” Something that could’ve been done much better and honestly maybe even cut entirely.Overall it sounds like I don’t like this show, and that may be partially true, but this show isn’t that bad. Entertainment value is high, the fights and action sequences are very good and the saving grace for it. Mainly I’m dissapointed and like I said before, I think this could’ve been a good show if they were given an episode format. In general I think this series of OVAs is a strong 5 to light 6 out of 10. If you want to enjoy some good mech fights, this series might be worth watching, but for narrative, characters, and everything else, this show is a waste of time and you’re better off ignoring it.', 'The good:-The sound was awesome! The music that played during the fight scenes was really fun and edgy, and reminded me of Cowboy Bebop in a way. I also loved the end song.-More movies in the Code Geass universe!The bad:-Well....pretty much everything elseI was really hyped to see that there was a series of movies set in the same universe/time frame as the original Code Geass series. The concept of the movies was good, and I liked the idea of Akito\'s character. However, everything felt forced and jumbled together - all style and no substance. I imagine that the conversation leading up to...the creation of this movie series went something like this:-Marketing: The people loved Code Geass! Let\'s do some more of that.-Movie Directors: Okay well let\'s spend some time making some new, well-thought out characters that --Marketing: MORE MECHA!-Directors: Surely we are going to need to spend some time making a cohesive, compelling plot line so that --Marketing: MORE GEASS!!!-Directors: Well that is good and all but we are definitely going to need to give the viewers that extra special ""something"" to make this movie stand out-Marketing: Wut OK make some good music lolz. SPACE-TIME CONTINUUM!!!!Don\'t get me wrong, I love a story told on a grand scale with lots of different factors coming into play....as long it all fits together. However, this movie was a hot mess of different ideas that just felt cobbled together, propped up on the previous glory of the original Code Geass.Even the characters, when viewed apart from the shoddy story line, felt shallow to me. Akito had a decent backstory, but the other characters only had small hints to their pasts and underlying motives. I felt no emotional connection to any of them. Leila was especially disappointing. I LOVE a strong female character, and she was a prime position to become one, but overall she felt hesitant, weak, and superfluous. the creation of this movie series went something like this:-Marketing: The people loved Code Geass!

I have tried to cover them as much as I can.All Hail Lelouch!Well I am grateful for the makers giving 5 hours of more enjoyment.When I started watching the first episode I accepted that it will be like Rogue One where it is a good side story and everyone will die in the end. Yes some of the characters die but we can see some happy endings....There are really good mecha combat scenes and the battle for fortress is good. Jean\'s last scene was touching.The StoryWe  have a nice good side story which has enough depth but does not effect ""All Hail Lelouch!""ArtThe mecha scenes are clear and you can keep who is fighting who easily than most animes.SoundPerfectCharacterWith the fifth episode we get almost any main characters\' story.

I don't think I'll have to watch this series ever again, or at least, not in the foreseeable 3 years or so. give credit wherever it's due, and the animation folks have outdone most of their collective work regarding the whole series, there were some bugging flaws here and there, but this was the best entry to feature CGI that blends with the 2D environment the best.I feel like I just have to pick on the lack of the majestic ending song that made the previous movies great while at that too.

There is also the matter of the four legged one...piloted by Shin which can go 160 kph and switch direction quickly despite being heavily armored, it also has a lever action rifle, which is clearly an outdated design and some bullshit melee weapon made from gears and blades held together with magic,  Then there is the one piloted by Ashley at the airship having some bullshit armor than can deflect normal bullets, this also shows us that EU knightmares carry 4-5 different type of rounds which begs the question where do they store them? There is also a serious lack of different type units like tanks or aircraft, we do get a scene with artillery but nothing serious. One of the thing I liked in R1&R2 was the use of mixed arms, and supporting units, which gave it a realistic feel, despite it getting ignored towards the ending.So, in summary, while most of the mech vs mech action was good, there wasn\'t really anything else, the battles were uninteresting mostly just the two sides smashing together without any tactics or strategy, basically just a brawl, which is not a problem on it\'s own, but not what I would expecting of Code Geass.The plot & characters:The plot revolves around Akito, as the title would suggest, he starts out as edgy, then after getting tricked into forced labour by a bunch of gypsies, he suddenly becomes kind. He is part of a spec ops team dropped behind enemy lines to create a diversion, we don\'t get a reason why. It\'s as bad as it sounds. We barely get any background on him, that only asks more questions, like how did he ended up in the EU army, and how the hell is he still alive, etc. Overall he has no depth and his character develops the way the plot requires it.Leila, from whose perspective we see the plot unfolding for the most of time, could be called the MC, but if not for that she would be pretty forgettable, generic naive ojou-sama type who can\'t really do anything on her own. She came up withe the idea of the spec ops team though it only mention once when she is give command of it. She doesn\'t do much during the films, besides recruiting the eleven pilots, and the bullshit at the end. Her parents were  Britannian nobility, seeking refuge in the EU. Her father became a popular politician, who then got assassinated along with her mother. While running away she falls into a lake and freezes solid only to be rescued by C.C. somehow and then given a geass that only activates when she grows up, she completely forgets this until the last episode, where it turns out it\'s a geass canceller, let\'s her see the future/travel back in time, teleport, see and interact with dead people and god knows what else.The third most important character is probably the Akito\'s nemesis, his brother Shin. Supposedly his geass forces people to kill themselves, but not much is known about it, besides that he got it from a flying skull that came out of a painting. His goal is to kill everyone to free them from the suffering that is life, which IS a valid philosophical argument, though he came to this conclusion because his mother cheated on his father which is at best a cheese. There is also the question of how the hell did he became Britannian nobility and a the leader of a holy order as an eleven, even though he got adopted, and then named successor it makes no sense considering ""discrimination against numbers is Britannian national policy"", no way would it be allowed or anyone would even consider it.Honorable mentions goes to the trio of Japanese criminals, who fight alongside Akito, their characters are one dimensional, being there only to support Akito, they don\'t really have any backstory, they start out hating Akito, trying to kill him and Leila before and during a mission, then after a single battle they became besties.Lelouch and Suzaku also shows up, though Suzaku has no impact at all, and Lelouch is used as a plot device to change leadership on both sides, resulting in Shin taking power on the Britannian side and military rule on the EU\'s side, this doesn\'t have any effect on the plot and is mostly disregarded anyway. And it conflicts with R2 so there goes continuity.There is Ashely and Jean, Ashley is only role is fighting, he doesn\'t have much of a character, Jean character revolves around her being in love with Shin, ending with her jumping in front of Akito taking Shins blade, causing her to die, while also shooting and killing Shin.There also a bunch of other supporting characters but they add so little it would be a waste to mention them.Sound and Art:Art is good, about the same as the original series, though I absolutely hate CGI, the music is good even if not memorably, it usually fit with the scenes.Fun:The first 3 could be considered fun, the 4th one is bad and the 5th outright terrible, even as a stand alone series. I don\'t know if they originally planned it to be a 25 episode anime, but there are a lots of things left unanswered and the ending felt extremely rushed.Overall, anything besides the mecha fights and the character designs sucks, even moreso considering it\'s Code Geass. piloted by Shin which can go 160 kph and switch direction quickly despite being heavily armored, it also has a lever action rifle, which is clearly an outdated design and some bullshit melee weapon made from gears and blades held together with magic,  Then there is the one piloted by Ashley at the airship having some bullshit armor than can deflect normal bullets, this also shows us that EU knightmares carry 4-5 different type of rounds which begs the question where do they store them?

As for limitations Lelouch's geass only can only work on each of his targets once and he has to be able to look them directly into the eyes and not say through the display and cameras in their knightmares. In contrast Mao's geass does not have these limitations and affects everyone within half kilometer radius from him.Akito the Exiled geass users have neither concrete powers not concrete rules of usage. By episode 5 geass is just used as deus ex machina for scrip writers to pull whatever.While early on Akito the Exiled showcased the life in EU and Euro Britannia, later story became about about authors own values and philosophy of life they wish to sell us.Overall story mostly revolves around Leila Malcal and everyone else acts as her support, the final episode is about main antagonist Shin Hyuga and pretty much the entire cast is used to stop him from destroying Pendragon and killing everyone.This unlike the original, here authors want to make a dichotomy between death represented by Hyūga and Life represented by Leila and those who ended up on her side.Hangyaku no Lelouch and Akito the Exiled have ultimately the opposite views on lfe and values.The original Hangyaku no Lelouch was about fighting for justice against the unjust system and the unjust world. It clashes this worldview with that of Suzaku but ultimately lets Lelouch's vision to prevail.However it is also an ultimate tale of battle for one's inner personal happiness, even if the entire world oppose you.The main protagonist continually defies fate at every turn and twist of his life no matter what happens. It is a story about fight against fate. The story of Ubermensch if you want.In contrast Akito the Exiled at first endorses monarchy, aristocracy and military dictatorship as 'stronger' systems. Then continues on to endorse basically pacifism, acceptance of fate and saving human lives above all else.If in the Hangyaku no Lelouch Charles wanted to kill god and Lelouch later geassed god into obeying his vision for the future.Then in Akito some mysterious girl just acts as a representative of some sort of 'higher power' and fixes the final outcomes of the plot. Not only it is a poor lazy writing, but also a values statement on existance of the said 'higher power', something like a god, the kind of god who is 'a bearded old man on a cloud or a winged goddess' to quote VV from Hangyaku no Lelouch who also said there is no such thing.It is a story about surrender and acceptance of fate to save lives. And about miserable existence that follows.There is also underlying message of guilt for being a human. Overall story about being the Nietzschean Last Man and living a medieval lifestlye in some wooden wagon on wheels, drawing water from river with buckets and such. No seriously.

Burn the Witch,https://myanimelist.net/anime/41468/Burn_the_Witch,"[""This anime has a disastrous montage.Burn The Witch is anything but a movie. The biggest problem that prevents any internal logic is the way it was distributed by Crunchyroll. The movie was perforated like a seasonal anime, and the transition between the 3 episodes is disastrous, the narrative tone of each episode gives the feeling that the story is going to be much bigger than it really is.In the little show time we have, the anime tries to develop an internal problem that doesn't work or just doesn't matter, and tries to assimilate that with a drama of some characters that does not move.When I...finished watching, it got that feeling of something unfinished. It can even be a very rich anime visually, but it does not explore any of this, the anime universe is very artificial, it seems that the characters were taken from another world, and played there in the middle.To conclude, Burn The Witch was not able to enchant at any time thanks to the efforts of the filmmakers who seem to me to have prioritized a visual part without correctly assimilating it as the work's unity. finished watching, it got that feeling of something unfinished.

It really brought back that Bleach nostalgia.While I can't even to begin to express how glad I am that I could experience Burn The Witch immediately as it released, it wasn't a flawless masterpiece. It tried to tell way too much story that could naturally fit in a one hour movie. The world building wasn’t as strong as it could have been. If only this movie had an extra 20-30 minutes to its runtime, like a normal length animated feature, it would have flowed a lot smoother and could have fleshed out the characters and world a bit...more. Some things weren't explained fully and the characters didn't have enough time to become fully developed. This is especially true for Balgo, who is easily the flattest and least interesting character in the movie.There is a moment at the end of the movie where two characters hug (sort of), and it feels so random and comes so out of nowhere, that you would think that there actually was a prequel movie to this, since nothing in the movie made it seem like they were on hugging terms.Another flaw I would give this movie would go to the animation team at studio Colorido. While the fight scenes were well animated for the most part, a lot of the still frames felt stiff. While that may seem like an obvious thing to say, it felt stiffer than most still frames feel. Some of the CG was off-putting as well, but most of the CGI was integrated well.Now for the positives, as I said before, the action scenes were well animated for the most part. They were very slickly and stylishly animated and the CGI was integrated well most of the time. The Marchen (legendary dragon) was animated nicely as well. The entire backstory scene with Macy and Elly was presented wonderfully. The ED song was nice and the soundtrack fit. The voice cast was all solid as well.Most of the cast had great designs. The character designs were very Bleach-like and they looked great in this setting. Also, it is just nice to see the Bleach references and to just be back in the world of Bleach. The main characters, Noel and Ninny, are really likable (even if not fully developed), and they really had a natural and believable chemistry between them.This movie was enjoyable, although I went in to the movie already loving it, so I have a bias. That being said, I think that non-Bleach fans will have a harder time enjoying it than Bleach fans.There will probably be more animated Burn The Witch content down the road, so it will be interesting to see where the series goes from here.All in all, an 8 out of 10. more.

We get about 2 minutes of the anime establishing the setting, another 2 minutes of vague implications about who and what people are, and then all of a sudden we’re fighting dragons in the middle of the street. The lack in background isn’t so bad that you can’t follow what’s going on, but the anime would have been a million times better if everything had been laid out properly before...the plot started escalating (which is how stories usually work).On a positive note, I thought the sounds were amazing. The greatest selling point of this anime would probably be the background music which fit the scenes very well. The music had a magical vibe that was perfect for the plot. It was also very innovative since it combined different kinds of sounds: modern sounds, orchestral sounds, and even some really cool vocals. I enjoyed the effects and outro too.5/10 the plot started escalating (which is how stories usually work).On a positive note, I thought the sounds were amazing.

In fact, I can\'t even call this a movie, maybe an OVA would better describe it.Let me start off with the first thing that greets you when you watch an anime, the animation. I must say Studio Colorido has done a great job at animating this movie, the fight scenes are visually pleasing and the movements are fluid, there\'s no sign of shoddy work done by a bunch of underpaid chumps. Although some frames...felt a bit jagged and stiff, great work! I will also praise the character designs which fit perfectly into the setting.Now onto the story and let me say this again, it\'s nothing special. Just your average shounen anime, fights, drama, and bam that\'s that. Although they did a decent job explaining the backstories everything just felt a bit rushed, if this movie was maybe 30-50 minutes longer, they could\'ve executed this a bit better. MC\'s are likable, nothing special, there\'s chemistry but at the same time it doesn\'t feel as fully built as it should be, the ending scene seemed completely out of place. Then there\'s Balgo, who is so damn bland, so boring that even some plain tart from Yogurtland had more ""spice."" I understand there wasn\'t much material to work with, but everything felt extremely rushed.In summation, Burn the Witch is an enjoyable movie, albeit with no depth in any way. Visually rich but falls short when you take the story into account. Nothing more than your average shounen anime as I previously stated.5/10 felt a bit jagged and stiff, great work!

I completely expected a soulless cashgrabbing garbage to fund Bleach 2021, but I was absolutely surprised. Burn the Witch is the only anime I didn't drop at episode 1 in 2020, and not because other shows this year were absolutely horrible, they were, but Burn the Witch is so god damn good.Let's get this out of the way. I am a fan of Bleach, been one for some 12 years now. But these 3 episodes, or should I say, 1 movie, took me in way faster than anything Bleach EVER did.Interesting characters? Check.Amazing power system? Check.Amazing animation? Check.Bleach references? Check.Kubo once...again showed why he is a master of character design, if not story telling at least. But BTW GENUINELY has a great premise. The series fully deserves to be completely adapted, and I can easily see it overcoming Bleach, in both quality and popularity.To keep this short, it's an amazing watch, doesn't even matter if you saw/read Bleach or not. This movie is absolute quality of the highest standard, and it is surprising it comes from a hack like Kubo, who butchered the ending of Bleach.

There will be a season 2 for the manga which will more than likely be animated as well.On the production side, there is nothing to complain about. The animation is totally smooth and nowhere does it ever drop in quality. The ED theme is beautiful. The sound designer didn't do that annoying thing where they just added a ton of bass to every explosion/hit and crunched it. The comedy was on point, the character designs are all unique, the voices fit...every character to a tee. Good job Studio Colorido.The plot for this first arc was very clear and concise. Every character had a unique personality nor did they seem cookie cutter. Season 1 did an excellent job of providing a foundation for the chapters to come. The viewer immediately gets a sense of the world the characters live in and its rules. Despite its short run time, I totally felt the emotions of certain characters and have become attached to quite a few that aren't the protagonists.There's just too many good things to say about Kubo's BTW and Studio Colorido.Stan Noel. every character to a tee.

I agree with the criticisms that say this feels like a 12 episode show and we\'re starting on episode...4, but I think overall they did a good job of establishing relationships, each character\'s personality & motivations, and a pretty significant amount of worldbuilding in just 1 hour. Everything left me wanting more, and I PRAY that one day this gets picked up as a full series, even if it gets handed off from the author to a studio for them to make their own thing out of it.

""Burn the Witch"" was no exception in this case. When the one-shot came out,I didn’t really feel the urge to get into it. But after the serialization,I got the drive force to give the manga and the adaptation a try and it sure as hell didn’t disappoint me.In simple terms,I would say,""Burn the Witch"" felt like an anime version of J.K. Rowling\'s Fantastic Beasts(Hey,Harry Potter fans! Did I catch your attention with that?). But,firstly,let me clear...up the confusion you’re in right now of whether this is a sequel to Bleach or is it a seperate story. It doesn’t directly involve the characters from Bleach but it does occur in the same universe.Ok.Let\'s get into it. The show does feel a lot like Bleach as the characters are a lot similar. But it actually works and doesn’t feel like a repetive out of place setup. The basic concepts are pretty much the same.  MC is a human,he gets involved with an other worldly girl with powers and the girl is a part of a police force that supervises the control of other creatures in her reality. It does have fun characters and the story itself is interesting. Although,I would\'ve loved to see more of the story as a one hour movie kind of felt short as it\'s set up in the universe of a long running anime. The animation wasn’t top notch throughout the whole thing but it\'s still pretty solid. The fights were perfectly done with great animation and amazing sound effects.Athough,One of the negative points this show has is that it might not be appealing to someone who\'s not familiar with stories from Kubo as this one attracted Bleach fans the most.If you haven’t watched it yet,step back as I\'m about to spoil the story now-Earlier in the review,I did mention about this show being a lot like Fantastic Beats. So,let\'s look into that. Instead of the Obscurus,we have a featherless chicken that turns into a disney princess after losing contact with it\'s owner(I said that because it\'s name was Cinderella after the transformation).  In case of the characters,Balgo feels like a blend of Ichigo and Kon,Noel feels like a fusion of Orihime and Unohana,Ninny feels like a combination of Hiyori and Yoruichi and Bruno is like a mixture between Grimjow and Bazz B. I liked Noel\'s tsundere act at the end and the Bleach logo inside the Burn the Witch logo was definitely clever.In conclusion,it\'s a solid and entertaining show and I would definitely recommend giving it a try. up the confusion you’re in right now of whether this is a sequel to Bleach or is it a seperate story.

Also has your typical higher-up people who are like, ""We\'re gonna take care of it, stay out of our way!"" and one of the main characters (or just one, but we have a duo) is like, ""Nope, can\'t...do!"" and goes all out to be a hero in the end. I think we\'ve all seen these scenarios and the anime directors seem to can\'t get enough of it, so they don\'t wanna try to be original. If you\'re gonna use this scenario, I always hope it\'s at least interesting and unique from the others and this anime got off the hook with it, but barely passed.Art: It looks like a typical anime design (and it is), but they kept it clean and consistent, even during the fighting animations. I really like how each character looks the best rather than the scenery. The scenery barely changed throughout the movie anyway. But I like the designs and the dragon designs were nice as well. Job well done.Sound: I don\'t really pay attention to OSTs, but they have to be unique and good for me to notice it and even start listening to it. If I like an opening/ending, it has to be good. The ending of the first two eps were okay, but the ending on the last ep really got me jamming. So my score is a 7 just because of that ending.Character: This movie did a good job including all the typical characters: loud and determined one, reserved and follows the rules, the pervert, the one who cares about people, and the reckless with the most self confidence. I\'m not gonna say who\'s which because I don\'t want to put any spoilers, but at least every character was likeable (for me, at least).Enjoyment: I actually really liked it, even though it was such a basic anime. If a basic anime goes right, it actually turns out to be really good. The plot itself was definitely not interesting, but the animation and characters made up for some of it.Overall: I\'m not picky when it comes to watching anime and if you look at my list, you can tell I don\'t really give any bad ratings. Most of the bad ratings are in my dropped list, but when it comes to watching till the end, it shows that I enjoyed it some way.

As a result, it barely manages to offer up an hour of content, and viewers are left only wishing that there was more. Is that really a bad thing, though? For what content is provided, I feel as though the writers did an excellent...job of answering most of the big questions, and left enough unanswered to make me wish it was a full series.

Burn the Witch is without a doubt one of the best animated films/anime (regardless of the three-episode count) I have ever seen in 2020-2021.---STORY---Rating: 9The story was set up very well with the concept on the setting of Reverse London which plays a huge part in the anime and its lore. The plot turned out to become interesting for the most part as the story advances throughout the story, though at some points may make viewers feel like the story has nothing special. However,...besides the speed bumps that had underwent in the plot, I do think there are some parts in Burn the Witch that may be special in particular. The set up of Burn the Witch even reminded me of the Little Witch Academia series I watched a while back, which they are both some of the great witch anime as well. The character development here and there was evermore interesting, especially for characters Ninny Spangcole, Noel Niihashi and Macy Baljure. One scene particularly in the first act and the climax was intense and had a ton of action that is worth entertaining for many.---ART---Rating: 9The art direction in Burn the Witch was pretty spectacular with the landscapes, the vastness in the environment of London/Reverse London, and the production/set design in some of the settings in the anime. There were even some scenes with amazing art in particular that help play out some of the great cinematography/layout that the film has in some sequences.---SOUND---Rating: 10The sound design (mixing/editing) was incredible in Burn the Witch, alongside the fantastic original score/music composed by Keiji Inai. Though the anime has perfect voice acting and the action sequences incorporate great dragon/magic sound effects, the film orchestrates a various array of using a mix of sound effects and voice acting in some parts in a wonderful display of sound mixing/editing in anime that immerses viewers into their world. The ED song, Blowing, is no doubt harmonious.---CHARACTERS---Rating: 10Along with the major and technical specs Burn the Witch had to offer as well as its imaginative character design, the characters/voice acting was the main highlight of the anime for me. Asami Tano (english dub actress Olivia Hack of Avatar: TLA and Bratz fame) has brought humor, drama and passion to her role as Ninny Spangcole, in which her character examples ambition, beauty, magical and complexion in the anime. Ninny has a tour-de-force powerhouse anime performance that I believe that she is one of the best anime girls of the year and is one of the best animated performances in my opinion this year.Yuina Yamada (english dub actress Allegra Clark) on the other hand also brought serenity, empathetic and splendor as the other main Noel Niihashi, who also brings sensitivity, courage and teamwork in every scene she's in.Saori Hayami (english dub actress Brianna Knickerbocker) apparently has one of the strongest roles/performances in the anime, exemplifying shrewdness, emotion and even humor in her role as Macy Baljure, in which, alongside Ninny, is one of the best characters in the anime and has one of the best developed character developments and backstories, showing melancholy, dignity and/or comedy in many of her scenes.Other major supporting characters in the anime, including male characters Balgo Ywain Parks (played by Shimba Tsuchiya (english dub actor Griffin Burns)) and Bruno Bangnyfe (played by Chikahiro Kobayashi (english dub actor Sean Chiplock from Re:Zero)), has shown promising and intriguing roles by playing crucial parts to the story alongside the other characters.Osushi was at least pretty cute too.---ENJOYMENT---Rating: 10Hands down, I have enjoyed every minute of Burn the Witch, if its not the best anime ever (since there's also Ghibli and other anime films/series out there that are animated masterpieces). If I made my own animation awards for films and series, I'd definitely contend/nominate it for one or some awards. I know some people don't agree that Burn the Witch is great, but I for one loved it.

The director, Tatsuro Kawano, has made a mesmerizing debut in his first anime direction for Burn the Witch after his commitments to key animation in various animes.---OVERALL---Rating: 10(96% as a percentage)Burn the Witch was a splendorous, whimsical wonderment that's ever been adapted from a manga by the author of Bleach. I hope more of the story is told later on with a sequel in the near future, because I would love to see where their next adventures would take them next. The story was amazing with a faithful adaptation to the manga, the artwork is well done, the sound design is immersive/innovative with the use of magic/dragon sound effects, the characters along with its designs and developments absolutely shine in every scene, and the anime itself is impactful, especially for diehard Tite Kubo and Bleach fans.

The story was amazing with a faithful adaptation to the manga, the artwork is well done, the sound design is immersive/innovative with the use of magic/dragon sound effects, the characters along with its designs and developments absolutely shine in every scene, and the anime itself is impactful, especially for diehard Tite Kubo and Bleach fans. I'd recommend it to those who wish to see the Burn the Witch in anime form and to those who want to see this."", ""After watching burn the witch, it was like watching bleach again, but in the different universe, the vibe of bleach is really connected to burn the witch, and as for the bleach fan, it was amazing to watch it, it has great potential and I hope we are going to see a new season soon enough, because I have a feeling it is only just starting, and we will get more in the future, so let's hope for itNow let's talk about burn the witchIt is the same as bleach, soul reaper/witch against hollow/dragon, and it is same mission for both of them, but...burn the witch is way different than bleach when it comes to the mission, the selling, the handling and the connection, because burn the witch is in the future after bleach, the story is the most important and interesting part of burn the witch, and I hope we are going to see it more in the futurethe art is absolutely amazing and beautiful, the studio did absolutely a amazing jobthe sound was awesome it was really good musicThe characters is the best one, it is very bleach character feeling right there, the characters  development, they personally, the acting and the looks, it is amazing to the characters Noel and Ninny as the main character in the series, because it is not often we see the female character as protagonist, tite kubo did amazing job to make female characters to the main characters in the series, and also the support character bruno is side of grimmjow and it makes more exciting to watch the seriesI really enjoying watching burn the witch, it is the same feeling when I watching bleach back then, and I really hope we are going to see more burn the witch in the future, because it really deserves it, so I hope we can support tite kubo for he's working and he's new series, he really needs supporting from us and I hope he gets it, tite kubo deserves itThank you tite kubo for this new series from your biggest bleach fan ^^ burn the witch is way different than bleach when it comes to the mission, the selling, the handling and the connection, because burn the witch is in the future after bleach, the story is the most important and interesting part of burn the witch, and I hope we are going to see it more in the futurethe art is absolutely amazing and beautiful, the studio did absolutely a amazing jobthe sound was awesome it was really good musicThe characters is the best one, it is very bleach character feeling right there, the characters  development, they personally, the acting and the looks, it is amazing to the characters Noel and Ninny as the main character in the series, because it is not often we see the female character as protagonist, tite kubo did amazing job to make female characters to the main characters in the series, and also the support character bruno is side of grimmjow and it makes more exciting to watch the seriesI really enjoying watching burn the witch, it is the same feeling when I watching bleach back then, and I really hope we are going to see more burn the witch in the future, because it really deserves it, so I hope we can support tite kubo for he's working and he's new series, he really needs supporting from us and I hope he gets it, tite kubo deserves itThank you tite kubo for this new series from your biggest bleach fan ^^"", ""Where did this come from and how do I get more? Absolutely phenomenal from start to finish. I found it to be unpredictable, surprising, the art style complemented the story, the characters were interesting and had flaws and strengths.The characters, the world, the story, given so few episodes I didn't think it could come together. However, I was pleasantly surprised. I really enjoyed the animation and all of it.No notes. Give me more.It is associated with the bleach universe, however, I am not that familiar with bleach, just a few Easter eggs. Not anything related to the main plot.I think that people that give...this a chance will really enjoy it.Good vibes. this a chance will really enjoy it.Good vibes."", ""I truly enjoyed this anime. The story itself was good enough that I didn’t necessarily need to have any prior knowledge that it  takes place in Bleach universe. Although with only 3 episodes, the story sets itself up with the potential that it could later turn into a full 12 episode series.The artwork was amazing. When I think dragons, I think cute or total badass. Burn the Witch managed to deliver both. The fighting sequence was well done and didn’t feel dull. The main characters were enjoyable with the classic fiery witch being paired with the more calm demeanor one. Voice acting was on...point. (Asami Tano's delivery as the classic fiery witch was amazing).The background music was good in its setting. I really vibed with the outro song. point. (Asami Tano's delivery as the classic fiery witch was amazing).The background music was good in its setting. I really vibed with the outro song."", ""Quite obviously rushed. However, good concepts and great animation. Seems promising. Would want more of this, better written, than a revived Bleach.As reviews need to be longer, just a few more words:There being a law that those who have touched dragons are to be imprisoned/executed sounds completely unreasonable. But, this could lead to further reveals, and I wouldn't mind just assuming it as a premise. The greatest part of the short story for me: in the end the problem isn't solved by friendship and love between human and dragons. That the white dragon outright tried to kill its adoptive mother lays promising grounds for further...dragon-human relationships. dragon-human relationships."", 'Burn the Witch was a pleasant surprise to me. It appeared really bland and mediocre on paper. Moreover, I have never read even a single chapter of Bleach, forget about being a fan of it. But still, the movie did a pretty decent job at entertaining me within its span of an hour. I\'ll explain why.Burn the Witch takes place in the city of London. It mainly revolves around two witches, Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole, who are a part of an organization named Wing Bind. Their job is to protect and cope with dragons that are invisible to most people and cause the majority...of the deaths in London.Needless to say, the premise of Burn the Witch isn\'t very unique. However, as I have always said, the story doesn\'t need to be completely unique in order to be compelling. If executed properly, even shows with the most unoriginal plots can be very entertaining to watch. Initially, Burn the Witch seems to follow that formula pretty well. Though, the problem with the plot becomes apparent as we move onto the second episode.Burn the Witch can be a bit overambitious at times. It tries to tell way too much story than it actually needs to. It wants to narrate a lot bigger story, but fails at doing so because of its short span. If the movie had run for 30 extra minutes, it could\'ve done a much better job at world building and storytelling.But that isn\'t to say the plot is completely irredeemable. Despite not being particularly innovative or outstanding, it does a decent job at keeping the viewers engrossed in watching. But as I said before, just taking a little more time with the world building and storytelling could\'ve been really efficient in making the plot even more enjoyable. Because of that exact reason, most characters don\'t get the chance to be fully fleshed out either. Not enough time is given to properly develop all of them, which can become a little problematic later on.They aren\'t unlikeable in any way, though. They all have their distinct and likeable characteristics which make them pretty entertaining. Our protagonists, Noel and Nana, are really likeable and their interactions are always amusing to watch. The backstory of Macy and Elly is also presented decently. Even Bruno, who seemed like a huge asshole, turned out to be a not-so-bad person in the end. I especially enjoyed Balgo\'s personality; his idiotic nature and uselessness might annoy some viewers, but I personally found it very appealing.In case of animation, Burn the Witch does a pretty decent job. Studio Colorido isn\'t the most renowned studio out there, but they handled the animation greatly in this case. The character designs are distinct and attractive. The dragons are decorated nicely in terms of designs as well. While some action scenes feel kinda stiff, most of them are very decently animated. The voice acting and soundtrack are also very decent. Most background tracks, despite not being very memorable, are befitting to the movie, which makes the fight scenes more dynamic and enjoyable. There isn\'t any opening theme, but the ending song ""Blowing"" sung by NiL is kinda catchy.To summarize, Burn the Witch is a pretty enjoyable movie. A little more runtime could\'ve helped fix some of the issues regarding the narrative, but the movie was quite good for what it was. So if you are looking for a short but entertaining movie full of epic action and goofy characters, give Burn the Witch a try. of the deaths in London.Needless to say, the premise of Burn the Witch isn\'t very unique.

A sad, overhyped joke.I personally have not seen Bleach, so I would not understand the connections between this miniseries and Bleach, but I feel like I don\'t have to to be critical of this pure waste of time. While Burn the Witch is incredibly well-animated, it\'s so devoid of substance that I couldn\'t feel any emotion towards this whatsoever. All I could think was that I was glad it only lasts an hour so I wouldn\'t waste any more of my time on it.There are so many pieces introduced that don\'t end up playing any role in the show\'s...outcome, and the pieces that do play a role are really stupid. For example, Balgo is one of the worst characters I have ever seen in an anime. His only purpose in the story is to be protected for reasons that are far beyond me, there is no indication as to what his relationships to Noel or Ninny are, and he somehow ends up as a Mary Sue in the very end. What hurts the most is that far more interesting characters get no development whatsoever. Ninny is a protagonist that simply exists, without getting nearly enough of the backstory or development she could have used to become a good protagonist. And yet somehow, Noel gets even LESS development. The show just leaves you with so many more questions than answers because it\'s so dedicated to the idea of doing nothing with its characters.Burn the Witch also has perhaps one of the worst climaxes I\'ve seen in an anime. In retrospect I\'m glad I felt nothing towards it because if I had somehow become invested in these characters I\'m sure the final battle would have been even MORE insulting. There\'s no story, no satisfying combat, no genuine attempts at comedy (seriously it\'s almost exclusively the ""panzu"" jokes""), no good characters, and overall just nothing positive going for it aside from the animation. I wanted to enjoy Burn the Witch, everyone told me I would, but that\'s just not the way it goes sometimes. outcome, and the pieces that do play a role are really stupid.

The 3 episode format led to a unnecessary ending for two episodes when it should have just been put all together for fluidity.Story was nothing special but nothing trash. Plot twists were cool but generic.Characters were extremely average to me but Noel and Ninny got thighs so thats a plus. The interactions between the two main females are funny, sometimes.Animation once again is average and non-memorable.In conclusion, if you have a rough 1 hour of time to do anything, watch Burn The Witch if you just wanna pass time, but do not expect anything amazing. ', ""Cons:This three episodes transition and pacing isn't good, the way the episodes end aren't well done. It feels like they just wanted to squeeze some artwork with a catchy song at the end.The world building wasn't that good but not terrible, you could understand in a way what the world is in a few minutes.The main characters aren't bad, they're good characters.The supporting characters are just there, they could've played a better role in the story (specially Banx). Balgo is just annoying and useless....Pros:The world has an interesting settingGood artwork and soundLikeable main charactersIt's an enjoyable watchThe pacing isn't that badOverall:This one-shot has the potential to become a good anime, just fixing the pacing problem might be enough sense that's the main problem. It has a good setting, with supporting characters that can be great if they are done right, with two main characters that might become popular, sense there personalities are quite good.

In those few episodes it manages to show the universe (like scanning codes to open portals, using phones to keep track of their progress, those areas being locked by hidden fences) a plethora or characters (that don't look or act alike), great art (with plenty of detail and without those dumb underwear shots), good music (though unfortunately rarely played), a few twists (like that fingershot at the end) and jokes, everything being mixed in overall dark (or just far from fairytale) mood.Plot overall...wasn't the best but... how can all this be squeezed in 60 minutes and reasonably development? Obviously it was rushed but characters are not irritably stupid, act naturally, dialogues and situations are well above good and I wish it would not have ended so abruptly, though they just had in order to have certain closure (unlike many others) and that just ears them more respect points.Hell, I would even read the manga I guess, which is extremely rare for me. wasn't the best but... how can all this be squeezed in 60 minutes and reasonably development?

If you\'re familiar with Tite Kubo of Bleach fame, you will be able to tell that he plans on expanding this series way beyond this first movie.Story: 5/10.There are two things you need to know before jumping into this movie.The first: it\'s a sequel to the original Burn the Witch one-shot. Yes, not an adaptation, a sequel. The events of the one-shot still happened, but you don\'t get to...see any of it. This is why you\'re just thrown into the series\' world, without any real introduction to its main characters.The second: the story is incomplete. As I mentioned above, this movie, as well as the first season of the manga that it adapts, is a prologue. It serves to introduce you to Ninny, Noel, Balgo and a few other characters before the ""real story"" actually begins... Which is very weird, considering that the manga went into indefinite hiatus as soon as Season One was done, so we actually don\'t have that ""real story"" yet.Let\'s talk about the movie\'s story, for what it\'s worth. Two girls work for an agency that handles dragons, both friendly and useful, as well as aggressive and dangerous. They\'re currently taking care of this really annoying guy called Balgo, and if you want to know why... you have to read the one-shot.This is bad story-telling. Nothing indicates that the movie is a sequel to the one-shot, and you\'ll only find out about this if you do research on the series on your own, because there is NOTHING that alludes to why or how they got stuck with Balgo, which raises a lot of questions and confuses the viewer when they start throwing around terms that are explained in the one-shot... but not in the movie. You shouldn\'t have to do homework in order to understand the basic premise and world of your movie.Looking over this HUGE flaw, the story is... ok. Nothing special, for a prologue. It\'s meant to introduce you to the characters and establish the world and it does that fine enough, even if a bit clunky sometimes.Art: 8/10.It\'s Kubo. The man who achieved ""Big Three"" status on drawing cool shit alone. The character designs are great, which has always been his strong point, and the animation by Studio Colorido is fluid and pleasing to look at. There is a lot of flying around in this, as you\'d expect from a show about witches, and it\'s all pretty well done.Spells look a bit boring for the most part, with the exception being the spells cast by Bruno, which are very creative in how they\'re cast and look different enough from the rest, which are basically just light being shaped differently. Yeah it\'s all a bit samey but it\'s not what I\'d describe as bad, at all.Sound: 6/10.The voice acting is good, everyone fits their character and helps the movie sell you on who these people are. The background music was fine, if a bit unremarkable. The same could be said about the ending song, it did its job fine enough, but it\'s not like it\'s particularly memorable or something that I\'d add to my anisong playlist, for example.Character: 7/10.Kubo knows how to write likable characters, even if he doesn\'t really know what to do with them as the series goes on. He also knows how to write insufferable characters.Case in-point: Balgo. Balgo is by far the worst thing about this series. Comic-relief characters are hard to write, I know that, and if you\'re not careful enough, you end up with a character like Balgo, a complete useless tag-along whose only role in the movie is to ""be funny"". I did not find him funny, I found him incredibly irritating.Everyone else is good, for what little we\'ve seen of them. The two main characters are your typical energetic-apathetic dynamic, but what I like about them is that neither one of them is your typical hero(ine). They\'re both selfish, Noel is greedy and Ninny is ambitious to a fault, disregarding rules and even the safety of London citizens to prove herself worthy of a promotion. Their dynamic is nothing new but it was enough for me to want to see more of them.Other relevant characters include hot-headed, over-confident Bruno Bangnyfe, which is my favorite character thanks to a combination of great character design, cool powers and scene-stealing personality which is a Kubo classic; Macy Baljure, whose only real role in the prologue is to be cute and naive which I assume is to establish that she\'s going to be changing a lot throughout the series (whenever that decides to start); and Ninny and Noel\'s boss Billy Binx, Jr., a laid-back and lazy character who is pretty charming considering his small screen-time.The movie also introduces the Top of Horns, the rulers of the Wing Bind association, but their appearance is very brief, only serving to, again, assure the viewers that the story is only at its beginning.Honestly I would give it an 8/10 if Balgo wasn\'t so damn annoying.Enjoyment: 7/10.It\'s fun. That\'s all I can really say about this series so far, really. It did get me interested in seeing the rest of the story, which I guess was the purpose of the movie. It feels incomplete because well... it is. In a way this movie is just a big advertisement for Burn the Witch Season 2, whenever that decides to show its face on Weekly Shonen Jump.

I definitely hope, despite how unlikely it is, that this will be developed into a full fledged series, because the potential is amazing.The animation is smooth and super high quality, the choreography is amazing, and the visuals are just very pleasant and engaging.

It also bring a little bit of nostalgia, especially that characters gives you a 100% vibes of Tite Kubo drawing style and not gonna lie Bruno Bangnyfe give Grimmjow vibes unfortunately these characters...don't share the voice actor.Story:It's good, but too rushed, alot of people will disagree with my point of view, but let's be honest you don't need to know everythign about a world to enjoy the movie and that's what happens here, a short plot with introducing a little bit of the world, of the main characters and with few actions.Art:I really like the art style of Tite Kubo which is visible in this movie and I love that fact, also i want to point out something which some people like some doesn't it's the specific art of background which in my opinion is familiar to Owari no Seraph background art, for me it was great the whole Reverse London looked incredible.Sound:Well that's a too short movie to even notice anything, the sound effect during actions is quite good, there is only one soundtrack which I memorised from that movie which is the main theme of burn the witch and that's all what I can say about that, unfortunately I didn't like that much of voice acting for Bruno.Character:They are unique but not unique at the same time, the art style and their look like is something which will make you remember these characters but their personalities is something which you can definitely find in another titles and it makes you forget about the character, the example is that Noel for me is like a female version of Ishida from Bleach and as I said before Bruno is similar to Grimmjow, but to be honest I like very much his balaclava, clothing for mouth i don't know how to properly call it in english.Enjoyment:That's a short and good movie to watch in an evening, to eat some pop-corn, chips or some other snaccs and just chill out while watching it, without thinking about what's gonna happen, who is who, who will do what, who will survive, etc. Just a simple story for a chilling which I personally like.Overall : 8/10I really hope that burn the witch manga will have more opportunities for develop and will not have to be rushed like Bleach to give time for Kubo to make and procces this title for a better score, I hope that I will oneday be watching week by week episodes of Burn the Witch if that's gonna happen, I will be positive that it will happen, when?

With all these creatures and magic there had to be, as the title says, witches and...they are divided in different groups sorted by their tasks.Watching the prequel makes the story better since there is 1 character that looks a bit odd in the story but if you watched the prequel it should all make sense, anyway this anime made me so upset that i had to write my first review.It looks like someone took a perfect recipe and then chose to buy expired ingredients to make it. The story is very dynamic it starts right in the middle of some action losing little to no time explaining the backgroud of the world which is fine in this case, it makes everything really engaging and it allows the spectator to learn about the backstory in a less stagnant way.The main characters are fun and boring at the same time, you have Noel and Ninny that have very different personalities and they of course get on eachother nerves from time to time. Then you have Billy the chief of these 2 little witches, he\'s the typical character that looks like he\'s almost lost in his own world just to then realize he is smart and all and was just playing the part.At this point you get Balgo a character that has a flat personality he literally doesnt seem to be able to think like a normal human being, as dumb as a rock and cringe, his main goal in life is watching some ""pantsu"" same goes for his stupid dog that keeps repeating this deside of its owner.I just started watching this anime and i haven\'t read anything yet so i don\'t know where the story is going to go but the feeling that you get once Balgo gets on screeen is enough to turn your TV off even though everything else is amazing.This really looks like a missed opportunity, could have been such a cool anime and story but as far as i\'ve watched it doesn\'t seem to become anything above the usual anime that you\'d watch when you are bored but nothing more especially thanks to the fact that it looks like it\'s written for a 13yo with all this pantsu here and pantsu there. they are divided in different groups sorted by their tasks.Watching the prequel makes the story better since there is 1 character that looks a bit odd in the story but if you watched the prequel it should all make sense, anyway this anime made me so upset that i had to write my first review.It looks like someone took a perfect recipe and then chose to buy expired ingredients to make it.

It doesn't explain a huge amount about it's world (even burying the lead of what world it even is until the end), but trickles the details through well enough that I don't consider most of it confusing. There's perhaps a couple of details I'd have preferred them to be a bit more upfront about, like what the seemingly separate divisions of Wing Bind actually do, but those things don't get in the way too much. And many of the...other things that are left vaguer, such as just what a Dragonclad actually is, feel more deliberate than careless; after all, with more manga on the way, there's plenty of time to open the world up more.The characters don't get time to get deep development yet, but Ninny and Noel are an enjoyable enough pairing, with a decent energy around them, and the supporting cast in the status quo the ending establishes should be enough to build a story around going forward. The story of the film itself is a strong enough pilot. Certainly, it's not especially complex, but it throws in a couple of surprising enough beats, and does its job of introducing the world and characters perfectly adequately. The animation is strong, with a fun, slightly rough art style that I really like.Overall, a solid adaptation of the manga, and a promising start to something that will hopefully get a lot more time to flesh itself out. other things that are left vaguer, such as just what a Dragonclad actually is, feel more deliberate than careless; after all, with more manga on the way, there's plenty of time to open the world up more.The characters don't get time to get deep development yet, but Ninny and Noel are an enjoyable enough pairing, with a decent energy around them, and the supporting cast in the status quo the ending establishes should be enough to build a story around going forward.

I thought it was short and sweet with some likeable characters and an interesting world they set the anime in. Its a beautiful looking show, the characters all look interesting and unique, the setting of London and reverse London are both well imagined and really set a cool place for dragon chases and fights.Since there is so little of it I don't think there is much for me to dislike in it really, the one nitpick I would say is Balgo's subs voice is a little too whiny for my liking.They set up quite a few plot points...for future episodes so I hope they make more in the future. for future episodes so I hope they make more in the future."", ""Burn the Witch (2020)Whilst this was released as 3 episodes and not a movie and it would be a fairly short movie over the average I must say it was actually unexpectedly good.

It is a shame because the premise of the show is really interesting.The art although it can be a bit crude is perfectly good for...the show.

Unfortunately, things such as stellar animation, beautiful colours, interesting looking art style, and cool character designs can\'t carry the overall chaotic direction and extremely rushed, poorly written plot.""Burn the Witch"" offers a very nice and intriguing setting that serves as mere background to a story that\'s just half-baked. Half-baked, because how would one call a situation when viewers are supposed to care about anything and anyone, when all they learn throughout the show is that ""this place exists, this person exists as well""? Why do viewers have to learn...about presumably important and strong secondary characters, see them saying a phrase or two, and afterwards not hear anymore about most of them, or just see them being somewhere in the background and saying something cryptic that\'s also not elaborated upon later on? Many high schoolers would write a better scenario, even for such a short animated series. It\'s even worse if we consider that without knowing the prequel movie, which was released 3 years (!) after the reviewed series, the viewers will have a hard time figuring out what the heck is exactly happening in the story, why do some situations occur, and why do certain characters act like they do. Yup, ""Burn the Witch"" doesn\'t offer any introduction, not without watching the ""Burn the Witch #0.8"" prequel movie.Speaking about its length, there are three episodes, and each one is 20 minutes long. In theory, that would be alright to tell a cute story. That is, if the writing was at least on an acceptable level. Sadly, like I mentioned earlier, the writing was mediocre at best, but most of the time it was chaotic and messy. The direction was weird as well, as if the show couldn\'t find balance between more static and more dynamic scenes, but preferred to just mix them up and end up with a rather convoluted mess.Some might say that it was like this in the source material. Some might say that this show fits the ""Bleach"" universe in which it is set. I\'m neither familiar with the first nor the second thing, so as an anime only viewer, I can\'t relate to any of them. However, even if I had knowledge about one thing or another, I wouldn\'t treat it as something positive. If an anime is not labelled as a spin-off series, then it\'s not unwise to assume that one may enjoy the story without knowing the main series, no? Obviously, a shared universe is not the same as a shared story, after all. And at the end of the day, we\'re talking about an animated show that is loosely related to an already existing series. The fact that source material was worse or better, or that some elements might make more sense if someone is familiar with said existing series, shouldn\'t matter, in my opinion.I was torn between choosing ""Mixed Feelings"" or ""Negative"" as the final verdict for this review. I think the former will be more appropriate. I don\'t regret watching it myself. It didn\'t take a lot to watch the reviewed show and the aforementioned prequel movie, after all.

And man, did Kubo ever slapped me this hard since the early days of Bleach.Story (7.5/10):I'm only going for what I saw on...these three episodes, because had it been a tad longer and more things were explore, this would have been an easy 8 if not more. These three episodes felt like the Romance Dawn arc of One Piece, it's super short, it has the spirit, but does not tell everything, no, no way near half of everything. You feel like setting the stone into a grand world build on top of Bleach's, but which entirely new and more expressive lore that followed everything thing. This felt like if Ghibli Studio were to animate a series instead of a movie more than not.Art (9.2/10):Close to perfection. The art style is there, the color palette, also there, the animation is dynamic and fluid, and the cinematography and camera angles were not of an average Anime screening. This was the best any of Kubo Tite's animate characters looked, and I hope it's a ten that will follow with the 1000 years blood arc of Bleach, Inshallah.The characters felt really, really fresh and new, but also very familiar and nostalgic, I guess Kubo is one of the few Mangaka that persists his signature art even as he improves it. Also, more of a reminder that Kubo really did miss a promising future as a fashion designer because the clothing and customs here are a moo of their own.Sound (8.3/10):I did not notice anything out of place, audibly speaking, the voice acting was sharp and great, the emotions were delivered, the passive-aggressive commentary was there and hit the comedic effect they aimed at, such a shame that no opening song came with this, but the ending was a great pleasurable treat.The OSTs were good and felt organic and part of the scenes, however, not quite on Bleach's level, to say the least.Characters (8/10):Obviously, we saw no character development “that mattered” in these three episodes, but it's fine as the start of the story is yet to unfold.The cast however is very varying and alive, with different characters with different interactions and charisma, never a dull moment of a boring conversation.The main duo, Noelle and Nina was just the right nail to seal this story, both great in opposing ways, which keeps it interesting and fresh, with countless of Shounen that features males as the primary main characters, it's about time we saw things differently from a protagonistic female ^point of view.Enjoyment (10/10):Three episodes were never going to be enough for this great showing. I certainly I not feel like I was gonna enjoy this this much, but I'm glad I did.Overall (8.6/10):That I better than was anticipating. Kudos to Kubo sensei for this new work, and looking forward to featuring sequels.

Burn the Witch\'s premise is also interesting in which there are ""Reverse"" Worlds and in London, dragon roam, Pipers eliminate them all the while humans who come into...contact with them get executed, though there are humans form the ""Real World"" can go into the Reverse World and harbor dragons being ""Dragonclad"" and they are used to ""bait"" other dragons.The characters are also interesting, from the aggressively tsun Ninny Sprangcole voiced by Asami Tano a former singer turned Piper along with her partner the stoic teasing Noel Niihashi voiced by Yuina Yamada and the bumbling aloof idiot Balgo Parks voiced by Shinba Tsuchiya who\'s a dragonclad and has a MASSIVE crush towards Noel. The first three episodes mainly centres on Balgo for the first episode, while the last two centres on Ninny due to the other character of Macy Baljure voiced by Saori Hayami who used to be in same idol band Ninny was in and she somehow ended up in Reverse London. Though on this front, Noel seemed to be the most reactionary in the cast let laone we not knowing much about her besides her being Ninny\'s partner.Though to counteract this, Burn the Witch\'s world building was MASSIVELY interesting from how the structure of the Reverse London handles it\'s dragon problem to the higher ups, something Tite Kubo is adept at in writing. The world building all within the three episodes though giving us exposition but needed nonetheless, fleshed out Reverse London and it\'s workings all the same and made LA invested into it much more easily at that too.The animation done by Studio Colorido was done extremely well, with Tite\'s style pretty much shown through it\'s character designs off the bat to the good to great battles shown. Really not much else to say besides that the animation OOZES Tite\'s style and flair and Studio Colorido captured that brilliantly.The voice cast was also pretty good with some relatively new seiyuu\'s like Yuina Yamada to Shinba Tsuchiya to some veteran and somewhat rookie seiyuu\'s like Saori Hayami and Asami Tano in the voice cast, nonetheless the voice cast was REALLY good from Saori Hayami\'s quick changing cadence to Yuina\'s more stoic-ness reminding LA of Saori Oonishi. If LA had to pin LA\'s favoruite seiyuu in this cast..........Asami Tano, with Yuina Yamada as a close second. Nonetheless decent to almost great voice cast.LA sees massive potential in Burn the Witch and in this regard kinda makes LA want to return back into Bleach in this regard and yes Bleach and Burn the Witch does have connection which is shown near the end of the 3rd episode and to this regard, though Burn the Witch\'s characterization is lacking as well as the first episode\'s ""incident"" glossed over for plot and screentime reasons kinda rushing things, LA could see that being fleshed out from the teaser we got here.If anything if Burn The Witch manages to actually get a full series off this, LA will and would actually watch it as this teaser pretty much cemented that fact that it\'s something to dig into and having all the potential it can to be something HUGE if it can be, but we\'ll more or less see if Burn the Witch actually gets a full anime series in due time.The ""teaser movie"" has tons of potential, let\'s just hope for the best as this might be Tite Kubo\'s peak writing but for the teaser movie itself it shows promise and LA was decently invested in itand liked it more or less.Bleach but with Wtiches....and dragons. contact with them get executed, though there are humans form the ""Real World"" can go into the Reverse World and harbor dragons being ""Dragonclad"" and they are used to ""bait"" other dragons.The characters are also interesting, from the aggressively tsun Ninny Sprangcole voiced by Asami Tano a former singer turned Piper along with her partner the stoic teasing Noel Niihashi voiced by Yuina Yamada and the bumbling aloof idiot Balgo Parks voiced by Shinba Tsuchiya who\'s a dragonclad and has a MASSIVE crush towards Noel.

It’s great to me and part of the reason why that’s so is because of the nostalgia it Brings me. This is Kubo we’re talking about. Bleach is a classic. Naturally, I think most of the people who are gonna love the fuck out of this, such as myself, are those who love the fuck out of Bleach. How good the viewer thinks this movie is is partially reliant on the nostalgia levels of the watcher.Minus all that, it’s very fast paced and I can understand this to an...extent. It’s a movie. You wanna spend as little time world building and as much time focusing on that action and boy did I eat that shit up. It was great. The events leading up to the action may seem like an Olympics track race but personally, I’m fine with face paced anime. As long as I can understand the setting I don’t mind jumping right into things.All in all, it was hella fun to watch. Loved the characters. Loved the setting and loved the action extent.

It\'s just 60 pages or so, and it\'s totally worth it. While I wouldn\'t say it\'s required viewing/reading, the story WILL flow significantly better having read the chapter. After all, the ""movie"" adapts chapters 1 - 4 in the manga, and those all occur after the original one-shot. It helps to flesh out the characters with proper, longer introductions, including Balgo Parks, such as explaining how he obtained his ""abilities"" and Noel\'s relations with him. Now, finally,...all of that aside, what do I actually think of the ""movie""?It was great! Obviously it wasn\'t flawless, and it could\'ve used maybe another ""episode"" to flesh out the greater details (maybe adapt a little of the one-shot chapter, though that may take more than an entire ""episode""); however, in terms of adapting what they set out to adapt. they did a great job. The scenes in the manga were definitely enhanced with the music and beautiful animation. Many scenes were conveyed better to me in the animation than the manga, and the amazing dynamic ""camera angles"" really sold the fights. The voice acting is great, the story is quite decent (though the start may seem off-putting without having read the one-shot), and although it doesn\'t get quite enough time to flesh out the characters, they do have their own unique personalities (Osushi is the cutest thing ever, change my mind).Overall, I give Burn the Witch an 8/10.

For me that's not necessarily a bad thing, as I did enjoy most of what it had to offer.First of all I gotta say, this movie was way too short. A movie split into 3 anime length episodes was too little and is one of the biggest setbacks this film has.The story starts way to abruptly with minimal explanation and the overall story suffers because of this. There just isn't enough time to properly introduce the character's or pull you into the plot. While the story isn't anything too special, I...did find myself liking some of the character's even if they were pretty shallow.Now for the art, animation and sound I have very little complaints. The character design is well done, something Kubo Tite never seems to fail on. The animation was smooth and well done. I only noticed the 3D animation being slightly jarring once at the start, other than that I can't say I even noticed it being used much.Other then that, the art style is clean and I loved the color palette. The sound was really good and varied. I found myself liking a lot of the background music and the ending song was decent as well.All in all this series has good potential and I hope Kubo Tite is able make something great out of this. The movie did suffer quite a bit from being so short, but I'm excited to see where this goes. I have yet to check out the manga, but hopefully we get a full length anime season once it gets a bit further. did find myself liking some of the character's even if they were pretty shallow.Now for the art, animation and sound I have very little complaints.

However, a season 2 has been announced for the manga, and I\'m hoping that will get an anime adaptation eventually. Burn The Witch has an overflowing well of potential to tap into. It did a great job of setting up the world and characters and giving a reason to be invested in them. As a complete story on its own, it\'s definitely a bit lacking. I feel as though the time spent on...the EDs would have been better spent wrapping everything up. Each episode feels like it isn\'t entirely resolved, at least not on-screen. Instead, it\'s wrapped up at the beginning of the next episode, which is fine, but it\'s not entirely satisfying. I wanted to see more of the resolution. It\'s a bit jarring to cut from a high-intensity scene at the end to the next day where everything is fine and low-stakes again. Perhaps a more traditional movie length and structure would have benefited this series. Still though, what we *do* have is very enjoyable and absolutely gorgeous. The character designs are simple and clean yet dynamic and striking; they convey a great deal of character while not being overly complex. The simple and clean artstyle compliments the animation greatly, which is fluid, dynamic, and very creative.This is most certainly a \'spectacle\' anime. If nothing else, it is absolutely worth watching for the gorgeous animation and spectacular cinematography. I\'m not really well-versed enough in cinematography to explain why it\'s so good, but everything just flows together really well, and it feels very exciting to watch. The characters also have great chemistry and bounce off each other very well. Sometimes, the characterization can feel a bit off and out of nowhere, but overall, it\'s very strong. The main two girls especially have very strong personalities that are a joy to watch, especially together.Overall, while this may not be a masterpiece, I found it throughly enjoyable and would highly recommend it to anyone who might be considering watching it.

It has well-designed characters and an intriguing setting. However, it feels superficial. And with the short runtime the plot feels rushed and underdeveloped, with little room for character growth. Despite the promising premise and visually stunning art, it is difficult to recommend in its current form, as it lacks substantial content and ultimately feels incomplete. Burn the Witch holds much potential, and it remains to be seen whether it will ever be fully developed into a more fleshed-out series, making it an interesting prospect for the future.

Even if it lacks a complete plot, the anime has the potential to be an even more enjoyable journey.The anime\'s aesthetic department is unquestionably its most outstanding feature. The visuals alone are worth a watch, thanks to the appealing character designs, vibrant animation, and frequently spectacular camera movement during its action scenes.

It turns out that it was a movie originally only released in Japan as a one-hour film. Crunchyroll, however, had the strange idea to split the movie into three parts, which not only destroys the flow of the story but also creates a needless sense of anticipation for something great that, of course, never occurs. A significant event happens, but since there are only 3 episodes (or a 1-hour length), not much can be set up for an exciting climax. They had to cut out a chapter from the source material (that chapter 0 gives a backstory as to why Balgo needs special attention, aka why he\'s necessary to the plot).Even though the emotional plot it builds for its characters doesn\'t reach its utmost height, considering the timeframe, the creators did a respectable job of getting their message out loud and clear with two female protagonists carrying the show with their charm.

Crunchyroll, however, had the strange idea to split the movie into three parts, which not only destroys the flow of the story but also creates a needless sense of anticipation for something great that, of course, never occurs. A significant event happens, but since there are only 3 episodes (or a 1-hour length), not much can be set up for an exciting climax. They had to cut out a chapter from the source material (that chapter 0 gives a backstory as to why Balgo needs special attention, aka why he\'s necessary to the plot).Even though the emotional plot it builds for its characters doesn\'t reach its utmost height, considering the timeframe, the creators did a respectable job of getting their message out loud and clear with two female protagonists carrying the show with their charm. However, there are a few pointless kinks that can cause some people to avert their gaze.Who should watch this?Unless you\'re finding for something complete, I see no reason to not watch this ONA.If you are in a busy schedule but got an hour to spare or are just bored and want something entertaining but don\'t want to commit to a huge plot, this will be a fun little jaunt you would like to take.', ""*Spoiler warning!*Story/Plot 6/10 - The pace was pretty good for a 3 episode anime and the plot was fairly interesting, it was also cool the anime was set in the same universe as Bleach! But, that's about where all the good for the story and plot end. The anime was way too short and they left us with more questions than things we got answered. Personally, the plot was good in some aspects but overshadowed by the bad aspects.Art/Animation 8/10 - Animation was fluid. And the art was very beautiful, it was sort of a mix between anime movie animation, shojo style, and shonen style....I also really liked the color pallet!Sound 6/10 - Same as any other anime. The voice actors really fit the character's personalities. And, one of my favorite voice actors stared in the anime, so that's cool! (Saori Hayami)Characters/Personalities 7/10 - Noel, Ninny, and Macy's personalities are fine. I like each of their personalities in their own right, and I feel like there isn't that much I hate about them. But, Bruno and Balgo's personalities are other stories. Bruno is downright preppy, rude, and acts better than everyone, and Balgo's entire personality is messing things up, being a simp over Noel, and barely (Or not) being able to protect himself. But, there are more good personalities than bad, so I feel like this deserves an average score.Enjoyment/Overall 7/10 - It was good, I would recommend it to people that just want a short action-type anime.

It\'s as almost they were planning a season for the anime and then realized they only had a budget for three episodes.So the ""movie"" is three episodes of ~20 minutes or about an hour long. That\'s not a lot of time to make a complete and satisfactory story. There needs to be time to set up the plot, get some background and a foundation for the story, create characters and explain their quirks and relationships, etc...There just isn\'t enough time for that in an hour movie... Even...worse, it feels like the movie drops you right into episode 6 of a season (of 13 episodes). Two minutes of a backstory isn\'t enough to fully nurture a good story. Even worse it tries to get to the last episode of season if the span of time equal to three episodes... which is a bit too rushed. There isn\'t any real growth in the characters... and characters show up but they just don\'t have any major importance to the movie at all.That aside, what I watched... I enjoyed. It was a fun watch and I see potential for anime series that could work and I would be down to watch that if that were the case. There needs to be more time to explain things and not to have them throw everything to the viewers in just one hour. This could have worked as a movie.. but in the end it just turned out three episodes that were treated as a movie which just doesn\'t work out that well. Perhaps the creators didn\'t have a choice in that manner... which is a shame because I do see some positives in Burn the Witch. worse, it feels like the movie drops you right into episode 6 of a season (of 13 episodes).

What appealed to me when scouting for something, anything to watch, was the character designs, which are pleasant enough to look at even when they're not moving. I was pleased to see that, in motion, the characters are detailed and distinct enough, as well as plenty expressive enough for me to enjoy my time watching the show even if I had the sound turned off and...had no clue what was happening. I'm pretty confident you actually could watch these three episodes without any sound and interpret a general idea of what was happening anyways. That is the sign of a competently made animation is my opinion.Tite Kubo wrote the story as a one shot, and I think the concept is creative, the two central characters are at least entertaining to see interact with each other and the world around them. Ninny and Noel have distinct enough personalities and designs that fit well with Studio Colorido's interpretation of London. Kubo's character designs blend and move well with the environment thanks to the animation team's talent and, I assume, damn good budget, considering the only three episodes.The story felt to me somewhat interesting, but of course not really that impressive considering the length of the one shot. You have three episodes to decide if the characters are worth following, because really that's what drew me in and kept me watching, aside from the gratifying animation of course. If Kubo decides to expand on what he's created here, I insist he do so.

I really only have two criticisms and first would be that it needs more source material to work with. Many  characters come off as pretty flat, uninspired, and maybe even annoying in the case of Balgo. My second complaint would be one that even plagued Bleach.

I can just about handle people rating this a 7/10, which usually means ""above average"" or ""good"".In my opinion, Burn The Witch seems like a rushed-to-release OVA, rather than an actual movie....If we can even call it a movie, what with it being 3 episodes of 20 minutes.An hour is simply not enough time for any meaningful character development or plot development.The ""story"" follows 2 main characters and one recurring side character, all of whom are one-dimensional, bland, uninteresting and have zero quirks or traits that make them memorable.

The show has potential so I hope Tite Kubo doesn't throw the potential in the trash as he did with Bleach, which I dreaded watching."", 'So I came to this a bit later than most which led to me not realizing this anime/movie is part of the Bleach universe. No where on Crunchyroll\'s app did it inform me of this nor did it state as much in the beginning. The issue with this is that I have never watched Bleach and have no interest in doing so thus I have no context for the things happening or mentioned in Burn The Witch making it a very confusing a sometimes frustrating watch.Story: This is very difficult for me to rate. As someone who has not watched Bleach I would rate this...as a 1 because it felt like I was entering an anime part way through since they barely explained anything important. I\'m not sure what a fan of Bleach would rate this but I\'m assuming it would be significantly higher. We\'re introduced to concepts and characters as if we should have some additional information outside what the movie gives us -  it\'s frustrating to watch at times. Burn The Witch feels like the beginning of a longer anime, while at the same time feeling like an arc taking place part way through a longer anime. I can see them possibly making a season 2 after this but they failed with their first season in my opinion. The first season of an anime is supposed to be used to build the characters and world, and this movie did none of that. It gave us ""mysteries"" that we are supposed to care about for some reason, and they rush through an entire arc in an hour. It doesn\'t feel like a movie at all, and should have been longer so they could explain things better. Also a side annoyance: There\'s some really bad tonal whiplash when Macy and Balgo are involved in a scene.Art: The art is fine. Nothing special.Sound: Nothing amazing but I didn\'t hate any of the music or voice acting so it\'s whatever.Characters: I don\'t care about any of the characters in this anime. I feel no connection to them and they barely show any personality traits outside a single one. Noel is boring and generic. She\'s the typical serious half of a duo and  has no interesting personality traits. Ninny is the opposite of Noel. Shocker. She\'s like... famous I guess? She\'s part of a band I think but it doesn\'t really delve into that at all even though one of the main antagonists is linked to a former member of her band who also becomes a semi-important character toward the end. Speaking of, Macy is both sad and annoying. Her backstory and personality really shine through during the little screen time she has but holy crap is she the cause of some tonal whiplash. One moment she\'s pouring her heart out to Ninny, the next second it goes full comedy with her throwing shit at Noel. It\'s terribly paced and feels very out of place. Tonal whiplash from Macy is nothing compared to Balgo though. Balgo has no good qualities at all. He\'s stupid, ignorant, weak, pathetic, perverted, and happy-go-lucky. He never takes anything seriously in a ""I have no idea what\'s going on even though I\'m going to die"" kind of way that is not at all appealing. I don\'t mind flippant characters if they apathetic or cocky, but Balgo is neither of those. He\'s just really really stupid and situationally tone deaf. He has no redeeming qualities and the way Ninny treats him is the main reason Ninny is the best character in the anime. There\'s a handful of other characters but most are not important, and the few that are aren\'t very interesting or relevant. Besides Bruno probably. He\'s like the big bad for 5 minutes and then he joins forces with Ninny and Noel to take down Cinderella (who just so happened to be named Elly by Macy even though she had no idea she was actually Cinderella so... that was dumb). He\'s brash, egotistical, and cocky. He\'s fine I guess? Not a highlight though.Enjoyment: As a not fan of Bleach I didn\'t find this enjoyable at all. Some of the art design was neat, and the magic system seems interesting if strange (and not explained at all). Some interesting concepts that don\'t get any real screen time or explanations. It was only an hour so it wasn\'t worst, and I wouldn\'t call it boring so it was fine.Overall I\'m not sure if I would recommend this anime or not. It has some interesting concepts but is sometimes confusing and annoying. Not great.5/10 as a 1 because it felt like I was entering an anime part way through since they barely explained anything important. I\'m not sure what a fan of Bleach would rate this but I\'m assuming it would be significantly higher. We\'re introduced to concepts and characters as if we should have some additional information outside what the movie gives us -  it\'s frustrating to watch at times. Burn The Witch feels like the beginning of a longer anime, while at the same time feeling like an arc taking place part way through a longer anime. I can see them possibly making a season 2 after this but they failed with their first season in my opinion. The first season of an anime is supposed to be used to build the characters and world, and this movie did none of that. It gave us ""mysteries"" that we are supposed to care about for some reason, and they rush through an entire arc in an hour. It doesn\'t feel like a movie at all, and should have been longer so they could explain things better. Also a side annoyance: There\'s some really bad tonal whiplash when Macy and Balgo are involved in a scene.Art: The art is fine. Nothing special.Sound: Nothing amazing but I didn\'t hate any of the music or voice acting so it\'s whatever.Characters: I don\'t care about any of the characters in this anime. I feel no connection to them and they barely show any personality traits outside a single one. Noel is boring and generic. She\'s the typical serious half of a duo and  has no interesting personality traits. Ninny is the opposite of Noel. Shocker. She\'s like... famous I guess? She\'s part of a band I think but it doesn\'t really delve into that at all even though one of the main antagonists is linked to a former member of her band who also becomes a semi-important character toward the end. Speaking of, Macy is both sad and annoying. Her backstory and personality really shine through during the little screen time she has but holy crap is she the cause of some tonal whiplash. One moment she\'s pouring her heart out to Ninny, the next second it goes full comedy with her throwing shit at Noel. It\'s terribly paced and feels very out of place. Tonal whiplash from Macy is nothing compared to Balgo though. Balgo has no good qualities at all. He\'s stupid, ignorant, weak, pathetic, perverted, and happy-go-lucky. He never takes anything seriously in a ""I have no idea what\'s going on even though I\'m going to die"" kind of way that is not at all appealing. I don\'t mind flippant characters if they apathetic or cocky, but Balgo is neither of those. He\'s just really really stupid and situationally tone deaf. He has no redeeming qualities and the way Ninny treats him is the main reason Ninny is the best character in the anime.

Well, this isn't that. It was merely OK.The background work was great. But the character art felt flat to me. It looks like a lot of the current style of computer animation that for the sake of production speed, they sketch out the characters with minimalized details and then use a paint bucket tool to fill in the color. A stark contrast to the beautifully detailed background work.The sound work was nicely done, no complaints there and the music blended in beautifully as well.The problem is with the overall story. It...felt like taking a twenty-four episode series season and condense it down into a one hour show. You learned only some bare basics about a couple of the characters and the rest are just chum for the water. And that is a huge problem as we have two lead characters with Noel and Ninny, two secondary characters with Balgo and Macy, a tertiary character with Billy, and an antagonist with Bruno. But we only learned a little about Ninny and Macy. And we learn that dragons are apparently attracted to Balgo who is the comic relief really.Spoilers belowThe initial premise (other than defending against dragons), is that a group puts a hit order out on Balgo. So the girls have to attempt to keep him alive. Meanwhile, Ninny's friend is dragged to Reverse London because she has a pet dragon. So Macy is dragged into the fight between the girls and Bruno, as her dragon transforms into an all-powerful dragon and starts destroying Reverse London. And just as the fight is going to have to come to a climax, Balgo somehow transforms his horn into an almightly looking sword. So you think that Balgo may end up being the hero. Nope, an energy blast from far away from one-shots the dragon, and the show gradually draws to a close with a bunch of little end sequences. felt like taking a twenty-four episode series season and condense it down into a one hour show.

That's right, the creator of Bleach. The anime version was handled by Studio Colorido. Which I've never reviewed anything by. Let's have a look.Story:Our story centres around the idea that there are two Londons. The London we know and Reverse London, where dragons roam and need to be kept under strict control. Our heroines are two witches, Ninny and Noel. They help bring a rampaging dark dragon under control only to find themselves entangled in a plot that's all about bringing down one of their friends.Here's the...big problem with the narrative, there are a lot of things that aren't explained very well. The film throws out a lot of terms and concepts very quickly but never extrapolate on them all that well. For example, there are people who can come into contact with dragons but most can't and there's never a detailed explanation for why. It seems to be something to do with mana but the film never explains how mana works in its world. It's like Kubo wanted to set up a long series to follow up after Bleach, but he never got past the planning phase.This is also supposed to take place in the Bleach universe, but none of the abilities or creatures seem to operate anything like the fantasy creatures or abilities in Bleach. Which is weird. There's just no coherent reason for this and Bleach to be connected. The film also suffers a bit from a rushed climax with the big battle sequence ending with a disappointing anti-climax.To its credit, this film is full of interesting ideas that have a lot of potential. I could see this as a really good twenty six or more episode series with proper pacing and fleshed out concepts. The problem is it's an hour long film. I will also say, to its credit, it was fairly compelling throughout.Characters:My big problem with the characters was that I hated Balgo. He's one of those characters who comes across as a complete moron but he's supposed to be likeable because he's a friendly and inoffensive moron. I just really found him insipid.I do think that both Ninny and Noel are pretty interesting characters and I could see them becoming really complex given more time. But for the length, I don't think they could have been done much better. With most of the side characters you get the sense that Kubo has ideas for them but they don't really go anywhere and the characters themselves end up being a little lacklustre.Art:The artwork does look pretty good. I especially love the big dragon they face for the climax. The action is also interesting to see. There's a definite unique aesthetic to the way characters use magic in this and I'm kind of into it.Sound:The acting is pretty well done. Yamada Yuina, Tano Asami & Hayami Saori all perform strongly and there's not really anyone who does badly. Even the performances that aren't as good are still competent. The music is fine.Ho-yay:There's a little bit. The character Macy openly has a crush on Ninny.Areas of Improvement:1. Extrapolate on how your world works. This film is full of potential that never quite gets reached and ideas that never get fleshed out properly. It would work so much better with a little time taken to flesh it out.2. There's no reason for this and Bleach to take place in the same universe. Connecting these two is both unnecessary and doesn't make much sense. There's this sense of disconnect between the works and telling us that our heroines work in Reverse London's Soul Society just isn't an adequate connection.3. Have a more satisfying conclusion. It's a bit disappointing that the big climactic battle just ends abruptly and far too easily. It makes the whole thing just feel unfinished.Final Thoughts:This is one of those works where there's clearly a lot of potential and some strong elements, but the potential is never fully realised and the strong elements are met with a lot of weaker aspects. Ultimately, I do think this is better than mediocre but not by a large margin. So, I'm giving it a 6/10. big problem with the narrative, there are a lot of things that aren't explained very well.

Despite its slick animation and memorable designs, as we’ve come to expect from Bleach creator Kubo Tite, this fiery fantasy unfortunately underwhelms.This could be symptomatic of the adaptation dropping so early into the manga’s run, but there was just too little character development and world-building for a setting that could have otherwise been great. Between ‘Dragonclads’, ‘Watchers’, and ‘Märchen’, there’s simply too much lore and not enough time to flesh anything out.I don’t always mind comedic subversions of dramatic moments, but this happens every single time something impactive...arises, making it difficult to connect with the text. The characters, as cool as they look, are the tropiest tropes to ever trope. The clearest motivation and arc can be found in the black and blue-haired support who appears in part two, while the mains are just archetypal tsundere and kuudere, respectively.Burn the Witch felt more like a pilot episode than a feature, so if they come out with more, I’ll check it out, as I do think the overall story has potential. In the meantime, if you’re after a fantasy anime featuring dragons, I’d recommend Ancient Magus Bride instead. arises, making it difficult to connect with the text.

In the meantime, if you’re after a fantasy anime featuring dragons, I’d recommend Ancient Magus Bride instead.', 'Most of us are here for one reason, we heard that Burn The Witch was written by the author of Bleach, it peaked our interest and so we gave it a chance. But what a disappoint it was.Burn The Witch is a ""movie"" in a 3 episode format, except they\'re not even full-length episodes. Each episode is only about 18 minutes long after you take out the screen time used for the ending. This means that Burn The Witch is a ""movie"" that isn\'t even an hour long. Movies are already hard pressed for time when it comes to building an exposition, building up for...a climax, and then an ending that wraps up everything nicely. Burn The Witch did none of this nicely.Art: 6Nothing is really wrong with the art and animation. I actually fairly enjoy the art style and have no issues with it. The reason I\'m giving it a 6 however is because this is supposed to be a ""MOVIE"". However the art and animation just feels like a standard anime. There are many anime that look much better than it.Sound: 5Not much to say here. None of the songs really stuck out to me or really caught my attention. There was no song that made me go ""I want to listen to this again in my free time.""Story: 6The format for the three episodes are as follows:Episode 1 - Introduction to Characters & WorldEpisode 2 - Minor Backstory and Buildup to ClimaxEpisode 3 - Climax and Conclusion.I will admit the first episode I think was very well done. It introduced the characters we would be seeing the most of us, it gave us a nice introduction to the setting and how the rules are in Reverse London when it comes to dragons. It even gave us a nice and entertaining fight with a dragon to show off what our main characters Noel and Nina can do.Episode 2 felt really rushed. I didn\'t really care much for Mary or the way she was introduced. It all felt sort of half ass done. This is where the 18 minute screen time really comes into play (I think. I haven\'t read the manga so I\'m not sure how religious it is the source material). It really hurt because not much time was allowed for proper build up.While I did enjoy episode 3 I also have some big complaints. They go on to fight this ""legendary"" dragon and they even go into some dialouge where they name all the legendary dragons BUT NONE OF THAT MATTERS BECAUSE AFTER THEY BEAT THIS ONE DRAGON THE SERIES JUST ENDS. The last few minutes also didn\'t really feel like much of a proper ending as well, it more so just felt like a normal ending for a normal episode that would be continued later on. It literally just feels like I watched the first 3 episodes of a 12 or 25 episode anime. Why waste time naming all these legendary dragons when none of that will be explored, why give me an ending that doesn\'t feel like a movie ending and more so just feels like there should be an episode 4?This adaptation is literally based off of only the first 4 chapters of the Burn The Witch Manga. There is no chapter 5... yet. At the end of chapter 4 it says ""Season 2 Coming Soon."" I wish they would\'ve just not adapted this until they had enough content for a full series.

If you've read any the reviews here you'll know that guys are pleased and are giving it a high score with the expectation that the manga will swoop in, sell big, explain things and more episodes will come our way.Woe unto thee who thinks the manga is going to solve any issues you may have had the show. Let me just list a few...down.- The stoic stand in for Byakuya, who actually has an emotional side- The tsundere stand in for Renji,- The easy-going old-man that is far stronger than anyone else ever thought.- The references to past events that won't be covered- The references to a league of people or creatures who have some sort of power level stratification- Unexplained objects that do nothing but will somehow save the day- and many many moreThese are just some of the issues covered by SuperEyepatchWolf who has a great video addressing some of the issues he had with Bleach and the realization that that ugly head is rearing itself again just makes me depressed.Unfortunately, just try to think about what happens in the community when someone hasn't watched or played or read something from this split story. Stratification is what happens. There will be people who know the full story and those who don't. People will gate-keep. Some people will become outsiders.This at-least is my explanation why other reviews here start will full-fledged anime fans apologizing for not having read Bleach.

If I said the horny one, the cold one, the crazy one,...the greedy/ambitious one and the ambitious one without any morals, anybody who has seen the show will know who I\'m talking about.

I hope to write it somewhat well!I did like this movie. It wasn’t mind-blowing to me, but I do find the concept of it pretty fun. The movie is set in two versions of London: Front London (the London that appears in our world) and Reverse London (the London full of magic, witches, and dragons). The world of “Burn the Witch” gives me many Harry Potter vibes, which I am not at all opposed to seeing. The whole movie sort of feels like a nod towards that franchise. However, it doesn’t appear to be as fleshed...out as Harry Potter. There is still a lot left to the imagination on how magic in this universe works, what the different organizations in the world of Reverse London are, and how it interacts with Front London. It's not even clear on who the villains are. Are they the dragons themselves, or are they the shady council people trying to capture Balgo? Who’s to say?! But perhaps that’s the point of the movie-it’s meant to throw you, the viewer, into this fantastical world of dark dragons and spunky witches. You’re meant to experience the world on a joyride, not analyze it.Story: The story was fine. Not something that blew me away, but it also didn’t bore me half to death. As I stated above, there are still plenty of questions about how the world of this movie works that are left unanswered. That’s a bit frustrating, but again maybe that was international. The story itself is also quite fast-paced. It’s as if the movie cobbled together three episodes from the middle of an anime and tried to condense it into an hour-long window. It’s not so fast-paced that the viewer is confused about what is happening, but it still leaves a lot to be desired.The story's main conflict appears to be whether or not Dragon Clads should be protected or killed. That’s all fine and good conflict...but as the movie progresses, it appears the problem is less with the Dragon Clads and more with the dragons themselves? The Dragon Clads are sort of just...there. Attracting dragons, I guess, but the movie never really goes into a lot of depth on just how dangerous a Dragon Clad could be...especially since Balgo and Macy aren’t dangerous characters. You could call Macy unhinged, but she doesn’t have malicious intent.Burn the Witch’s story isn’t all bad, though. I like all of the references to fairy tales and seeing how Ninny thinks they’re all a load of bull. Although the movie never really goes into detail about why Ninny thinks this way either. The fights scenes and learning about the lore of the dragons and world itself are quite fun.That sentence could sum up the story, I suppose. Fun, but it doesn’t appear that the movie will go into more depth than that.Rating: 3/5Characters: The characters were ok. Not much to write home about. We have Ninny, who lives a dual life as a celebrity in Front London and a witch in Reverse London. She hates fairy tales, is spunky, wants recognition for defeating dragons...and that’s her character. The majority of characters are fairly surface-level without going into a lot of depth about them. Noel is the quiet side-kick, Balgo is the goofy but lovable Dragon Clad, Bangnyfe is the cool but intense wizard who wants to kill Balgo for his own gain, and Macy is a girl who’s in love with Ninny and is clueless in a magical world.I blame the movie's running time for not giving the audience a chance to get to know the characters more. Maybe they appear surface-level now, but a proper series could expand on their potential for being great and memorable characters.The character designs aren’t too bad, though. In fact, they’re quite good! Bangnyfe looks the coolest out of everyone, in my personal opinion, haha.Rating: 2/5Animation: The animation was really, really good! Probably the best part of the whole movie, if I’m quite honest. It was fluid and vivid, and the action scenes flowed splendidly. There wasn’t anything done that was too experimental. It was just a good shonen animation. There was some CGI animation that was implemented too. I always get nervous seeing CGI animation in anime, but this honestly didn’t bother me much. In fact, it was well-executed for once! If there were animation mistakes or awkward stills, I didn’t really see them myself.Rating: 4/5Voice Acting: Again, also very good. All of the voice actors conveyed their character’s personalities well and were all pleasant to listen to. I absolutely adored Balgo’s VA. He did such a good job striking a balance between “awkward” and “adorable” in his performance. It’s such a shame that Balgo’s character writing was just so...well, bad.Rating: 5/5Music: I’m a bit reluctant to write about music since I don’t tend to pay attention to it much. Unless it’s something really unique, but the music for Burn the Witch was fine-nothing particularly stood out, but it did do its job carrying the scenes along.Rating: 2/5Closing Thoughts: While there are still many questions left unanswered about the movie's world, I would recommend giving this a watch. In my personal opinion, I would like to see this fleshed out a bit more as a regular anime series than as a movie. If there ever will be a show, I’ll keep my eyes peeled for that. But for now, check this out if you’re interested and scratch that itch for Harry Potter in an anime world.Final Rating: 6/10 out as Harry Potter.

I enjoyed the animation and character designs; the story was alright however there was simply not enough time to connect to the characters or explore any of the world that the story takes part in overall this show suffers from rushing the story a lot if this was a 12 episode show or even 6 episode show it would become much more enjoyable.I hope Crunchyroll decides to remake or continue this serie, this anime may not have a unique or groundbreaking story but it still has an interesting enough characters...and settings.

In reality I don't even think the anime deserves a 6, the only reason I gave that score is the animation and the sound design.Its way to short even for an actual movie, without the ending credits I don't even think the whole run time would reach the hour mark. Now don't get me wrong, if this was a full fledged 12-ep anime, it would be way way higher but as a 3ep 'movie' it just doesn't work.I think its an amazing anime with just a very short...story (the manga is this short too). story (the manga is this short too)."", ""Burn the Witch felt woefully incomplete, like the concept exists on its own and little effort was put in to ensure it became a polished end product. To begin with the story, there really isn't much of one to speak of, though it gives the distinct impression that there is a lot more the viewer doesn't get to see. One can only do so much with a scant 3 episodes, but even then the story felt terse, shallow, and generally uninspired. Which is a shame because the world that the story takes place in is unique, characteristic, and has a lot of potential. The art,...meanwhile, is this anime's strongest point, hands-down. The art style impacts every level of this anime's visual language, from the detailed and striking backgrounds, to the fun and well-constructed character designs, and even down to the sheer fluidity with which they move through their world by way of very high-quality animation. The only artistic decision I take issue with is in the design of the 'witch gear' gun things used by our main two characters, Ninny and Noel. They don't don't really fit the rest of their aesthetic, and seem almost jarringly silly as a result. The sound was a very mixed bag. One the one hand The sounds of life, like shattering glass and explosions, are very good, and the music has the ability to be pretty impactful at certain moments. However, to begin my problems with the sound, I watched the English dub because this anime is supposed to take place in the UK, and I thought I'd immerse myself. What a mistake, as the dub is garbage, and features some really questionable translations. The voice actors, while I can tell have some talent on their own, aren't being utilized correctly here, and everybody's delivery is so stiff and unconvincing that I was unable to immerse myself at all, in fact. Also, the music, while fine half the time, lapses into this weird techno bass guitar fusion thing the other half of the time, and it just doesn't fit. That's it, it's a bad musical decision. The characters, thankfully, are pretty good, and the audience is presented with a cast of colorful, visually appealing, and easily memorable characters that each fill their own niche well and interact in vibrant and believable ways. In many ways, the characters pull the weight that the story should be pulling. Overall, Burn the Witch is a beautiful bite-sized adventure that, while not the worst thing I've ever seen, left me feeling grateful there were only 3 episodes. meanwhile, is this anime's strongest point, hands-down.

Keep in mind, this may contain spoilers.I personally didn’t expect this to be a so-called ‘movie’ with 3 episodes. Let’s begin on how this ‘movie’ is presented. First episode, without a doubt, must give a big impression to the viewers, in this case Burn the Witch actually does. It starts with Ninny helping her friend Noel on doing contracts(?) and developed from that. Moreover, the first episode packs quite the action with cool scenes and effects which I find very pleasant to watch. However, the second episode was probably...the point where it just collapsed.I don’t want to get into details on each episode so I will only discuss the (really) main plot. Balgo, a normal human being marked as a dragonclad, was to be executed for having contact with a dragon.Why is this like this you ask? Well I really don’t know why since the 'movie' didn’t give any proper context in the first place.  I can’t really tell why the 'movie' didn’t give context but it just keeps on adding new things without really explaining it properly. It’s like there are 2 things happening at once, and then another 2 followed on, and so on. However, in these action packed episodes, it made me feel that there is much more that’s going to happen, and I personally was really looking into it. Guess what, the producers slapped my cheeks so hard and said ‘no more episodes and explanations for you, here take the somewhat good animation quality and stay quiet!’The characters were fairly interesting by itself. We have Ninny, a tsundere-styled girl; Noel, an expressionless friend of Ninny; and Balgo, the ignorant guy that’s going to be important to the story. I described these characters with only a few words because mainly the studio didn’t give any background to them, or show who they truly are and what they’re capable of. It really made me feel like the characters aren’t important to the whole series.As for the visuals and audio, it is pleasing for me. Like I said, the art was pretty nice with a nice touch of style to it. The voice acting was fine, nothing really special about it, and the soundtracks were able to fit in well with the 'movie'.To sum up, Burn the Witch was a disaster when it comes to the pacing and plot. However if you’re looking for some short movie and just want to clear your mind without using too much brain power, this ‘movie’ is probably not the one you want to go with since it may leave you disappointed in the end. the point where it just collapsed.I don’t want to get into details on each episode so I will only discuss the (really) main plot.

It's a broken and incomplete narrative over its surprisingly short run time. It somehow has too many exposition and lore dumps, while also leaving the viewer confused as to what is happening at any given time. Each subsequent scene is a disparate mashup of half baked ideas at best, and incomprehensible nonsense at worst. Many characters are introduced and suddenly whisked away, never to be seen again. And the handful of characters that do stick around are bland and grating. However despite this, something about it all continues to stick in my mind....The animation during fight scenes is stunning, and the visual effects for the magic system are some of the best in the industry. The character designs of the two protagonists are top-notch, and even a few background characters are visually striking. The show hints at a greater and more interesting world (and it wasn't until the ending that I realized this was a Bleach spin-off). While the show doesn't give time to care about the characters, they're still quite enjoyable. Truly the protagonists stand out as being the most interesting characters worth paying any attention to.For this series, every great decision is preceded by two mediocre decisions and a bad one. With all this, I can't quite pinpoint what it is about the show that keeps me coming back. Throughout the day I find myself trying to piece it all together despite knowing it's an incomplete and defective puzzle. It's truly a mess of a show, but there's some potential there under all the rubble. If a sequel is ever released, I will definitely watch it, either for closure and clarity, or to see it all crumble. I truly hope it's the former. The animation during fight scenes is stunning, and the visual effects for the magic system are some of the best in the industry.

I felt like I was part way into an anime, and had no idea what I was watching was a movie.I\'m not sure if they have plans to make more of this, I know there\'s an on-going manga being published, but seeing a 3-part episodic Movie had me tilting my head: Was this it? Why did it feel like they set up 2 vast worlds for us, and then delivered... Basically nothing but bits and pieces of story.Story: 7/10Solid 7 at that, because while it\'s fun, unique, creative,...and leaves open a world of exploration and inventive creative ideas... At the end of the day, what we got was. 2 worlds, hundreds of questions, and no answers in sight for most of them.

I\'m split on that at the moment.TL;DR wow, it was enjoyable to watch this art style.Sound: 6/10I\'m very harsh on sound tracks, and audio. If you have a lot to work with, a good studio backing, or scenes that have potential to blow up with the right tracks, and effects, I\'m going to hold it against your show if it fails to deliver. At no point did I ever go ""wait what is this track called? Wow I need to check this artist out to follow more of their work"" It failed to stand out.

There was some fun chemistry, but that\'s where the line mostly stops. You have no background for these characters, you\'re given the most shallow information on people that we\'re made to watch over an hour of.

Did you just show me an array of characters and do jack with all?Overall a solid 6.5/10 for this one. I summarized all I\'d like to say in my points above for those looking for a serious TL;DR: Wasted potential, no character presence, just chemistry.

You have no background for these characters, you\'re given the most shallow information on people that we\'re made to watch over an hour of. What\'s worse is they dangle small tid bits of information in front of you face, where you expect them to come out and elaborate on. Like my qualms with most shows in this filed... Potential wasted.Enjoyment: 6.5/10I enjoyed it almost 60% of the way through, and then the other 40% I was left sitting around wondering... And?! ... Please give me something more... Did you just show me an array of characters and do jack with all?Overall a solid 6.5/10 for this one. I summarized all I\'d like to say in my points above for those looking for a serious TL;DR: Wasted potential, no character presence, just chemistry. The story was lacking even though I had such high hopes. The artwork is it\'s biggest saving grace in my personal opinion, and ... That\'s about it.', ""I don't have all that much to say. I didn't expect much of a story considering it was never Kubo's strong suit in Bleach. However, it seems either Kubo himself was trying to overcompensate for that in this project, or there was no direction in the studio's adaptation (I have not read the source material mind you)Kubo's art and the animation steals the show, no question about it. There are some fun moments here and there, hell I caught myself chuckling once or twice. And the world that is built doesn't seem too original, but distinct enough to intrigue me nonetheless. Otherwise there isn't much...to say to praise it.I hope that there is more to come as I do think that if there is more time for the story to come into its own, it can be something good. However for now I find this to be anime junk food. A quick watch that catches the eye, but nothing substantial for it to be remembered as it is. to say to praise it.I hope that there is more to come as I do think that if there is more time for the story to come into its own, it can be something good.

Not the first three episodes of a season?As a movie this is probably one of the most terrible things I\'ve seen. You don\'t split a movie in 3 parts with different ending songs inbetween, and should certainly end in a way that suggests that the anime is not going to go on for another 10-20 episodes. I\'m giving it a 5/10 just because it should be a 6/10 average anime of the season, it\'s just that it completely fails to be a movie. Should honestly give it a 2-3/10 because it\'s simply not a movie....It\'d be like saying a 5min Youtube video is a manga, and then you rate it. Like no, that\'s not a manga.2 decent enough MCs, interesting setting, fair OST (I dig the ending though), but this should\'ve been a 12 episode show. Not a 3 episode ""movie"". I\'d watch it for the fun of it, but I\'m kind of tilted they aren\'t showing any more lol. It\'d be like saying a 5min Youtube video is a manga, and then you rate it.

It’s supposed to be some sort of spin off that takes place in the same setting as Bleach but it has absolutely nothing in common with it.I didn’t make a review of Bleach because there is no point in doing that, since everyone and their mothers already talked about it both positively and negatively, but I will make comparisons between the two.First thing to notice is how it takes place in...a different country, nothing wrong in that, and it goes for a urban/contemporary fantasy and magic realism type of story, meaning the normal people is more or less aware of everything that happens (in one side), unlike in Bleach where neither the Hollows nor the Shinigami could be seen by people with weak spiritual energy…at first, something that changed completely later on.This would be pretty interesting if said normal people would get a role in the story but as of yet they don’t do nothing of importance, heck, they are not even allowed to interact with the monsters, which here are presented in different form than they had in Bleach, as dragons. Another thing where is weaker than Bleach is having a much lighthearted tone.Although Bleach has lots of silly comedic moments from beginning to end, the first episodes have a creepy atmosphere with a haunting soundtrack at times, something which was completely lost here.For something positive, the Soul Society here works completely different, it no longer follows a military logic with clear borders that separates the japanese elite from the poor and miserable foreigners (cough) but instead works as some kind of company where the Soul Reapers are some kind of employees that hunts the hollows in pairs for credits.Believe or not, this is a good thing, in Bleach, the Reapers sent on a mission could be a single soldier or both the captain and lieutenant of a squad which was kind of sily if you think about it. Why would you send a single person on a mission, or why would you do that with the two biggest authorities of a squad, leaving it behind without leadership and boy was the Gotei 13 lucky that they never received an attack at the same time. Also, I never understood why the captains have only one lieutenant and only one squad under their supervision. And the ranks were complete bullshit, with stronger people serving under weaker people at times. None of that nonsense is present here, as everyone has the chance to get a higher rank just by working a lot.Also, the Gotei 13 is presented much sooner and they already began moving in order to capture some sort of legendary weapons/creatures which are seemingly going to be important later on. What I didn’t like is how the place feels like a school, is there really a need to have a school in everything, especially if it involves magic?Anyways, the premise is more or less the same as in Bleach only less interesting because of the lack of a creepy atmosphere as I already said but also because the characters here are complete shit. The black haired girl is the only one who is completely serious about what she does and does not take bullshit from anyone, but she’s also so serious she’s just boring to watch. The blonde one is just Hiyori from the Vizards in steroids and man is she annoying.And still not as much as the guy, he’s so stupid, he ruins any attempt at seriousness. And there’s also a yandere type of antagonist who has a crush on the blonde girl and just like with the guy, I was expecting for the moment both of them die on screen, which obviously didn’t happen because they are going to be main characters later on.Another problem in the show is how the spells are totally boring, they are just light beams of different colors and that’s it, nothing like in Bleach where they had all sorts of shapes and functions and I need to point out how the characters keep pulling powers out of nowhere, in fact that is how the anime ends, leaving any sort of closure completely open for it is just a prologue which exists only to promote the manga.That is another issue it has, it’s too short and silly to make anything feel important, and on top of that, since it clearly wanted to promote the manga, it skipped the pilot chapter which shows how the main characters get together and are connected, none of that is present here, which could have worked as a bit of their backgrounds.It also feels uninspired, with the dragons flying around it just feels like you are watching something made by Hiro Mashima, and the two sides from the same city, which seem to work as some sort of parallel dimensions connected to each other (I’m only guessing, it’s never explained), is basically taken from Harry Potter, with the only difference being that the “muggles” know what happens here and can move from one side to another under certain circumstances.I like how the legendary weapons/creatures are based on classic fairy tales, I’ll give it that, but even then it’s nothing I hadn’t seen done already in Read or Die, in a much more creative and fun way.Ultimately, what everyone who watched this really cared for was the action and the visuals, and I have to admit that they are not bad, but when they are praised beyond the point they deserve, I have to point out how neither of these elements are that great either.By comparison, in the same season, Majo no Tabitabi and Akudama Drive came out and Burn the Witch just pails before them. And in the same year we got the likes of Tower of God, Deca-Dence and Fog Hill of Five Elements, all of which are also far better and more spectacular than this show in these aspects.Another thing that was praised about it are the character designs and I don’t understand why, Kubo knows how to draw his stuff but he also tends to repeat the faces of his characters a lot, in Burn the Witch, the black haired girl is basically a mix between Orihime and Bambietta from Bleach and as I said the blonde is an aged up Hiyori. The same thing can be said about every other character, they resemble the characters from Bleach a lot and the artwork lacking in details does not help them either. There is a character with a somewhat original design, but he has the same problem as Mirio from My Hero Academia, he resembles a famous character (Luigi) a lot and the chances of liking his design are gonna be divisive because of that.The special effects are not bad but for a show where they throw magic left and right, they could and arguably should be better, the best things in the visuals are the backgrounds, the city looks really good. The motions are fine but nothing really surprising, again I feel like they could have been better and at times they felt kinda sloppy. They feel consistently fluent and fast paced but it’s mostly because of the camera work, which follows every movement the girls make with and without their brooms. And as I said, Majo no Tabitabi did it better.I have nothing to say about the sound, the sound effects lack impact, the voice acting is one of the same you can hear everywhere, the music is alright but nothing really memorable.And that’s it, there isn’t really much else to comment about it, it’s short, it’s just a prologue, it’s mostly silly and nonsensical, poorly written, it has trashy characters, it feels disjoined from the series it’s supposed to be related to, it feels derivative in some elements, everything it does has been done before (for better or worse) and it’s not amazingly animated, it also had the bad luck of airing in 2020, the anti hype year, and thus it didn’t caused as much impact as expected, but I guess it served to remind the audience that Bleach will get a sequel soon, let’s see if this one still retains its audience and manages to sell once that adaptation of a somewhat hated arc is over. a different country, nothing wrong in that, and it goes for a urban/contemporary fantasy and magic realism type of story, meaning the normal people is more or less aware of everything that happens (in one side), unlike in Bleach where neither the Hollows nor the Shinigami could be seen by people with weak spiritual energy…at first, something that changed completely later on.This would be pretty interesting if said normal people would get a role in the story but as of yet they don’t do nothing of importance, heck, they are not even allowed to interact with the monsters, which here are presented in different form than they had in Bleach, as dragons.

Wait for more. I watched three episodes and was surprised to find that I had seen... a movie, apparently.Right now, while Burn the Witch is quite aesthetically appealing, it is a merchandising story so caught up in placing all the bells and whistles that it fails to be believable or likable.It contains the usual forms: girls with 'personality', throwaway cute characters, stereotype sandwiches, a quelle-meaningful MC catchphrase, thighs, and more thighs. The setting does raises interesting questions - what are dragons?, what is this new society? how does this magic work? - but it's neither well explained...nor believable. In three episodes, half the city of London perishes under flames and explosions. That raises some follow-up questions: how is this city still standing? Why do people live here?The characters are also enjoyably frustrating. There is Ninny, our lovely MC, whose response to 'you destroyed half the city and killed thousands!' is 'where's my money!?', Balgo, the village idiot, stereotype gangster 1, stereotype cop 32, quirky anime council members 49-117, et cetera. The only persona who doesn't come with perennial facepalms is Noel; probably because her motives and personality are nil.Burn the Witch failed to be likable.

We're thrown into the middle of the story with zero emotional connection to the protagonists, no connection to the world, and no connection to the lore itself.As shown above, we know nothing about the world we're watching, and (SPOILERS EPISODE 1)...I don't see how I'm supposed to care about the leaders of the organization deciding to kill the possessed human.So, I think if this were an anime with 12-24 episodes, it could be really amazing.

It consists of 3 poorly-linked Anime episodes of 20ish minutes (standard, if you will).Story - 3There\'s barely any introduction to the MCs (only a little bit of backstory that\'s mostly left out to the viewers\' interpretation rather than being expanded on or explained). There isn\'t much to the story honestly, besides meaningless encounters and fight scenes that escalate too quickly and weirdly to be taken seriously. Trying to fit all of it in 3 20-minutes episodes was probably a mistake, since the many roughly...touched-on parts of the story couldn\'t be explained or further explored and developed. To the viewer, it\'s like the story is simply filled with holes and appears to make no sense (at least to me, that\'s what it felt like). Also, the transitions between the 3 episodes don\'t make sense at all to me. That\'s probably the main reason it didn\'t feel like a movie when watching them back to back.Art - 6The Art itself isn\'t that bad, but it really isn\'t movie quality (if you compare it to popular and well-ranked movies like Your Name, Weathering with You and such). It\'s also not a complete and utter dreadful experience for the viewer since there\'s a consistency - the characters, the environments, the colors used, etc. are always the same and keep the flow steady and natural for the viewer.Sound - 6I found that one of the supporting characters was truly bugging me and part of it was because of its voice. I simply found it annoying and it sort of ruined the experience for me. Everytime that character was involved in a situation and talked, I\'d just roll my eyes in exasperation (yes, it was that bad for me). Otherwise, the music and sound effects were okay, nothing worthy of mention or anything very powerful or too emotional. Just plain decent and basic sounds/music that help the viewer understand what\'s happening.Characters - 3As I said in the Story part, there\'s barely any introduction to the MCs. Whilst watching, I felt like they had no depth since there wasn\'t any backstory shown or explained. There were little pieces of information left here and there, stuff that the viewer could deduce or interpret their way, but no real background story or anything of the sort. This resulted in pretty bland/generic and boring/annoying characters. I couldn\'t care less if any of them were to get into a relationship, lose something valuable or whatever. I couldn\'t find anything to relate to or get attached to. They felt empty to me, void of any substance.Enjoyment - 2Pretty dull. I didn\'t really enjoy watching this ""movie"". It kinda felt like a chore to me, just to add it to my Completed Animes list. After seeing it advertised and looking up this Anime, I had high expectations but sadly, they weren\'t met at all. Most of the action was pointless and provided no character development, if any at all. The show brought up so many unanswered questions in my mind (and didn\'t answer them) that I didn\'t understand the point of watching it. Nothing joyful happened, nothing saddening nor heartbreaking happened, it\'s just the same-old bland and boring meaningless story of stuff happening to the MCs for absolutely no reason other than to make something happen to fill the 60ish total minutes of the show (""movie"").Overall - 4Yeah, that\'s just the average of the scores I\'ve given this show. I\'ve got nothing more to say about this so-called ""movie"", except go watch it if you want, but lower your expectations for it first. It\'s not deserving of a score as high as it is right now.

Albeit formulated upon a childish and roundabout plot line, this archetypal setup does not detract from the depth of its amusement and the value of its entertainment.Opening up with a supposedly recurrent motif--that is, Nobito's tendency to attempt to run away--juxtaposed with the hunting excursions of a confused cavechild about to be sucked into a vortex, the film clearly aims to immediately earn the attention of it's intended audience (children).The art is colorful...and eye-catching, but not exceptional and clearly old-fashioned. The soundtrack and voice acting is par, but again, not spectacular. The characters are pre-established and not given any sort of development within the span of the movie, but they certainly aren't unlikable, they're just generically comedic and static. While I can't praise the movie for this, I don't find it particularly negative either--for the genre and pure entertainment purpose of the film, the kids fit the bill.Overall, it's definitely something I enjoyed and would recommend to burn an hour or to entertain a group of bored children, but it's not something I would set aside time to watch again. It's funny, dynamic, and has the chummy, nostalgic vibe that would bring a warm pain to the chest of any adult revisiting it, but for someone watching for the first time, it can seem to drag along at times and serve no real purpose when it comes to intellectual analysis. It's a dated piece of art for dated folk, but otherwise, it's just a film to laugh at and appreciate for its unabashed mediocrity. and eye-catching, but not exceptional and clearly old-fashioned.

It's funny, dynamic, and has the chummy, nostalgic vibe that would bring a warm pain to the chest of any adult revisiting it, but for someone watching for the first time, it can seem to drag along at times and serve no real purpose when it comes to intellectual analysis. It's a dated piece of art for dated folk, but otherwise, it's just a film to laugh at and appreciate for its unabashed mediocrity."", ""My overall take: Promising narrative hook, but disappointing resolution to the main conflict.In this movie, Nobita and his friends all want to run away from home, so they run away to... the Pleistocene Epoch 70,000 years ago, before humans lived in Japan. The film starts out pretty strong. The premise itself is an intriguing one that provides insight into each of the main characters: it's not rare to see Nobita or Gian getting in trouble with their mothers, but why might spoiled Suneo or responsible Shizuka want to leave home? And what about Doraemon himself, who often takes on the role of a guardian figure...for the kids? Connecting this story concept with the dispersal of humans into Japan is also a very creative idea. It's quite fun to watch the protagonists set up their own secret base in the Pleistocene.Unfortunately, the primary conflict is where the film falters for me. The main characters barely contribute to defeating the villain other than unwittingly leading the time police to his hideout, which felt extremely unsatisfying. They don't even get to successfully escape from the hideout by themselves. So enticing premise aside, I've always found this story disappointing. for the kids?

Doug & Kirill: Extra is, as the title states, an extra addition to the main series, which is titled (you guessed it!) Double Decker! Doug & Kirill.

However, if you become invested in the colorful cast of characters throughout the main series, these extra episodes are well worth the time.The plot of these episodes are not directly related to each other as they take place during different points throughout the main series, with the final of the 3 acting as an...epilogue of sorts to the main series (an obligatory hot springs episode, no less). Although, just watching all of them after the main 13 episode run is certainly an option and doesn’t break any sequencing or immersion.Given the nature of these episodes, nothing of real importance happens, but instead focuses on character interactions and minor trivia about them. In my opinion, this is where Double Decker: Doug & Kirill shines brightest, not on the story itself, but its entertaining characters and their diverse personalities leading to a variety of amusing situations, and the Extra episodes definitely deliver on that.So, is Double Decker! Doug & Kirill: Extra worth watching?If you enjoyed its parent series and are itching for more, then it is definitely worth watching. It preserves all the charm and humor from the original and adds more scenarios to showcase the characters’ personalities and chemistry with each other.To wrap things up, Double Decker!

Doraemon Movie 14: Nobita to Buriki no Labyrinth,https://myanimelist.net/anime/2659/Doraemon_Movie_14__Nobita_to_Buriki_no_Labyrinth,"[""My overall take: I don't love the setup, but an engaging film that highlights the importance of Doraemon's role in the story.In this movie, Nobita and his friends visit a strange yet luxurious hotel, but end up having to stop a robot uprising. Probably the standout feature of this movie's narrative is that the kids are unable to rely on Doraemon for most of it. Although a similar subplot has been done in a previous Doraemon movie, in that instance Doraemon was at least accompanied by Nobita for much of the time that he was broken; here he is physically separated from the children and...they have little clue of where he is or what happened to him. It's certainly an effective emotional setup: Nobita's despair at Doraemon's absence is palpable, and the moment when they finally locate and repair Doraemon is a real hope bringer.If I have anything to complain about the story here, it's that the protagonists' movie-exclusive allies sometimes don't come across as very sympathetic. I get that they're in a desperate situation, but essentially tricking a group of children from a different planet into fighting for their cause doesn't leave a great first impression! Not only that, but they also don't give the protagonists a real opportunity to consent; by the time the movie characters explain all this, they're already bringing the protagonists with them on the way to start a campaign against the enemy robots. Note that Doraemon had already gone missing by this point, so the main group really consists of regular kids who don't even have gadgets to use. they have little clue of where he is or what happened to him.

Despite being, in some ways, a retelling of the original story, I can say that it\'s an improved DB\'s beginning, with all main characters (some with minor changes in their appearance, like Staff Officer Black and General White).Better renderized, it just became beautiful and gives joy to watch. The original magic got stronger with this special animation and it surely won\'t disappoint anyone who loves DB, and even the ones who had never watched it.Some characters were excluded, like Pilaf and his comrades, and some members from RR (Colonel Silver, Captain Yellow etc.), but those were less important in the...saga. What matters is that it shows us, in 75 minutes, all that happened before Piccolo Daimao\'s appearance.So, basically, the story goes from Goku meeting Bulma, Oolong, Yamcha, Puar and Master Roshi, to the complete defeat of the RR\'s army, with some small changes in the way it goes and the exclusion of Goku\'s training with Kuririn, as well as their first Tenkaichi Budoukai.Ending credits with ""Dan Dan Kokoro Hikarete \'ku"" as its background made me cry (this song really moves me).

Unlike most of the other DB movies that I\'ve seen, this one actually has a story. Yeah, you heard me right. The usual set up for Dragon Ball movies is this: Introduce some new villain(s) within the first 5 minutes that\'s out to take...over the world... and then the rest of it is just a long drawn out battle between Goku and co with the aforementioned villain(s). At some point, Piccolo would make an ""unexpected"" appearance in order to save Gohan (Goku\'s son), then gets beaten up before Goku saves the day. The end. Surprisingly, this movie deviates from that much used formula. Shocking though it may seem, THIS movie actually has a story to tell, a story that can actually be considered a proper adventure, albeit one with lots of time spent battling enemies. However my point is there IS story development here and not just a simple 5 minute set up to face up to the newer, badder, stronger than ever enemy. This is what makes it so refreshing in comparison to the other Dragon Ball movies. The story itself is decent too, and kept me interested for most of the duration of the movie despite some parts being quite predictable.I enjoyed the comedy element of the movie as well, I remember one classic line ""I don\'t want to touch your dirty ass"" that had me LOLing for a bit. The animation is of the usual sub-par Dragon Ball standard, though I\'m grateful for the lack of typical fast exchanges of blows style battle animation that\'s so prevalent in other Dragon Ball movies. The character designs are typically uninspiring, with young Goku looking exactly like Gohan in the other movies - they are so similar in fact, that I thought this was Gohan\'s story at first. It\'s quite funny (in a good way) to see a young, naive Goku. He\'s makes for a decent lead character. The frankenstein character wasn\'t so good though - there was one point where he suddenly changed in a way that doesn\'t make much sense from a character development point of view. Oh well, what the hell am I doing being so fussy about the characters in a Dragon Ball movie anyway...My main issue with this movie isn\'t actually with the quality of the content (my expectation wasn\'t exactly sky high in the first place), it\'s with the frequent fanservice. I\'m not a fan of fanservice even during the best of times, but it\'s worse here because it\'s highly inappropriate considering the age group of the audience thats being targeted.Though ""The Path to Power"" still a way from being good, I\'d definitely give it a thumbs up for good effort, and for succeeding to be one of the more interesting Dragon Ball movies.Extended edit: having watched the first Dragon Ball movie ""Curse of the Blood Rubies"", I\'m even more impressed with ""The Path to Power"" now, because comparing the two movies revealed just how different this one is to its predecessor.

Now, it\'s time for the fourth and final film before they moved onto Dragonball Z, Saikyou e no Michi. It was released by Toei in \'96, seven years after the Dragonball series had ended and the same year Dragonball Z saw its finale. Which seems like odd timing. Like, the non-canon GT had started airing when this came out. In any case, let\'s take a look and see what they had in store for us.Story:We open with Goku meeting Bulma for the first time. Yay, another re-telling like the first film. So, they meet Oolong and Yamcha...and then things surprisingly get switched up and they encounter the Red Ribbon Army. So, instead of a straight up re-telling, it\'s more an alternative scenario where the group encounters the Red Ribbon Army while first hunting for the dragonballs instead of Pilaf and his minions.The biggest issue with the narrative is that some parts of it are overly predictable. Like, the big climax is very much of the ""everything is obvious before it happens"" variety. Of course, this isn\'t a franchise that\'s known for its surprising twists. It\'s known for its big, over the top action sequences. But it\'s usually not quite this obvious with every single beat being super telegraphed. The film also repeats some of the gags from the series verbatim and they just don\'t have the same impact. It doesn\'t help that they aren\'t even close to the funniest gags from the series.On the positive side, changing things around so that the group\'s first major conflict is with Red Ribbon, does change things up enough to give the film a sense of uniqueness, in spite of being an alternative re-telling. Which is something of a rarity. It also does mostly capture the sense of fun of the series proper pretty well.Characters:Chances are, most of you are familiar with the major Dragonball characters like Goku, Bulma and Roshi. You also get more minor supporting characters like Oolong & Pu\'ar. There\'s also Yamcha for the one person out there who likes Yamcha. Fortunately for the rest of us, he pretty much just follows the group and gets used as a butt monkey. The somewhat surprising character is Cyborg Eight, or Hat-chan if you prefer. He gets used quite extensively in this one. It\'s a fun cast, not all that deep but well suited for the film\'s aesthetic.Art:Mostly, the artwork is pretty well done. There are some cool action moments. The character models look good. Bulma has purple hair instead of her usual teal for some reason and Goku wears a blue gi instead of his usual orange. Probably because the non-canon GT had just come out and he wore blue in that. The only real issue with the art is that they really overdo the shadow effects and there are points where it just looks a bit rubbish.Sound:The acting is well done. They got the usual cast with Nozawa Masako, Tsuru Hiromi, Tatsuta Naoki, Iizuka Shouzou and the others. So, it\'s a group who know the characters they\'re voicing really well and are good at them. The music is typical for the franchise. Which isn\'t a bad thing. Dragonball consistently has some pretty strong music.Areas of Improvement:1. A little surprise to the climax. Yes, this is a formulaic franchise but they could still put in something a bit unpredictable to make things more interesting.2. Rework the gags a little. There\'s a reason Spamalot doesn\'t use the exact same jokes as Quest for the Holy Grail. Gags are funnier when they\'re fresh. If you know the punchline, they just don\'t work as well.3. Stop Putting shadows over everything.Final Thoughts:Saikyou e no Michi\xa0is a solid Dragonball film, in spite of its late release and fans of the franchise will probably enjoy it once they stop complaining about Goku\'s wardrobe change and Bulma\'s hair dye. For myself, the climax was far too obvious and the recycled gags didn\'t land particularly well, but I still thought it was a solid film.

It spends a lot of time on the former and not so much on the latter, ending with an awkward blend of disjointed scenes that aren't all that engaging or interesting. Now, that last comment is extremely relative, I understand that. How engaged someone is depends on, quite literally, their knowledge of the source material. I couldn't find myself enjoying it all that much because the source material was being butchered in favor of telling an alternate...world Dragon Ball. However, the aspects within this film are just other-worldly enough to make someone keep going back and forth between what we already know about Dragon Ball and what this film is translating.For instance, the first time Goku uses a Kamehame wave he ends up using far more power than he initially would. In the manga it's big but not DBZ Super Saiyan tier. In this, Goku seems to already be able to make a big enough wave that a fleet of ships are destroyed. It's really strange and sort of off-sets the film especially in the last bit where Goku has some trouble during the last fight. But, things get way out of hand during this scene when almost becomes Super Saiyan? It's weird. It makes the whole thing memorable for all the wrong reasons.Art:With story aside, it's a shame to realize that the animation here is pretty solid. I found some set-pieces to be really beautiful and certain combat sequences to be well animated despite their lack of depth or martial arts. That said, I can't say the film doesn't LOOK GOOD.Sound:Forgettable music. Can't remember a single song used during the film, neither any prominent sound effects that humbled me, something that should regularly happen when people are shooting lasers from their fingertips or punching the tar out of each other. I want to be wowed by what's going on not just with visuals but with audio. I didn't get this at all.VA work was good, though.Character:Again, not that great. Since Goku's character is spent laughing too much (to the point of utter annoyance) or being horribly unrealistic within the world of Dragon Ball, we're left with the supporting cast being nothing but basic type-casts that don't get very much to go on. Granted, it's not until later on in Dragon Ball when the characters begin to really develop beyond caricatures but it'd still be nice to get some development. I can't tell you one thing about each character when I exclude what I already know from the manga. It's disappointing.Enjoyment:Unenjoyable. For me, at least. The fanservice didn't help.

Trying to fit such a rich story into 74 mins robbed a lot of the characters of a good backstory (particularly Red and Black).

Here there be spoilers!I actually reviewed this OVA a few months ago, but I wrote a joke review entirely for laughs. Now I will actually give my real opinion on it. The OVA is a mixed bag honestly. There was a lot more backstory that the Director and writer of the series Mamoru Kanbe wanted to put in, but he only was given the budget to barely make one 20 minute OVA with drastically inferior animation. He knew there wasn\'t time to fit in the subplots he really wanted, so the OVA focuses mostly on lighthearted comedy. Unfortunately, it decides at the last minute...to tease us with some really interesting backstory, but it runs out of time to explain several hugely important details and leaves anyone that didn\'t read the manga with more questions than answers. The ending of the main series was intentionally ambiguous, but gave enough hints and felt complete on an emotional level. The OVA on the other hand, just suffers from poor ""clock management"" to borrow a football term.Story and characters: 8/10We see Nana trying to adapt to life at Kouta\'s home for girls with serious psychological issues. This results in some actually pretty funny shenanegins and heart warming moments. Nana is slowly starting to realize that there is world outside of the hell she has endured her entire life. We also see Nana\'s internal struggle on how to handle Lucy/Nyuu. Even the saintly Nana, who is basically anime Jesus, struggles to forgive the girl that tore her limbs off in slow and sadistic fashion. However, Nana realizes that Lucy has been reborn and killing this alternate personality would be like killing a child with a clean  record. Nana contemplates taking Nyuu to Bando and getting her killed in order to protect her new found family from Lucy, who Nana believes is simply evil. Honestly, I don\'t see how we could blame Nana for thinking that way. However, Nana being her extremely kind hearted self has second thoughts and abandons the plan.We see Lucy have a flashback to 3 years before the start of the series and 5 years after the festival massacre. Lucy has been laying low for years and living on to one day apologize to her beloved for her crimes. She continues to wear the ski cap that he gave her as a momento. Lucy has met a new friend it seems, a girl that is roughly her age. This girl like Kouta before her treats Lucy with kindness even after seeing her allegedly ""hideous"" deformity. Lucy seems like she is beginning to trust mankind again and is clearly trying to turn over a new leaf. Unfortunately, the 2 girls are on the run for reasons never explained. The girl, who is never even named has blood on her shirt, but what happened is never explained. It is hinted that she killed someone in self defence, which indeed is the case in the manga, but in the anime you pretty much have to be Sherlock Holmes to figure that out. Lucy tells her new friend that she will go to the police station in the morning. Apparently Lucy is getting ready to take the blame for her friend\'s crime as a final act of repentence. In a symbolic scene, Lucy gives her friend the ski cap of friendship and humanity, which will soon lead to her tragic demise when the police mistake the girl as another mutant. Kanbe really liked his metaphors between the hat and the damn clock. Did anyone else notice the last thing Lucy does in the main series before listening to her hallucination and slaughtering the festival goers? She takes off the hat and throws it to the ground, abandoning her humanity and desire for love. I guess she went back and got it after the massacre? Anyways, Kurama has been spying on Lucy for some time now and decides this is now the right moment to move in and capture her. Did he know she was going to the police? Is he psychic? How the hell did he even find Lucy when all the clues he had was a picture of Lucy from 5 years ago and the knowledge that she was born in Kamakura? Maybe he just assumed she was still in town and looked for people wearing ski caps in the summer with red eyes. Lucy fights off the guards but shows restraint and doesn\'t kill anyone, because this new penent Lucy has no desire to kill anymore. Tragically, Lucy\'s friend takes a bullet to save Lucy, leaving our mutant anti-hero completely devastated. Lucy agrees to surrender peacefully as long as her friend is saved.Lucy is dragged off in undignified fashion and her ski cap momento was left behind. Kurama promises to save the friend, but callously tells Lucy later that day that her friend has died. Having lost her friend and her symbolic momento, Lucy hardens her heart and filled with extreme rage, starts to become the cold blooded murderer that we are introduced to in episode 1. Lucy vows while crying through her mask that she will make Kurama feel the pain of losing the only people that love him. I have one question. Why the HELL did Kanbe leave in those silly comedy scenes with Bando instead of explaining JACK SHIT during the flashback? Wouldn\'t that have been a more effective use of episode time? What the HELL was Kanbe thinking? You directed Baccano! You worked with Miyazaki himself on Nausicca! You\'re better than this Kanbe!Art: 5/10The animation took a nosedive from the main series and any seen where characters are actually walking are pretty painful to look at. The animators try to mask the lower quality with the wild facial expressions and chibi style that anime is known for, but this was never done in the main series and looks completely out of place here!Sound: 8/10It still has that awesome opening, but this episode mostly uses the comedy tracks, which are the weakest part of the OST and are fairly grating at times.Overall : 8/10This OVA has some moments where it shines, so firstly I will explain the good. It explains Lucy\'s capture and why she didn\'t kill Kurama in episode 1. It shows Nana\'s moral struggle over whether it is right to kill Lucy and allows the viewer to better see into the psyche of Nana\'s character. The OVA also does have some cute moments and some fun comedy that gives us a break from the extremely dark and brutal tone of the series. Lastly, the OVA also manages to do fine with virtually zero blood and no nudity, shutting up the obnoxious haters that think that is all the series has. On the negative side, the OVA squanders many of its precious few minutes on goofy comedy like Nana trying to cut vegetables rather than explain some background that easily could have been summed up and left viewers far more satisfied and less confused. It is too bad Kanbe will never be given a mulligan and allowed to make more episodes to fill in more story. to tease us with some really interesting backstory, but it runs out of time to explain several hugely important details and leaves anyone that didn\'t read the manga with more questions than answers.

I would say that yes for me watching the show in 2020 it is fine because I checked that it is episode 10.5 so fits really well. I can appreciate the mixed feelings in 2005 when it came out after the main 2004 show.That said it is a thoroughly enjoyable OVA that is a bit more ecchi focused than before. I would also say it was unexpected. The first part is very comedic then...starts to take a dark turn as like the main show. It eventually goes really dark then back to being funny again. It was welcome but unexpected to have this during what is generally a very dark and violent show.The art is the same standard as the main show if not slightly more polished. I would say that it is of a good standard and for its age has stood very well. Many shows of even later towards the 2010s have much worse animation so it was built to last per se.The soundtrack is enjoyable. I watched this in the dub format as I couldn't find a subtitled version in English in good quality. The dub makes me glad I am watching the main show in Japanese. As with many older shows, the dubbing is a bit odd.Characters develop in as much as they show a bit more normal life. It was good to see although Bando is doing it to fight Lucy he is doing a service cleaning the beach.I would say this was very good.

The animation improved, and there is music that wasn't heard in the rest of the show.  I'll admit I didn't expect to learn anything major about the plot from watching this, but I was pretty surprised when I did!  This OVA will answer some nagging questions while building on the relationships of the characters.I can't think of much else to write without spoiling things, so just go enjoy this funny, lighthearted episode of Elfen Lied!

I guess they felt they needed to pad it out or something. The bulk of the episode is just Nana doing chores and being suspicious of Nyu. I thought it was fine, but definitely skippable. The episode is, dare I say it, filler. Throughout the series they\'ve touched on...things like Kouta and Yuka\'s relationship in small ways and something as insignificant as Nana adjusting to human life should have gotten the same treatment.

It does however, provide further insight into Lucy's past and develops the relationship between her and Nana. I felt that it wasn't necessary to the plot presented in the anime series, but you could consider it as an enjoyable addition to the series.The story of this OVA is rather simplistic, which I found to be enjoyable, as it helps you take a break from all the tragedy you'd face in the main series. Others may find it boring or a waste of time though....There is however, an emphasis on comedy in this OVA, and as for the ending, it ties back into the main storyline at a point which you'll most likely be able to recognize if you've already watched the main series.I don't have much to say on the art style. It was nice to look at it, but not anything amazing really. I will add that the art style of the Elfen Lied series makes every character look rather cute in a way, until they start tearing people apart of course.The voice acting is still on point, and the songs used are representative of the tone of the series as a whole. The same haunting OST is used in the OVA during moments that require it. There is a strange soothing quality to it, that makes you think of listening to it again, but not actually doing it cause you're afraid that it might suck you in. I'm aware that this is a strange way of describing it, but you may come to understand what I mean once you listen to it.Character development is the main focus of this OVA, as it helps to slightly flesh out the background of certain characters. There is also a humorous side to one the antagonists personalities that ends up saving the environment for the wrong reasons. As previously stated, they're focusing on humor and character development (which isn't that much to be honest) in this OVA.Was it enjoyable? I did find a few laughs here and there, but it's certainly not one of my favorite OVA's, nor is it memorable by any means. The lack of importance to the story is the bane of this OVA. I'm not saying that it's bad, but it isn't necessary to watch unless if you're invested in the characters or the series. That is my final verdict. Thanks for reading this review!

It takes place before the end of the series and has a completely different cast, so you're thrown for a fool when you end up watching it. At least Lucy is still as excellent as always but it really should have been an extra episode to tie up the loose ends from the anime series rather than what this turns out to be, but the offbeat comedy is not to my taste overall but provides some nice fluff to distract from the more serious nature of...the main show. the main show."", ""So sometimes this OVA is called episode 10.5 because that's roughly where it fits into the main series.I don't have much to say without spoilers, it's basically just a normal episode of Elfen Lied.

It provides some extra background and fills in a blank spot in the main character's history.I give it a 9/10 even though I gave the main series a 10/10 just because its not really a stand alone OVA or anything super special.

Druaga no Tou: The Aegis of Uruk,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3230/Druaga_no_Tou__The_Aegis_of_Uruk,"[""Its really hard to tell where GONZO is going with Druaga. The first episode of Druaga is the funniest (and probably the best) first episode of any anime I have seen. It starts off with an RPG-style party (a sword user, an archer, etc) with the aim of climbing the Tower of Druaga to defeat the evil Lord Druaga There was me thinking 'Oh no, the lame shounen of this season', however that all changed quickly. The rest of the episode is about the protagonist's (Jil) journey to climb to the top, and the comic manor it all happened. The not-so-slapstick comedy in this anime...has been somewhat refreshing and different to anything I've seen before, which is the reason for the 10 for enjoyment.However, this actually turned out to be a dream, and from episode 2, it became more serious. The rest of the series continues the party's journey to the top, with less jokes along the way, but ones that will make you uncontrollably laugh nevertheless. Sometimes there are really hilarious episodes, and sometimes more sober-sided ones, which is why I can't really tell where this series is going and why I have given a 7 for story (sometimes the serious episodes aren't that interesting).The art is average for this day and age, and likewise with the music (though the opening is very misleading as it shows the characters in modern school uniform, when this is set in medieval-ish times - though this raises the theory that these people could be playing an RPG all this time, like .hack, as it is very game-like with the parties, monsters, maps/levels and the different classes). I do however, like the characters in Druaga; there are no lame characters (the shy one, the overly-clever one) and its epically good there's no 'the-useless-one' of the party; they all seem to have a purpose.All in all, a very amusing, but peculiar, anime which is showing good potential. I just hope it doesn't end with the 'power of love' saving the world. has been somewhat refreshing and different to anything I've seen before, which is the reason for the 10 for enjoyment.However, this actually turned out to be a dream, and from episode 2, it became more serious.

Sometimes there are really hilarious episodes, and sometimes more sober-sided ones, which is why I can't really tell where this series is going and why I have given a 7 for story (sometimes the serious episodes aren't that interesting).The art is average for this day and age, and likewise with the music (though the opening is very misleading as it shows the characters in modern school uniform, when this is set in medieval-ish times - though this raises the theory that these people could be playing an RPG all this time, like .hack, as it is very game-like with the parties, monsters, maps/levels and the different classes). I do however, like the characters in Druaga; there are no lame characters (the shy one, the overly-clever one) and its epically good there's no 'the-useless-one' of the party; they all seem to have a purpose.All in all, a very amusing, but peculiar, anime which is showing good potential. I just hope it doesn't end with the 'power of love' saving the world."", ""It would appear GONZO seem to think they can use their unique release format to gloss over the fact this series is riddled with flaws.  There are three experiences to be had from Druaga, a hilarious comedy one, a somewhat below average action one and a dire fantasy one.  It is literally a lottery as to which genre will be dominant in each episode.The storyline couldn't possibly be any more generic; explore dungeon, defeat evil boss, find legendary treasure etc., its not even well executed.  When its not being generic, it's being downright predictable, major plot points are seen coming a mile...off.  The pacing is atrocious, the characters will spend multiple episodes in floors relatively close to each other then magically be much further in the dungeon just so the series can finish within the episode count.  Much of which is taken up by almost filler like pointless episodes that do nothing to progress what little plot there is (episode 6 in particular).  GONZO have tried to justify this shambles by confirming a second series to continue the storyline, but such a weak reason doesn't excuse this mess.  A real shame after a genuinely fantastic opening episode, that made it look like the series wiould break a lot of these clich&eacute;s, sadly it fails.  If the storyline can't even meet its own expectations, what chance does the viewer have?Animation is top notch, nice to see GONZO are still capable of doing something right.  Very impressive scenery and backgrounds throughout the series, with some solid, likeable character designs.  The enemies are also (for the most part) very well designed.The audio is another highlight, very nice opening and ending themes that fit the series well enough.  The background music is good enough and usually appropriate to whatever is going on.  Voice acting is another strong point, with an impressive display from the seiyuu's.Character wise, Druaga once again fails to live up to its own expectations,  the cast is initially nothing short of excellent; likeable characters with interesting personalities, unfortunately there is next to no character development in he entire series, kind of to be expected when there are more characters than episodes though.  Once again the excuse &quot;it'll be fixed in the next series&quot; isn't valid in an analysis of this series.  As a result of little character development, it is hard for the viewer to get attached to the characters and the dramatic scenes lose much of their impact.Druaga remains an enjoyable enough experience despite these flaws, thanks mostly to comedy episodes, but it can be a genuine atruggle to get through some of other episodes. The comedy episodes if reviewed individually would get nines and tens, whilst the rest of the series would get between four and seven.  It keeps the viewers attention with the promise of better future episodes, which is sort of admirable.  It'd be a lot better if it were a 26 episode series, that'd allow fleshing of the plot and characters as well as removing the rushed feel to the series. Worth a watch regardless. off.

The story follows rookie climber Jil, who got kicked out of his brother Neeba's team after failing miserably. Refusing to give up, he decides to look for new teams mates to again climb the tower to defeat Druaga and claim the prize for doing so, an artefact said to be able to grant any wish, the Blue Crystal Rod.STORY:Making use of a legendary name of &quot;Tower of Druaga&quot;, fans from that age and generation will be...very interested in watching it. They will be sorely disappointed. The references to the game are so lousily done, it made this almost a parody of it, which I highly doubt that was the intended motive. Even the overall plot hardly has a flow, just mearly the climbing of the tower, facing various obstacles along the way, which are hardly entertaining, might I add.ART:For all of Gonzo's inability to make a decent plot, their animation quality never ceases to amaze me. It's very pleasing to the eye. Now if only the anime was any better. -_-SOUND:Good opening song, voice actors pretty decent. Not much more I could say, really...CHARACTER:WHAT character development?

What made the game popular were the various almost random actions you had to perform in order to be able to ascend to the next level. The original game had a number of sequels, of...course all involving some even greater evil and an expanded tower.The background explains why the series plays out in an enormous tower of multiple levels, each with their own hazards and enemies. As a fantasy series, this is as clichéd as it gets; as a series bearing the Druaga name, this is proper.Using this all too familiar fantasy theme has its uses. There really is no need to have to introduce much of the world, background story, and characters: everyone watching the series immediately knows he's in fantasy video game-territory, where everything and everyone has a standard role to play. Within the first few episodes all major characters are introduced, with the main roles being those of the somewhat naive young man who wants to fight for justice and peace, the girl with clerical powers and a dark secret, and of course the more experienced powerful adventurer with his own share of secrets. The cast is filled out with the usual bunch of rugged fighters, silent rogues, and whining but powerful mages, all planning to ascend to the top of the tower, slay the evil monster, and gain the heroes' reward. Of course, the animation and design of the characters is geared to making sure there are no doubts to their roles, as is the vocal cast, which includes some high-profile names but takes absolutely no chances: everyone sounds as their archetype should.The first half of the series is used to pound every single trite and generic characteristic of standard fantasy series, from Wizardry to whichever animation of the Tales-video games, into the viewers perception. Expediently enough, it does this by making the episodes comical, even farcical at times. The first episode shows the main character's own vision of his heroics in the most generic manner possible, for instance, while later on the inherent greed of all adventurers is relied upon to have them unite against a common enemy. It is in this half that the series also pays its homage to the roots of the Druaga franchise, as not only are there a few instances wherein the drawing style switches to the top view, 2d, 8 bit look of the original game, but the game itself appears as well, and has a functional role too.But I started this review by stating that Tower of Druaga is not a comedy series. This is because, halfway through, it suddenly takes a turn for the dramatic. Usually, this would mean the end of any interest the series would hold, as far too many broken romcoms and action comedies testify to, but in the case of Tower of Druaga, the first, somewhat comical, half turns out to be used to make the viewer comfortable with the generic setting and characters. It makes no sense for the viewer to expect some sort of realism in the setting, and he also has come to expect some sort of volta stemming from the characters' unspoken but clearly known backgrounds.The effect is that the viewer does not have to be disappointed by this generic plot twisting or the reactions of the characters to it, as it was already clear that nothing overly original would happen. It is, in fact, this basis in generality that makes the drama fairly strong. As each and every character acts according to its archetypal fashion, a plot point that is as archetypal can be convincingly raised as a source of dramatic tension: for instance, if all characters have their own motives, and if only one reward can be gained from slaying the big evil, what would this imply for intra-party integrity and inter-party rivalry? The friction resulting from the fact that, while slaying the big bad would be beneficial for everyone, only one brave adventurer can become the true is convincingly exploited.Granted, the drama and tension aren't very evolved or deep, and the fact remains that almost any single happening can be predicted. The way it was portrayed, however, was, to me at least, thoroughly enjoyable, even if entirely forgettable. What makes me shirk from giving the story an extra point for the way it is handled, however, is the simple fact that Tower of Druaga - the Aegis of Uruk is an unfinished series, with a sequel in the making, and I fear that many of the more interesting points will in the end be strung out and hung out to wither.As for the art, in general it is pretty good, with clear lines and a strong design treading the middle ground between expected fantasy trappings and some more inspired vistas. A definite plus is the use of the graphics of the original game at times, and a definite minus would be the use of CG for the main monster, but that's just my personal hatred towards CG animation speaking. As said, the voice acting, though relatively high profile, was as generic as possible, ranging from the heroic to the positively annoying. Music is utterly forgettable.The characters, as said, are as generic as they come. I didn't expect more, and I didn't get more. I have never understood why character development and connection with characters is such a dearly held item in reviews, as characters should portray their roles within a certain story (background in general is irrelevant) and should be convincing and consistent in their roles, whether or not the role is likable or not. In the case of Tower of Druaga, the roles aren't meant to be developed, or to offer some insights, or to portray either 'real' humans or ideals. They're consistent, clear-cut, and utterly generic, and this serves the series well.

Not like I must have control to enjoy something, but without having some solid ground, you don't know where GONZO's gonna throw you next. The series started out brilliantly, but as it went on, it felt like GONZO split up its team into sections. &quot;OK, you make episode 4, and I'll make episode 5, and...&quot; yeah, you get it. You can feel the disconnection between episodes, and GONZO is having a hard time finding the fine balance between comedy and serious plot movement that makes sense. However, it...wasn't horrible and not worth watching at all, and it seems GONZO's gonna try this again with a new season next year.STORY: 6/10Not the most inventive thing you've ever heard of. A guy wants to be the hero, his old team rejects him, he finds a new team, and whoopee you can guess from there. Although the story has a nice twist at the end, it hardly makes up for the stereotypical plotline. What makes things even worse is that the plot is executed by underdeveloped characters that you have a hard time connecting with, and part of that is the tiny 12 episodes that GONZO attemted to cram their huge ideas into. If they had about 26 episodes for this anime instead of 12, I bet we would see some huge improvements.ART: 8/10The art was actually pretty good. I really enjoyed the occasional 3D moment, it really fleshed out the anime more. The character designs were unique as well (in terms of looks, not emotions) so not much else to say here.SOUND: 7/10Nothing fabulous. OP and ED were ok, and no in-anime music struck me as amazing. it just... it fit what it was going with, like anime music and sound should.CHARACTER: 6/10Here's the one I wanted to talk about. I can see that these characters have a lot of great emotions and ideas packed into them, but 12 episodes is simply not enough for such a complicated web of people. I didn't know much about any character at the end, and I felt almost like they didn't earn what they got. Instead, it felt like GONZO was pushing the characters to the end so that it could meet this 12 episode limit. It just feels like something is missing, and that probably has to do with the confusion of where this series is actually going. The characters rarely start an episode where they ended previously, and... well, I blame it on the 12 episode limit again...ENJOYMENT: 7/10Not much to say here. Let me put it this way: I always watch 4 anime episodes a night, sometimes 5, and I always watch them in order of worst to last. Druaga was almost always one of the first ones. It's hard to enjoy it when you don't know where its going, or what the characters really think. I am very confused right now about Kaaya's stand on things, but hopefully we'll learn more next season.OVERALL: 7/10I've been beating on this anime a lot, because I feel that Druaga is lacking something.

This anime is just like any other typical adventure anime engulfed with wacky antics that will leave an impression to you.The story is somewhat generic. Basically it includes a group of climbers with the desire to obtain the Blue crystal rod (an item which is said to grant its bearers wish). It can be obtained after defeating Druaga who is located on top of the tower that is  named...after the evil lord Druaga himself. Certain plot twists were also present which sets this anime apart from most adventure anime titles. The animation company &quot;Gonzo&quot; is the one who's responsible for this one. I personally disliked Gonzo before but I have to say that their work on this one is pretty good. From the first episode to the last, the animation got better. The background animation is decent and 3D animations were also present. The BGMs used in this one is unappealing. The only thing I liked about the music in this anime is the performance of the uprising band Muramasa with their opening song Swinging. The characters are also typical, it features some of the so-called classes which includes an Archer, a shielder, a healer and etc which can be found in most RPG's or MMORPG's of today. The characters are interesting, interesting to the fact that almost all of them have different intentions and reasons for climbing the tower however they share only one thought and that is to defeat Druaga.I enjoyed this anime, almost every episode will make you smile and these interesting characters will do the honors of doing so. Overall this anime is good for all ages, it's an adventure of 2008 that you should not miss. after the evil lord Druaga himself.

', 'Av: Interesting looking box art thereNK: Ah, right.  New anime I got a couple weeks back.  It’s called “Tower of Druaga - The Aegis of Uruk.”Av: That’s a mouthful.  Wait, “Tower of Druaga?”  I’ve heard that somewhere before…NK: Tower of Druaga is an old video game by Namco.  I played it a bit when I was a kid.  That’s the reason I took a look at the anime.Av: How’s the anime?NK: Pretty good.  Sure, it doesn’t follow the plot of the game, putting the events of the game at 80 years in the past, but it still has...references to a lot of the game.  King Gilgamesh, all the monsters.  Heck, the main group actually goes to the old tower during one episode.Av: Sounds…interesting.  What did they do there?NK: It’s actually an important plot point as to why they were there, so I won’t divulge all the details.  Basically, Jil charges into the tower to find something, when it turns out he has to be controlled by someone outside.  Hilarity, and the most direct reference to Tower of Druaga, ensues.Av: I take it that’s your favorite episode?NK: No.  Episode 5 is.  The party comes across a fork in the road, one side saying “shortcut.”  They decide to take the shortcut, which turns out to be covered in traps.Av: That doesn’t sound good…NK: The traps are hilarious, though.  They change the entire party magically whenever someone steps on one.  For example, at the beginning of the episode, everything turns 8-bit.  It’s great.Av: Right.  What about the characters?NK: I like most of the characters in the series.  The main party is easy to get attached to, though some are your stereotypical heroes.  Jil, for example, is your typical, likeable goof, though he does get pretty serious when he needs to.  Kaaya is, well, there’s a lot of important details to her.  She’s an oracle, a user of defensive magic…she comes across as cute an naive at first, but...well...that’s all I’ll say about her.  Ahmey is a very serious character among all of the chaos in the party, so she stays pretty quiet until there’s trouble.  Melt is from a noble family, so he’s really picky and complains about a lot of stuff.  Plus, he uses his magic with rods that he swings like golf clubs.  His assistant, Coopa, is the craziest of the group, being about 12 years old, though she acts much more mature than Melt.  It‘s funny watching them argue.  I really can’t go into too much detail about the party, though I will say it’s one of my favorite casts of characters.Av: Figures as much.  Take it Coopa’s your favorite?  You do tend to like the younger characters.NK: Actually, no.  Melt is my favorite character in the series.  The introduction to him casts him in a bad light, seeing as how he’s completely drunk, but he’s actually a likeable character once you reach the end of the series.Av: You watch it in Japanese, as usual?NK: I actually watched it in English, though I did watch the first few episodes in Japanese.  Part of the reason I bought the series was the voice actors in it.  Jil is played by Todd Haberkorn, who also played Hikaru in Ouran and Watanuki in xxxHolic. He does a good job playing the goofy hero.  Melt is voiced by Chuck Huber, the same guy who voiced Hiei *snicker*.  It’s a pretty interesting voice cast.  Oh, just warning you now, Coopa’s played by Monica Rial.Av: Oh, joy…NK: It really isn’t that bad.  Though she does sound a lot like Renge.Av: That’s what I was afraid of.  So, I take it I should watch this?NK: Definitely.  Even if you haven’t played Tower of Druaga before, I’m pretty sure you’ll enjoy it.  Oh, before I forget, this is the first season.  There’s a second season I’ve yet to watch subtitled “The Sword of Uruk.”  The ending is pretty weird because of that, just warning you.Av: You’ll be getting that one too, huh?NK: Yep.  Though it comes out in February…It’s going to be a long wait. references to a lot of the game.  King Gilgamesh, all the monsters.  Heck, the main group actually goes to the old tower during one episode.Av: Sounds…interesting.  What did they do there?NK: It’s actually an important plot point as to why they were there, so I won’t divulge all the details.  Basically, Jil charges into the tower to find something, when it turns out he has to be controlled by someone outside.  Hilarity, and the most direct reference to Tower of Druaga, ensues.Av: I take it that’s your favorite episode?NK: No.  Episode 5 is.  The party comes across a fork in the road, one side saying “shortcut.”  They decide to take the shortcut, which turns out to be covered in traps.Av: That doesn’t sound good…NK: The traps are hilarious, though.  They change the entire party magically whenever someone steps on one.  For example, at the beginning of the episode, everything turns 8-bit.  It’s great.Av: Right.  What about the characters?NK: I like most of the characters in the series.  The main party is easy to get attached to, though some are your stereotypical heroes.  Jil, for example, is your typical, likeable goof, though he does get pretty serious when he needs to.  Kaaya is, well, there’s a lot of important details to her.  She’s an oracle, a user of defensive magic…she comes across as cute an naive at first, but...well...that’s all I’ll say about her.  Ahmey is a very serious character among all of the chaos in the party, so she stays pretty quiet until there’s trouble.  Melt is from a noble family, so he’s really picky and complains about a lot of stuff.  Plus, he uses his magic with rods that he swings like golf clubs.  His assistant, Coopa, is the craziest of the group, being about 12 years old, though she acts much more mature than Melt.  It‘s funny watching them argue.  I really can’t go into too much detail about the party, though I will say it’s one of my favorite casts of characters.Av: Figures as much.  Take it Coopa’s your favorite?  You do tend to like the younger characters.NK: Actually, no.  Melt is my favorite character in the series.  The introduction to him casts him in a bad light, seeing as how he’s completely drunk, but he’s actually a likeable character once you reach the end of the series.Av: You watch it in Japanese, as usual?NK: I actually watched it in English, though I did watch the first few episodes in Japanese.  Part of the reason I bought the series was the voice actors in it.  Jil is played by Todd Haberkorn, who also played Hikaru in Ouran and Watanuki in xxxHolic. He does a good job playing the goofy hero.  Melt is voiced by Chuck Huber, the same guy who voiced Hiei *snicker*.  It’s a pretty interesting voice cast.  Oh, just warning you now, Coopa’s played by Monica Rial.Av: Oh, joy…NK: It really isn’t that bad.  Though she does sound a lot like Renge.Av: That’s what I was afraid of.  So, I take it I should watch this?NK: Definitely.  Even if you haven’t played Tower of Druaga before, I’m pretty sure you’ll enjoy it.  Oh, before I forget, this is the first season.  There’s a second season I’ve yet to watch subtitled “The Sword of Uruk.”  The ending is pretty weird because of that, just warning you.Av: You’ll be getting that one too, huh?NK: Yep.  Though it comes out in February…It’s going to be a long wait.', ""This spring season completely changed my opinions toward Gonzo. Blassreiter is already a very solid series and I have always been a CG-hater. Druaga, on the other hand, came as a wonderful surprise.Druaga is not a masterpiece by any means, otherwise I wouldn't give it an 8 only. But it does have the potential to become a masterpiece. I was rather disappointed after the first episode because it was not funny at all (the Urua episode was much better IMO). In the next 11 episodes, I did see some interesting ideas and the writer did not drop them either. Unfortunately he didn't go on...and explore them. Of course, one may argue that Druaga is a comedy anime in nature, and I'm perfectly fine with it. All I'm saying is that Druaga could be much better if the writers were more serious about these ideas.But I'm not trying to bash the show here. What makes Druaga so wonderful is its good characterization and a full-of-imagination worldsetting. The worldsetting incorporates all the wonderful elements of RPG such as cute low level monsters, various skills, different classes of characters, team play, boss run etc. It also leaves all the boring parts out, such as walking from point A to B, like what they did in that more-boring-than-Bohr's-atomic-model Guardian of the Spirits. The little cute monsters and all that are what makes RPG interesting in the old days.The chacterization is above the average too, even though it suffers a little bit from the plot. It has everything I could ask for. The characters are realistic, they have depth, and they have some lovable elements. Rarely seen in the anime industry, the writer clearly demosntrated that he received some professional training in writing. Druaga introduced a huge set of characters. Fortunately the writer didn't divide the screen time evenly to each character (see Rahxephon). What he did, like any other trained writer is supposed to do, is to focus most of the show on the main characters: namely Kaaya, Niba, and Jil. None of them are annoying, and all of them have some mysteries surrounding their past. The mysteries kept them interesting to watch throughout the season. My favourite character is Jil, not because he is the protagonist but because he is the only one who showed some character change in this season. From a rather naive hero wannabe to a person who desires to become a shield for his friends, the change was done smoothly and genuiely with considerable amount of introspection, another important piece in good characterization. The last episode says it all:&quot;They are not heroes but people who fight for their dreams.&quot; A normal person growing up is always the best. The puppy love between Kaaya is cute too and it's very likely that the focus of the show is going to be shifted toward this relationship in the next season. As for the side characters, as long as they are not annoying, that's enough for me, and that's exactly what the writer has done.Season 1 has been a great journey and ended at a cliffhanger. Without a question, season 2 is going to be my most anticipated series next year.PS I hope someone could organize a petition. The rating system should really include more important things such as world setting, theme, theme delivery etc. Who cares about animation...? and explore them.

In that regard it can only either achieve it or fail, but in between those two there is what we call mainstream (don’t mix it up with ordinary or average), and there have been very few installments that represent the niche as well as Druaga.Two things will remain constant in this review, first alphanumerical scorings will mean very little since we can only strictly classify an anime by its intrinsic values,...when we are either flaming an abysmal show, or praising another gorgeous one. And second, people that tend to strive by exaggerating problems instead of praising achievements and balancing mistakes will most likely disagree with me. But anyway, these people tend to make their minds on a subject before hitting the issue so their thoughts are biased from start, and no matter how long of a rant or praise I write I will never make them happy, and I wouldn’t be paying justice to Druaga with neither approaches.----------------------------------Story----------------------------------The strength of the story here doesn’t come from intricate plot or interesting twists, instead it have its strongest suit on the development, which is only a pretty way to say it is predictive and not as well explained as one would hope, but still manages to stand on its own legs and doesn’t let down. Some parts of the lore and the most part of the back stories of the characters are simply not explained at all, but since we are dealing with some pretty standard territory (fantasy, dragons, ghosts, magic, so far not vampires…) even if some plot holes are present, the omission of explanations actually helps what could very well turn out to be a dragged mess of unneeded monologues.The first episode is simply wonderful and kicks in with a really good pace that puts you into the mood to take whatever it might hold ahead, and actually manages to keep this feeling going for the majority of the time, only dropping the ball slightly by the end running away from its uniqueness’s to the more safe surroundings of your everyday shounen, complete with insane amounts of mainly screens and girly tears. It is aggravating but bearable since even in its worse moments it stays solid, and on the other rare occasions where it is simply bad, you always manage to find other redeeming factors on the scene, either it be the unusual and fresh homage to the source material spread throughout the series, or the humor that frequently comes off on the precise moments.That aside, one of the small touches I like the most is the fact that they strayed away from the usual “average high school boy” as a main protagonist, while still referring to that demographic trough the intro. It was a really smart move to make the plot feel a little bit fresher, while still ticking the pre-requirements to get founding for the show. If only they would stick to this kind of creativity throughout the whole thing, the story would’ve been much better, but I don’t like criticizing something based on my failed expectations so it’s a moot point.----------------------------------Art / Animation & Sound----------------------------------The static art is good, characters are vivid and well designed and the colors albeit a bit too bright for a dungeon environment are good, but as soon as motion occurs it is uneven at best. This doesn’t deserve to be dragged much longer, but I have to point out you will spot a few sequences of animation with  less frames then would be required to look good, luckily  those were not frequent enough to leave a bad impression of the otherwise competent art and animation direction. Just as the 2D counterpart, the CGI is well executed but animated unevenly. It was also not bad enough to become intrusive, but at this day and age we have come to expect more value per screen time then what is delivered here.Soundtrack is really subpar. It’s not technically at a fault and more often than not it fits the scene, but battles lack punch, drama lacks emotion and overall it lacks quality to make an impact worth noticing at any given moment. The intro selection is fitting for the unique choice but nothing else, and sound effects are not as bad as the rest, holding their own ground fairly well. Voice actors do a decent job, and at least during a few lines when both the plot and the soundtrack help they do a great one, but this is not common enough to worth praising on any specific role.Without taking into consideration the lack of vibe the sound department provides, the visuals are pleasing while never achieving moments of complete gloriousness (possible exception for the outtakes of the tower itself) and in fact the irregular nature of the art here, hurts more than simply the lack of quality which gladly is far less common.----------------------------------Characters----------------------------------Lasting impressions after the credits roll are usually a safe indication of how good characters are, but here this might not be failproof. This is because the development of the main characters is incomprehensible from time to time, and you might just as well get attached to someone just to find out later he became something else. This is a bit more subtle on the female cast but ridiculously evident with the main character, he goes from good-for-nothing to dependable to demigod and then back to screaming teenager without any trouble or rational explanation, and in the meanwhile people around him act as if he had a giant poster written “main character” floating above his head and this was only natural. Romance development and drama climax also suffer from this, and they never truly deliver due to lack of proper trailing.Side roles are not particularly flashed out here, and it is for good measure since the few attempts to bring them out shows how silly and underdeveloped they are, but with a main cast of roughly 10 characters we still get plenty meat on the bone with episodes focusing on specific characters and such. The main gripe thought is that there is no clear enemy, and instead they just go around facing random “evil” that pops up, most of them nameless, until they reach yet another boss that is not developed as a character at all. Instead of having opposing motivation, the enemies are just there to be slashed, and this gets old eventually even if it is yet another trait of the original material they derive from.Just as with the story, where at the same time it’s neither the main focus nor the outcast, the characters face a well rounded tour, going from spotlight to backstage in a blink of an eye. You never get too much or too little of them, and by the end the mileage gained is quite good. Though it could be a bit better if they would settle for either comic or dramatic mood with some plot developments, because with so many stories I felt it lacked time to fulfill both goals to the fullest. Rest assured, there isn’t many unlikeable characters to begin with and the side cast is pretty weak, but the main ones all have some redeeming traits and unless you try really hard to hate them, you will be able to get attached to them soon enough.----------------------------------Enjoyment & Value----------------------------------So, what makes a mainstream anime? Average sound, average music, average animation, average art… these are scrutinizing about subjects one anime belonging to this category don’t need, instead what characterize a mainstream anime is how well it manages to differentiate itself from the horde of similar ones, and how effectively the fun factor can avoid the hindering all the technical shortcomings might incidentally bring to the table, and taking all of this into consideration Druaga is a proud member of this group.With its dose of uniqueness both on visuals and direction it manages to remain with a fresh feeling during the entire show, and with somewhat likable characters and good pace, it also achieves a decent level of lasting impression. The technical aspects might not be as sharp as one could expect since the bar these days is set so extraordinarily high, but it also goes miles away from being simply ordinary or mediocre.Overall it is an easy recommendation for anyone that likes the genre, perhaps not a “no brainer” for anyone else, but it definitely delivers into all aspects one would expect while at the same time bringing a healthy dosage of extravagances. when we are either flaming an abysmal show, or praising another gorgeous one.

The story is about a rag tag group of people aiming to climb the Tower of Druaga and claim the glory that comes with reaching and defeating the demon, Druaga, at the top. Jil is our main character, a young kid who is deceptively strong and he is joined by other party members representing stereotypes from RPG games. By all accounts this series isn't perfect, it's a balancing act between serious story and comedy and it tries to hit...both, it can however be very serious at moments and very funny at moments. Whats great about this series is the unique quirks and twists it provides the viewer, from pop culture references reflecting RPG's and other similar adventure series', to representing different fandoms as well as recycling a very cliche story into something legitimately enjoyable.The story follows along Jil's adventure with his crew of 'climbers' as they progress through the levels of the tower and encounter beasts, personal battles and betrayals and along the way they keep a sort of episode by episode shift between comedy and serious story and character development. As you watch this series you never can tell what will happen in the next episode, your guess is usually as good as the characters but this is also a feather in Druaga's cap as it delivers on both front, though isn't quite good at mixing the two together.The characters were some of my favorites I've ever watched and one in particular left a bit of an impact on me and now resides in my list of favorite characters of all time. The shows episodes are told almost episodically and its only in a couple of episodes where moments from previous episodes are even brought up. That being said this series warms up to a fantastic end and second season which I almost instantaneously began watching.The art is enjoyable though not particularly awe inspiring and a bit of CG is used which isnt particularly exciting. The opening and closing songs are fantastic and are complimented by great alternative world style video clips (featuring the main characters as if they were ordinary people) though the background music in the show wast very pronounced.In all honesty I may have marked Druaga up a bit in the wake of watching this show but as I think more about it I want to stick by it. Think rationally this series earns an 8, but personally this show is one I will probably come back and watch with delight.First review complete! both, it can however be very serious at moments and very funny at moments.

You follow Jil as he tries to climb the Tower of Druaga to make a name for himself as a hero. Hes not your typical annoying male lead character and while he wants to save everyone as many leads do he comes across as believable and genuine. In fact all the characters are not your average band of cookie cutter party members and all have their own reasons for climbing the tower...and their own distinct personalities.The animation is of a good level throughout and while they may use some CG here and there such as the large army of Uruk it actually meshes pretty well and isn't your typical rubbish Gonzo CG. The show as a nice mix of comedy,storytelling and action so theres something for everybody. Most of the earlier episodes have a more lighthearted feel to them but at the same time foreshadowing something that isn't quite right with the legend of the tower. You will be surprised as the show reaches its last few episodes and not everything and everyone is as clear cut as they appear to be.The silliness in the earlier episodes may put you off in your looking for a dead serious fantasy story but you can rest assured that this show does actually go somewhere and more of the shows time is spend fleshing out both the character relationships and their motivation. We really don't learn too much about the characters past apart from Jil and Nebaa but they try to fit in some time here and there for a few of the supporting cast. Being only a 12 episode series i guess this cannot be avoided but they do a good enough job of it for me to care about all the party members.Anyone looking for a good fantasy RPG style show should definitely check this out. I was very surprised at how good the show turned out after the confusing first episode. Also you can join me into looking forward to a second season coming out sometime in 09. and their own distinct personalities.The animation is of a good level throughout and while they may use some CG here and there such as the large army of Uruk it actually meshes pretty well and isn't your typical rubbish Gonzo CG.

The first episode was hilarious and had so little; yet so much to do with what has later to come.Truly; it made me want to look at episode 2 with more heart and NEED of this Anime.However, the more the episodes went on, the more disappointing it'll become.I don't know what GONZO was trying to do; but a lot of stuff later in the series starts to get quite confusing and doesn't really add up to anything.I see this happen in a lot of Anime; they try to complicate their stories more by confusing the viewer....But the only thing they are doing is putting unnecessary effort into unnecessary scenes. If only they'd put in more thought to the story and followed up from where they started, it would've been better.However, it is what it is, so lets keep it that way.

The story was unpredictable; due to it being confusing. But the characters, not as much.The best part of this Anime is it's continual feel. At one point it is mystical and fantasy-based. At the other point it tends more towards action or drama. Some scenes really look like RPG's, while other scenes tend more towards a different type of action.All in all, the Tower of Druaga - The Aegis of Uruk, has a lot to offer.

I was never overwhelmingly surprised nor bored with the series, and enjoyed a marginally original take on a fantasy anime.Story follows young protagonist on an exceedingly standard quest for heroic glory. Along the way we meet a few few extra party members next to a few standard entries; none too tired to be irksome or annoying if you're willing to roll with some standard fantasy fanfare. The series does actually make a point of being slightly lethal which does prevent it from falling into the vacuum of awful cliche.A...good series to watch over the course of a week that keeps things interesting enough to keep you wanting to see the end result.Particular note goes out to the opening for juxtaposing all the characters into a modern setting, which might have served as a great filler episode. good series to watch over the course of a week that keeps things interesting enough to keep you wanting to see the end result.Particular note goes out to the opening for juxtaposing all the characters into a modern setting, which might have served as a great filler episode."", ""Welcome to my candid review. This is an adventure anime with elements of fantasy and tinged roughly equally with moments of light humor and dark violence. The first episode focuses only on humor and is NOT like the remainder of the anime, which is actually much more serious.There isn't much complexity to this anime. It's fairly straightforward, blunt in its character design and writing, with standard-fare switch ups between serious and lighthearted episodes, young characters, as well as delivering a measured rather than ambitious plot, overall making it a simple anime that would fit kids well. The catch to this anime is that for all...its simple design, it has enough violence to coat it in mature tones as well.The anime is at a crossroad between many different styles. Due to its lack of specific style  it will probably deliver moments that you absolutely have no interest in, but other moments that will tug you along just enough to keep watching.It's a nice anime, nothing amazing. If you find yourself not liking it, don't force yourself to continue watching. Just note that the anime doesn't really settle in until after episode 3. its simple design, it has enough violence to coat it in mature tones as well.The anime is at a crossroad between many different styles.

There was always something hidden just out of reach or a new discovery about the characters that got you to connect with them more and more as the story played out. Most of all I liked the whole tale being told around a seemingly undependable, useless figure that acts so sure of himself but has absolutely no real goal for himself. It\'s always ""just keep going,"" but to actually have there be much more to him then he or anyone else can even tell. That type of plot development is...an old one but it never seems to get old. an old one but it never seems to get old.', ""Tower of Druaga is a wolf in sheep's clothing.

The narrative (discounting the dangerously misleading but brilliantly satirical first episode) starts out very light and often humorously, making for easy, pleasant watching in bulk when you're hungover or otherwise unable to cope with fast dialogue, complicated plots and frenetic action. For the amount of characters included they did a fair job of establishing them in this chunk and making all of them passable in their own ways. It's in the second half that things start to get more serious, with a...good amount of mysteries to be uncovered and some interesting turns that venture beyond the conventions of most aventure-fantasy stories.There are very basic things which drag this show down, however. While episodes 2-6 do manage to have a fun, adventurey feel and establish the characters, they're not complimented by much memorable humour, which I feel is something they could have done with. The second half sees more in the way of depth and seriousness, but it doesn't accompany this with any good action, with the rare battle sequences feeling unfortunately boring, and the drama involved wasn't all that poignant. The latter defect probably wasn't helped at all by what another reviewer rightfully pointed out as the very emotionless face-animation which detracts from both the humour of the lighter scenes and the intensity of the more dramatic ones. The soundtrack is pretty decent but it didn't really manage to 'make' any scenes like it can in other shows, partially as there weren't enough tracks to begin with. The universe of TToD itself is supposed to be fairly generic, so you can't expect any saving graces from there like you would be able to with, say, Log Horizon.All of this being said, I definitely like the way the storyline culminated in the last few episodes, setting us up for a conclusion of the adventure in Sword of URUK which I was quite eager to experience. TToD is no top tier must-watch anime, yet despite its defects it was an enjoyable watch and deserves its share of credit.5/10 good amount of mysteries to be uncovered and some interesting turns that venture beyond the conventions of most aventure-fantasy stories.There are very basic things which drag this show down, however.

Well, i was, surprised in some ways, disappointed in others. (Which describes most GONZO shows anyways.)Story - 6.5/10 (D)Well, it's about a young hero who wants to rid the world of the evil Druaga, at the top of the Tower of Druaga. Sounds cliche? It somewhat is, but the first episode might be a miss for most, because it's mostly a &quot;I had a really sweet dream&quot; episode. Though i did like the funny parts, definetly episode 5, with the whole RPG-look, sex changes and the Roper Dance...really made me laugh, in a good way. You can enjoy Druaga, though it does randomly change from plot-focused, to comedy relief each episode.Animation - 9.0/10 (A-)Well, at least Gonzo is rich, enough to make Tower of Druaga a great animation piece. I really enjoyed how they took every scene into great detail. Though the show was somewhat not plot-focused, it had top-quality animation for each episode.Sound - 7.8/10 (C+)Well, typical RPG-like background music wasn't at all worth remembering, though the &quot;Funny&quot; episodes tend to have more upbeat, cheery music. The opening &quot;Swirling&quot; really stunned me. For an RPG-based show like Druaga, &quot;Swirling&quot; felt more for a show like &quot;Katekyo HItman Reborn&quot; or &quot;Gintama&quot; maybe, but it was a hit for me. The Ending, &quot;Touchousha-tachi&quot; by KENN (Who's also Jil's voice actor, fyi.) is a good mix of feelings jam-packed into 1:30, pretty good stuff.Characters - 8.4/10 (B)A great ensemble for Druaga. We have the wannabe hero Jil, then we have his older brother Neeba, who in a way cares about him though (to me) he's just a plain mean older brother. We have Fatina: a ditzy, Paris Hilton clone who wants to get to the Tower to claim her &quot;reward&quot;, we have Kally: a stealthy individual with a keen sense of direction. Next is Jil's team: Kaaya, a charming young woman with a strange, unknown power who is drawn to Jil's bravery. Ahmey, the &quot;Clare&quot; of this show (Clare=Claymore) who fights to somehow talk to her dead love, through the means of the Blue Rod. We have Melt and Coopa (No, not the Mario-kind of Koopa): A Mage with a presigious background and a willing servant to him. They provide the most comedy-relief in the show. Overall, this is a good kind of cast for an RPG-based anime.Enjoyment - 8.2/10 (B-)I fairly enjoyed Druaga, with some complaints about story pacing and easy boss battles (the One-Winged Dragon for example) being too easy. If you have some spare time, Druaga shouldn't disappoint (For only 12 episodes). You'll laugh, scratch your head and cry during the short span of 12 episodes.Overall Averaged: 7.9/10 (C+) really made me laugh, in a good way.

As the name may imply this anime is based on the long running series of Druaga games by Namco. I have to say that while generally enjoyable anime based on video games is often pretty hit or miss. On the one hand you have awesome stuff like the Streetfighter movie and on the other hand you have stuff like Ragnarok - which wasnt as rubbish as people said, but it certainly wasnt awesome. This anime is certainly up there on the same level as the Streetfighter...movie.The animation in this is lovely looking and is enhanced even further by being in HD (I have to say Ive now got used to HD anime, I really like the crispness). But it\'s really the story and characters that form the appeal. The characters all feel ""real"", while there is no huge attempt at in-depth characterisation none of the characters presented feel two-dimensional; which can be a problem with genre pieces of this nature.As well as excellent animation and appealing characters this show also has an engaging storyline which draws the viewer in while providing an excellent mix of action and comedy with the odd bit of drama thrown in for good measure.

The capital lies under a big tower , where the strongest enemy , Druaga , lives  . The king of Uruk , Gilgamesh , is a legendary hero who defeated Druaga 80 years ago . But for some reason Druaga is back to life and someone has to kill him again. For that...reason many fighters, called Climbers, are gathering in the capital and are waiting for the ""Summer of Anu"" , because the monsters get weaker , to start climbing the tower and reach the top floor, where Druaga lives (and of  course, our main characters are also climbers).

The summer has finally come and each party has started their journey to the top floor .....The main and supporting characters are divided into different parties and each one of them has their own reason for joining the party . Through the series , parts of the main and supporting characters lives (and their reason for joining the parties) will be revealed , but some of them will be left unveiled.Jil, the main character , is an inexperienced adventurer  , who joined the party to help Kaaya in her goal to get the blue Crystal Rod in order to ""cure her brother"" (of course that\'s a lie), but also to kill Drauga and save the people from the monsters .Kaaya, on the other hand , is a mysterious person , who doesn\'t want to reveal things from her past and has a hidden goal from which no one in her party knows.One more interesting character is Neeba . He\'s the older brother of Jill , but they are not in good relationship . He even fired Jill from his party. He, like Kaaya, has a hidden goal , and it\'ll play a vital role in the last fight against Druaga.

He teams up with other ""climbers, all with different goals, and heads to the top, racing against other...teams of climbers, facing many dangers and meeting many people. Throughout the story we\'re shown hints that there is some hidden plot working behind the scenes as well. Still there\'s a bucket full of plot holes and annoyances through the series that can be quite glaring at some points. The characters are a cast filled with some of the usual tropes and e few rarer, with different short backstories. The characters are enjoyable enough, but doesn\'t go far beyond that.Art & Sound: The art is not the best, but it isn\'t bad either, and manages to make things look interesting enough, without going above and beyond. The sound are ok.Overall: I enjoyed the show, but it\'s not among my favorites. It has a lot of problems, but still remains better than many newer shows, having a personality of it\'s own.Enjoy! teams of climbers, facing many dangers and meeting many people.

The best way to describe this is by describing it as a more harsh version of Konosuba.  This is not a isekai  but the comedy and characters and very similar to it.  Why do I say harsh, well in the moments it makes you laugh it brings you down and rather that is a mistake or not is you decision.  After a serious moments it start cracking jokes after watching many today's moody anime I can give it a pass.  The characters are wonderful, their design are questionable they look like children when...are teenagers almost adults.  You do fall in love with almost every character here even with ones you hate you like.  There will be moments every character will make you laugh at least once.   The story is great feels original even after all these years.  The pace is indeed slow, slower than konosuba but faster than other anime. The sound is awful I usually never complain the sound but it was hard to understand what they were saying.  I did enjoy i first saw this in 2010 i rewatch it because it was not mark that i watch it i am glad i did. are teenagers almost adults.

At this point, this anime was very promising, at last something new, something cliché-breaking.But it betrays you. The longer I watched, the more evident it became that despite the prelude, this really is just one of those fantasy shounens that you can find on every corner.Boring story if there is any,...one-trait characters, no character development, undetailed world.But in one aspect, this anime is worse than your run-off-the-mill fantasy:The characters are not only stereotypical, but most of them are unbelievably, utterly stupid, so much that it is irritating. Others want to convince you that they have some kind of personality, some kind of purpose, but they don\'t. The rest are just pure evil, because something something dark side - you won\'t get to know really.The same goes for the second season, just even more so.It\'s a pity. one-trait characters, no character development, undetailed world.But in one aspect, this anime is worse than your run-off-the-mill fantasy:The characters are not only stereotypical, but most of them are unbelievably, utterly stupid, so much that it is irritating.

Ensemble Stars!! Road to Show!!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/50414/Ensemble_Stars_Road_to_Show,"[""To be honest, I have been playing EnStars since 2016 but since the !! update, I kinda dropped it because I dislike the new universe and preferred Yumenosaki so when I saw that the movie was focusing on Square, I was a little disapointed.But, I was really happy to see EnStars come back as an anime and the movie overall was good. The characters apparing in this movie aren't even my favorites but, if it's your case too, know that others characters do appear as cameos. Rei and the others are going to a movie awards show, and during that show, clips from different movies...that are talked about in the game's events are animated as Midnight Butlers for exemple. I was happy to get to see others boys animated too even if it is short clips.Instead of a movie focusing on post Yumenosaki, I personally would have preferred a direct sequel to the original anime featuring different events to highlight all the characters, there are tons of events that could be animated and that would allow an equal focus on each characters and groups but I imagine that the choice to focus on Square is also to highlight characters like Aira, Kohaku or Mayoi and also to promote the current EnStars!!, I can see why they did that.I must admit that the choice of New York for a trip seems a bit cliché because it's not the first time that we see characters go to America during a movie but in the end, the choice of the country doesn't have much impact knowing that all the American characters in this film speak perfect Japanese, it's a shame not to have tried to make scenes in English for more realism.Finally, I find that the villain of the movie was a bit too predictable, as soon as I saw him on screen, I knew it was him and also I admit I had trouble understanding his motivations.I don't have much more to say, the movie is cool and I enjoyed it, I hope that in the future we will get to see more animated EnStars again and this time with different characters. that are talked about in the game's events are animated as Midnight Butlers for exemple.

Flag,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1299/Flag,"[""Flag is a pretty unique venture.  It's researched reasonably well, and is set in our world.  The world with the laws of physics and politics.  More interesting than the reality-based content though, is the form.  This show is set entirely within the eye of the camera.When we're not watching the narrative through a lens; we're seeing photos or computer displays.  There is no scene set outside of the camera, and that in itself is a bold creative choice, although it is stretched very thin, in that we have to assume these people are such camera junkies they take them everywhere...and never turn them off, no matter what they're doing or where they are.  It's a bit too much to accept, but the directorial concept is so cool that you just shrug off any unrealistic scenarios and run with it.The story follows the main protagonist, and her friend's reflections of her actions at the same time.  The pacing between their stories as a result is well balanced, as just when one avenue of narrative is reaching its end or becoming stale, another picks up the slack.  The story's focus on the UN's 'peacekeeping' of a war-torn country is more developed than it has any right to be.  We see bureaucracy, politicking, soldiers dealing with killing, and more importantly the feelings of photographers capturing war and their place in it all.  I don’t think this anime raises anything more powerful than the case of Kevin Carter's infamous photo in Sudan, but it does try.The animation for the show is very well done, it always looks good and the whips and pans from the camera P.O.V are very smooth and natural-looking.  But this anime is a sad case of so much effort put into research and attention to detail that they forgot about the importance of narrative.  But more about that below.Flag always runs the risk of wallowing in self-importance; the music being a major fault here.  Full of bombastic cinematic score in the vein of Lisa Gerrard, with Middle-Eastern lady wailing in pain, it's all very trite.  Just like the majority of photos.  Yeah, for a show revolving around photography, having it populated by generic and clichéd-as-hell photos really doesn’t do it any favours.  You've seen them all before: soldiers and kids, animals and destruction, and you could say that the anime is just using the clichés of the medium to tell its own story, to give it context, but cliché is cliché, unless you're commenting on the cliché itself, then just don’t use it.  There are some photos that are good though, mainly the infamous photo the entire show is about.Ultimately though, is this show entertaining?  Does it maintain your interest?  Does it captivate you?  It didn’t for me.  Maybe others will love it, but I have to admit I was bored a lot of the time by the constant 3D maps of digital terrain and preparation for military assaults.  Hardly what I call entertaining.  Michael Mann's The Insider is about a tobacco whistleblower; there's a lot of talking and meetings in that film, but it’s engrossing, you're on the edge of your seat; you're captivated by what's happening to the characters.  In Flag there's a whole bunch of talking and meetings but the narrative is like an afterthought, it’s like the script has been fitted around the concept, instead of the concept decorating the script.  There's no drive, no momentum, even though the first half is building up to an assault, there's no sense of urgency, not when every scene transition is via a computer desktop mouse cursor clicking on random files. (which gets old very quickly)If the anime's purpose was to be like a documentary, it fails even more, as this isn’t a documentary about anything actually occurring in the real world.  We have a quasi-Tibetan like scenario here, but its all fiction.  If the anime-makers were bold enough to actually focus on a real event, Iraq, Afghanistan, take your pick, and provide their own view on it, then I would find it engaging, but otherwise the anime takes the safe route and doesn’t stick its neck out on anything.  Just universal themes of war and media, which isn’t bad of itself, but when it consists mostly of dry lifeless dialogue and 3D maps, it’s hard to find anything compelling to latch on to.There's only one moment where all the aspects of this show come together and work properly, and it’s very late in the series in the 12th episode where a conflict is being filmed by the main two characters, and it feels alive, full of purpose and direction, emotion and drama.No matter the faults of the show, it’s different and I always applaud that.  There is the chance that it will inspire kids and teens to pick up a camera and find a career out of it.  A shame the brilliant animation was wasted on a muddled tale with no backbone. and never turn them off, no matter what they're doing or where they are.

A shame the brilliant animation was wasted on a muddled tale with no backbone."", ""To us foreigners, it perhaps can't get any more Japanese than Flag: in essence, this series is about two Japanese and their cameras.Set in the near future, in a fictional nation that very strongly looks as if it should be positioned on the India-China border, somewhere in the Kashmir region, Flag recounts the story of the civil conflict that crippled said nation and of the UN sponsored peace talks following a photograph (containing the Flag the series is named after) that became a powerful symbol of cooperation between the parties involved. It follows the photographer of said photo, who is officially installed as reporter of...a special UN strike force created to recapture the flag in question after it was stolen by insurgents in order to damage the peace talks, while at the same time following that photographer's mentor, who has arrived as a journalist in the fictional nation's capital.The story remains firmly focused on what the main characters, the two photographers, see, one at the UN strike force base, and one mostly in a bar in the capital. In fact, what we get to see is mostly what they see through the lenses of their cameras.This should be taken quite literally. Almost every shot is as if viewed through the lens of a camera, meaning that what we get to see is what is shown to the camera's front. Both reporters showcase the life that goes on around them. The female reporter attached to the UN base films the goings-on with the crew, takes shots of the landscape from a helicopter, and is witness to a few battles. Her mentor in the capital shows how people live their lifes in the uneasy cease-fire, showcasing often their religious believes, and taking not a few shots of the journalistic community that preys on new scoops. Though there is some action to be seen, and quite nicely done at that, Flag focuses as much on showing the lifes of the different groups of people in the fictional nation, and on interviewing people about their believes concering all that is going on.And what it shows, it shows very nicely indeed. Flag is, without a doubt, endowed with very good graphics. While the scenes themselves are crisp and especially the equipment looks very good (this is one of very few shows where a bit of 3D doesn't hurt, especially when employed on the military materiel), this quality is mostly apparent in design. For one, all the different cameras through which the series is viewed show different images: some images are more grainy than others, some show heat-vision, some even are in black and white. What they show is mostly quite well researched, as it is apparent that a lot of time and effort has gone into making the military materiel, surroundings of the cities, general apparel, and even the fictional OS showcased on computer screens look realistic (in the sense that it could be real, not that it is). Moreover, the series clearly differentiates between ethnicities, again opting for a somewhat realistic look, even if faces in particular are not very detailed. The result is that persons are highly recognisable, sometimes even delightfully so: especially the main female reporter, Shirasu, is utterly, and charmingly, Japanese in looks as well as actions and phrasing.Characters are generally outlined in pretty broad strokes, each occupying their very own niche within the characterisation spectrum. This becomes readily apparent in the quicker interviews with the UN strike force personnel in the earlier episodes. It is not a let-down, though, as Flag uses most of these characters, not very well developed in more than a few aspects, mostly to portray different views or opinions on a situation. To ask more for a plethora of characters would not only mean having to use far more time, but would also mean that the effect of having each person only appear as portrayed through a camera lens within specific situations would be destroyed. In fact, quite a few characters are memorable even though they aren't very well developed: often it is enough to see them smiling to the camera and voicing their beliefs very strongly.Considering voicing, voice acting also is generally very well done, as a lot of effort is made to use just the slightest touch of accent without ridiculing. Also, the 'natives' are consistently speaking their own language (I think I can recognise Tibeto-Burman roots, though this might be effected by the surroundings; I'd be very happy if anyone could actually understand or name the language and mention it to me). On a less positive note, the music in general aims towards the dramatical. Though, personally, I like this Hollywoodesque touch in a series such as these, I readily acknowledge that it is somewhat over-the-top and can be off-putting, or even be enough to raise a scene from the somewhat dramatic into the pompous and self-important, thus effectively destroying the effect aimed for.All in all, I was somewhat impressed with how the story was handled, both graphically and epistemologically (as concerns the cameramen). It looks good and sounds fine, and is simply quite interesting to watch, both design-wise and not so much story-wise as concept-wise. This was only the less difficult part of reviewing Flag, however. The far more tricky question is what this series is or aims to be. As has been commented upon, almost all scenes are portrayed as if viewed through a camera lens or some equivalent thereof. This has two results that are almost antithetical. On the one hand, many scenes, especially those viewed from the on-board camera of armoured vehicles when in action, can be described as, for lack of a better word, intense: the first person view seems intended to throw the viewer in the midst of the situation.On the other hand it seems, and I feel very strongly that this is the case, that the use of looking at the portrayed situations through a lens creates a sense of distance. The very literal spectator's role you are taking distances you from the situation. The fact that all scenes are introduced by the opening of a file containing the piece of film in question on a computer screen indicates that you are looking at a record that stands further from you in time. This suggestion is strengthened by the jumps in time and place when a film snippet ends and another piece is opened, as well as in jumps in intensity, quite often having the newly started piece of film have a different pacing than the preceding. Moreover, the few scenes which are not portrayed as if viewed through a lens are deliberately grainy or even blurry, to indicate that you are still viewing a piece of film or looking at a photograph.It is visible that the makers have gone to great lengths to create this distance. While this may have been done for its own sake, a move to show a type of anime series different from others, perhaps one is allowed to search a bit for further reasons.One of the main effects of this distance is that it gives the impression of impartiality: the camera records whatever is going on, regardless of who is doing or saying something or of what is done or said. Switching between the cameras of a multiple reporters and other persons gives the series the chance to display multiple takes on the same situation. As in a documentary format, most people speak directly into the camera, giving their personal views, while the recorder in the main stays quiet. Quite a few times, when said reporter is reacting or expressing his or her views, the view switches to another camera, thus once more distancing what is said from who records.Having the main story involve a military conflict in which the UN gets involved, and focusing on the issues of the justifiability of said involvement and actions taken during its course, and on the role of the media in such situations, is, of course, not the pinnacle of innovation. Many pieces of film (though not animated film, as far as I know) show a reporter's view on war, official intervention, the reaction of the media, and, of course, official censure, often in a documentary format. However, it is quite seldom that what is seen is portrayed through more cameras than one, and is thus portrayed, quite literally, from different angles.This might be the main difference between the method of 'filming' that makes up Flag and a documentary, which is usually directed from one perspective. It does not seem as if Flag wants to convey a message: it seems as if it wants to stay neutral, and it does play it safe. It has been noted in another review on this site that it would have been more bold if Flag would have portrayed an actual conflict, and though it might be bold, I don't believe if would have been for the better. By keeping the setting, and thus the story, fictional, Flag can maintain a more or less neutral disposition. If a real situation would have been portrayed, there would have been no room for errors of research or animation without it being possibly considered a view on the situation. Quotations and portrayals of actual persons would of necessity be selective, which may very well lead to misrepresentation. The very choice of what to portray within the frame of time would immediately convey a certain bias - which is the major fault of most, if not all, real-life documentaries. The above goes for a fictional situation as well, but at least it would prove impossible to find any true misrepresentations or factual errors, thus maintaining at least the illusion of factuality and impartiality.I get the impression the makers were aiming at quite simply showing a situation through the eyes of the camera, focusing on the act of recording and the presence of the recorder and keeping, as much as possible, the portrayed situation itself value-free. If this were to be indeed the case, I'd say they managed to do this to quite a decent degree.What this means, in the end, is that I got the impression that we should view this series as it is presented: as a collection of footage. That is to say, I think, and I actually hope that this is what the makers intended, that we should take every scene at face value. What the manifold cameras shoot is just what it seems to be: films and photographs. Therefore, we should not be surprised that we get to see a lot of different scenes, and, within those scenes, a lot of different opinions, voiced by different people speaking from different positions in the conflict that forms the background story. If anything is meant to be conveyed through this series, I'd say it is wonderfully portrayed in the final episode, when in the background, in a nearly deserted bar, a singer seems to sing with all her heart put into it, regardless of whether many people have come to listen: Flag is about the photographer and his love for his art. a special UN strike force created to recapture the flag in question after it was stolen by insurgents in order to damage the peace talks, while at the same time following that photographer's mentor, who has arrived as a journalist in the fictional nation's capital.The story remains firmly focused on what the main characters, the two photographers, see, one at the UN strike force base, and one mostly in a bar in the capital. In fact, what we get to see is mostly what they see through the lenses of their cameras.This should be taken quite literally. Almost every shot is as if viewed through the lens of a camera, meaning that what we get to see is what is shown to the camera's front. Both reporters showcase the life that goes on around them. The female reporter attached to the UN base films the goings-on with the crew, takes shots of the landscape from a helicopter, and is witness to a few battles. Her mentor in the capital shows how people live their lifes in the uneasy cease-fire, showcasing often their religious believes, and taking not a few shots of the journalistic community that preys on new scoops. Though there is some action to be seen, and quite nicely done at that, Flag focuses as much on showing the lifes of the different groups of people in the fictional nation, and on interviewing people about their believes concering all that is going on.And what it shows, it shows very nicely indeed. Flag is, without a doubt, endowed with very good graphics. While the scenes themselves are crisp and especially the equipment looks very good (this is one of very few shows where a bit of 3D doesn't hurt, especially when employed on the military materiel), this quality is mostly apparent in design. For one, all the different cameras through which the series is viewed show different images: some images are more grainy than others, some show heat-vision, some even are in black and white. What they show is mostly quite well researched, as it is apparent that a lot of time and effort has gone into making the military materiel, surroundings of the cities, general apparel, and even the fictional OS showcased on computer screens look realistic (in the sense that it could be real, not that it is). Moreover, the series clearly differentiates between ethnicities, again opting for a somewhat realistic look, even if faces in particular are not very detailed. The result is that persons are highly recognisable, sometimes even delightfully so: especially the main female reporter, Shirasu, is utterly, and charmingly, Japanese in looks as well as actions and phrasing.Characters are generally outlined in pretty broad strokes, each occupying their very own niche within the characterisation spectrum. This becomes readily apparent in the quicker interviews with the UN strike force personnel in the earlier episodes. It is not a let-down, though, as Flag uses most of these characters, not very well developed in more than a few aspects, mostly to portray different views or opinions on a situation. To ask more for a plethora of characters would not only mean having to use far more time, but would also mean that the effect of having each person only appear as portrayed through a camera lens within specific situations would be destroyed. In fact, quite a few characters are memorable even though they aren't very well developed: often it is enough to see them smiling to the camera and voicing their beliefs very strongly.Considering voicing, voice acting also is generally very well done, as a lot of effort is made to use just the slightest touch of accent without ridiculing. Also, the 'natives' are consistently speaking their own language (I think I can recognise Tibeto-Burman roots, though this might be effected by the surroundings; I'd be very happy if anyone could actually understand or name the language and mention it to me). On a less positive note, the music in general aims towards the dramatical. Though, personally, I like this Hollywoodesque touch in a series such as these, I readily acknowledge that it is somewhat over-the-top and can be off-putting, or even be enough to raise a scene from the somewhat dramatic into the pompous and self-important, thus effectively destroying the effect aimed for.All in all, I was somewhat impressed with how the story was handled, both graphically and epistemologically (as concerns the cameramen). It looks good and sounds fine, and is simply quite interesting to watch, both design-wise and not so much story-wise as concept-wise. This was only the less difficult part of reviewing Flag, however. The far more tricky question is what this series is or aims to be. As has been commented upon, almost all scenes are portrayed as if viewed through a camera lens or some equivalent thereof. This has two results that are almost antithetical. On the one hand, many scenes, especially those viewed from the on-board camera of armoured vehicles when in action, can be described as, for lack of a better word, intense: the first person view seems intended to throw the viewer in the midst of the situation.On the other hand it seems, and I feel very strongly that this is the case, that the use of looking at the portrayed situations through a lens creates a sense of distance.

With just one image, our attention can be purchased back from the chaotic shuffling of everyday life. Something that could temporarily snap us out of our daily stupor; our focus readjusted. It could be something simple that resonates with us on a personal level or perhaps a quick glimpse into a truth that we abandon simply out of its inconvenience to our day-to-day lives. Confined within its framed border, a picture could tell a tale, capture an emotion, embody the essence of the period it was taken. It could be all that\'s needed to encapsulate a fleeting moment in time, preserving it for posterity, where it can live on in the memory of the next pair of eyes to gaze upon it. Whether on celluloid or pixelated, what matters, in the end, is its ability to grab the viewer\'s attention. And perhaps no better example of that are moments captured amidst human conflict.For at the heart of the matter lies a common understanding that we can all share. Something that supersedes religion, race, ethnicity or any sociopolitical borders set in place to keep us apart. Through it all, the right image has the power to stir up an emotional response that takes far more than words to express. They become calling cards for truths. A way of giving tangible form to nebulous ideas. It’s for that reason that we continue to rely on them. Their ability to speak to us is timeless, even if the world around it continues to march forward.And when it all boils down to it, it’s this rare phenomenon, this occurrence, that Flag attempts to capture. But perhaps more important than that is the way in which it goes about obtaining it. A way that’s surprisingly underutilized, both in its presentation decisions and subject matter.Documenting the civil war of a fictional country named Uddiyana, the show centers around a mission to retrieve a flag that’s become a symbol of peace, not only for the country’s residence but also the international community at large, after a photo was taken of it that immortalized its status as such. And while this retrieval mission is carried out by a small military unit in accompaniment with the same photographer responsible for giving the flag its fame—being brought onboard to help chronicle the mission’s success; the bigger truth for the mission’s significance gets unearthed in the process, as the agenda of all sides involved in the conflict—both domestically and on an international stage—slowly makes itself known to the people involved. What had started off as a straightforward mission for an idealistic cause was effectively turned into a labyrinth maze of political shuffleboarding. A maze that our characters find themselves becoming involuntary pawns in, as it slowly divulges into an elaborate zero-sum game.By using the framework of this image phenomenon as its central premise, Flag crafts a narrative around a point of view that\'s usually gone unaccounted for, yet plays the most vital role in the reason these powerful photographs come into existence, in the first place. Here, we follow the brave men and women that are constantly seeking out the fringe to capture that perfect shot; the kind of picture that finds its place in the pages of historical texts. Whether the journalists in question are using this as a means of income or have a genuine desire to reveal the truth, Flag uses this kind of occurrence as an opportunity to view concepts far less vague than the sentimentality behind what they come to represent. A tale that takes on broad implications, yet, surprisingly enough, remains intimate. A type of intimacy that can only be birthed from the cold cynicism of politics once we discuss the presentation being used to contain it all.What should be understood right up front is that the intended countries being emulated to create this fictional land is of little relevance, as the real importance here is how it will come to represent attributes of everyday conflict seen whenever bigger governing bodies meddle in the domestic dispute of smaller nations. Flag slowly unveils all the chess pieces involved by situating its focus with people who find themselves being designated as the middlemen of public awareness and what occurs at ground zero.To traverse this story, we follow Saeko Shirasu, a young photojournalist whom, unlike her peers, isn\'t interested in publicizing truths of some country’s conflict, but instead, uses this opportunity as a chance to carve out a purpose for herself through the photos she takes. Despite gaining recognition amongst her colleagues and media outlets for the famous image she captured regarding the civil war, there’s far more fueling her to undergo the mission to help retrieve the flag than anything described as “noble.” For Saeko, this is a task meant to help her find who she truly is. In many ways, the story is every bit about Saeko as it is about the political climate she finds herself navigating across. Something that the show wastes no time in establishing with what’s arguably its biggest draw.The anime shows everything in a POV (point of view) perspective. Well, to be more accurate, all the events are documented through recording devices located throughout the series. Diary vlog entries made by Saeko herself, the accumulated recordings of her handheld camera. Photographs and video recordings taken from other colleagues, footage gathered from implanted security cameras located in military vehicles and buildings. News coverage broadcasted over the airwaves and amateur videos taken within the city. Every method of data capturing is account for, each going towards creating the ""bigger picture""; Flag changes how we perceive this world by turning it into instances stockpiled and fine-tuned through our very own viewfinder. Our method of seeing this world becomes a ""lens"" within itself. There’s no cheating with elaborate aerial shots intended to enhance the action. Nor are there moments that make you question “Who’s filming this right now?” No, the creative minds behind this series treat their subject matter with respect, never giving into the temptation of excessive theatrics to heighten its drama. If it can’t be realistically captured, it does not get occupied space in this screenplay. This is what grants the show that coveted intimacy that many other creators would kill for. That feeling of isolation and immersion with the people we follow. The viewer isn’t granted a chance to become omnipresent, to shift through scene transitions or have everything laid at their feet through verbal narration. The only knowledge we acquire comes from events we see happen at real-time with the people we follow or come in the form of visual archives stored by multimedia devices that are offered to us to dissect whatever we will from it.By doing this, the show can keep everything up close and personal, something that’s made all the more impressive given the all-encompassing nature of the civil war set on center-stage.POV shots in storytelling isn’t a novel idea, but despite that, the way Flag goes about repurposing it to tell its story feels entirely fresh. This is something that could be attributed to the obsessive nature of Ryosuke Takahashi, one of the anime industry’s most overlooked auteurs. A man whose insistence for detail and distinct vision of warfare can be seen from his more commercial works (Blue Gender / Armored Trooper Votoms), to his pet projects (Gasaraki / Panzer World Galient). There’s always a general sense that the functionality of his works is something he keeps to the forefront of his mind whenever he’s constructing it. Nothing just happens for the sake of creating a great moment. Instead, great moments are created because what is happening onscreen doesn’t feel that far-off from whatever future-reality it might be channeling. And it’s this commitment towards plausibility that makes following Saeko and the military unit she partnered up with feel every bit as real as any journalist special that may be found time-slotted in CNN’s regular broadcastings.There’s an understated cinematic fervor to the way the camera locks in its characters in this tumultuous experience. It has the biting grit of a TV series commissioned in the same stylistic vision of Oscar winners like Syriana, Black Hawk Down or The Last King of Scotland. This is seen with the key mechanics of the characters, as we track their involvement within the story. The way events play out in the absence of our protagonist’s view of it. The grainy shot of surveillance footage that’s juxtaposed to the crisp rendering of an expensive handheld camera. Camera panning that continually leaves the audience anticipating what will be shown next. These things that might be interpreted as minor flourishings to the untrained eye is ultimately the secret ingredient that helps this anime piece together a cinematic blueprint of its own. Giving a “bigger than the frame can contain” feeling to everything presented. A kind of cinematic engulfment that gives a feeling of involvement to everyone, even those living on the outskirts of the events taking place. It’s a show that offers a platform for those directly caught up in the conflict as well as the civilian bystanders that simply wish to maintain their way of life.It doesn\'t just stop at seeing life through the lens but follows the men and women that directly and indirectly help in orchestrating the type of environment that will give birth to the kind of photographs our protagonist just so happen to capture. An idea in documenting what goes towards the photo’s origins, both for the viewer and in this rare case, the taker of the image, creating with it a new way of soul-searching that comes as a direct result of these two worlds intermixing.All of which starts off with the famous image that carries the narrative from its beginning to its inevitable end. An image that is every bit as iconic as any real-life examples I’ve given at the beginning of this review:A blue flag waves across the sunburnt landscape of this far-off country, as the armed resistance of the people raise their hands and weapons in triumph. War-torn pieces of their homeland are left ravaged by a domestic dispute. Ancient Greco-Roman pillars of a forgotten time positioned firmly in the ground, as light cascades through its columns. The silhouette of women praying amidst this small celebration, forever immortalized with their figures embedded in the sunlight and the iconic fabric in mid-wave.It’s a powerful photo that manages to invoke both the strength of the people united and the hopes they have for peace going forward.A photograph that will go on to become the calling card of the people, as well as a political asset for those operating with hidden agendas. Pretenses are forged behind it to justify political subterfuge, and while talks of peace are held in the open with smiling faces, bureaucrats and fanatics alike are busy thumbing away at the chance to set their plans into motion, as they masquerade behind falsehoods conjured up to win the trust of the people.But where other shows would treat this as an opportunity to take a stab at the political system at large, here, it doesn\'t chastise the men and women of the army that fight blindly to the political agenda of those in charge. Nor does it make it its intent to oversell the ugliness of these high-ranking figures\' actions. Instead, Flag chooses to stand at the wayside, taking in all facets of the ongoing conflict and designating the characters in it as mere vehicles to see how each person chooses to deal with the situation at large. This gives us an angle that’s rarely explored in stories... well, at least never in this exact light.In most forms of storytelling media, reporters and journalists are usually just there to fill in the role of expository footnotes to the audience. Very rarely do these shows stop to get these people’s perspective, let alone follow them for the duration of its story, which is fascinating in and of itself when you stop to think about it. Here are people whose job it is to project a decorum of professionalism regardless of personal bias or situation. An act that’s all the more alarming when you get behind the lens, where the ones that capture random acts of violence towards others don’t even intervene, and in fact, are encouraged not to. People responsible for bringing humanity closest to the truth yet never get involved in it. A level of emotional withdrawal not only from oneself but humanity as a whole, yet at the same time, it’s these very same people that are expected to practice transparency once the greater powers at be decided what angle they will choose to approach the entire situation with.And for a young woman who is still piecing together who exactly she is in this big, crazy world, that kind of responsibility–no–that kind of willingness to participate must take a mental toll on her, whether she’s fully aware of it or not. She may appear cheerful, flashing a smile to all those gathered around her, but when no one\'s around, we see the full picture. We see the pensive expression of someone searching for answers and only finding more questions. And it’s this very mental battle of uncertainty that’s captured with pinpoint accuracy as she literally and figuratively look in the mirror, snapping a photo of herself, yet unable to recognize the person looking back in the cold, unfeeling reflection.It’s powerful moments like these that truly elevate Flag to a place beyond boilerplate fiction. Here, this title manages to obtain sticky instances of pathos that finds itself slowly taking ahold of you the more you let the content settle in. And personally, for me, it’s these kinds of moments that keep me constantly returning to the anime medium. It’s one thing to give birth to this phenomenon with real-life actors and actresses in a live-action feature, but it’s a complete other when the already thin membrane of suspension of disbelief for watching an animated title still manages to dupe the audience into forgetting that realization. By effectively obtaining that same level of human intimacy, despite the fact that it’s animated—even if the illusion only happens for a split second—Flag proves that there’s more here than merely mimicking documentary-style storytelling. And this is something the show manages to do on more than one occasion, crossing this threshold into realism effortlessly. This makes it a feature deserving of far more appraisal than its meager existence as a mecha variant to the higher-budget alternatives. With everything considered, Flag is one of the medium’s more realistic utilization of mecha, politics, and human conflict in a not-too-far-off future, and it’s high-time it gets the proper recognition for that.Admittedly, the show has its faults. Like anything else made around a specific time, what may once have been considered suitable, or in some cases, expected for certain features, can later run the risk of being viewed as an antiquated element, even going as far as being scorned in retrospect. And in the case of Flag, that aspect was easily its musical selection. Taken as a whole, the soundtrack of Flag demonstrates its fair share of musical highlights, but equally so, a noticeable number of pitfalls for those well-versed in warfare-focused stories. The opening song, to put it lightly, is very clichéd, and stands as a microcosm of the problems that occasionally show up in the soundtrack itself. The over-emphasized yodeling of a middle-eastern woman accompanied by grand orchestral gestures and tribal drum renditions, at this point in the world of storytelling, has been done ad nauseam in war movies and TV series alike. It’s the equivalency to every depiction of High School containing the popular girl with her two lesser-attractive sidekicks cat walking down the hallway as the main protagonist looks on in admiration. A kind of cliché that runs the risk of parody for anyone seriously thinking of incorporating it today without finesse.Thankfully, the intent behind these musical embellishments felt like it came from a place of earnestness and not a result of studio mandate. Anyone familiar with Takahashi’s directorial style or Yoshihiro Ike’s musical output would find it easy to forgive this treatment, and what I’m assuming would be the majority case, wouldn’t even have registered any of this as a problem at all. Given music’s subjectivity to the ear of the listener, this can simply be chalked up as a personal gripe derived from perceived oversaturation of a musical fallback for anything depicting a third world country.But regardless of this personal gripe, Flag has become a title I find myself wholeheartedly cherishing for everything it brought to the table. Not only does it stand as a unique entry for anime in general, but beyond that point, it stands as a pillar of legitimacy that naysayers unfairly attempt to rob from the medium. An animated emulation of real-world conflict can stir up an emotional response with the best of them. It can still stand for something bigger than itself. It can still drive its message home with the same level of poignancy. But most of all, it’s deserving of the same level of respect allotted to features that occupy the big screen. And for that, Flag is an anime that earns its keep as one of the medium’s best-hidden gems. they celebrate a momentous victory.These are all instances captured on film, images that could convey meaning, regardless of personal connection or circumstances.""A picture is worth a thousand words.""It\'s amazing what one snapshot can do.

Diary vlog entries made by Saeko herself, the accumulated recordings of her handheld camera. Photographs and video recordings taken from other colleagues, footage gathered from implanted security cameras located in military vehicles and buildings. News coverage broadcasted over the airwaves and amateur videos taken within the city. Every method of data capturing is account for, each going towards creating the ""bigger picture""; Flag changes how we perceive this world by turning it into instances stockpiled and fine-tuned through our very own viewfinder. Our method of seeing this world becomes a ""lens"" within itself. There’s no cheating with elaborate aerial shots intended to enhance the action. Nor are there moments that make you question “Who’s filming this right now?” No, the creative minds behind this series treat their subject matter with respect, never giving into the temptation of excessive theatrics to heighten its drama. If it can’t be realistically captured, it does not get occupied space in this screenplay. This is what grants the show that coveted intimacy that many other creators would kill for. That feeling of isolation and immersion with the people we follow. The viewer isn’t granted a chance to become omnipresent, to shift through scene transitions or have everything laid at their feet through verbal narration. The only knowledge we acquire comes from events we see happen at real-time with the people we follow or come in the form of visual archives stored by multimedia devices that are offered to us to dissect whatever we will from it.By doing this, the show can keep everything up close and personal, something that’s made all the more impressive given the all-encompassing nature of the civil war set on center-stage.POV shots in storytelling isn’t a novel idea, but despite that, the way Flag goes about repurposing it to tell its story feels entirely fresh. This is something that could be attributed to the obsessive nature of Ryosuke Takahashi, one of the anime industry’s most overlooked auteurs. A man whose insistence for detail and distinct vision of warfare can be seen from his more commercial works (Blue Gender / Armored Trooper Votoms), to his pet projects (Gasaraki / Panzer World Galient). There’s always a general sense that the functionality of his works is something he keeps to the forefront of his mind whenever he’s constructing it. Nothing just happens for the sake of creating a great moment. Instead, great moments are created because what is happening onscreen doesn’t feel that far-off from whatever future-reality it might be channeling. And it’s this commitment towards plausibility that makes following Saeko and the military unit she partnered up with feel every bit as real as any journalist special that may be found time-slotted in CNN’s regular broadcastings.There’s an understated cinematic fervor to the way the camera locks in its characters in this tumultuous experience. It has the biting grit of a TV series commissioned in the same stylistic vision of Oscar winners like Syriana, Black Hawk Down or The Last King of Scotland. This is seen with the key mechanics of the characters, as we track their involvement within the story. The way events play out in the absence of our protagonist’s view of it. The grainy shot of surveillance footage that’s juxtaposed to the crisp rendering of an expensive handheld camera. Camera panning that continually leaves the audience anticipating what will be shown next. These things that might be interpreted as minor flourishings to the untrained eye is ultimately the secret ingredient that helps this anime piece together a cinematic blueprint of its own. Giving a “bigger than the frame can contain” feeling to everything presented. A kind of cinematic engulfment that gives a feeling of involvement to everyone, even those living on the outskirts of the events taking place. It’s a show that offers a platform for those directly caught up in the conflict as well as the civilian bystanders that simply wish to maintain their way of life.It doesn\'t just stop at seeing life through the lens but follows the men and women that directly and indirectly help in orchestrating the type of environment that will give birth to the kind of photographs our protagonist just so happen to capture. An idea in documenting what goes towards the photo’s origins, both for the viewer and in this rare case, the taker of the image, creating with it a new way of soul-searching that comes as a direct result of these two worlds intermixing.All of which starts off with the famous image that carries the narrative from its beginning to its inevitable end. An image that is every bit as iconic as any real-life examples I’ve given at the beginning of this review:A blue flag waves across the sunburnt landscape of this far-off country, as the armed resistance of the people raise their hands and weapons in triumph. War-torn pieces of their homeland are left ravaged by a domestic dispute. Ancient Greco-Roman pillars of a forgotten time positioned firmly in the ground, as light cascades through its columns. The silhouette of women praying amidst this small celebration, forever immortalized with their figures embedded in the sunlight and the iconic fabric in mid-wave.It’s a powerful photo that manages to invoke both the strength of the people united and the hopes they have for peace going forward.A photograph that will go on to become the calling card of the people, as well as a political asset for those operating with hidden agendas. Pretenses are forged behind it to justify political subterfuge, and while talks of peace are held in the open with smiling faces, bureaucrats and fanatics alike are busy thumbing away at the chance to set their plans into motion, as they masquerade behind falsehoods conjured up to win the trust of the people.But where other shows would treat this as an opportunity to take a stab at the political system at large, here, it doesn\'t chastise the men and women of the army that fight blindly to the political agenda of those in charge. Nor does it make it its intent to oversell the ugliness of these high-ranking figures\' actions. Instead, Flag chooses to stand at the wayside, taking in all facets of the ongoing conflict and designating the characters in it as mere vehicles to see how each person chooses to deal with the situation at large. This gives us an angle that’s rarely explored in stories... well, at least never in this exact light.In most forms of storytelling media, reporters and journalists are usually just there to fill in the role of expository footnotes to the audience. Very rarely do these shows stop to get these people’s perspective, let alone follow them for the duration of its story, which is fascinating in and of itself when you stop to think about it. Here are people whose job it is to project a decorum of professionalism regardless of personal bias or situation. An act that’s all the more alarming when you get behind the lens, where the ones that capture random acts of violence towards others don’t even intervene, and in fact, are encouraged not to. People responsible for bringing humanity closest to the truth yet never get involved in it. A level of emotional withdrawal not only from oneself but humanity as a whole, yet at the same time, it’s these very same people that are expected to practice transparency once the greater powers at be decided what angle they will choose to approach the entire situation with.And for a young woman who is still piecing together who exactly she is in this big, crazy world, that kind of responsibility–no–that kind of willingness to participate must take a mental toll on her, whether she’s fully aware of it or not. She may appear cheerful, flashing a smile to all those gathered around her, but when no one\'s around, we see the full picture. We see the pensive expression of someone searching for answers and only finding more questions. And it’s this very mental battle of uncertainty that’s captured with pinpoint accuracy as she literally and figuratively look in the mirror, snapping a photo of herself, yet unable to recognize the person looking back in the cold, unfeeling reflection.It’s powerful moments like these that truly elevate Flag to a place beyond boilerplate fiction. Here, this title manages to obtain sticky instances of pathos that finds itself slowly taking ahold of you the more you let the content settle in. And personally, for me, it’s these kinds of moments that keep me constantly returning to the anime medium. It’s one thing to give birth to this phenomenon with real-life actors and actresses in a live-action feature, but it’s a complete other when the already thin membrane of suspension of disbelief for watching an animated title still manages to dupe the audience into forgetting that realization. By effectively obtaining that same level of human intimacy, despite the fact that it’s animated—even if the illusion only happens for a split second—Flag proves that there’s more here than merely mimicking documentary-style storytelling. And this is something the show manages to do on more than one occasion, crossing this threshold into realism effortlessly. This makes it a feature deserving of far more appraisal than its meager existence as a mecha variant to the higher-budget alternatives. With everything considered, Flag is one of the medium’s more realistic utilization of mecha, politics, and human conflict in a not-too-far-off future, and it’s high-time it gets the proper recognition for that.Admittedly, the show has its faults. Like anything else made around a specific time, what may once have been considered suitable, or in some cases, expected for certain features, can later run the risk of being viewed as an antiquated element, even going as far as being scorned in retrospect. And in the case of Flag, that aspect was easily its musical selection. Taken as a whole, the soundtrack of Flag demonstrates its fair share of musical highlights, but equally so, a noticeable number of pitfalls for those well-versed in warfare-focused stories. The opening song, to put it lightly, is very clichéd, and stands as a microcosm of the problems that occasionally show up in the soundtrack itself. The over-emphasized yodeling of a middle-eastern woman accompanied by grand orchestral gestures and tribal drum renditions, at this point in the world of storytelling, has been done ad nauseam in war movies and TV series alike. It’s the equivalency to every depiction of High School containing the popular girl with her two lesser-attractive sidekicks cat walking down the hallway as the main protagonist looks on in admiration. A kind of cliché that runs the risk of parody for anyone seriously thinking of incorporating it today without finesse.Thankfully, the intent behind these musical embellishments felt like it came from a place of earnestness and not a result of studio mandate. Anyone familiar with Takahashi’s directorial style or Yoshihiro Ike’s musical output would find it easy to forgive this treatment, and what I’m assuming would be the majority case, wouldn’t even have registered any of this as a problem at all. Given music’s subjectivity to the ear of the listener, this can simply be chalked up as a personal gripe derived from perceived oversaturation of a musical fallback for anything depicting a third world country.But regardless of this personal gripe, Flag has become a title I find myself wholeheartedly cherishing for everything it brought to the table. Not only does it stand as a unique entry for anime in general, but beyond that point, it stands as a pillar of legitimacy that naysayers unfairly attempt to rob from the medium. An animated emulation of real-world conflict can stir up an emotional response with the best of them. It can still stand for something bigger than itself. It can still drive its message home with the same level of poignancy. But most of all, it’s deserving of the same level of respect allotted to features that occupy the big screen. And for that, Flag is an anime that earns its keep as one of the medium’s best-hidden gems.', ""There's this old saying: “You can't polish a turd.” Someone (probably a grandparent; it's hard to beat cranky old people in the “brutal honesty” department) relayed that valuable piece of information to me at some point in my young life, and I've found it to be a crude but immutable truth, in art and fiction as much as in anything else. The best way I can describe Flag is to say that it's a great example of attempted turd polishing. It boasts a unique visual presentation and some downright incredible animation, but at the end of the day a weak narrative, poor cast, and muddled...themes stick out from it like sore thumbs.The story is this: In the near future, a civil war is erupting in a fictional country in Asia. Before the events of the series occur, photographer Saeko Shirasu takes a picture of a flag being lifted by the UN with help from citizens of the war-stricken nation. The photo becomes extremely famous; the flag itself becomes a symbol of peace. The UN steps in to mediate the civil war, and a date on which the major warring parties will sign a UN-sanctioned peace agreement overlooked by the legendary flag is approaching. However, just before the peace agreement is to be signed, the all-important flag is stolen by an unknown insurgent group. Without this symbol of peace in its possession, the UN fears that the peace agreement will ultimately fail, so they assign an elite group of special operatives to locate and retrieve the flag. Shirasu agrees to be an embedded photographer and document the group's search for the flag. While she's doing that, a friend of hers (also a photographer) is keeping an eye on the increasingly tense situation in the country's UN-occupied capital.At this point you're probably asking questions in the vein of “if the flag is so important that they're risking lives to locate it, why wasn't it heavily guarded in the first place?” But I digress.Flag's story is told with a film making technique called “found footage,” meaning that the series is presented to us as being raw, unedited footage of events that someone taped in the past with a handheld camera. This technique has existed for a while but was popularized in the late 90s with the success of films like “The Last Broadcast” and “The Blair Witch Project.” Flag shows everything either through the lens of a camera or the display of a computer, and goes to great lengths to maintain this illusion. Whenever the cast enters a vehicle, for example, the locations of the cameras on the vehicle are pointed out to the audience, so that we don't wonder where exactly the footage of different angles is coming from. In addition, you can tell the two main characters apart based on the differing electronic displays of their cameras, allowing the series to switch back and forth between plot threads without much of a hitch. I think that's neat. The whole setup does require a certain suspension of disbelief; I don't think a photographer would use their computer's webcam to film themselves typing, or leave their camera running while sitting around drinking coffee with a friend in a Starbucks.The reason for using this style of filming is that it's honest. We see only what the camera sees, and hear only what the camera hears. That leaves us free to make up our minds about what we're seeing on our own. No external influences, such as a character's thoughts, affect our judgment. Depending on how it's used, this property could be seen as a strength or a weakness, and in Flag, it's definitely the latter. Dramas like Flag survive on swaying the emotions of the audience, so one might question how wise it is to use a style of presentation which creates distance between the audience and the events of the drama. In Flag, I don't think it was wise at all. There isn't a single conversation in the series that doesn't feel cold, empty, forced. And that's at least partially a result of this stylistic decision.The other problem with the way that Flag's story is told is that, quite simply, it's boring. Flag is an endless montage of interviews, computer simulations, and narrative monologues played over still images. We're shown grainy photographs of the harsh reality of life in this country, political and religious doctrines are explained at length, and we watch the military perform long, tedious tests of its soldiers and their futuristic weapons. All of this is out of respect for realism, and I can appreciate that, but it takes over the series to the point where I almost forgot there was an actual plot buried in there somewhere. The series has strong sequences, but they're few and far between. For every genuinely rewarding moment in Flag, there are fifty that are empty and directionless. Several episodes begin with unnecessary recaps that sometimes stretch for as long as three and a half minutes. It's draining to watch this series. I have a pretty big reserve of patience, and it ran out long before I reached Flag's conclusion.The characters aren't much better. The main character, Shirasu, is shown to be a little insecure and lonely. She's trying to figure out what exactly she wants to do with her skills as a photographer. She gains a bit of depth as she gradually becomes more comfortable with her role in the squad of soldiers she's been assigned to film, and moves from feeling like an outsider to being accepted. Unfortunately, the soldiers themselves are nowhere near as fleshed out as Shirasu. They're cardboard cutouts at best, bordering on outright stereotypes. There's a tough blonde female commanding officer, a big Russian strongman-esque pilot, an intelligent young Asian woman with glasses who does computer work...the list of seen-them-befores goes on. The show botches several opportunities to turn the cast into something more memorable. For example, in a series of interviews, Shirasu asks the soldiers about their personal reasons for choosing this line of work. Just when I thought I might get to hear them say something interesting, the responses came back, all empty one-line platitudes: “I fight for my family,” “I fight to save people,” “I fight for my country,” etc. Real nice. Apparently everyone's reasons for risking their lives come from recruitment posters they saw in their local middle school. We can eventually discern a little bit more about the cast based on how they react in discussions about military protocol and battle, but they're still too flat to be a source of any real drama or interest.Thematically, Flag is more than a little confused, and doesn't seem to know what it wants to say at all. Originally I thought the series was going to be about photography: The value of an iconic image, the ability of the photographer to capture the past, breaking the barrier between being an observer and a participant, risking yourself for your art. Flag brings up all these themes, but utterly fails to elaborate on them or make any sort of real statement. Which is too bad, because those are all relatively original ideas. In addition, as Flag goes on, the focus shifts from themes of photography to general antiwar sentiment. This isn't bad in and of itself, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and Flag doesn't bring anything new to this theme. Images of children with guns, civilians killed or displaced by indiscriminate bombing, masked terrorists taking to the streets...these images can be powerful when infused with the right amount of emotion, but on their own accord, they ceased to be shocking and new to most of us a long time ago, and they're now fairly commonplace in our media, both fiction and nonfiction. Flag presents them in an emotionless manner that doesn't bring anything new to the table. They're cliches, to put it simply. The result of all of this is that it's tough to say with certainty what Flag is even supposed to be about. If it was meant to be about photography, they should have taken out the deluge of trite antiwar content. If it was meant to be a statement against warfare, they should have taken out the commentary on the nature of photography. If it was meant to be both, they should have hired some better writers.Two elements of Flag that I can truly compliment are the art and animation. The background art is well detailed, with wide expanses of desert and mountains looking about as close to real life as possible. The city, likewise, is an appropriately drawn maze of housing. Say what you will about Flag (and I've said a lot), but it doesn't slack on creating a setting. However, it's in mechanical design and animation that the series really shines. The show, set in the near future, prominently features some military mecha in the battles, and these look unbelievably good. The series captures the motions of vehicles more realistically than any I've ever seen; every moving part seems to function with the perfectly regimented order typical of machines.Unfortunately, the music is another downer for Flag. The first problem with the musical score is that it exists. No, seriously; since Flag is presented to us as a collection of images and raw footage found in numerous video cameras, the fact that there is any background music at all works against the original concept of the series. The second problem with the music is how typical it is. Some of it's Middle Eastern sounding, lead by traditional drums and wind instruments, sometimes with wordless vocals, sometimes without. The other half of it is more Western, spearheaded by horns and crashing drums. It's generic and not at all memorable, and if you've seen any film about war in exotic nations, you've pretty much heard this music. What's worse than that, it's sometimes so ridiculously overbearing that it's unintentionally comical. Why is there a booming, uplifting patriotic song playing while the main character huddles helplessly in the fetal position to avoid being killed by shrapnel? The mind boggles. The most tense moments of Flag are actually those accompanied by either silence, or light atmospheric noise. In one memorable sequence, we hear nothing but a pilot's shallow, unsteady breathing alternating with the roar of her vehicle's minigun as she kills a group of insurgents. This conveys both her hesitation and dislike of killing, and her determination to get her job done even if it means doing something she dislikes; it tells us far more than any patriotic music could. Flag would have been well served to rely more on the atmosphere and setting that it went to such great lengths to create, rather than on some very heavy-handed music.When all is said and done, I cannot, in good conscience, recommend Flag to anyone but a select group of people. I actually give it a lot of points—probably way more points than I should—for its visual originality. So if you are actively searching for something that is unique in its visual style, then Flag is definitely worth a bit of your time; if nothing else, it's a good looking show. But if you're the average person, wanting to be entertained and/or informed by a series with a strong plot, and you're looking at Flag with curiosity, rest assured that your curiosity has been evoked under false pretenses. Flag's method of storytelling, and its cast, are exceedingly poor efforts. Its themes are a miasma of generic antiwar sentiment and undeveloped artistic ideas which play a dysfunctional game of tag with each other during the running time of the series. A domineering musical score that browbeats the entire concept of the show is the last nail in the coffin of mediocrity. On the outside, Flag is about as polished as you can get, but on the inside...well, refer to paragraph one. themes stick out from it like sore thumbs.The story is this: In the near future, a civil war is erupting in a fictional country in Asia.

On the outside, Flag is about as polished as you can get, but on the inside...well, refer to paragraph one."", ""This anime had a good concept but terrible execution. I wanted to review it for a long time so here it is. There's spoilers in this review BUT you'll be warned beforehand and you'll be glad I spoiled it for you LOL! This anime was so misleading and bad that I just had to review it for you to save you pain and time.Basicly there's some kind of war going on in some kind of 3rd-world country and some kind of war journalists (I think they are Japanese but that doesn't matter) go to this country to get pictures because that's their job or as...they like to say, their ''passion'' or whatever.So the entire show is told through a camera lense, which was artsy and original at first. It's a very detailed digital view but gets old after a while and serves less & less symbolic purpose as the show goes on. The main character girl who is holding the camera takes pictures throughout the show and we see these nice pictures. They are portrayed as nice pictures, which they are, but none of them are really meaningful. Beleive me I'm a photographer, filmmaker and cinematographer.  Only a few parts of the show are shot normally (not through a camera).The story is this girl war journalist got a lucky shot on the country's flag the moment a back-lit girl was praying and her silouhette could be seen through the flag. Suddenly this picture became the people's symbol for peace, or morality, and the flag became a symbol for.... hope i guess, for the war to stop.... Anyways some terrorists stole it and now a special U.N. team is assembled to retrieve the stolen flag. The girl who took the picture is recruited onto this team to document the mission(s).What's supposed to make this U.N. team I mentioned earlier 'special' is a giant robot vehicle thing they have as part of their main arsenal. It transforms into a humanoid mode and a car-ish mode. The movements it makes sound more like a little toy than a war machine. Also it's only weapon is a machine gun, Big Whoop! At least give it a laser gun sheesh.... At least it sort-of looks cool.You'll notice something wrong right away: the war-torn country is too clean. Even the destroyed parts of town are clean and lack any grim detail.  The characters, whom most of which are either jounalists who put their necks out into dangerous situations, or soldiers who put their necks out into dangerous situations, are not dirty at all. This anime about the horrors of war, is just not graphic in any way. The only graphic part about this anime is the lack of vibrant colors, but even the washed-out colors that are present are solid and clear.The graphic quality isn't only lacking in the art style, it's also lacking in the plot and narrative. You won't see much violence. (SPOILERS)  The most violence you'll see (for 4 episodes) are one guy getting shot in the arm and bad guys getting shot in the desert with the desert sand getting kicked up to block our view.  Then the soldiers return from the mission stone-cold and melancholy to show how terrible war is. Seriously, you'll see 1 blood stain after 4 episodes. I am dumb-founded that an anime like FLAG, which is supposed to be about the horrors of war, actually censors violence, and then follows-up with scenes like the soldiers moping around as if we just saw something truely horrifying that will scar the grey matter of our brains forever and give us post traumatic stress syndrome. There are comedy anime with more blood and violence than FLAG.... This is just unacceptable. Also the show usually prefers to show the aftermath of skirmishes instead of the battles themselves because the main focus is the poorly-implied conflict going on in the characters' minimaly-present souls.Another thing disappointing is the intelligence of this so-called super secret team of soldiers. (SPOILERS)  This is one of those spoilers that you'll be glad i spoiled for you: In one scene the team (I'll just call them ''the team'' from here on) thinks they know where the terrorists are hiding. They go in an unarmed helicopter to check out this fortress in a twisting valley. They stay at a safe distance and send out a small scout drone. It flies over there and discovers heavy anti-air defenses. So what does this super secret team do? Head back to base? Report this intelligence to command? Call in reinforcements? No. They fly this unarmed, non-armored helicopter straight into the hostile airspace. Guess what happens next? They get shot at and the pilot is hit in the arm and only Then do they retreat!I could not Believe what I just saw! And nobody acknowledged this as a stupid move! Bunch'a idiots. It was at this point that FLAG lost all credibility and I stopped giving it chances (many chances were spent in vain....)This show also tries to portray war journalists just as brave and valiant as a front-line soldier, which can be true sometimes, but this show fails to do even that.  (SPOILERS) Maybe if they showed the main character being shot at or help an injured person or something, but she is never in danger.  One scene shows the main character go to a building where a fellow war journalist was killed in an explosion.  Her friend war journalist puts a flower in a cup next to the dead guy's camera and has a big monologue about how war journalists are to be respected and are very courageous and all that.  Well sure but, could we at least see the explosion so we have some kind of remorse for the guy?  We never even see this guy, therefor I don't care about him much.(SPOILERS)  Action scenes (of which there are very, very few) have no music whatsoever and like I mentioned, you'll only see 1 blood stain.  I know I didn't see even a single dead terrorist!  And you will only see (in the first 4 episodes) one far away terrorist as seen from night vision in only one shot.  It's like the show can't wait to get these parts over with and get back to the boring-as-hell parts.Another thing that REALLY bothers me is this girl was recruited to document the missions of this team, but guess what?  (SPOILERS)  They don't allow her to go with them on their missions because it's too dangerous! WHAT THE HELL??  The show makes itself redundant right from the get-go!  So she stays at the base taking pictures of the scenery, I am not joking about this at all. She takes pictures of the sourounding mountians and wildlife while waiting for the team to return. You have got to be kidding me.  All sense of risk, danger and excitement is swiftly extinguished right from the beginning.So that's my review. FLAG was a good concept but they were afraid to show violence in a show about violence, they were unable to show intelligent characters in a show about intelligent characters, and they were unable to show graphic images in a graphic show.If anything, FLAG should have been the bloodiest, most disturbing & grotesque anime ever created!  Documentaries on the history channel are vastly more entertaining than FLAG.  FLAG makes war boring (not to say war is supposed to be exciting in a good way, but you get my point)This show fails to execute everything it sets out to do. I don't even know what country they were in and I don't care so they obviously failed to set the up the plot in such a way that I'd be interested. This only reviews the first disc (Good God there's more!?).I give this anime a score of 1.5/10.If you want to see a piece of film that best portrays the horrors of war (which FLAG tries to do) I reccomend Apocalypse Now.  This film captures the essence of the Vietnam war (don't ask me how I know lol).Or if you want to see anime with great character conflict (which FLAG tries to do) then watch Elfen Lied, or Higurashi (aka When They Cry).I can sort of see why people would give this anime high-ish reviews; because of what it tries to do and tries to be.  There is no show like it.  It's one of a kind.  Granted, it is a unique show and in a good way (theoretically).  Unfortunately in my strong opinion which I will state as fact, it fails and somebody should remake it properly.  It has potential, but that's about all it's got and did not deliver for me.  I tend to be very critical so if you have second thoughts about my review, go ahead and give it a chance.  Many people are happy with FLAG and you might be one of those people. they like to say, their ''passion'' or whatever.So the entire show is told through a camera lense, which was artsy and original at first. It's a very detailed digital view but gets old after a while and serves less & less symbolic purpose as the show goes on. The main character girl who is holding the camera takes pictures throughout the show and we see these nice pictures. They are portrayed as nice pictures, which they are, but none of them are really meaningful. Beleive me I'm a photographer, filmmaker and cinematographer.  Only a few parts of the show are shot normally (not through a camera).The story is this girl war journalist got a lucky shot on the country's flag the moment a back-lit girl was praying and her silouhette could be seen through the flag. Suddenly this picture became the people's symbol for peace, or morality, and the flag became a symbol for.... hope i guess, for the war to stop.... Anyways some terrorists stole it and now a special U.N. team is assembled to retrieve the stolen flag. The girl who took the picture is recruited onto this team to document the mission(s).What's supposed to make this U.N. team I mentioned earlier 'special' is a giant robot vehicle thing they have as part of their main arsenal. It transforms into a humanoid mode and a car-ish mode. The movements it makes sound more like a little toy than a war machine. Also it's only weapon is a machine gun, Big Whoop! At least give it a laser gun sheesh.... At least it sort-of looks cool.You'll notice something wrong right away: the war-torn country is too clean. Even the destroyed parts of town are clean and lack any grim detail.  The characters, whom most of which are either jounalists who put their necks out into dangerous situations, or soldiers who put their necks out into dangerous situations, are not dirty at all. This anime about the horrors of war, is just not graphic in any way.

Many people are happy with FLAG and you might be one of those people."", 'If there is one thing that should be immediately praised about the anime FLAG is its daring approach to the animated medium. The entire story, revolving around two photo-journalists in a fictional war zone that resembles the middle east/south-east Asia, is seen through either their camera lens, cameras of vehicles, or sometimes someone else\'s camera. This approach while certainly unique requires a certain level of suspension of disbelief though. You have to believe that every living moment of this series that they have their cameras opened and pointing at people, but nonetheless, for those interested this suspension of disbelief should be trivial and come rather...easily to the audience.This stylistic approach really lends the anime itself to being very gritty, pulling you into the world in a manner that a 3rd person point of view could never do. The way the battles are animated earns a unique flavor as you see everything from the perspective of the pilots fighting. Aiding all of this are its outstanding visuals. The quality of art and character designs is off the charts good. All of these visual elements combine to form a rather incredible feeling of what it feels like to watch a war documentary.Of course, style isn\'t everything, and a gimmick with nice visuals can only take one so far into the anime before one must scrutinize the plot. One can say that FLAG is the story of two halves, one being that of the Saeko Shirasu and the other being that of the Keiichi Akagi. Both of these photo-journalists friends (A mentor to student relationship to be precise), the beginning of the story starts off with them parting ways from each other in the story. While Akagi is seen trying to dig up information on the events of the war from the grounds of the city where the war zone is centered, Shirasu is shown following a group of soldiers by request of the UN. The journey that both these journalists take is very different, and gives a very holistic picture of the war in question. It becomes a very interesting tale about the people involved, their motivations and goals, as well as a suspenseful mystery, as more and more details of this shady war are revealed through the lenses of our photo-journalists.The story\'s strength is not about showing the obvious horrors of war. If one wants to see blood, guts, and screaming children, they would be better served watching live action war dramas or documentaries. It\'s about showing a gritty perspective of war, where one doesn\'t understand the forces at play, why certain things happen, how injustices are played out but are never talked about, all the meanwhile shady political movements are abound. It really delves into the roll of the journalist, and how they seek to unravel the mysteries and details before them. Furthermore, one of its greatest strengths is its depiction of people involved in the war, whether it\'s the common civilians or the soldiers, or even just the other journalists and informants around the grounds of the city. The characters feel very genuine, the emotions and feelings feel very genuine. That\'s part of what makes this anime so incredible.Despite everything I said and the rating I gave in the enjoyment category (""9""), I will say that this anime is not for everyone. Without an intellectual curiosity and intrigue for such material, this anime will grow old quite fast. It is something that one must strain their mind to enjoy at times because the great nuances at play and intellectual satisfaction will not come without much concentration put into the anime. It\'s definitely not easy-bake entertainment.Overall, I have to give credit to this anime. It delivers a nice intellectual satisfaction, and was definitely a pleasure to watch.

If anything, the unique style of the anime is something that makes this anime worth watching.', ""Being a fictional documentary of sorts in depicting hostile tensions between terrorist factions and the UN military to try establishing a peace treaty in a small country, Flag did enough to impress me in its 13 episode run. It offers a unique and original narrative style by showing pictures and the point-of-view from the video cameras of two photo-journalists as they cover the mounting tensions of a terrorist faction's plot to hijack a peace treaty signing and try driving their country into civil war from stealing a flag that was symbolic of the desire that many of the people in the country have in wanting...peace. The series splits its exploration between Saeko accompanying a special forces squad of the UN military tasked with retrieving the flag and her older partner, Keiichi Akagi, exploring political and military activity with the situation as the UN attempts to cover up any information about the flag being stolen and an influential religious figure in Uddiyana having indifference over the peace treaty affairs because of his radical religious beliefs.There are two central elements to Flag that the series focuses on throughout its run: the tensions between UN and terrorist forces, plus the fleshing out of the bonds that Saeko establishes with the special forces unit that she is allowed to accompany during their mission. Flag does a believable job in depicting realistic political tensions that escalate. Through information gathered by Akagi and what we see from his video camera, we come to learn of the strong religious influence that bears upon the land of Uddiyana, especially among what is revealed of the more radical element of the country's religion that is strongly followed by the terrorists and Uddiyana's religious leader. The UN military is depicted to be well aware of the fragile tensions between factions in the country as any wrong move could cause chaos and doing what they can to hide any information related to the theft of the flag to save their hides, even if it infringes upon the personal rights and beliefs of individuals who have close ties to the conflict which show some elements of military corruption.Yet despite both the UN and religious element to Uddiyana having their shady sides, Flag also depicts those among these elements having their peaceful and righteous purposes for their actions as shown through Saeko's video camera footage of the special forces unit and her encounters with some of Uddiyana's local residents. Saeko's perspective of events allows her to connect with members of the special forces unit she accompanies who are shown to behave no differently than a civilian as their desire to resolve Uddiyana's crisis comes across as genuine and are willing to do what they can to accomplish their mission. She also experiences the opportunity to connect with some of the Uddiyana natives in their everyday routines, particularly an encounter she has in a later episode with a group of nomads which she spends an evening with them to experience their lifestyle.The visual presentation to Flag is an impressive one sporting highly-detailed shots of various Uddiyana locations such as mountains, small towns and religious monasteries. Character designs are created to look as realistic as possible, especially with facial designs as they stand out quite a bit from conventional titles. The CG-rendered mechas used by the special forces unit during their missions mesh in well with the regular animation found throughout this series. Animation is efficiently used in believably showing the perspectives of camera shots from the video cameras of Saeko and Akagi, as well as through military mecha and helicopters. Focus on video camera shots from the two photo-journalists are shown to degrade in quality and movements are erratic at points as they move about and react to the intense situations they see unfold in covering their news reports. Shots from mecha and helicopter camera are shown in infra-red and night vision when they are used in action. Battle scenes aren't Flag's prominent focus as whatever camera shots we see of conflicts between UN and terrorist factions are there to get the job done in depicting the events unfold, yet are nothing too impressive to see. Music also tends to be quite minimal for this series to give it its realistic feel thus the only notable music tracks of note for it are the solid OP/ ED tracks chosen.Despite Flag's impressive visual presentation and original premise, it can be an acquired taste for a good number of anime fans. Those expecting slick action scenes because of the focus on military/ terrorist conflicts and mecha will be disappointed to know that they aren't this show's strongest focus, as well as also being possibly turned off from the video camera POV shots that are a regular part of this series. In addition, the series isn't too character-focused as we don't get much in the way of depth with the major characters encountered throughout Flag as the prominent focus of the series lies on the special forces unit mission to retrieve the flag and uncovering the hostile tensions with UN military and terrorist factions escalating towards the deadline of the peace treaty to be signed. Those who enjoy more character-driven titles would likely not get much interest out of this series as well.However if you are genuinely looking for a unique and original premise for an anime title, Flag would be your title of choice. With its unique narrative style from the POV of video cameras and exploration into shaky military/ political affairs in a strongly religious country, this is a definitely keeper for those wanting something unconventional to see with their anime titles. peace.

Be it a camera, a gunsight or a radar screen, you\'re seeing what the characters see. It makes the combat a lot more visceral than even the most hard sci-fi real robot shows, because you\'re on the ground and seeing the fighting right there. An early skirmish in which the lead mech engages a small insurgent force...is given a shocking power thanks to the viewpoint - the gunsight of the mech\'s minigun. All you hear is the sound of the gun firing and the pilot reporting the status of the mech, and all you see is smoke and muzzle flash. It won\'t appeal to people looking for constant exciting action, but it is very atmospheric.The plot of the series is less real robot and more redolent of Modern Warfare or other contemporary war movies or video games, set in an ill-defined oriental state and following a UN black-op fighting to end a civil war. The tension between the press, the UN and the locals is covered in detail, as is the human cost of asymmetrical warfare. It\'s attempting to be serious stuff, and does it well.The ending of the show is very powerful in its own way - some people consider it unconvincing but its suddenness is what gives it power. There\'s a lot of Takahashi\'s earlier work in it, especially the comparatively strong anti-war message (for a mecha show) of Dougram.In terms of mechanical design, the main mech does a good job of seeming like a piece of early 21st century military hardware, taking design cues from modern armoured vehicles. A second mech introduced later is less convincing, though, but interesting in its own way.The combat scenes aren\'t exactly dynamic or mobile, but instead interesting in their use of tactics, the tools of modern warfare and the show\'s unique viewpoint.Another challenge to tradition is the lack of an opening song, which would seem out of place in a serious series like this. The ending song, LIGHTS, is very good and used excellently in the final episode as the show ends.In conclusion, FLAG is a challenge to the mecha genre which can be seen as the culmination of what Takahashi attempted in his earlier works - a mecha show which doesn\'t glorify either side in a war, and which really gives some prominence to non-combatants, maintenance and engineering and military strategy on certain levels. is given a shocking power thanks to the viewpoint - the gunsight of the mech\'s minigun.

It was handled by The Answer studio. That's right, the studio behind Golgo 13. It's also an original work. So, that'll be interesting.Story:Our narrative takes place in a fictional war torn country named for a yoga pose. A young photographer named Shirasu Saeko manages to capture a strong moment of hope in a brilliant photograph. This results in the flag in the photo becoming a symbol of peace. There's just one problem, it gets stolen. Shirasu is chosen to work with UN's special forces in their efforts to scour Uddiyana and regain the flag.The biggest...problem with the series is that it has two protagonists, for good reason, but it can repeat information from each of their perspectives with very little difference. Which just feels like a pointless way to pad the series.To its credit, the dual perspective does work well for showing the situation from the military-oriented perspective of Shirasu and from the more civilian point of view of Keiichi. Which serves to provide a broader, more nuanced viewpoint. The series also makes good use of its photography theme. Both with its aesthetic and by using short snippets for its scenes. The ending also has a strong narrative purpose that ties things together and is really well done.Characters:The series does a great job of using snippets with characters to illustrate different parts of their personalities and flesh them out more than you would expect for a cast of this size in a thirteen episode series. It helps that the conflict has a strong sense of realism to it which gives them a grounding in reality.It also helps considerably that the side characters interact with the photographers, which provides some strong interactions for the photographers even though we don't see that much footage of them directly.Art:The only real downside of the art is that the CG shots of the mecha have pretty stilted movements and they just look awkward. Yeah, I have seen much worse CG but this still isn't good.Overall, however, the visual aesthetic is really good. Seeing everything through lenses, as either stills or video, gives the series a unique look and it really delivers the photography theme strongly. I also appreciate that the series shows warfare while using various tools to avoid making it graphic. It's almost like you can get the point across without going the sensationalist route and showing a bunch of blood and corpses.And even though the mecha look a bit awkward, seeing their blueprints and how the parts connect is interesting. Even if the engineering isn't realistic. If it was we'd all use these blueprints for our own killer robots. And almost as many people would die as anti-vaxxers have killed.Sound:The worst thing I can say about the acting is that Tanaka Rena delivers some of her lines a bit awkwardly. They aren't badly done but they don't seem to quite match the mood the series is conveying. In contrast, we get an excellent performance from Ishizuka Unshou and most of the actors do really well. Ike Yoshihiro's soundtrack is nicely done.Ho-yay:About the closest we get is Shirasu commenting favourably on some of the women she's working with. But she does the same thing with the men and it's pretty obvious that it's not meant romantically. Romance, as a whole, is not a significant thing in this series.Areas of Improvement:Cut down on the repetition. We don't need to see both Shirasu & Keiichi look at the HAVWC blueprints. We can see that kind of thing once. And it would make for a cleaner narrative.Animate the mecha more naturally. It would legitimately be better if these things looked more natural instead of sticking out awkwardly.Better direction for Tanaka Rena. Like I said, she's not bad. But the emotional core of the series would be stronger if not for those out of place lines of dialogue.Final Thoughts:Ultimately,\xa0FLAG is a series that has a lot to offer. Including an aesthetic that's all its own. Do I recommend it? If you're intrigued by the idea of a narrative where photography is a central theme and an operation to suppress insurgents is handled from a human rather than a sensationalist perspective, I absolutely would. I'll give it a solid 8/10. problem with the series is that it has two protagonists, for good reason, but it can repeat information from each of their perspectives with very little difference. Which just feels like a pointless way to pad the series.To its credit, the dual perspective does work well for showing the situation from the military-oriented perspective of Shirasu and from the more civilian point of view of Keiichi.

I remember the series growing very slowly on me, ending with a big twist.By the time I watched it the second time, I matured a bit. I have noticed a lot more nuance than the first time, despite the ten year gap. I laughed and I cried when watching the show both times. I can recommend it even to mature viewers who have no contact with anime as a medium.This...show has perfectly portrayed the ideological clash of motivated individuals working in a conservative environment led by bureaucrats. It\'s not unlike the feeling you have when working within a company. You can understand both sides. None of them are in the right - there is no right or wrong. There is simply circumstance.The helpless journalists, snapping their cameras away despite the media caring solely about about the juiciest of news. The people, dis-attached from the westerns media and institutions, trying to go on with their daily lives. It all feels all too real to me.I have watched countless shows repeat the same old tricks. This one stands out from the rest. It\'s not about escapism. It\'s a simple story set within our modern times, where the protagonist is a helpless spectator, just like we are. The whole show takes place from the perspective of the camera. We\'re on ground level with all of the participants. It\'s a unique perspective.A big point made by this show is that the act of witnessing an event makes a difference. This gives meaning to the life and job of a photo-journalist, the protagonist. At the same time, the viewer feels part of this as well, being a witness to the events of the story.Another significance of the show is having a very good female character. She\'s defined by her job and personality much more than her gender.The english dub is instrumental in enjoying this kind of show. The narration done by Taylor Henry gave the show a really good atmosphere. His calm voice made the show really enjoyable. Anything narrated by him would feel like something special.

The art is wonderful and fresh, while the characters feel incredibly realistic.  It stumbles rarely over its narrative and creates an engaging atmosphere that drew me in at the very beginning.There definitely are times when the sound seems out of place (subbed), but the scarcity of music provided excellent breathing room for the characters and the use of photography throughout the series.As more of an aesthetic complaint, the intro did not seem to fit with the tone of the show entirely, but I would be hard-pressed to...name any anime that has an intro that matches its show.One thing I must applaud about the show is its diversity of cast.  In so many shows, the setting is almost exclusively Japan, with the cast almost exclusively Japanese.  Of course, this makes sense, but having a show set in a near future that does not take place in Tokyo and includes a host of international characters certainly helps this particular story more universal in its approach. name any anime that has an intro that matches its show.One thing I must applaud about the show is its diversity of cast.

The character development was deep but neither melodramatic nor overextended.  Every scene feels like the dialogue means something.  The contraposition of military and philosophical warfare concepts was very well-done.  Also, the way they imagined mechs is both realistic and imaginative at the same time.  If you're looking for an anime which really delves into a nuanced understanding of military, politics, character, and technology, FLAG is right up your alley.  I feel like this is an underwatched and underrated gem of anime, and will recommend it highly to anyone who likes anime of any kind,...really. really."", ""Flag is a bold venture, committing entirely to its realistic pseudo-documentary style, which means omitting an emotionally charged main character, elaborate robot-vs-robot battles, or any of the other genre conventions that would typically serve as points to sell the series on. In that regard, it is a series that can’t be easily sold or summarised via a poster or tagline, but it can at least be summarised accurately with a familiar phrase: it is boring. For that matter, it is very committed to being boring, and it is respectable in its endeavour to reject almost every narrative convention that it is expected to perform, but...while its willingness to be different may be respectable, that doesn’t mean much when its outcome suffers for it. It may do some interesting things when viewed in a wider context, but as a product on its own, the series itself often fails to generate interest.The most significant part of Flag is its visual approach, which is immediately striking, as it applies a Brechtian form of spectatorship via its camera, in which every moment of its runtime is seen through a disconnected interface, predominantly via the lens of a physical camera, a point also reflected in its cinematography which is unflatteringly naturalistic, with the camera typically placed in such a position that people’s faces are obscured from the frame as they have a conversation, or the camera’s operator will decide to move around and look at the scenery, which as may be expected for something that takes place in a desert country, is rarely bursting with features. This technique has echoes of Gasaraki, a prior work also directed by Ryosuke Takahashi that Flag shares many similarities to, but in many ways it is used to greater effect in Gasaraki. In Flag, the camera filter is something that becomes familiar, and by having it appear all of the time, it ends up diminishing its effect, and when this conscious form of spectatorship becomes assumed and understood, it ends up wrapping all the way around to being a detached and uninvolved form of cinematography, leaving it with the same resultant outcome as standard continuity editing. In Gasaraki, distortion and camera filters are used frequently, with scenes depicting news broadcasts, monochrome helicopter camera feeds, and views from the mechs themselves, which were subject to varying degrees of static. However, one key difference is that this often appeared in contrast to the scenes from the perspective of its main character, providing forms of exposition, a different form of imagery and also generating worldbuilding by showing how the events of the story affected different groups of people. Flag’s use of this method does end up losing some of the Brechtian impact through its overuse, but it is an issue seriously compounded by the fact that it does not come anywhere close to approaching the same range in its use that Gasaraki does. Gasaraki shows many real cameras held by different people and machines, being used for different purposes, leading to a fundamentally and immediately visible difference based upon the origins of each specific form of camerawork. Instead, Flag is composed of two perspectives, a photojournalist, and another photojournalist who also provides narration, and this fundamental lack of difference also contributes to to the sluggish pace and feel of the series, as it does not feel like its episodes occupy a typical A and B plot, but rather a single A plot that is dragged out to double its appropriate length.One point that this idiosyncratic approach does have to its benefit is its immersive quality, particularly through the POV sequences which provide diegetic graphs and infographics, allowing it to convey information in an efficient manner that is nonetheless still visually inventive and engaging, which is especially helpful when the information in question is drier than the desert it's set in, whether it be discussions on the limits of gun depression, or looking at a blurry photograph and trying to match it to a particular SAM model, which as far as most viewers will be concerned, all look basically the same and do basically the same thing. Gasaraki was similarly dry, taking the issue of food security and Japanese economic autarky to drive its plot, concepts that have been noted as being relevant factors in a potential US-China war in the Pacific, but rather than speculate on a potential war, Flag decides to adopt the motifs, factors and subsequent consequences from a pre-existing contemporary war, the GWOT, with its story focusing on an invasion of an undeveloped country that serves as an amalgamation of Afghanistan and Vietnam. But despite the subject matter, it is a remarkably apolitical work – in one episode, a character alludes to the Rwandan Genocide, which is a line that seems to come out of nowhere, as while superficially and aesthetically allegorical, Flag is entirely disconnected from the outside world, which limits its ability to develop and immerse itself in its own story, much less one with significant subtext as one may expect from the setting. Takahashi’s works do often exhibit a Frankenheimerian interest in politics and power, but what contrasts Flag with both Gasaraki and VOTOMS is this political element is not centralised through a single figure. As such, the wider political implications of its story, which should be emphasised when it is a story specifically about politics and political conflict, are nowhere to be seen. Why, for instance, do the UN conferences always insist on the violence in the country not being an issue to further their plans for the ceasefire? Is it an act of individual bravado, ignorance of the issue, the result of manipulation from higher-ups to force the ceasefire to be completed by a certain date? This is all conjecture, as there are no answers to be found, for either the viewer or the characters. The UN don’t know what they are doing, nor what the enemy is doing, and this could be argued to contribute to a sense of realism. Even if it does get some great ratings, war doesn’t usually end in a cinematically dramatic fashion, and as per Jean Baudrillard, is so heavily misrepresented and manipulated through its media coverage that any sense of reality is lost by the time it reaches the public eye. For that matter, if one considers the historical precedent of the constructed image of Saddam Hussein as a megalomaniacal dictator, along with President Bush’s frequent invocation of fighting a Christian form of evil, Flag actually makes less of an attempt to present an oversimplified and fictional depiction of international conflict than real life does.Flag is capable of supplying tension at times, but it is a work that is idiosyncratic more than it is interesting, and in many ways it is interesting directly because of those idiosyncrasies. Alongside Gasaraki, it stands as a work that goes as far as possible to try and emphasise realistic elements within the inherently fantastical mecha genre, seeming to deliberately test the limits of just how much realism could be put into a work like this, but even Gasaraki contained a grand narrative. Flag has plenty of unique design elements, and it is a work that is more than adequate for studying within the wider context of either Takahashi, the 2000s, or mecha as a whole. But as a work to be watched and enjoyed, it is largely hollow, its deeply understated characters and plot development will alienate general audiences, and its lack of action will likewise leave hardcore mecha otaku with a lack of content to keep them engaged, especially seeing as its mech has more in common with the motorbike from Tron than any other Sunrise mecha before or since. It defies conventions and common sensibilities of writing, as it chooses to take Brechtian principles, not to advance any idea, but to simply confront the viewer with its own simultaneously empty and original existence. while its willingness to be different may be respectable, that doesn’t mean much when its outcome suffers for it.

Fushigi Yuugi OVA,https://myanimelist.net/anime/380/Fushigi_Yuugi_OVA,"[""The concensus was that this OAV was way too confusing. I found it to be that way too - in fact I had to look up a synopsis for this to understand it.What confused me the most is the time frame - I am not aware of how much time has passed since the last episode of the TV series. Furthermore, how can Hotohori's great grandchild exist when it's obvious that Chichiri and Tasuki has not aged at all? Well at least that's what I understood from Wikipedia. If it is what it is, then it doesn't make much sense. Yui's hair length is something...to think about as well. From what I understand, it hasn't been too long from the events of the series. Miaka and Yui had just entered high school, so what's with the long hair, Yui?The music is still the same - not exactly the same. It sounds the same, mid 90s style, that kind of music. I only like the opening song. The background music is definitely in the background. I think that's all I can say about the music.I still do think that it is worth watching. I am a Fushigi Yuugi fan after all, and I just have to watch every thing related to the series. Besides, there are 3 extras by the end of each episode. It's about the gang (Along with Keisuke and Tetsuya) going to hot springs, and it turns out only women are allowed so the all the guys dress up like women (Yes people, even Nakago and Mitsukake). I do think that this was the high part of the OAV, and for this reason, it should really be watched. to think about as well.

Seemed like there was a lot of build-up that was resolved within the space of 5 mins.  the omake were hilarious. perhaps the minor characters were given more attention in the manga, and so it made sense to bring them back.hopefully they will continue this line in the next one... seems like so much dragging out tho... ', ""Well, let's see  how I can put this. At the beginning I was a bit confused but after seeing the whole entire OVA through I managed to understand what was happening.Storyline: Basically Tamahome is thrust back into the &quot;Universe of the Four Gods.&quot; And while he's in there he's mistaken as Nakago which leads to his eventual mental breakdown. Like I said, at first the storyline is a bit confusing and at parts you don't entirely know what's going on. However as the story progressed I eventually understood what was happening.The story really had a very realistic feel with Tamahome wondering, &quot;Am I...Nakago or am I Tamahome?&quot; Or was his mind playing tricks on him? Was he going crazy? It also had an extremely emotional feel to it. With Tamahome's breakdown, with Miaka's doubt at losing the memories she cherished in the book, with Yui forced to see her friend succumbed to such a state, and Tetsuya and Keisuke who, without their relation to the book, must stand back and read whatever is going on. Truth to say, I'd give the storyline an 8. Mainly because it confused the hell out of me and it took some time for me to get it straightened out. And the fact that, rather than in the manga, everything seemed to be rushed to a resolution.Art: Beautiful. Although there was a lude scene in there that didn't exactly need to be placed. Aside from that the drawings were well done and the raw emotion depicted on the characters was breathtaking. All in all, a 10.Character: We all know the characters if we've watched the series. Everyone has their certain strengths and weaknesses that are depicted in the OVA. Each person was in character, however, at a certain point I often wondered how that person resolved something so quickly. But I suppose within the time limit the creators had for the OVA they had to do something. I rate the characters a 9.5.Overall: Truthfully I loved the series and knowing that there was also an OVA, I was flipping thrilled. But compared to the manga, everything in this felt rushed and nothing really noteworthy happened. Same thing: Bad guy comes to book, priestesses come to book, celestial warriors fight, bad guy beaten, everything somewhat goes to normal. Despite the cliche, the confusing storyline, and the rushed resolution the OVA was all right. In my opinion it's certainly good to watch if you are an avid Fushigi Yugi watcher. So for my overall impression I give this OVA a 9 out of 10. Nakago or am I Tamahome?&quot; Or was his mind playing tricks on him? Was he going crazy? It also had an extremely emotional feel to it. With Tamahome's breakdown, with Miaka's doubt at losing the memories she cherished in the book, with Yui forced to see her friend succumbed to such a state, and Tetsuya and Keisuke who, without their relation to the book, must stand back and read whatever is going on. Truth to say, I'd give the storyline an 8. Mainly because it confused the hell out of me and it took some time for me to get it straightened out. And the fact that, rather than in the manga, everything seemed to be rushed to a resolution.Art: Beautiful. Although there was a lude scene in there that didn't exactly need to be placed. Aside from that the drawings were well done and the raw emotion depicted on the characters was breathtaking. All in all, a 10.Character: We all know the characters if we've watched the series. Everyone has their certain strengths and weaknesses that are depicted in the OVA. Each person was in character, however, at a certain point I often wondered how that person resolved something so quickly. But I suppose within the time limit the creators had for the OVA they had to do something. I rate the characters a 9.5.Overall: Truthfully I loved the series and knowing that there was also an OVA, I was flipping thrilled. But compared to the manga, everything in this felt rushed and nothing really noteworthy happened. Same thing: Bad guy comes to book, priestesses come to book, celestial warriors fight, bad guy beaten, everything somewhat goes to normal. Despite the cliche, the confusing storyline, and the rushed resolution the OVA was all right. In my opinion it's certainly good to watch if you are an avid Fushigi Yugi watcher. So for my overall impression I give this OVA a 9 out of 10."", ""Although I was happy that most of the cast came back, it was far too confusing, even for a fan of the series like me.STORYTELLING:First of all, I'd like to say that it takes a little bit of reasoning and patience to deal with the storytelling as it switches back and forth between two different settings. It could have gone over well, given that aspect but sometimes the sudden change even left me wondering what just happened. It takes a while to realise what's really going on. Moreover, it's a decent concept but lacks depth.ART:The same art style that was used for the original 52...episodes is still present here, which makes me smile, the characters still look the same, minus the minor changes in hair length, indicating time.SOUND:I thought the opening and ending themes sounded great, and the insert songs fit in appropriately, if you were to look up the lyrics somewhere you'd see what I mean. The only drawbacks that I'd note is that somewhere along the lined is deliberately timed slower. Not that it hurts the overall but in my opinion, it would have been nicer if timed correctly. Oh, and prepare for lots of cheesy lines.CHARACTER:I really must confess that even though much of the old cast returned, there were a few quirks here and there which disappointed me. Though most of the characters were the same as the original series, a few of them were very out-of-character. I also had a problem with the shallow actions of some of the supporting characters.OVERALL ENJOYMENT:I must say that I didn't mind watching it but half of me liked the story while the other half wanted to stop and ban it as an insult to the original. Though it is necessary to watch the original 52 episodes first, I would say that when coming to this OVA segment, it would be easier just to stop before watching for those of you with low patience/tolerance levels. episodes is still present here, which makes me smile, the characters still look the same, minus the minor changes in hair length, indicating time.SOUND:I thought the opening and ending themes sounded great, and the insert songs fit in appropriately, if you were to look up the lyrics somewhere you'd see what I mean.

GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class,https://myanimelist.net/anime/5670/GA__Geijutsuka_Art_Design_Class,"['One of the problems with anime these days is the tendency for studios to stick to formulae, and to capitalise on what has gone before (also known as jumping on the bandwagon). It\'s unfortunate then that GA: Geijitsuka Art Design Class is a victim of this mindset, especially given the subject matter and the potential for experimentation.Originally a yonkoma (4-koma), manga by Kiyuzuki Satoko, the anime adaptation is actually based on the 2005 serialisation that was published in ""Manga Time Kirara Carat"", and while the series is very much aimed at the moe market, it has benefitted from the directorial talents of Sakurai Hiroaki (Di-Gi-Charat,...Sweet Valerian, Majokko Tsukune-chan), and the art direction of Kasuga Reiji.The story follows the lives of five girls who attend a specialist design school, where they learn about various aspects of art and design, art history, and various other art related subjects.And that\'s it. Seriously. That pretty much describes the entire show.One of the biggest problems with GA is that the entire show has been done before, be it with Lucky ☆ Star and K-On, or with more relevant comparisons like Sketchbook ~full color\'S~ and Hidamari Sketch. In truth, GA offers nothing new or different in terms of settings or characters.What it does offer though, is information, and this is ultimately it\'s saving grace. Unlike most other school based slice of life shows, GA is far more informative about it\'s related subject matter, and much of the humour is actually derivative of this. The plot focuses far more on art and design than it does on the characters, and while this may be an anathema to some, it\'s actually a rather refreshing approach as the viewer doesn\'t then need to worry about things like plot or character development.One way to describe GA would be to call it a moe documentary about art, and the show makes good use of the subject matter to produce some surprisingly well executed sequences and comedy scenes. In truth, the majority of events are designed to provide visual examples of whichever style of art is the current topic (Kisaragi\'s surrealist dream being a good example of this at work), while the rest of the show is more along the lines of a typical slice of life comedy.Given that the show is about art and design, it would be fair to expect some great visuals and animation, and while GA is good in this department, it lacks a certain something...Let me explain. Visually the show is a bit too ""cutesy"" to be taken seriously. The characters are designed to attract a specific audience (the moe marketor younger children), and the over-use of soft focus scenes reinforces this aspect. While there is nothing overtly wrong with this, it does mean that the show will only really appeal, at least in visual terms, to those who like shows like Lucky ☆ Star, or to those who simply don\'t care what the characters look like. That said, the series is colourful and cheery, and while the majority of the design falls on the side of cute, there are some superb moments when the designers really get experimental with the show.As far as the animation goes, the series is actually pretty well executed. The characters move well, and while the general animation is of a good standard, it can\'t quite make up for the ""too cute"" feel of the show.The voice acting is pretty decent for the most part, but here again the show adopts a more ""cutesy"" approach. While the seiyuu are able to deliver the humour fairly well, the show lacks a certain depth of character due to some wooden moments.The OP is a fairly upbeat track called ""Osaki ni Sil Vous Plait"", which is sung by the female seiyuu who play the lead roles, and bears a surprising resemblance to the infamous ""Happy Material"" (Mahou Sensei Negima), in terms of it\'s composition. The opening sequence is very well choregraphed though, and while the track is a little on the boppy side, I found that I didn\'t actually get too bored of hearing it (unlike a certain other song I mentioned).The ED is an altogether different story. The show actually has twelve different ending songs, and the artwork depicts the girls at three different stages of life prior to them entering their current school. What makes the ending sequences even more unusual is that each of the five main seiyuu take turns at singing the ending theme, and each time the song reflects a different aspect of the current episode. The final ED is a group effort, sung by all five main seiyuu, and shows all three stages of life in one sequence. Because of this, I never once found the ED to be boring as each song is highly reflective of it\'s respective character, and effectively adds to the charm of the series.Aside from that, the show is reasonably well served in terms of it\'s sound and music. My main gripe though (although it is admittedly only a minor one), is that there is very little in the way of quiet time in the show as almost every minute involves some form of accompaniment.The characters aren\'t that bad for the most part, however they are formulaic at best, and far too moe for their own good. Each of the five main girls represents one particular moe archetype, the clumsy, ditzy meganekko; the brash, monkey-like tomboy, to the cute-but-evil master of games; the normal girl who mothers everyone; and the wierd, quiet girl who has strange powers (like talking to chickens).One of the problems that some may have with GA is that the characters lack anything resembling a personality, however this is due to the show being focused on art. Effectively, the characters are simply there as a point of reference, a means to better facilitate the viewers understanding of the various forms of art (basically they\'re tools for teaching, like a pencil or a calculator). However, even with this grandiose intent (to teach using anime), the director and writers should really have found a method to make the audience relate to the characters more, as this would have facilitated a better appreciation of the subject matter.Think about it. If your teacher is fun and interesting, then you want to learn the lesson. If they\'re dull and boring, you want to do something else.On the whole though, this isn\'t a bad show at all. While there will be direct comparisons made to Hidamari Sketch and Sketchbook ~full color\'S~, as well as with shows like Lucky ☆ Star, Azumangah Daioh, K-On!, etc, GA is able to stand on it\'s own due to it\'s novel approach and focus. Where those other shows were very much about the daily lives of the characters, GA only uses this as a point of reference. Granted it is very firmly on the moe bandwagon, but the show never really pushes this aspect too much, which actually made it more pleasant as a series.In this respect it more resembles Sketchbook, as the moe aspect is simply there, nothing more than that.GA would appeal to fans of any of the shows mentioned above as it has a fair few things in common with each of them. Likewise, those who are interested in art and producing artwork, or are artists themselves, may find this as enjoyable as I did, as there are numerous moments when I found myself thinking ""that happened to me as well"" or ""I did that too"". Younger viewers may also find the series interesting, in particular for it\'s rather simplistic approach to ""teaching"".That said, some may be disappointed if they go into this show expecting a moe-fest as, aside from the characters being cutely designed, there isn\'t any.GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class may not be as experimental in terms of art and animation as I\'d hoped, and it may be a little too tooth achingly cute at times, but behind that there is actually a pretty decent show that takes a completely different tack to almost every other anime in recent years. The series isn\'t really trying to tell a story, but is instead trying to impart knowledge - something that is always laudable, and is remarkably absent from anime as a medium. While the show does have it\'s flaws, the intent and purpose should be appreciated and applauded.You never know. We may end up seeing mahou shoujo wildlife documentaries in the future, or the news read by shounen icons like Goku, Luffy, Ichigo, etc, or even Yagami Light in a Judge Judy style reality show.Now wouldn\'t that be something to see :) Sweet Valerian, Majokko Tsukune-chan), and the art direction of Kasuga Reiji.The story follows the lives of five girls who attend a specialist design school, where they learn about various aspects of art and design, art history, and various other art related subjects.And that\'s it.

K-ON! was overdone and downright stupid.  Some would say the same for GA, but I beg to differ.==[Pros]==- Jokes are original because the material they cover is not standard fare.  This isn\'t Lucky Star.  This isn\'t Azumanga Daioh (though both of those series are great stuff).  The normal SOL comedy uses stereotyped characters and running gags to stir up laughs.  Osaka was funny because she was the constant village idiot.  Panty-flashing-girl and dog-with-stick-in-butt from Zetsubou Sensei are funny because they...pop up repeatedly.  But does GA rely solely on this?  Nope.  The Geijutsuka Art Design Class lives up to its name - it makes jokes grounded not only in the usual school life situations (school festivals, etc.), but also in art.  ""How is that remotely possible...?!"" you might ask.  But it is, and it works.- The humor is consistent.  There are no dips in the humor throughout the entire series.  Even though this may sound like a quality that every comedy has to have, that\'s often not the case.  Kannagi turns to drama, Gintama becomes hardcore action at times, and Full Metal Panic hops between action, romance, and comedy.  It\'s easy to appreciate an anime with more than one aspect, but it\'s damn hard to keep an anime in a single genre.  When you watch Gintama, you don\'t know whether you\'ll get an action-packed episode or a comedic one.  When you watch GA, you know that you\'ll get a light-hearted comedy, and that you won\'t be disappointed with what you see.- Sounds, visuals, other stuff like that.  It sounds good and looks good.==[Cons]==- The ""cute"" art style.  Personally, I found this appealing (it really works with the the humor that\'s put forth), but some people really hate this style.  But then again, people who hate this kind of art probably wouldn\'t like SOL comedies in general.- Predictability of characters\' actions.  A slice-of-life comedy requires somewhat formulaic characters for its humor to work, and GA is no exception.  The characters stay pretty much the same throughout the entire series (honestly, would you expect a high school student to undergo incredible changes in a month?), and this leads to somewhat predictable situations.  But as I said above, this is something that anti-SOL comedy viewers would pick at no matter what.==[Conclusion]==Suffers from usual problems that slice-of-life comedies face, yet breaks the mold with its art-based humor.

Sure, there are other animes about art, but this one caught my interest in particular.There is no solid story to this anime, and simply, it tells the watchers about the activities that the GA, the Geijutsuka or Art Design Class experiences. The anime has five characters, each with their own distinct personalities. I have to admit that the character design and art was ""interesting"" to say the least for...the anime.The BGMs and OP and ED music were alright, but the anime probably will not be known for that.Overall, I thought the concept of combining say your typical moe-chibi-girl-cute-etc anime and adding some traditional art styles such as painting, sketching, and various other types of mediums and add it to modern moe Japanese animation was quite interesting. I would say it is quite a good anime.Of course, that is because I am an art nerd, for various other people, the opinion might be different. Nonetheless, if you love art or just watch cute-girls do various activities involving or not involving art, it would be recommended. the anime.The BGMs and OP and ED music were alright, but the anime probably will not be known for that.Overall, I thought the concept of combining say your typical moe-chibi-girl-cute-etc anime and adding some traditional art styles such as painting, sketching, and various other types of mediums and add it to modern moe Japanese animation was quite interesting.

I\'m terribly Biased. like, REALLY biased. Not only do I love the author of this work, I tend to love moe animes in general. To me, the ability to generate a really good atmosphere is just as important as telling a good story, and an anime with a horrible story can be more than completely forgiven in the case it has a really good atmosphere. This anime does. Granted I loved the character designs (and had real fun guessing what S-A-C Kuro characters these were designed off of), found them a little tropey, but hey, tropes are...things that work, and they were different enough to keep from becoming flat characters, so they\'re good. also, I enjoyed this anime ALOT.The plot is essentially if you mixed Azumanga Daioh with the occasional little art-lesson, while the characters have an upperclassman-lower classman situation similar to Lucky Star (but the main focus was switched to the Lowers), and the upper class was a more harmless version of the SOS brigade (with a supervisor not unlike K-ons).

Despite that, GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class is unique in it\'s own way and is pretty entertaining.Like most slice of life anime series, there is no plot. It takes a similar approach to the genres as most slice of life anime where you watch what the characters do in different situations. However this series is unique in it\'s way. For one,...everything that happens is art related, which isn\'t too uncommon but it also teaches you about art. All these lessons about art fit in very well with this anime and they add to the effectiveness of the jokes that this series makes. Another thing that this series has going for it is that the jokes are pretty funny, and the comedy works most of the time.An advantage that slice of life anime have is that there is no need for character development. All you have to do is take a bunch of girls with contrasting personalities and throw them together, that is also what happens here. The personalities of the characters\' drive this series as it makes it very interesting to watch, and it also makes a lot of the jokes work. Each character is also very likeable in their own respect. This approach to the characters, rarely fails but it also makes the characters not very memorable. That\'s what you call playing it safe.The art is like most anime but it does use a variety of different art styles throughout the series. The cute art style also fits in with the light mood of this series. The animation itself was fine, the characters moved fluidly and nothing really seemed odd.For the opening we have an upbeat song which fits the anime but not really memorable (except for the opening line). There are also six different endings (one for each main character, and one for all of them) which fit the characters quite nicely but like the opening it isn\'t too memorable.GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class is very enjoyable, even if you are not interested in art or don\'t know much about it. The jokes are still funny because of the lessons the series teaches you. Also for most people who already enjoy anime in the slice of life genre, this will not disappoint. However if you aren\'t into the slice of life genre, it would probably be best to stay away.Overall GA: Geijutsuka Art Design Class has a lot of similarities to a typical slice of life anime but it also has a lot of differences that separate it from the rest. everything that happens is art related, which isn\'t too uncommon but it also teaches you about art.

For me, that\'s usually a sign I\'m not interested in it if I don\'t want to watch the next episodes. But every time I did come back to an episode, I enjoyed myself.The basis for this anime is very plain and simple, just 12 (13 if you count the OVA) straight episodes of moe girl stereo types living their daily life throughout their art school. I myself do like to draw, but I am not that ""artsy"" per say, my doodles are quite alright but I don\'t do much more than...that, I only sketch. With my limited knowledge of art, there was a lot of jokes I didn\'t get, but I still enjoyed this anime.There is always at least one really interesting thing that happens each episode that is pretty enjoyable. This anime was actually very informational to me. For the art/animation and sound, the actual anime art itself is very plain, but ok for the eyes. However, some of the actual drawn art in the anime, by the characters, is quite good. The opening is really catchy for me, hearing the ""hitotsu, hitotsu, hitotsu, hitotsu"" makes me happy every time. And the ending is always different too. So props to the studio for the extra effort.But honestly, the only reason I can give you to watch this is if you like moetrash or art. Because honestly, I do XDSometimes you just need something to draw away the crippling depression temporarily you know. Like spending your time watching a cutesy art anime where everyone is having fun and well...you\'re.... that, I only sketch.

The principal topic is the different activities the GA class (with some participation of the art club members) have every day: painting, drawing, CG, assignments, and some activities of their school life.Each episode is, in fact, an visual art ""lesson"" but showed in a very funny (and sometimes crazy) way because of the creativity and...different personality of each one.At first sight this can seem as another school-life anime with moe characters, but believe me... is more than that.

Though not uncommon for the genre of Cute Girls Doing Cute things, being pushed straight into the day to day lives with no attempt at character introduction is jarring, especially for people who are not already into the anime scene. The story really goes no where; even within episodes it is unclear what the struggle of that day is. The art style is fitting to the characters and the show's tendency to launch into an over the top exaggeration. The music and sounds of the show are solid, with an added bonus of the sounds will often be...represented on screen with words from where the sound is coming from, labeling the sound.This anime is probably better than I'm giving it credit for, but as I just finished binge watching K-On!! I find many aspects of it lacking, leading to it being not too enjoyable but at the same time not a snooze fest. represented on screen with words from where the sound is coming from, labeling the sound.This anime is probably better than I'm giving it credit for, but as I just finished binge watching K-On!!

Garo: Vanishing Line,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36144/Garo__Vanishing_Line,"[""At this time 11 episodes have aired now. This show is a good one, it evolves over time and becomes more in depth. Action is good and to be be honest the different stories are entertaining it's a show like I said before evolves in the sense that you feel like your watching two shows but in a engaging way. Characters are solid and certain backstories are explained very well. For me it's an entertaining show to pass by the time but certainly not my favorite.Don't worry about the rating as you may like the show and think much higher of it. "", 'Sometimes, old ideas never die and Garo is an example that feels timeless regardless what setting it takes in. Upon being announced for a new anime series, I was rather ecstatic upon realizing the setting this show would take place. Contrary to some of the past series that took place in dark fantasy world, we got a modern Garo. That’s right, a series that takes place in modern times with politics, technology, and new dangers lurking in the shadows.Confession time. I’m actually not a huge Garo fan. In fact, my first exposure to the franchise is from 2014 when Garo: The Animation aired. Basically, I...missed out on the original series that aired over a decade ago and only understand the anime side of the franchise. That’s no problem though as it seems that any new viewer can jump into this anime right away without a big question mark. You can basically watch Garo Vanishing Lines even if this is your very first Garo series as a whole. The real question is whether you can accept and enjoy this series for what it is.Taking place in a modern setting, Garo Vanishing Line breaks the traditional norm. Because of this, the mood of the show at first feels different. Upon watching the first few episodes, I had a sensational feel about how the series would be presented down the line. The roadmap seems to follow a format that people may feel familiar though. The typical monster-of-the week starts the adventure for our main characters. The rogue gallery consists of Horrors that gets more twisted and twisted each week. It shouldn’t take long for viewers to get comfortable to watching this series once you realize what you’re in for. That being said, Garo Vanishing Line offers a peculiar character cast consisting of Sword, Sophie, Gina, and Luke. All of them have distinctive backgrounds, personalities, and motivations in this series but it’s easy to see how they connect. The most prominent relationship is between Sword and Sophie. From strangers to becoming close friends, they grow close during their time together. It’s also important to note that after being exposed to the existence of Horrors, Sophie’s character begins to grow more confident and sets a promise to find her lost brother.Sword (known as Garo the Golden Knight) plays the role of a badass protagonist with the motivation to find “El Dorado”. Throughout the series, we can see that he is similar to some of the other Garo characters from previous franchises. He reminds me of German Luis the most as both of them are known for their lustful personalities yet are also very courageous in the face of danger. On the other hand, there’s Luke. As a Makai Alchemist, he is a lonewolf type of character and seeks vengeance for the murder of his mother. Throughout the series, we learn more about his own story and it’s easy to understand his personality. Finally, Gina enters this series as a professional thief. Also known for her skills as a Makai Alchemist, she is what I initially see as a femme fatale. She’s the type of woman known for her dangerous charms and can be quite manipulative. However, her more delicate personality is shown through interacting with Sophie. Throughout the series, she almost seems like a mother figure to her and it’s not hard to see why once you see their character chemistry. Her interaction with Sword plays on a lot of flirtatious moments although her feelings also seem genuine in later episodes. So there you have it, the diverse main cast of the series. Whether you like them or not isn’t the point but rather how these characters all build on one another to make this story.While this series follows a monster-of-the week format at first, later episodes focuses on a more complicated storyline. It gets thrilling, emotional, and some scenes are very impactful on the characters’ state of being. The most prominent example is Sophie as she discovers revelations beyond her imaginations. I think for most parts, this show adheres to psychological horror with a sense of dark comedy. For me, the series can be both heartwarming and depressive to watch. The storytelling’s pacing catches up after building up events and hits its climax in some ways that you may be unprepared for. On the other hand, the series’ flaws can be looked at for some of the inbalanced storytelling in its first half. A few of those episodes can be quite forgettable as there’s little value that comes out of it. In essence, “filler episodes” can really be either memorable or forgettable depending on your perspective. The main plot carries some of these problems too if you’re not invested into the main cast. And trust me, I wasn’t really sold into the main cast until after I watched a good amount into this show. Personally, I wasn’t invested in Sword’s role in this series much as he feels like a one dimensional character and receives little development. However, this series did make me realize how sad some of the characters’ background stories are. In particular, I feel like Sophie is the most tragic characters in this series after seeing what she’s been through. Poor girl.Adapted by studio MAPPA, Garo Vanishing Line presents the mature vibe that is very suitable for this anime. The graphic violence is carried by the action scenes with the fighting involving Horrors. It isn’t shy to throw in violence whenever it finds a situation suitable. As such, expect limbs to be blown off, blood to be spilled, and bodies hit the floor in stomach-inducing ways. The Horrors also gives off a Lovecraftian horror vibe with the way they’re designed. There seems to be a larger variety of them too ranging from shapeshifting types to even Horrors that can control people and technology. Also, be prepared for fan service. Gina is the main culprit of this as the series makes her look as sexy as possible with her outfit, curves, and alluring face. As this show also contains heavy action, expect the choreography and battle scenes to have a fast pace. Sometimes, it feels like it’s hard to keep up but once you get used to it, it’s very electrifying. Finally, I want to say the series’ creative team did a wonderful job at crafting the setting for this show. Russel City (based on New York) not only shows the concept of the modern era but also carries a dark metropolis feel. It has a very different style compared to the previous animated Garo series but works creatively well.To me, Garo Vanishing Line’s main voice cast did a pretty decent job at their roles in particular for characters such as Gina and Luke. The way they speak reaffirms their personalities while showing how they can react differently under certain circumstances. The battle OST and music molds a variety of style to present this action thriller. Some of the emotional scenes in this series also look impactful with the moody soundtrack. The theme songs are also made with care with its thrilling details.Even as a new series introduced to the Garo franchise, it feels that the show always fit right alongside with the others. With a new group of characters, it will take some time to grow and accept them. In fact, you may end up not liking any of them in the end. That’s okay as Garo isn’t a show that is suitable for everyone. This isn’t one of those series that feeds you along the way with every episode. Honestly, I think Garo Vanishing Line stood out with how it was able to take its new ideas and makes an identity for itself. And that’s a thumb up in my book. missed out on the original series that aired over a decade ago and only understand the anime side of the franchise.

And that’s a thumb up in my book.', ""First of all its no sequel of other Garos , so you dont need to watch any other Garo series in order to understand this 1 , so feel free to give a start.I already watch the Garo animation so i know little bit about the monsters.This garo is an awesome series so far.Its 10/10 for me.You got a cool Male mc that is badass and A girl who got guts to stand against horror , she is trying to find her brother tho.Don't worry if you wanna see badass girl then this series have 1.In episode 3 you will find a S rated badass...girl.Damm she is so badass.Story: =8/10Story is simple but good,Sword the mc who is makai knight , that fights horrors created by negative energy and looking for a place Eldorado and the female mc Sophie is a normal girl but her brother went missing and she finds out that horrors and the name eldorado has to do something with her brother missing.They both counter each other and sopphie find out that sword will be helpful to find her brother and so it goes on.Sound; =10/10I love the sounds of the anime its amazing.Character; =9/10Character are so good , good job by mappa.We have kawii girl and cool mc.We have badass supporting chracter Luke and Gine and both are badass.Overall; =10/10Overall i enjoyed this anime its amazing for and according to my taste well its far batter than Die Iraes , lol.Its amazing and unique anime its just have low score that does not mean you should not watch.Its worth a try and its amazing.This 1 is far batter than Garo The crimson moon and good as Garo the animation(first garo series)Well my review will be deleted after episode 12 coz i know this series will have 20+ episodes. girl.Damm she is so badass.Story: =8/10Story is simple but good,Sword the mc who is makai knight , that fights horrors created by negative energy and looking for a place Eldorado and the female mc Sophie is a normal girl but her brother went missing and she finds out that horrors and the name eldorado has to do something with her brother missing.They both counter each other and sopphie find out that sword will be helpful to find her brother and so it goes on.Sound; =10/10I love the sounds of the anime its amazing.Character; =9/10Character are so good , good job by mappa.We have kawii girl and cool mc.We have badass supporting chracter Luke and Gine and both are badass.Overall; =10/10Overall i enjoyed this anime its amazing for and according to my taste well its far batter than Die Iraes , lol.Its amazing and unique anime its just have low score that does not mean you should not watch.Its worth a try and its amazing.This 1 is far batter than Garo The crimson moon and good as Garo the animation(first garo series)Well my review will be deleted after episode 12 coz i know this series will have 20+ episodes."", 'Garo: Vanishing Line, the 3rd installment of the Garo series, which *SPOLIER TIME* if you don\'t know, here\'s a trait of these types:1) Every Garo story takes place in a different city (Spain, Japan, US)2) Whatever the story is, the good vs. evil divergence story setting is STILL the same with Makai Knights vs. Horrors and the masterminds behind each series3) Expect intense action with good yet improving CGI since all of the Garo anime series are done by the one and only MAPPA....except, when you realize who\'s directing this series, and it\'s a Korean! This is Park Sunghoo\'s 1st role as director, and while...some (or most) of us don\'t quite agree that Koreans should take helm at Japanese anime, I definitely feel that regardless of origin, they can still make wonders and it shines here.Personally, this is my 1st ever exposure into the Garo series, since my niche wasn\'t action-based and while I wasn\'t looking forward to watching the others before it (but luckily they weren\'t related to each other), I gave this a shot, and it holds out pretty well.Story (in a nutshell coz it\'s too long):There exists Russell City (in the setting of the US), a prospective city in New York, with Garo now being brandished under a very muscular man named Sword who for most intentions, is a lustful oppai worshipper *pun intended* other than his Garo self. His intentions of smirking around the city comes in a form of a passphrase ""El Dorado"", a sinister plot by the Horrors to use the people in gain for their purposes. An encounter with a girl named Sophia Hennes and her near-encounter death when the Horrors strike down on her from her missing brother\'s request to bring her into ""El Dorado"" caught the sight of Sword, and both people (along with Gina and Luke who joined hands later) decided to vain in search only from the lead that is the world of ""El Dorado"".From the outset, as mentioned in point no.1, every Garo story is set of from a city universe. Along the way, the story did get interesting with the CGI-supported action that really sometimes feel like a letdown, but yet feeling accomplished after all that is said and done, and when it came down to the ending, I was feeling nothing but pure satisfaction that arose from the interest from the very beginning, and I really have to say that this is the pinnacle of the Garo series.Characters:Sword for one, he\'s strong, robust and doesn\'t give second thoughts when it comes to exterminating evil as the Makai Golden Knight Garo. Other from his worshipping oppai lustfulness that sometimes rack my funny bones out, I\'ve gotta say that Sword is a full-on-experience person. But all this could not be said without some tragedies, which he lost his sister in the past, and strives to take upon himself to find out what\'s going on and eradicate it. Most importantly, with his trusty motorbike aid Zaruba who serves as an advisor and a Horror detector, Sword is a character that though can fight like his determination will go, but too has a heart of gold for the other characters, especially for Sophie (as like a father to a daughter).Sophia Hennes is the oddball BUT plot-moving pointer in the series. Her search for her missing brother Martin Hennes come forth in a password that is ""El Dorado"" a city of people used by Horrors to power their existence (which he was proclaimed the King of El Dorado, but only as a tool). Once an orphan, took into a home to be taken care of until the Horrors searched for her with the unknown purpose of the Horror masters. Her character might be whining from the start as her pursuing of her brother who\'s a genius hacker and had outstanding IT skills, and as a brother who cared for her in many ways, sets up the mood for how Sophia journeys with Sword, Gina and Luke into discovering the same purposes and fighting off against the same type of evil they were searching for.Gina, another Makai Alchemist, and probably the character we adore the most in this series, as her flirtatious but manipulative self serves as the supporting role to help Sword and Luke fight off the Horrors. When it comes to Gina, her actions light up the overall supporting action that was once great, but her appearance made it better tenfold. Though a woman in heart, when it comes to her sensitivity, there\'s nothing else that could beat her likeness as her closeness with Sophia re-enacts her decision to protect her ultimate goal (as like a mother to daughter).Luke, yet another Makai Alchemist, and one that might be the most stubborn in the crew, but yet has a life mission in his hands: to overcome his past of a family conflict when he was trained to be a Makai Knight by his father, Knight (now the Dark Knight which serves El Dorado) until the gruesome murder of his mother became the source of hate for him against Knight which he swore his revenge on, improving his skills and awaiting the days where he could take down the Dark Knight, eliminating the hate of years gone by. The gun-welding person in the crew, with bullets targeted to manipulate and eradicate Horrors, he sometimes cannot be empathized for his behavior against the others, but at times the figure of understanding his past gives light to who he is in training towards the fights that he encounters, that solidifies him as the support character in the most sensical way.The Horrors, Bishop, Knight and Queen, did their job at stopping the Makai Knights from realizing their goals, and I\'d bet that they truly evoke the ""pure evil"" tried-and-true villain requirements, that was handsomely put down by the thought of the Makai Knights whose goals have been to eradicate Horrors from the get=go.Overall, a wide range of the cast of characters, but the good kind of showy action.Art/Animation:I\'m a huge fan of MAPPA\'s works, so to see that their expertise from the very get-go doesn\'t draw any cutback and instead let us right through into the scenes...with intensive action that\'s led by the CGI effects. Here\'s the caveat though: Often outlandish action doesn\'t mean the action lines up with whatever the storytelling is, but whatever Garo: Vanishing Line does, it strikes the chord of well-balanced heavy action with the storytelling, with switching from light-hearted to dark, depressing moments. Props to MAPPA for a series that has consistently improved ever since the 1st installment (since I\'ve heard that the preceding ones didn\'t do as well of a job as this one does).Sound:With cool, good-looking action, comes some crazy-intense BGM, and it\'s finger lickin\' good (and yes I know it\'s a pun, but it really supports the action VERY outstandingly well, and always gets me pumped for whatever\'s to come). But the OPs and EDs...while they\'re OK, nothing to scorn yet say of its achievements. At first I really thought that people will praise the soundtrack, but that totally backfired. For my preference, I do like JAM Project\'s songs, and while most people hate the 1st OP, I actually do love the intensity that it gives and it never disappoints. (Rant at me all you want you haters). Same as with the ED, the 2nd one is a vast improvement over the mellow 1st (since the story hasn\'t yet fleshed out by that point). Overall an OK OST by all terms.Overall:Garo: Vanishing Line, a series that I didn\'t thought would sell my soul into, became one of the (only few) action anime that I would eventually come to love and set as one of the recent favorites. For all its intensity though, setting this at a 2-cour, 24 episodes setting is really putting a lot of strain on the storyline because thought it might feel that some episodes are canon to the series, it did help set the future stories in motion for their effort.All in all, if you\'re someone who loves heavy action, try this new installment of the Garo series. You can choose to watch the ones before, but serves no point since they\'re NOT related to one another, so better off watch this one instead. It\'s for all intentions, a story that will grip you from start to end. some (or most) of us don\'t quite agree that Koreans should take helm at Japanese anime, I definitely feel that regardless of origin, they can still make wonders and it shines here.Personally, this is my 1st ever exposure into the Garo series, since my niche wasn\'t action-based and while I wasn\'t looking forward to watching the others before it (but luckily they weren\'t related to each other), I gave this a shot, and it holds out pretty well.Story (in a nutshell coz it\'s too long):There exists Russell City (in the setting of the US), a prospective city in New York, with Garo now being brandished under a very muscular man named Sword who for most intentions, is a lustful oppai worshipper *pun intended* other than his Garo self. His intentions of smirking around the city comes in a form of a passphrase ""El Dorado"", a sinister plot by the Horrors to use the people in gain for their purposes. An encounter with a girl named Sophia Hennes and her near-encounter death when the Horrors strike down on her from her missing brother\'s request to bring her into ""El Dorado"" caught the sight of Sword, and both people (along with Gina and Luke who joined hands later) decided to vain in search only from the lead that is the world of ""El Dorado"".From the outset, as mentioned in point no.1, every Garo story is set of from a city universe. Along the way, the story did get interesting with the CGI-supported action that really sometimes feel like a letdown, but yet feeling accomplished after all that is said and done, and when it came down to the ending, I was feeling nothing but pure satisfaction that arose from the interest from the very beginning, and I really have to say that this is the pinnacle of the Garo series.Characters:Sword for one, he\'s strong, robust and doesn\'t give second thoughts when it comes to exterminating evil as the Makai Golden Knight Garo. Other from his worshipping oppai lustfulness that sometimes rack my funny bones out, I\'ve gotta say that Sword is a full-on-experience person. But all this could not be said without some tragedies, which he lost his sister in the past, and strives to take upon himself to find out what\'s going on and eradicate it. Most importantly, with his trusty motorbike aid Zaruba who serves as an advisor and a Horror detector, Sword is a character that though can fight like his determination will go, but too has a heart of gold for the other characters, especially for Sophie (as like a father to a daughter).Sophia Hennes is the oddball BUT plot-moving pointer in the series. Her search for her missing brother Martin Hennes come forth in a password that is ""El Dorado"" a city of people used by Horrors to power their existence (which he was proclaimed the King of El Dorado, but only as a tool). Once an orphan, took into a home to be taken care of until the Horrors searched for her with the unknown purpose of the Horror masters. Her character might be whining from the start as her pursuing of her brother who\'s a genius hacker and had outstanding IT skills, and as a brother who cared for her in many ways, sets up the mood for how Sophia journeys with Sword, Gina and Luke into discovering the same purposes and fighting off against the same type of evil they were searching for.Gina, another Makai Alchemist, and probably the character we adore the most in this series, as her flirtatious but manipulative self serves as the supporting role to help Sword and Luke fight off the Horrors. When it comes to Gina, her actions light up the overall supporting action that was once great, but her appearance made it better tenfold. Though a woman in heart, when it comes to her sensitivity, there\'s nothing else that could beat her likeness as her closeness with Sophia re-enacts her decision to protect her ultimate goal (as like a mother to daughter).Luke, yet another Makai Alchemist, and one that might be the most stubborn in the crew, but yet has a life mission in his hands: to overcome his past of a family conflict when he was trained to be a Makai Knight by his father, Knight (now the Dark Knight which serves El Dorado) until the gruesome murder of his mother became the source of hate for him against Knight which he swore his revenge on, improving his skills and awaiting the days where he could take down the Dark Knight, eliminating the hate of years gone by. The gun-welding person in the crew, with bullets targeted to manipulate and eradicate Horrors, he sometimes cannot be empathized for his behavior against the others, but at times the figure of understanding his past gives light to who he is in training towards the fights that he encounters, that solidifies him as the support character in the most sensical way.The Horrors, Bishop, Knight and Queen, did their job at stopping the Makai Knights from realizing their goals, and I\'d bet that they truly evoke the ""pure evil"" tried-and-true villain requirements, that was handsomely put down by the thought of the Makai Knights whose goals have been to eradicate Horrors from the get=go.Overall, a wide range of the cast of characters, but the good kind of showy action.Art/Animation:I\'m a huge fan of MAPPA\'s works, so to see that their expertise from the very get-go doesn\'t draw any cutback and instead let us right through into the scenes...with intensive action that\'s led by the CGI effects. Here\'s the caveat though: Often outlandish action doesn\'t mean the action lines up with whatever the storytelling is, but whatever Garo: Vanishing Line does, it strikes the chord of well-balanced heavy action with the storytelling, with switching from light-hearted to dark, depressing moments. Props to MAPPA for a series that has consistently improved ever since the 1st installment (since I\'ve heard that the preceding ones didn\'t do as well of a job as this one does).Sound:With cool, good-looking action, comes some crazy-intense BGM, and it\'s finger lickin\' good (and yes I know it\'s a pun, but it really supports the action VERY outstandingly well, and always gets me pumped for whatever\'s to come).

And it was actually a quite nice watch. Nothing mind-blowing or world-changing, but a comfortable and colourful watch. This is my first entry to the Garo-franchise, so I will have no comparisons with the other series in the Garo-universe in my review.The story is a bit slow paced, taking its time to its finishing line (yes, pun intended). As gathered from the synopsis, the main story is about the girl Sophie Hennes and the Makai knight Sword, and their common goal to find this...mystery Eldorado. Its about more than that though. The story takes place in a more or less post-apocalyptic US-like country, with isolated cities scattered throughout. Horrors (demon-like creatures) is rooming the landscape and infiltrating the cities, hunting for human flesh and souls. Humans are usually not aware about the existence of these creatures, and it happens quite frequently that they get possessed by one when their emotions get dark and the horrors get attracted by those emotions. Once possessed, the person can never get human again and the only way to salvation is to get killed along with the horror. Against this threat, a secret group of people exist, the Makai Knights. Their sole purpose is to defeat horrors and protect people from them at all costs. There are different types of Makai Knight´s, like the gunslinger, heavy-sword fighter, or the alchemist, but all have in common that they can use magic of some sort. Sophie is an orphan and are looking for her older brother, and Sword is trying to make up with his with his past.The basic idea isn´t overly original, deep or thought provoking. But as a mentioned before, it has a nice vibe, sometimes cosy and sometimes right out horrifying (yes, pun intended again). It has classic cool elements, like, a young girl looking for her brother, monster that needs to be slain, and personal problems that need to be solved. The main story is built on progressively throughout an otherwise episodic pattern which ebbs out towards the end by getting more coherent. The episodes of episodic nature often have common themes though, like searching for a clue about Eldorado, fighting horrors and other enemies, and eating delicious meals. And some are used to get to know the key characters and their pasts, or current paths. I think it was a nice touch.Is this MAPPA´s most dazzling creation? No, it gets quite obvious that Garo: VL wasn´t their top priority. It looks very good in the beginning, but slowly drops in quality to hit a low somewhere half-way, to get a bit better towards the end again. Especially the art. I like the fact that they used a very strong and distinct colour palette, with vibrant red, purple, yellow, pink, brown, blue and green. I think that drew home the atmosphere of the show. The action scenes can be a “wow” or “whaat?!” experience. They often have neck breaking speed, but if you force yourself to really watch, the movements make sense. Watched like that, they actually became kind of cool, but it demands effort. Character designs are good and original enough, with distinguishing traits.Speaking of the characters, they were actually pretty good. Once again, not ground breaking, but good. Sophie is stubborn, naïve but brave in her own way. Sword is the classic brawny explosive character with a huge fancy for the opposite sex. At first, he has no intentions to team up with Sophie, but she´s quite persistent, and together with some unavoidable events, starts to warm up to her. I digged their dynamic. Tina and Luke are also pretty interesting in their own way. Luke is your quiet and brooding type of guy, which has roots in his past. Tina is your typical femme fatale, but with a pretty heavy arsenal up her sleeve. I liked their individual journey´s and chapters. The rest varied in quality and appeal, but many filled out the story well.The sound and soundtrack are decent enough, but nothing overly exiting either. The VA´s (Japanese) were all more than ok, and well matched with their character.So, to summon things up, I liked Garo: VL quite a lot. Not an 8 maybe, but a solid 7. I will probably re-watch it to get a better all over flow and feeling of it, I have a suspicion that Garo: VL is better watched that way. Sadly, this show seems to have been put in the shadows these past two seasons, and probably never will have a larger audience. Which is a shame, because Garo: VL probably has better qualities than more than half what’s been airing at the same time. I can warmly recommend you Garo: VL if you are into classic action-hero stories, don´t have a problem with slower paced episodic narrative and can accept some quality fluxes in the art and animation. mystery Eldorado.

Are you looking for some action? Here is the place!Garo:Vanishing line is a standalone anime, so you don\'t need to watch the older Garos in order to watch this one. What is this about? Well the sypnosis probably tells it better but in summary: Knights and Alchemists fighting Horrors, making their way to uncover the mysteries of El Dorado.Why did I like it so much? Because it was great. It did exactly what I was looking for.Sometimes it feels like shows try to make action anime epic yet fail with some underhanded tactics. Either fights ending too soon, or...just not being hype enough. But... Garo did it right.The combination of the music, art and animation, and the fight scenes in general were well done.What about the story? There was a general story line about going to El Dorado. But... It was a bit lacking. Since it was a 2 cour, they had a lot of time to... strech? Some episodes didn\'t really contribute to the general story line and just showed some cool fights. So basically the story picks up its pace only later on.While it didn\'t feel the most original story ever, it was pretty unique. And you don\'t really need to reinvent the wheel in order for a story to be great.Sound was amazing, it made every fight scene make me hyped. Also, OP/ED were fine, nothing too impressive but not bad either.As for characters... There was some fine development. Some getting stronger, or for some we can see the relationships grow stronger.None of the characters really fall to ""cliches"" so that was pretty nice.Overall enjoyment- I didn\'t watch it weekly. I watched a bunch of episodes every month or two, and this week I binged the last 8 episodes. Binging it all together is a lot more fun than weekly in my opinion. Generally, I enjoyed that.Do I recommend it? YES I do! If you\'re an action lover, you\'ll probably like this.Bottom Score: 8/10Bonus part: Since I watched the very first Garo anime, I might want to compare it a little.Garo:Vanishing Line and the first Garo are pretty different because of the eras. (This one is modern, older one is in the middle ages). Vanishing Line was better.I felt like the older Garo was  nice to watch as well but I don\'t remember it being as hype as Vanishing line.

After few episodes I found myself wanting more, after half of this aired I started to feel something was lacking, what this lacks is a good arc, with few exceptions this show follows the episodic rule meaning you won\'t find longer arcs, the episode starts and by the end the conflict is over, of course there is the long arc which is the sole purpose of this anime who in the end fails to deliver and it brings the old twist that even a 5 year old kid might\'ve guessed.Art 6/10The animation here is better that it\'s predecessor which completely failed it. The 3DCG animation blends well with 2D .The character design here is good, showing masculine males when it needs and normal looking females. A good depiction of reality with various types of the human body.What I dislike here is the fact they didn\'t put enough effort in showing golden armor at it\'s full potential, the battles where short, you would catch a glimpse of the armor and everything is over in the next second.Sound 6/10The sound was okay, the voice acting was good and the songs where catchy. Nothing too memorable here.Character 3/10This is another bad thing about Vanishing Line. The characters are developed, but only in the case of good guys in the case of villains, the creator must thought something among these lines: ""I want some villain who is strong and also some drama."" ""How about some one sided character, a traitor who is obsessed with power for no apparent reason?"" ""Great! Let\'s do that!"". While others are just there with some brief explanations thrown in haste.While the characters are developed up to some point they stop growing in more directions and when they grow unidirectional the attachment towards them won\'t change. In my case I was neutral to all because they lacked solid backstories. Heck, I might be attached more to a random character who appears for 2 minutes just to be killed for the sake of story, than the main characters.Enjoyment 3/10 and Overall 4/10A story that tries to be different but falls in the cliché category too many times, lack of solid twists, predicable developments, although I wasn\'t particularity displeased in every episode, there are several good episodes in this, I was left hoping for more and it seems it was just another Garo anime made to milk the original series with no intention of surpassing it.This was too long for it\'s own sake, this could\'ve ended in 12-13 episodes without significant content loss, this fails to bring out the full potential of Garo, the spotlight is more on horrors than the Golden Knight. As a movie this could\'ve been much better,great even, but as a 24 episodes run this stretched for too long, leaving much potential unused and failing to bring in light what could\'ve made this a better anime.As a verdict and also a summary of everything above all I will say is: You might enjoy this if you are not looking for something outstanding, you don\'t look for too much in your characters, you are happy with action anime that shows little action. Or you are looking for a normal anime, not a part of Garo series, this is okay but as a Garo anime this is a disappointment.For those who want to get into Garo series I\'d recommend to watch the original anime or the live action, just stay away from this and the other Garo anime. will make you beg for more is what Vanishing Line lacks.Story 5/10Let\'s talk about the story.The story starts good, looking promising.

I haven\'t watched the previous Garo series so I\'ll write this based just on Vanishing Line.2. I don\'t pretend to go deep.3. No spoilers.]I got hyped by Garo: Vanishing Line trailer, I think the promotional video is great. The first episode is really catching: animation, art, soundtrack and fight scenes are outstanding.No doubt that the strong points of Vanishing Line are the same of the debut episode: Soundtrack, fights and art/animation. I\'m amazed by their OST and how they managed to fit the animation (fights, calm scenes, dramatic scenes, etc). I would recommend Garo: Vanishing Line for anyone who enjoys great...sync between music and animation.The character design is great too, the characters are very unique and has their personality well built in mostly times. The artwork is beautiful and they made an effort to create awesome illlustrations along the episodes.But now talking about the weak points: Plot holes. Some things ""just happen"", without any explanation or suggestion how it happened (mostly on the final arc). Some events feels very improbable but so convenient to the main characters get out well from a bad situation. I know convenience is common to main shonen characters but in this case you can really feel missing something, like it SHOULD have more about it to be more interesting and logical. At least to feel they fought for it, not they luckly and magically got something solved by ???.Well, to conclude I really enjoyed the anime and I would recommend it for any shonen fan. Even with plot holes the story is enjoyable and the OST and fight scenes are really worth to watch. Extra points for Luke\'s development too. sync between music and animation.The character design is great too, the characters are very unique and has their personality well built in mostly times.

Extra points for Luke\'s development too.', 'Story 8 / 10:For me the story really kept my attention from beginning to end. I was interested in it even with some of the ""filler"" episodes with side stories for some of the main characters. I think it was a very engaging story up until the very end and while I predicted a few of the plot points along the way, most of the reveals were surprising to me and that kept the story even more interesting. While it didn\'t move me to tears myself, there were also plenty of moments that struck my heart and I think that\'s effective.Art 7 / 10:The art...wasn\'t overly outstanding to me, yet good enough to see some moments and go ""oh, that\'s nice."" Like I said, it wasn\'t anything higher than a 7 by any means, but I definitely think it would be doing it a great shame to rate it any lower than good. There are some moments where the art and animation really do stand out and others where it isn\'t as interesting, so that\'s something one has to consider.Sound 6 / 10The soundtrack was alright to me. There were some good ones in there (the first op being one of those for me), but the music didn\'t particularly do anything for me worth mentioning otherwise.Character 9 / 10The characters were EXTREMELY enjoyable for me the entire time I was watching the series. Luke was my favorite from the beginning (as predictable as I am with my character favorite types), but the rest of the characters were just as appealing to me! Even the antagonists interested me even if we didn\'t get to know them on the same personal level as the main characters (unless you count Luke\'s father, I suppose). All of their backstories and how they acted and interacted with one another made them extremely likable in every way.Enjoyment 9 / 10I really enjoyed Garo: Vanishing Line from beginning to end. While I may have mentioned that Garo didn\'t make me cry earlier on, I must say that it ALMOST made me cry a few times because I was touched. It also made me smile and laugh and I was excited for a new episode every week. It is definitely a show I feel sadness about it\'s ending and feel as if I\'m missing a little piece of Friday now that it\'s all over.Overall 8 / 10I give this show an 8 at the end of the day because while there are some portions of it that are considered average, at the end of the day Garo: Vanishing Line was a very entertaining show that kept my attention and excitement every week for the past 24 episodes. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and would rewatch it at any given chance. wasn\'t overly outstanding to me, yet good enough to see some moments and go ""oh, that\'s nice."" Like I said, it wasn\'t anything higher than a 7 by any means, but I definitely think it would be doing it a great shame to rate it any lower than good. There are some moments where the art and animation really do stand out and others where it isn\'t as interesting, so that\'s something one has to consider.Sound 6 / 10The soundtrack was alright to me. There were some good ones in there (the first op being one of those for me), but the music didn\'t particularly do anything for me worth mentioning otherwise.Character 9 / 10The characters were EXTREMELY enjoyable for me the entire time I was watching the series. Luke was my favorite from the beginning (as predictable as I am with my character favorite types), but the rest of the characters were just as appealing to me! Even the antagonists interested me even if we didn\'t get to know them on the same personal level as the main characters (unless you count Luke\'s father, I suppose). All of their backstories and how they acted and interacted with one another made them extremely likable in every way.Enjoyment 9 / 10I really enjoyed Garo: Vanishing Line from beginning to end. While I may have mentioned that Garo didn\'t make me cry earlier on, I must say that it ALMOST made me cry a few times because I was touched. It also made me smile and laugh and I was excited for a new episode every week. It is definitely a show I feel sadness about it\'s ending and feel as if I\'m missing a little piece of Friday now that it\'s all over.Overall 8 / 10I give this show an 8 at the end of the day because while there are some portions of it that are considered average, at the end of the day Garo: Vanishing Line was a very entertaining show that kept my attention and excitement every week for the past 24 episodes. I would definitely recommend it to anyone and would rewatch it at any given chance.', 'I have a feeling that this show is underrated. Many does not give it a chance because of CGI even tho it is only used in some parts that require it.It is a very entertaining and action-packed story which is certainly one of the better action animes.It is a world where humans who get too much hatred and greed might be consumed by the darkness and be turned into a monster who kills for something ""El Dorado"" which the protectors are trying to find out about.There are so many different stories and moments, and you get to know many characters in a special...way that is not just a flashback of something pointless, but something that makes sense. Its so interesting!On Crunchyroll every single episode has gotten a 5-star and 4,5/5 on reviews of the anime. Some of the reviews are ofc just about the first episode complaining about the cgi.I AM JUST SAYING GIVE IT A TRY :P way that is not just a flashback of something pointless, but something that makes sense.

However, the many episodic side stories mean it's all repeated too often, allowing it to go stale before the end.Once the show starts to get boring, it's a lot easier to notice the poor writing and inconsistencies, as well as more difficult to forgive them.There's a lot of fanservice in this but it's all western-friendly, only adult characters. The humour isn't great but it does keep the show from getting...too heavy, it also has quite a lot of flashbacks.This would be a brilliant show if it hadn't been drawn out into 24 episodes, I recommend watching at least the 1st one, but due to the series' length, it does get tedious in places. too heavy, it also has quite a lot of flashbacks.This would be a brilliant show if it hadn't been drawn out into 24 episodes, I recommend watching at least the 1st one, but due to the series' length, it does get tedious in places."", 'So i have never seen any other anime in this family... but it was very interesting to watch. There is a lot about the nature of the Horrors that i did not understand from the anime as a stand alone, maybe they were answered in the previous animes. The setting is very interesting and takes you to a bunch of different places, giving you a bit of variety. The story is probably its weakest point but it had a lot of potential. The battle scenes were fun and cool but at some point they started to feel flashy for flashinesses sake. The characters were all...pretty fun and i liked how the main character developed by the end.Overall its a fun anime to watch but I genuinely wish they developed the story just a little more and gave more information on the Horrors, the alchemists, and the knights. I dont really understand where they came from or how they became what they are. Anyhow, i give it an 8 overall. pretty fun and i liked how the main character developed by the end.Overall its a fun anime to watch but I genuinely wish they developed the story just a little more and gave more information on the Horrors, the alchemists, and the knights.

The story and relationships therein are built up gradually with each episode. There is mystery involved that I am only really starting to unravel now in the 18th episode. I find myself progressively more stoked when another episode is released. I'm quite interested to find out how this ends.I see reference to the use of CG. I personally greatly dislike CG. What was used is subtle and scant.The reviewer who stated something to the effect of this being like watching 2 shows in...one was accurate in this description. There is the greater story that you progress through, and every few episodes seem to cover another story at the same time. I think this is helpful to keep you engaged as the main story is a bit slow going, but progressively more interesting in the later episodes as the relationships are more established and you are more invested in the characters.These sub-stories are also helpful to build character depth and give you insight into the greater story.I've laughed, I've cried. There's suspense and intrigue. I recommend. one was accurate in this description.

Maybe this one is less profoundly stupid and manages to be a sentai show for adults that actually respects its audience\'s intelligence.Story:Sophia Hennes is an orphan who just wants to find her brother. He disappeared one day with the words ""El Dorad"" left on his computer screen. Sophia goes to a famous psychic hoping for a clue but, like all psychics, he\'s fake. He\'s also a monstrous horror who tries to kill her. Which is almost as bad. Fortunately for her, she\'s rescued...by the mysterious Sword who transforms into a golden knight on his motorcycle and slays the horror. He also happens to be looking for the secret behind El Dorado. Which sets the pair on the same path.This has the exact same fundamental flaw as the other Garo series. It wants to have a lot of excessive violence and some sexual content thereby making it for older teenagers or adults but it\'s written at the level of a children\'s series. Every single twist is exceedingly obvious far before it happens, but the series always acts as though it\'s doing something shocking. We all knew who King was the moment he sent his people to bring Sophia unharmed to El Dorado. We also knew who was using Sword\'s name the moment you talked about the corporation responsible in connection to his back story.I don\'t know whether the writers are inept imbeciles who think they\'re being clever because they couldn\'t figure out the obvious twists or they just have very low opinions of their own audience.Vanishing Line also has the other hallmarks of very childish writing with monsters of the week, one dimensional antagonists and being adverse to taking any real risks. Which also results in it having a kind of shit ending. Seriously, the most surprising thing to happen in the series is when we see the three identical chefs take off their hats and glasses and they look different. Which doesn\'t matter since they have so little personality that they could be one character any way. Plus it happens at the very end, so we never even get to see anyone else react to it.I also want to briefly mention the ""noble sacrifice"" scene. Because it\'s pretty bad. See, there\'s a point where one character is forced to sacrifice himself to protect Sophia. Which is really obviously going to happen because they give a speech that\'s a really clear flag for it, but that\'s not the issue with it. The issue is that about ten seconds after it happens, reinforcements show up and the writers act like it was a noble, necessary move even though they could have literally not done anything and the reinforcements would have gotten there in time. Also, the reinforcements approach Sophia from behind even though they clearly establish that there\'s a sheer cliff directly behind her. Because of course no one was editing this shit.Characters:So, all our characters are one note clichés. The one thing that separates this cast from the cast of that other Garo series is that two of them are really obnoxious clichés. Mainly, Sword and Sophia. Sword is that type of protagonist who loves to party and have a good time but he comes through in the end. Which is always an obnoxious archetype just because every character like that acts really annoying in any situation where their life isn\'t directly in danger.Sophia is one of those optimistic child hang on characters. They don\'t do much on their own, but they\'re always by the protagonist\'s side and providing motivation for them. And those characters are annoying unless they\'re well developed and given depth. But depth is a fully foreign concept to this series, so that\'s never going to happen.Art:MAPPA\'s artwork is mostly pretty decent. The biggest issue is that some of the action sequences are over the top to the point of being incoherent. Just a bunch of blur-lines clashing against each other. But the monster designs, character designs and backgrounds are all pretty nicely done. And most of the action sequences are basically acceptable.Sound:The acting is passable.\xa0Vanishing Line\xa0is one of those anime where the complete lack of character depth results in performances that are a bit mundane but where you can still tell that the actors are better than this. Kugimiya Rie, Shimazaki Nobunaga, Koshimizu Ami & Seki Tomokazu are all skilled professionals who occasionally take roles in rubbish because they have to make a living. The music is a bit shit. Maybe not inaudibly horrendous but it\'s certainly the worst I\'ve heard from MONACA.Ho-yay:The closest we get is Sophia\'s friend hanging onto her a bit. Which she does while talking about boys so either she\'s trying to get a sense of whether Sophia is into boys or she\'s just at that age where boys temporarily don\'t seem gross. It\'s hard to tell with a generic friend character who happens to be shallower than a spilled thimble of water on an unseasonably warm day.Areas of Improvement:Know your audience. If you want to write for adults, you can\'t make all your twists this obvious. You can\'t make your characters this trite. Well, you technically can but it\'ll be a shit product.Develop your characters. Honestly, even a good children\'s series will have better characterisation than this.If you\'re going to have a noble sacrifice, make it matter. Don\'t cheapen it by having reinforcements show up so quickly that it renders the act pointless.Final Thoughts:In many ways, this has the same problems that plagued the other Garo series I reviewed. Same childish writing. Same shallow, trite characters. What makes this one a bit worse are that it has annoying generic characters, its music isn\'t anywhere near as good and the action sequences aren\'t as strong. Which is why I\'m giving Vanishing Line a 3/10. And I\'m honestly tempted to go lower.

Good production values and plenty of fun action should be up the alley of a lot of people.Animation / Art / General Visuals - 8/10-----------------------------------------------The visual quality is very good across the board. Action scenes are high octane with good animation, mixing and matching more traditional anime and some subtle 3D. Art style is detailed and expressions on point.Sound / Music / Voice Acting - 8/10...------------------------------------------Sound and voice acting is great, with the Soundtrack especially worth noting. A lot of heavy metal bangers that fit the show perfectly. Whether it's some gun blasting action or sword swinging, or riding a jacked up bike, the music hits hard.Story - 7/10-------------When it comes down to it, the story isn't anything super notable.A young teenage girl, searching for her lost brother, accidentally stumbles into a world of demon like creatures who come to be from the negative emotions of humans. She is then saved by a mysterious knight, who turns out to be from an order that eliminates said demons - or horrors - from the world. Any civilians who witness such things are brainwashed to forget.However, the girl and the knight who saved her have something in common, a certain keyword relating to their lost siblings, so they join up to solve the mystery.The show follows a fairly episodic approach for a lot of its runtime. With our protagonists dealing with one horror attack after another, all the while the main mystery slowly develops on the side.Eventually the story focuses on the main situation and they along with a few other characters go to solve it.Ultimately the main story is kinda weak. With the main villain and their motivations somewhat lackluster. Secondary villains are similarly rather underdeveloped and boring.Still, things are pretty solid overall, and works just fine as a justification to get some action done.Characters - 7/10---------------------There isn't really a singular main character in this show. Both the teenage heroine and her protector, the magical knight, share most of the MC burdens, though additional secondary characters get enough screen time as well.The girl is a pretty standard teenage character with not much to make her stand out, other than her internet skills, and a persistent attitude. Luckily she's quite likeable, despite being largely useless, and acting like a damsel in distress more often than not.The magical knight, or Garo, the namesake of the show's title and the other main focus, is quite different. A proper macho man, who enjoys big boobs and big steaks at the diner. He's more jacked than The Rock, and takes care of business in the most straight forward manner imaginable. Using his fists or sword.Secondary characters feature a brooding magical marksman ally, as well as a woman who employs everything from spears to magic, to gatling guns, and her big pair of boobs to get the work done.All in all, all are quite likeable and don't have any particularly annoying traits.---Total - 8/10---Garo is a surprisingly good anime that seems to have gone largely unnoticed. It doesn't really break any new ground, but it has good fundamentals, decent enough of a story, good characters, and production values. Tons of high octane action and a badass soundtrack to boot.If you're into contemporary, magic and monster filled anime that features plenty of blood and guts flying about as heavy metal blasts, this is a show for you. ------------------------------------------Sound and voice acting is great, with the Soundtrack especially worth noting.

Girls & Panzer: Dai 63-kai Senshadou Zenkoku Koukousei Taikai Recap,https://myanimelist.net/anime/36783/Girls___Panzer__Dai_63-kai_Senshadou_Zenkoku_Koukousei_Taikai_Recap,[]
Genius Party,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3508/Genius_Party,"[""Genius Party represents 7 short animated films made by various talented anime directors of Japan. Unlike 1 minute long Anikuri, creators had 15-20 minutes this time, to fully express themselves and have an impact on spectators. Each episode is special in their own ways so I'll comment laconic on every of them.Genius Party – What an amazing way to begin the series! Atsuko Fukushima, also known from makin op/ed of Robot Carnival served her job and made an excellent introduction episode. It's very surreal, full of symbolisms and graphic looks also a lot better than in Robot Carnival.Shanghai Dragon –  Yet again we...see Shouji Kawamori from the different side. I really love his sense of humour. I enjoyed watching Project Omega in Anikuri and this parody short isn't an exception either. Yea there are lots of mechas, lots of actions but still the main attention is directed to an useless brat which saves the world. Characters really manage to shine in this 20 minutes.Deathtic 4 – My least favourite part. There's lack of story, depth and characterization. The only thing that makes Deathtic special is 3D graphic. Shinji Kimura was working on it after all. He has done a marvellous job for Steamboy as well, which is the most expensive animated film in Japanese history.Doorbell – Very unique. First of all I must say that the Director is Yoji Fukuyama , who isn't famous with anime at all. The atmosphere is really intense whole 15 minutes long. The design isn't as strong as the story, though I mostly enjoyed it. Anyway Doorbell is another interesting version of developing Paranoia.Limit Cycle – Philosophy is always the strongest point of anime, that's why Limit Cycle is one of the best episode. 20 minute of monologue about life, death, religion and etc. But what mostly surprised me was the name of the Director: Hideki Futamura. In most of animes where he took part in, Hideki had a secondary role. So this was his time to shine and he definitely managed to show us his talent.Happy Machine – Another Surreal addition to Genius Party from Masaaki Yuasa.Yea, he's the one I was looking forward to most and I must admit that Happy Machine didn't disappoint me at all and remains as my favourite short. I also understand that 15-20 minute isn't enough for a build-up + satisfying result + big impact but that's what directors should resolve and Masaaki Yuasa did stand out.Baby Blue – Baby Blue is another high-school romance with some action elements in it. What also made it outstanding was the characters and sweet soundtrack. In a nutshell Baby Blue is a worthy appendage to Genius Party collection.So Genius Party is a great chance to get know to some remarkable Directors and their talents. I am sure everyone will find their favourite ones. As for me I think strongest ones were definitely Happy Machine and Limit Cycle. The only thing I was a bit disappointed with was the romance shorts. Anikuri within 1 minute had much more to offer. I mean the episode from Akemi Hayashi (Gainax) exceeded my expectations. Overall the shorts itself are creative, neat and although they do vary somewhat in quality, there is so much to see in such little time that it is more than worth it. see Shouji Kawamori from the different side.

Its mechanisms are complex, and only after many years of observation and exploration have we begun to understand their functions. Certainly, the examination of multicellular organisms warrants a much more exhausting amount of research. Even more sophisticated is the existence of life so varied and so involved that it involves taxonomical classification schemes and entire bodies of research. Plants have different organs which serve specific purposes, are able to reproduce sexually, and perhaps most interestingly, transform sunlight into energy for life. Animals consume other creatures and have a conscience, exhibiting specific social and survival patterns and are...able to learn from their experiences and transform their sensory input into wisdom. Humans go as far as to have sentience and grammar. Where does the extent of our ability to understand life lie, and what is the attainable extent of life? These questions may not be answered in our lifetimes, or ever. There may be no answers.Genius Party is a brilliant anthology of mind-stimulating shorts which attempt to shatter modern animation paradigms. Driving the stories is the idea that the human mind is filled with unknowns, and that our universe is clearly incomprehensible. With such obvious observations, it follows that anime as an art need not have its content presented in a segmented and understandable way, for that would fail to emulate the very world we live in. Rather, life is too complex to be understood, and it is through its confusion and novelty that we must wade in order to find the answers. As human nature would have it, we can find meaning in anything as long as we believe in its significance, although whether or not anything truly has significance may be indiscernible.Commenting on Genius Party as a whole is difficult. It is, after all, a collection of disparate stories from a diverse cast of directors. They all succeed in providing a snapshot of current anime trends and capabilities, but their goals are as varied as their plots. It is without question that all the shorts have the asset of awesome animation, motivating soundtracks and captivating stories. Even if they fail to resonate with the audience, boredom seems distant due to the sheer novelty and excitement of the works.Genius Party comes highly recommended not only for the anime enthusiast, but for anyone who has even the slightest interest in cinema and entertainment. The audience is certain to pick favorites among the stories - which stories you find interesting may depend on your life experience and perspective. It may serve as an interesting exercise to contemplate why those stories click with you; you just might learn something about yourself. able to learn from their experiences and transform their sensory input into wisdom.

Limit CycleThis one was really bizarre. This is the longest short at about 18 minutes, but struck me as the worst of the whole thing. Basically a man made out of static and moving motifs goes on a very long, fast paced speech about.... literally nothing. Usually if I see someone say something attempted to sound complicated but falls under its own weight I don\'t believe them, but I see this as one of those cases. The man talks about...a variety of philosophical, religious, sexual, and biblical topics with absolutely no context, all in one stream. This must have been a nightmare to sub, it was almost a nightmare to watch as well. Maybe the point of this short went completely over my head, I wouldn\'t put it past me, but if you are expecting any kind of explanation of what is going on or any kind of basic premise on which your interpretation can be based on, you will not find it in this short. If I had to guess optimistically, the point was to be as chaotic and nonsensical as possible, in order to make some sort of ""sentence-art"" phenomenon to go on. This would work out well with the visuals, which are extremely spectacular, both technically and creatively speaking. A variety of colorful motifs and symbols take up the screen most of the time, and it is cool to see. Not enough to make the short itself fun though, unlike in the Genius Party opening short.6. DoorbellThis short also struck me as weaker than the rest. The premise revolves around college student looking man, who finds himself unable to walk into places or houses because a specter of himself is already in the house, and no one can see him. This sounds strange on paper, its also strange on screen. Although this short is about 13 minutes, it still felt a bit too long. At least half of the short revolved around the nameless main character walking around town, which isn\'t exactly a technical marvel or art style or animation I might add. In the end it was rather boring because of this, as well a premise that didn\'t interest me. The climax obviously carries some deeper meaning, and I won\'t reveal exactly what it is just in case some are reading the review without seeing it. My interpretation is that the young man is either bipolar, or it has something to do with how people put on different faces and sub-personalities based on their environment. Definitely not strong on that though, as it was an ambiguous climax. I wouldn\'t watch this one a second time.5. Shanghai DragonThe theme of this short is the imagination of children, and the premise is a young chinese boy acquires a futuristic device that allows him to create basically anything using it like chalk, that is he makes a drawing out of something with it on the ground and it comes into reality. Overall I was mixed with this one. Unlike Doorbell or Limit Cycle, I never got bored while watching it, but I wasn\'t stunned by anything either. The theme of children\'s imagination conquering the evil robot overlords was cool but, when you think about it, all of these Genius Party shorts already have a theme on imagination to begin with. The visuals definitely had a style to them, but it wasn\'t a very unique style like the one used in Deathtic 4. The action and chase sequences were both very fun to watch, as well as the finishing scene were the boy powers up into his imaginative toku suit of armor to fight evil. Again, didn\'t blow me away but its just another addition to the compilation, and is good variety in retrospect. Cool crayon art stuff on some scenes. Salute to Sai and his cuban cigars.4. Baby BlueThis short is directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, the well known director of Cowboy Bebop and Samurai Champloo. A high school student asks a girl to skip class with him and go somewhere. The girl agree and they head off, all the while small talking and reminiscing a little bit. It turns out they don\'t really know where they are going, but eventually decide they want to make a turn for the beach, and off they go. Baby Blue features very hushed voice acting, which gives off a subtle feel compared to the rest of the compilation, and the banter between the two really complimented the atmosphere well. This isn\'t one of those shorts that tries to hit you over the head with symbolism, its just kind of a simple story that I can\'t really describe much further without spoiling, but it works well. There were some funny scenes too, most notably the part where they were intercepted by the bike cop. Bike cop had a cool voice too, good audio experience indeed. I liked the ending too. Another good short and a nice quiet anime to compliment with the crazy action of some of the other shorts. Besides that, not much else to say about this one.3. Genius Party (short)This is the titular short of the compilation, the first of the pack in order, and also the shortest at around 5 minutes. It is similar to Limit Cycle in where, you really don\'t know what the hell is going on. That is to say the events that transpire are without any form of context are background information. Big difference though, it isn\'t 18 minutes long and full of monotonous nonsense. Instead, its an explosive piece of animation, with awesome art style and spectacular choreography to boot. Everything is colorful and complimentary, it is a huge visual and audio presentation and a great way to start off the short. An animation explosion is what it is. It\'s so short you could watch it on youtube in a few minutes so I won\'t say whats going on in the short besides theres these really happy rocks and they love to dance. Great anime.2. Deathtic 4CGI oh no! The CGI is really cool though because it has something many CGI anime lack, and that is detail to the art. Usually because CGI isn\'t meant to look like art i.e drawings in the first place, thats for the modern traditionally animated anime. This short features a bunch of zombie dudes trying to send a frog who fell into zombie land through a tornado in the sky or something (Uzu Uzu.) They get embroiled in some shit on the way. Plot is straightforward. Fantastic art though seriously, its like some kind of woodcut style thing. I usually hate CGI but I really loved the style of the background and the art. The style was particularly cool, everything is dead and zombieish, character designs fit the bill and they are all very unique. Props to the zombie police and Posse. This was one of the most entertaining shorts for me, mostly due to the reasons above, I really like when the shorts feature experimental animation or art or cool design, this one has all three. Details on the CGI, its basically like the characters themselves are computer generated, but they have a caricature style that you usually don\'t see in CGI anime, although you see it in western CGI alot. The backgrounds were mostly drawn in though. Anyways its a short with a simple premise but its unique because of some really funny scenes and cool style. Also all of the characters speak in some kind of bizarre, incomprehensible Scandinavian/Russian which only adds to the out of worldness of the environment.1. Happy MachineThis was my favorite short in the compilation, and is directed by one of my favorite directors, Yuasa Masaaki who directed Kaiba, Kemonozume, and The Tatami Galaxy. If you had to relate this short to anything complete he has worked on, it would be Kaiba. In a sense, Happy Machine is a visual prototype for the style and the atmosphere featured in full on Kaiba. The visuals and the design of characters, creatures etc. are very unique, in fact they are my favorite of the entire short, even more so than in Deathtic 4. I love how chaotic and enjoyable the director can make a short with such a simple premise that it goes without words, but will go with words for the sake of the review: A baby is taken care of in a bizarre machination of a day care center, only to leave it on a combination of impulse and accident, and ends up venturing out in a world that really doesn\'t have any laws of physics to speak of. The short is made up of several main scenes, like parts where the baby encounters a flame who burns his crackers, and riding a gigantic horse plant thing. It is not reliant on detail to add to the experience, instead more so on really cool atmosphere, music, and funny scenes. This is a kind of anime that you can just turn your brain off too and go wide with wonder, kind of like the baby. I wonder if this was the intention. Happy Machine has a theme about the cycle of life that only really makes sense at the end of it. It is really entertaining, an animation and style experiment that eventually matured into Kaiba, which was also one of my favorite anime. A great one to watch with friends. a variety of philosophical, religious, sexual, and biblical topics with absolutely no context, all in one stream.

It will let down a shoujo or josei fan big time, mecha fan also doesn't have a lot, action fan could just leave in the middle! It's mainly a playground for the directors to try their intersting ideas that they always wanted to bring to life. Their shorts are sure unique, but also weird at times! It is a try to be universal, but as I said, weird factor! :)It doesnt't mean that the shorts suck. But they don't represent anime in general.

Great animation and an interesting action packed storyline. 7/10Deathtic 4 boosts brilliant 3D animation, but not much else. The storyline and characters all lack depth and perception, though the idea itself of a zombie world is fairly interesting. 6/10Doorbell at first appears to be boring, but don\'t be fooled, the conclusion clears up the confusion and leaves you with a strange feeling and a particular concept. The animation personally I didn\'t like. 6.5/10Limit Cycle. A monologue that explores the philosophy of life, God, the Man.The animation compliments the text, a compilation of flashing moving pictures which give an overall feel of thought and dreams. It gives life through an entirely different perspective than daily life and addresses life\'s questions in what feels like a different dimension. What is God? What is nature? Watch with an open mind and let it take you through thoughts and feelings on a whole different level. Truly a ""genius party"" in a sense. 8/10Happy Machine contains the rare quality of surreal reality, similar to that of Kaiba. With quirky animation you are landed with a baby and its adventures through the peculiar world and its dazzling creations. 7.5/10Baby Blue.

Good start, very good animation, colorful, original and a good sound accompaniment. 6/10· 'Shanghai Dragon' Shoji Kawamori:Fifty years ago some Chinese children discover a strange sword in the schoolyard, one of them picks it up and it lights up. If the thing started well with the first short this second one breaks that feeling. Neither the animation, nor the story or anything have something special, and not only that, it also tells something very typical in the world of manga and anime, and also with that geek tone that...unfortunately presents so many things in that industry. 2/10· 'Deathtic 4' Shinji Kimura:A zombie child has a living frog, zombie police punish anyone who has a living being. One afternoon he meets with some friends to throw the frog to a hurricane that connects the world of the dead with that of the living.Very funny, has a striking animation and a great atmosphere, with touches of Tim Burton's works, or a series that I loved as a child, 'Courage the Cowardly Dog'. 6/10· 'Door Chime' Yoji Fukuyama:A boy sees how a clone of his is ahead of everything he wants to do, so that others do not notice his presence.Short with classic animation without too much charm and somewhat rigid. The story is fine, but manga like 'Gantz' play it with a lot more depth. 4/10· 'Limit Cycle' Hideki Futamura:A series of fascinating images accompanied by a discourse about God, humans and others. The background is too pretentious, it wants to be deep but it is rather senseless, bombastic phrases one after the other that globally mean nothing. Still it is a good experience, especially for its visual section. 6/10· 'Happy Machine' Masaaki Yuasa:A child is connected to a machine that makes him dream and live adventures in strange places. Previously I had already seen the feature film 'Mind Game', by this same director. I thought that I would like this short film because of the good impression that that movie gave to me, but it was not at that level, I was left quite cold. 5/10· 'Baby Blue' Shinichiro Watanabe:A boy goes with a friend to the beach instead of going to class.The short with better atmosphere and more suggestive. The bad, that unfortunately and as usually happens in the anime show the world and things from a point of view pretty gullible and ridiculous.

All of the stories  Genius Party, Shanghai Dragon, Deathtic 4, Doorbell, Limit Cycle, Happy Machine, and Baby Blue are creative and encapsulating. I enjoyed six out of seven of the stories, Limit Cycle being the one I least enjoyed. The rest of the stories are truly unique experiences and have a defined artistic direction. Genius Party the first film is mesmerizing, captivating and leaves me with a positive feeling after watching. Genius Party has entertaining imagery with a symbolic story as many of these stories do. The second film Shanghai Dragon is funny,...adorable, and kinda awesome. The mc is a boy and he is adorable. The mc is surrounded by action and fantasy with really well done cool fight scenes. The third film Deathtic 4 is so creepy and weird, but with so much artistic value. I really love the direction of this story it is so funny and interesting. The characters are so goofy and the art is weirdly amazing. Doorbell is the fourth film and it is so freaky and wholesome. The story gives off a sad vibe and tells an oddly meaningful story. The fifth film is Limit Cycle and to be honest it put me to sleep. The film is droning and overwhelming in its excessive audio. I kind of like that aspect but it does not hold the same uniqueness as the other stories do. The sixth film Happy Machine is the most solid film and it is so humble, sad, meaningful, and enjoyable. I love the main character being a baby going through a psychedelic experience of sorts. This one is full of hallucinogen inducing imagery and cutesy fun; made me go through the emotions watching it. The seventh film is Baby Blue and its sad and romantic. All I can say is melancholic story. Now all of these stories are worth watching and enjoying.

GIANT MECHAS!!! TOTAL COMBAT!!! Everything has just thrown into that situation and the results match as a pass (as in succeed). Also, most of the characters have made me change my mind about them in a flash and it was enjoyable and a bit crazy to watch.Deathic 4:  Aside from the impressive 3D animation and to live in the world of zombies (and being one), there isn’t much of a story around there, just crazy and goofy antics, which are okay but it didn’t leave it wanting more. In fact, I’ve gotten bored with that segment.Doorbell: This is one of those pieces that show an example of paranoia and mind-altering animation where a high school boy is wondering why is there another version of him cycling through his daily life. This one is where I’m very amused by this concept and it’s weird and hard to explain results at the end.Limit Cycle: As all anime fans should know, philosophy has always been a factor into anime and a 20-minute monologue going through that with the subjects of life, death, and religion and asking and answering any question about that. Once again, anime pieces like this should be watched more than one time to understand the point of the subject in order to expand your mind around the basic ideals of your own self and what is around you. But should it last over 20 minutes, which is half the time of what during the last two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion try to explain? That’s a maybe.Happy Machine: This is possibility more surreal than its other counterparts of the collection. It follows a baby exploring through some odd stages, befriending a fiery flame (briefly), a caterpillar-like giraffe and a green dog and also experiencing loss whenever something bad happens to them. I would say this is a head-scratcher but that would be redundant considering most of the shorts I covered so far is a head-scratcher.Baby Blue: Now to the one from Shinichiro Watanabe, the famed director of two of my favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop & Samurai Champloo. This is a high school romance piece about two people who enjoyed their night of love and maturing into adults with a bit of action thrown in, which is very dissonant of the previous Watanabe works and it shows and hopefully it could again with his upcoming series, Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope). Overall, this is an unusual turn for him and it was remarkably well-crafted. to well-known anime directors; I’m going to break down each and every short one by one.Let’s start with the shorts of Genius Party:Genius Party: While this is just the 5-minute opening that has a hand-puppet chicken and smiling rock heads, this is, in fact, a very strange and surreal opening to what is already considered to be fitted under the surreal category in anime and it is very impressive to look and be at awe.Shanghai Dragon: At first, you wonder why this is about some snot-nosed kid (no, really, he has a very snot-ridden nose and never bothers to wipe it out) discovering this magical crystal that you draw food with and then, ALIEN INVASION!!! GIANT MECHAS!!! TOTAL COMBAT!!! Everything has just thrown into that situation and the results match as a pass (as in succeed). Also, most of the characters have made me change my mind about them in a flash and it was enjoyable and a bit crazy to watch.Deathic 4:  Aside from the impressive 3D animation and to live in the world of zombies (and being one), there isn’t much of a story around there, just crazy and goofy antics, which are okay but it didn’t leave it wanting more. In fact, I’ve gotten bored with that segment.Doorbell: This is one of those pieces that show an example of paranoia and mind-altering animation where a high school boy is wondering why is there another version of him cycling through his daily life. This one is where I’m very amused by this concept and it’s weird and hard to explain results at the end.Limit Cycle: As all anime fans should know, philosophy has always been a factor into anime and a 20-minute monologue going through that with the subjects of life, death, and religion and asking and answering any question about that. Once again, anime pieces like this should be watched more than one time to understand the point of the subject in order to expand your mind around the basic ideals of your own self and what is around you. But should it last over 20 minutes, which is half the time of what during the last two episodes of Neon Genesis Evangelion try to explain? That’s a maybe.Happy Machine: This is possibility more surreal than its other counterparts of the collection. It follows a baby exploring through some odd stages, befriending a fiery flame (briefly), a caterpillar-like giraffe and a green dog and also experiencing loss whenever something bad happens to them. I would say this is a head-scratcher but that would be redundant considering most of the shorts I covered so far is a head-scratcher.Baby Blue: Now to the one from Shinichiro Watanabe, the famed director of two of my favorite anime, Cowboy Bebop & Samurai Champloo. This is a high school romance piece about two people who enjoyed their night of love and maturing into adults with a bit of action thrown in, which is very dissonant of the previous Watanabe works and it shows and hopefully it could again with his upcoming series, Sakamichi no Apollon (Kids on the Slope).

There is some pretty good art and animation but overall it never becomes too interesting. It seems like something I won\'t remember watching in a week. 5/10Shanghai Dragon - Fun to watch. Great action scenes....Touching story. 8/10Deathtic 4 - I don\'t know language they are speaking. 5/10Doorbell - With something like this everything hinges on how the ending of the film presents itself. It presents itself pretty well. 7/10Limit Cycle - I really don\'t understand this one at all. Although to be fair I gave up listening to the voice-over about half way through. There are some nice visuals present but I could never hope to decipher what they mean. 4/10Happy Machine - Like Shanghai Dragon, this short film is great fun to watch all the way through. Unlike Shanghai Dragon, Happy Machine has much less conventional storytelling and there is no dialogue present. It doesn\'t really need these things to be enjoyable however and the ending is like a cherry on top. 7/10Baby Blue - A fantastic roller coaster of a story that manages to stay believable and immersive throughout in spite of the ridiculous events that take place. In the 14 minutes this piece encompasses it managed to make me feel a more varied range of emotions than most full length anime series. 9/10 Touching story. 8/10Deathtic 4 - I don\'t know language they are speaking. 5/10Doorbell - With something like this everything hinges on how the ending of the film presents itself.

Just come out and say what you mean, the only people who need to hide behind fancy words are those who have nothing to truly say.Most of the shorts fall under ""please interpret me"" art. Even my favourite the one called ""Happy Machine"" feels like just an overlong metaphor for birth, life and death.Two of the three I liked, Happy Machine and Deathic4 really suffer from it but come out ahead because they feel like someone was actually trying to tell a story with Deathic4...and Happy Machine was at least cute looking.My favourite Baby Blue has an actual plot. It\'s about a boy and a girl cutting class and going on an adventure, mostly just for the heck of it but there are some deeper themes that are very heartfelt and actually work because BB allowed itself to have some characters and a plot! Who knew that BASIC STORY STRUCTURE IS A GOOD THING!!!!But the ending was absolutely ruined by being played at like, three frames and with a nasty grain effect over the whole thing that really undercut any of the emotion it was building to.But the rest are crap.There is one where green eyed John Travolta rambles nonsensically for like thirty minutes straight and that was the absolute nadir of quality.All the shorts have a weird problem with CGI. Its always done at a lower frame rate and multiple shorts re-use the same CGI car models as Initial D.I dont know, maybe if you really like art house stuff you\'ll be able to put up with it. and Happy Machine was at least cute looking.My favourite Baby Blue has an actual plot.

Haikara-san ga Tooru,https://myanimelist.net/anime/3335/Haikara-san_ga_Tooru,"[""(re-edited)It make me sad that not many people has seen this great anime Gekijouban Haikara San ga Tooru Despite being old /classic anime , It really has that historical ,comedy, drama romance that many would want to see.(okay maybe i exaggerated a little bit but it still kinda sad no one willing to do fansub on it). And fortunately i came across it and watch full episode of it with no subtitles . I'm also had seen the 2 movie that being produced last year.Story 8/10it sets the story at 1920 Taisho period where the country of Japan is start to modernized and west culture...was rising. Hanamura Benio is one of woman who intend to break free from the norm where she does thing that are unlikely done by a girl in that era, she wears western clothing, learn sword play ,fighting and many more. In other word Yes , she's a tomboyish girl where the haikara nickname given to her. The arranged marriage between her and Ijuuin Shinobu is the point in her life where it changes her life. The story is light and comedic and not many romance in it but it makes the moment  more special and precious to be await for. The beginning of story more to gag comedy and ridiculous, and it maybe hard to understand sometime,.However it began to shift it tones to heavy when her thoughtless action started to have implication on the other character especially Shinobu and her in law family. In other time, the story focused on her shenanigan.Character 8/10The most interesting character i could see is Benio the heroine herself as she changes from the adolescent to adulthood.She really have development in the series but by not losing her courage and unyielding self even though overcoming upcoming obstacles .She is not the heroine where all she can do is cry and being dame in distress waiting hero to come but solving problem by doing all thing in her own unique way, i really admire that full of flaw and goofy character of her and , although sometimes her playful nature may invite trouble than not ,You cant help but Laugh or sympathizing at her . This is where the lieutenant her fiancee comes in , Shinobu also was an intriguing character .He always smile or laugh when it comes to her but sometimes you cant understand what hes thinking type of character.He by the textbook is the perfect guy good looking , patient , perfect man that opposite to the main heroine  Maybe it sounded boring but it complimenting the heroine attitude and suit them So Well  but he sometimes unexpectedly have pretty laid back and fun attitude where he also joins in our heroine mischief where he fight with her. or causing public uproar together.Art 9/10 , Sound 6/10Because this is from, the earliest stage of manga and anime , it contains originality where the art is kinda reminds me Rose of Versailles or Anne of green gable . Watching it makes me take time to getting used to but when you watch it  you will fall in love with it.The opening was different, it was like when you listen the first 3 second you can figure what anime it is .The quirky and upbeat saxophone makes us audience really get into the atmosphere of the story while the ending is so chilled like you are drinking tea in evening and the visual is lovely in both.Overall/Lesson/Enjoyment 8/10Well this anime might suit someone who can appreciate classic anime but also drama in it while not too absorbed in romance but for me it really a unique experience . And i notice that the light comedy maybe to hide deeper theme in it .Like woman have to married early or arranged by their parents , Freedom of woman in education at that time and also political war and the consequences. The anime not only to entertain  but also It may have been an anime to give the hope for woman to be positive int their lives and try to fall in love with man of your chose.Between the movie and anime  series, i reluctantly have to chose the series because the journey of Benio to become who she is can be seen in anime series more naturally and makes thing make more sense than the movie itself .( I mean it was 42 episode) many thing happens although the movie 2 is better in execution of ending (depend on your taste some find it better than the original). I really love the anime please watch it if you get the chanc, but bear in mind it is a shoujo so the typical aspect and cheesiness is still there was rising.

This show takes a popular showa manga in the rom com genre set in the Taisho era of Japan, and brings it to life in the way only anime can deliver.  These characters evolved from seemingly flat comedy tropes into people who I constantly think about, months after finishing the show.  This show succeeds as an adaptation by bringing a far more melancholic and ethereal ending to a typical ""true love finds a way"" narrative.  Haikara san ga...Tooru has a message about loss and morning which is hard to find even amongst the sea of anime released in more recent decades, and very few people in the west have ever heard of this show, a real shame, as I see it.It\'s perhaps best to address the short comings of this show up front:  If you dont particularly enjoy slapstick showa comedy, seen in shows such as osomatsu kun, tensai bakabon, or Urusei Yatsura, you may want to temper some of your expectations.  I found it charming, funny, and found myself smiling and chuckling along the way.  This was made long before the era of Otaku media, afterall, and so there is an element of the writing being a product of the time and culture.  This extends to the art, from the backgrounds to the character designs, which may be less detailed and more stylized than the modern anime fan may be used to.  Art evolves over time, after all.  I found these aspects to be quite appealing, myself.With that said, I will readdress the art as a strong positive, as the color work and the framing finds strength in how it communicates the emotional movement and themes of the show with particular poise.  This aspect, particularly, improves greatly through the shows run time, with a specific scene around episode 30 coming to mind as a strong point.  The visual language of Haikara speaks to the viewer in a visceral way.The show diverges from the manga at a certain point, due to the abrupt cancellation of the show\'s place on television, but the anime take on the ending morphs the story and its themes into something amazing.  Where the manga holds that true love can always find a way, the anime comments on the cycle of love from beginning to end, and that message resonated with me in a lasting way.  The staff were able to deliver on something special as only a well considered adaptation can.Finally, i think one of the most interesting aspects of Haikara is the way in which it engages with gender norms (at least as understood from a western perspective.  I understand Japanese, but I am still a westerner after all).  This theme is explored in a number of directions from a number of different characters, from Benio\'s masculine take on femininity to Ranmaru\'s feminine take on masculinity.  There is certainly much more depth to this, but i will leave this note of the review here.  I found this commentary to greatly enhance the core narrative and its themes, with a simple message:  people are people, and they exist in society.  People\'s relationship to societal expectation is, in the end, fluid and ever changing.That Haikara san ga Tooru is not translated for the wider anime audience is quite honestly, a great shame, and I hope we as a community can correct that in the near future.

I might be a bit bias since I watched the Arabic Dub of it not the sub.Haikara-san go Tooru was known as Benio in the arabic Dub and as ""here comes miss modern"" in Japanese.Plot = 9/10In 1920 the young Benio has an embarrassing encounter with the VERY handsome army lieutenant Shinobu Ijuin. Between that, her classmate whispering in her ear about being a ""modern woman"" and her father announcing that he arranged her marriage to this stranger and that she must leave her home to leave with him... well she rebelled ofcourse.The entire plot...is about the clash of the old ways and the new with Benio\'s fiery personality reflecting it. The uncertain times that japan was going through and how to adapt as well as how the role women played changed during that time period. It weakens near the end of the show as the war and it\'s aftermath roll in though.Characters = 8/10There is nothing new here. The characters are very stereotyped for Shoujo manga (which this is based on). They are however true to type and act according to it.Benio is the standout, although fiery and extroverted tomboy her youth makes her mailable and easily influenced by those around her.The side characters all have their classic parts. The childhood friend that loves her but it\'s one-sided. The elegant classmate that she is admires. The... servant that treats her like a mafia boss???Even within their established roles they all have their own personalities and motives which keeps things interesting.The only that doesn\'t is Ijuin, the love interest. His role is to look pretty... that\'s about it. Even then the anime dives into his background to explain why he\'s like that with little character moments throughout that endear him to the viewer.Animation and art = 8/10This was made in the late 70s and it shows. Animation is a bit choppy at times however the style and character designs are distinct and very expressive.Music and sound = ???/10Again I watched the arabic dub. the theme song was literally ""Benio, Benio, how cute she is. Everyone that meets her is happy!"" Repeat till the credits end...Overall = 8/10This show is such an under appreciated gem and deserves more recognition as a classic. The animation is dated but still charming. is about the clash of the old ways and the new with Benio\'s fiery personality reflecting it.

The animation is dated but still charming.', ""I like historical settings, and the final phase/aftermath of world war 1 could be interesting I thought. This was the time when Japanese expansion began to take speed, and great transformations occurred internally. Interest in the epoch lead me to watch this piece. What I got was just another romantic comedy. At least it was not as bad as other romantic comedies that I have seen so far.The opening and ending music was pleasing to the ear I think, from the rest I do not remember much. Must have been OK probably.Some words about the graphical aspects of this animation title. Backgrounds are pretty basic,...and the fight scenes are sometimes just a dust cloud with some fists coming out of it. However, I somehow got an impression of Japanese streets and clothing of the Taishō area (google it, you may also need it for the calendar dates in the series). The Ryōunkaku (google it), which was destroyed in the 1923 Kantō earthquake, is shown several times.About clothes: Some characters do not seem to have many clothes to change, even if they are not exactly poor. For example Shinobu usually wears his uniform even if he is not on duty. The female or crossdressing characters (Ranmaru) have a bigger wardrobe. The protagonist Benio herself has various sets of clothes for school, housework, and the street. She dresses herself rather traditional in the first half of the series, but in the second half (after her hair cut), she acquires some sets of fashionable European clothes, even if her economic situation got worse. I think this is in order to express Benio’s change of character and personal circumstances.In any case, the art is not good, but also not ugly. It reflects the time, and is also linked with the story development, which puts it above mediocrity for me.The historical background shown in the pictures is just the stage on which the characters act. The characters have no influence at all on historical events, even those that affect their lives. The most prominent example is the Japanese Siberia Expedition after the Russian Revolution. This is closely linked to a turning point in the lives of the main characters, but they are just helplessly subjected to the events. What they make from this experience is another matter though.Apart from the main characters, there are a couple of side characters for comic relief, which serve no other purpose. Some are only annoying, like that boy with the alcohol bottle or the voluptuous hag with the white kimono. Others have some purpose, like Benio’s henchman Ushigorou, who transports his boss Benio through town after he enters into her service. These do not change noticeably (for example Ushigorou), or their change is not shown (Benio’s friend Tamaki).The protagonist Benio is the focus of the entire series. At least in the first third, her story seems to be that of an unwilling girl getting gradually attached to a snobbish rich guy. She is a rather outspoken person, who talks a lot about independence of women, which means to her to be able to select the spouse that she wants. However, she accepts the engagement that her father and grandmother decided, grumbling, but without offering serious resistance. Then, she gets relocated to her grandparents’ household, where she spends her time grumbling and doing household chores. In short, she seems to be rather superficial and more bark than bite regarding the important matters (her life and future).Regarding unimportant matters, she shows more fighting spirit and quite a violent streak.Benio's antiques include bickering, drinking alcohol, fights (with words and fists), boob jokes (maybe those will last as long as mankind), duels, property damage, bodily injury… Somehow, she does not get into serious trouble for her escapades. One of her fights even earns her a henchman, who serves as comic relief for the rest of the series.Shinobu, on the other hand, has the air of a somewhat arrogant and oblivious upper class guy, who falls for Benio for some reason, but does not seem to take her really seriously. He usually just laughs about her escapades, and about events that also concern Benio he does not inform her in advance.Things take a turn later, when it is not Benio, but Shinobu who receives the retaliation for some of Benio’s escapades. Separated from family and Benio, Shinobu is put to the test, and gets the chance to show that he is more than just a well bred snob. Far from home, he manages to get accepted by new companions, with compassion, loyalty and courage, and I started to feel sympathy to him.Starting with the separation from Shinobu, Benio now also makes some experiences, that change her from the shallow moody parasyte of the first 15 episodes, to someone who thinks about the consequences of her actions and actually takes care of herself and others. She gradually becomes more independent, discovers goals in life and makes a career, which goes well beyond her previous notion of independence, which seemed to be restricted to the free selection of a husband at first. Benio becomes a much stronger and responsible character. She still has her moods and makes mistakes, but now they rather add to her charm.I didn’t quite like the last scene. It is a scene with stylized background, unrealistic colors and few words. It seemed to be a dream. But if it was a dream, what became of Benio and Shinobu? The narrator finally says what is the conclusion, but I personally think it would have been better if the outcome was properly shown. The way it was, it was somewhat… frustrating. (Not sure if this is the right English word to describe my feeling, but I can’t think of a better one.)This series was a chore for the first couple of episodes. It seemed to be a clichéd romantic comedy with annoying characters, the protagonist being the worst of them all. As the series progressed, the episodes got more serious and more engaging.  Both the characters and story quality improved, and I started to enjoy the title. Especially Benio progressed greatly, but she also started from pretty low lows, so even reaching mediocrity may have been a big step for her... All in all, the series was fairly enjoyable I would say.Since enjoyment decides my ratings, the final verdict is 6, “fair”. and the fight scenes are sometimes just a dust cloud with some fists coming out of it.

In short, she seems to be rather superficial and more bark than bite regarding the important matters (her life and future).Regarding unimportant matters, she shows more fighting spirit and quite a violent streak.Benio's antiques include bickering, drinking alcohol, fights (with words and fists), boob jokes (maybe those will last as long as mankind), duels, property damage, bodily injury… Somehow, she does not get into serious trouble for her escapades. One of her fights even earns her a henchman, who serves as comic relief for the rest of the series.Shinobu, on the other hand, has the air of a somewhat arrogant and oblivious upper class guy, who falls for Benio for some reason, but does not seem to take her really seriously. He usually just laughs about her escapades, and about events that also concern Benio he does not inform her in advance.Things take a turn later, when it is not Benio, but Shinobu who receives the retaliation for some of Benio’s escapades. Separated from family and Benio, Shinobu is put to the test, and gets the chance to show that he is more than just a well bred snob. Far from home, he manages to get accepted by new companions, with compassion, loyalty and courage, and I started to feel sympathy to him.Starting with the separation from Shinobu, Benio now also makes some experiences, that change her from the shallow moody parasyte of the first 15 episodes, to someone who thinks about the consequences of her actions and actually takes care of herself and others. She gradually becomes more independent, discovers goals in life and makes a career, which goes well beyond her previous notion of independence, which seemed to be restricted to the free selection of a husband at first. Benio becomes a much stronger and responsible character. She still has her moods and makes mistakes, but now they rather add to her charm.I didn’t quite like the last scene. It is a scene with stylized background, unrealistic colors and few words. It seemed to be a dream. But if it was a dream, what became of Benio and Shinobu? The narrator finally says what is the conclusion, but I personally think it would have been better if the outcome was properly shown. The way it was, it was somewhat… frustrating. (Not sure if this is the right English word to describe my feeling, but I can’t think of a better one.)This series was a chore for the first couple of episodes. It seemed to be a clichéd romantic comedy with annoying characters, the protagonist being the worst of them all. As the series progressed, the episodes got more serious and more engaging.  Both the characters and story quality improved, and I started to enjoy the title. Especially Benio progressed greatly, but she also started from pretty low lows, so even reaching mediocrity may have been a big step for her... All in all, the series was fairly enjoyable I would say.Since enjoyment decides my ratings, the final verdict is 6, “fair”.""]"
Harukanaru Toki no Naka de: Maihitoyo,https://myanimelist.net/anime/1906/Harukanaru_Toki_no_Naka_de__Maihitoyo,"['This movie can be seen as a long episode from the hachiyo shou TV series. It follows the general plot of an arc or episode in the TV series: some enemy appear, they find out about the enemy, and they defeat it.However, I liked this movie much better than the series. In my opinion, the Hachiyou Shou TV series was rather average, there was some good moments but overall there was nothing special. Too cliche, too shoujo, not enough character depth, predictable plot devices etc.The movie can be watched as a stand alone movie (would still make sense), but since it follows the TV...series (is a sequal) it may make more sense to have a better understanding before watching the movie. The plot isn\'t different from the series (can be seen as an episode of the tv series), but the character depth of Akane and her relationship with the other main character made the movie good in my opinion.Story: 7/10As mention above, it fits the general plot line of meet enemy, fight enemy, defeat enemy. However, it was the intricacies beyond the plot events that really captivates. A coincidental meeting brings two unlikely people together, a meaningful and fragile friendship forms, but in the end was never allowed to blossom.  There is hope and heartbreak. What is really great about the story lies in the portrayal of the main character Akane, and in how cruel fate can be. I will talk more regarding this in character section. I should mention here that Akuram and the oni clan are not involved in this story and does not appear at all.Art 9/10Beautifully rendered art. If you have seen the series, the movie has much better art. The background was given a lot of detail and textures.Sound 9/10I was especially drawn to the opening music (which is the music for the dance that the movie is about) which probably biased my opinion. The music within the movie (not much) was alright, but the song for the dance really got to me. I also find it beautiful to come in a full circle, and the movie ended in a foil of how it started.Character 8/10The plot of the story isn\'t anything special, but what the story is really about, is the characters in it. Specifically, it is about Akane. It is a story about a miko who was being suffocated by her overprotective hachiyou guardians and by the duties pushed on her, a miko who is losing herself and confused about who she is and what she should do, a miko who is putting on a fake front for everyone but secretly breaking inside. Mostly, it focuses on the miko\'s inner struggle, her guardians being unable to understand her (and her trying to appear strong for them), and how a chance meeting with a new friend changes everything.For the character depth and development, and beauty of fate/chance meetings, I really like this movie. I would say more but I don\'t want to spoil anything about the story.Enjoyment and Overall 9/10Because of all the emotional depth that was portrayed for Akane (and to a lesser degree, the dancer) and the character development (they\'re facing a personal crisis, they go through emotional turmoil, and eventually finds some sort of solution to regain peace and become a stronger character for it), and the fact that it\'s not another ""nothing serious happens, nothing really changes"" episode of Hachiyou shou, I find it very enjoyable overall. I also like the bittersweet ending, which has a much bigger impact than a sparkly rainbow happy ending.If you\'re not interested in seeing some character development in Akane then the movie is probably not that great for you. The whole movie revolves around Akane and her inner turmoils, everyone else takes a very minor role. series (is a sequal) it may make more sense to have a better understanding before watching the movie.

I thought it was everywhere and going nowhere in particular, with more plot holes than I could count.In comes Maihitoyo... a beautiful, well written, well paced and amazing story that puts the rest of the series to shame by light years. However, the movie borrows from the rest of the series, so a viewer should consider watching the series before the movie. Standalone, this movie provided me with an original character who will go in my favorite characters list.The Good:As opinions go, Akane is not a character...most will find appealing. Personally, she is as annoying and as endeared by her companions as Miaka in Fushigi Yuugi. I care for neither protagonist but their weaknesses are what allows the rest of the cast to shine more than they normally would. To that effect, Haruka Naru Toki no Naka de - Maihitoyo introduces us to an initially unnamed man, a movie original, who develops a stronger bond with the main protagonist within the span of less than two hours than any we witness in the 26-episode televised series. Not only is this bond solid, but the well structured story pulls the viewer into truly believing its reality.Animation quality flew ten miles in a different direction in comparison to any of the OVAs or the main series. It is noticeable down to the last rain drop and every fluid thrust of a blade. Comparatively, there are actual battle scenes in the movie that dwarf the series in both delivery and execution. There aren't many, but given the movie length, they're spread out sparingly enough to keep the audience engaged.The Bad:The only negative points to this movie may lie in its relationship to the parent series and perhaps a singular corny, Power Ranger-esque moment.The Truth:Given the good points, Maihitoyo is an enjoyable tale worth sharing. It may suffer from being tied to a mediocre series, but the movie goes as far as to redeem the condemning role the main protagonist, Akane, plays.

It\'s really great to be able to see actual struggle, Akane wanting to help and tired of being useless, the Guardians being sort of douchebags and forcing her to always stay behind (even if their concerns are understandable), the way the title of priestess...weights on Akane like never before, how she tries to do stuff but is too nice and emotional to manage to do her job well which in turn makes her feel even more depressed, finding comfort in this random stranger that never treats her as anything more than just a girl. It was all just so genuine and heartwarming!If somebody would have told me Harukanaru Toki no Naka de would make me teary-eyed I\'d have snorted in their faces. And yet, it really did make me emotional. I feel this movie contains what reverse harems nowadays tend to lack: a ""soul"". How characters should stay characters before the need of offering fanservice, genuine feelings, characters that we can actually relate to, struggles than we can cheer for the characters to overcome etc. I\'m only giving this an 8 because of the original material being the way it is and despite me raving about it, this movie isn\'t actually a complex masterpiece, it\'s just infinite times better than the original lolIt was absolutely amazing and if anybody actually managed to go through the main series or get at least halfway through, then I definitely recommend this movie. weights on Akane like never before, how she tries to do stuff but is too nice and emotional to manage to do her job well which in turn makes her feel even more depressed, finding comfort in this random stranger that never treats her as anything more than just a girl.

OMG ^o^Very great side love story in the battle of Hachiyou VS Akram, I can tell u!

Hellsing: The Dawn,https://myanimelist.net/anime/11077/Hellsing__The_Dawn,"[""This is my first review.hellsing the dawn is a nice addition to the story of Hellsing Ultimate, I think it's rather impresindible, because this explains some holes left unfinished in the anime.The animation is very good, and interesting story so far, so if you watch Hellsing Ultimate should definitely watch it, and wait until December 2012 to see if with Chapter 10 of the main story its going to be included the rest of this. "", ""If you're watching this expecting plenty of Alucard and young Walter slaughtering Nazis, be warned: there's not much of that here. I gave this a 7 because seeing Walter in action is truly a sight to behold - in fact, any scene with Walter in it is basically pure, unadulterated awesomeness.Unfortunately, there's not enough of Walter, the rest having been replaced with seemingly pointless humor sequences and some exposition. There's also no resolution to the battle sequence, and Alucard is on screen for a disappointingly short time (in a very interesting form, however!)Overall, it's fun to watch as a little bonus to the Hellsing OVAs,...but don't expect much in terms of ghoul-slaying and Alucard's screen time. but don't expect much in terms of ghoul-slaying and Alucard's screen time."", ""Overview:Well that was over quickly! The whole special is only 27 minutes and really doesn't give us all the extra Hellsing we wanted. Each episode of Hellsing Ultimate was 1 hour long, so with 3 episodes at 9 minutes each, Hellsing the Dawn is like a terrible lover that finishes in 30 seconds and rolls over to go to sleep. We Hellsing fans are the disappointed chick going WTF!!? What was THAT!!!? To make matters worse, half of Dawn episode 3 is a preview for another series, so Hellsing Dawn is in total about 24 god damn minutes!Story: 6/10We get to see Alucard as a...little girl (because why the fuck not I guess) fight Nazis along with young Walter. Little extra back story or insight into the characters is given. We get to witness a 5 second fight between Alucard the Cap, but they even cut out the scene in the manga where Cap kicks Alucard in half. Was there no budget for this project?! After Alucard rescues Walter we are given some exposition by Integra's douchbag uncle with Hellsing's vintage pointless omake jokes. Then the OVA ends. As mentioned previously the last few minutes are a preview for another series, which SHOULD NOT be part of Dawn, but instead be a separate trailer. We came here to watch Hellsing God damn it!Characters: 7/10We do get to see more of Walter as a kid, so that was at least fun. We also get a bit more of what the daily friendship is like between The Major and Doc. The most wasted character in all of Hellsing is easily the Captain, but of course he gets no further development here. The captain was interesting not just because he's a fucking awesome werewolf with a cool character design. He is mysterious and has a presence that far surpasses his minimal screen time much like Boba Fett in the first 3 Star Wars films. Why doesn't he ever talk? Was he born a werewolf or did he get his powers at some point in the past? Is he even a German? Why would he carry a med kit around if he can regenerate in Ultimate. Why does he heal and save Hienkel Wolf when all the rest of the Millenium fighters are purely evil. If the Cap is different from the rest of Millenium and is a somewhat noble warrior that just wants a good death from a tough opponent, why doesn't he wipe out Millenium himself and go fight Alucard?! We will never know any of these things. Because Kouta Hirano would rather draw ero doujinshi than give his coolest characters a fucking back story!Sound: 10/10More Karl Maria Von Webber! Can't really go wrong there.Art: 9/10The excellent art and animation from Ultimate are back here, but we don't really get to see much action unfortunatelyEnjoyment: 7/10I guess it was kind of fun while it lasted?Overall: 7/10The tiny bit we saw was fun, but this felt like it was far more of a cocktease by Kouta Hirano than an extra gift for Hellsing fans.

It's targeted towards those who've watched or are watching the Ultimate OVA, as this will make very little sense on its own, but even then it provides very little that we haven't seen in the parent story already.There are 3 roughly 10 minute-long episodes to showcase a part of Walter and Alucard's past during WWII, when they fought side by side against vampires created by the Major and his cohort.

(A ""king"" like in Japan with a story ending in betrayal a few decades before Toyo\'s time).Without knowing where he is or what to do, he immediately decides to rush for an attacked village, where the children Elfs who saved him live, and became a carnage assault on a group of humans who started killing Elfs indiscriminately when the rumour spreads saying that Elfs had aid a Drifter.Now in this unknown world there are two well known groups (or factions if you so prefer) Drifter and Offscouring. Both of those groups hold a variety of heroes from the past of our actual world that will soon clash.Art:  Its Hirano Kouta\'s Art, there is nothing to say here.(If you watched Hellsing\'s OVA\'s even better.)Sound:  Perfect like always! They got good picks definitely, will catch your attention.Enjoyment:  Guaranteed', ""When it comes to the Hellsing saga, noone can argue that Hellsing Ultimate is the best series. After it was finished, Hellsing:The Dawn was announced. I eagerly waited for it, but I can't say that it was as impressive as its predecessor.Starting off, the story aims to show us events that are only mentioned in the anime and specifically the origins of the artificial nazi vampires. Set in 1944, we see Alucard as young as ever and Walter in his early years. It was obvious that the reason of Dawn's existence is to cover some holes in Hellsing's plot. Therefore, the story is really short...with few battles and somewhat rapid event rotation. However, it achieves its goal.The visuals and battles are outstanding as ever, same style with Hellsing Ultimate. Excellent character models, dynamic shadows and realistic blood.Same goes for the sound. The same cast of voice actors and themes.What I didn't like that much is that Alucard lost a lot of screen time. With Walter as main character, it was logical Alucard would fall behind. However, Walter's screen time is not that good as well since there are many pointless and unnecessary comical sequences that can tire you and make you bored.I definitely enjoyed it, but The Dawn is nothing compared to Ultimate. I understand it was created to fill gaps in the plot, but it gives a quickie work feeling. It was wonderful to watch young Walter slaughtering nazis in an elegant way, but I disliked the reduced screen time on Alucard and the strict plot. It could have been better.Overall, The Dawn is a nice extra to the OVAs of Hellsing. But don't expect to see Alucard slaughtering helpless victims all the time.

So The Dawn became a must-watch for me as well, all the Captain artwork surrounding this Anime made it even more interesting to me.Sadly, after watching it, I cannot call this anything better than ""utter trash"". It was so bad that I finally got myself to write a review on MAL, just to get it out of my system.All 3 episodes together are less than 30 minutes long and contain maybe 5 minutes of the promised prequel content regarding the events during WW2. The whole anime is very very...cheap, the quality suffered a lot and there is barely anything of value in it.-Story & Characters-Well, there is not much to say about it, there is no story, we just get an incoherent mess of scenes and a very short look into Millenium\'s base of operation. The characters are very bland and barely talk with each other. Walter gets the spotlight but barey does anything with it, just being arrogant and trying to show off is not enough for characterization. So, how was Walter during WW2 compared to Hellsing Ultimate? Basically the renewed Walter but way more irritating. The Major was exactly the same, just more boring, some for the Captain and the Doc. Alucard was barely in the movie and no, we did not get an Alucard vs. Captain fight scene, we got barely any fighting at all. I Really dont know what the creators believed we want.Arthur Hellsing\'s appearance is nothing more than a character assassination. Better not even show him at all than do this. He is supposed to be eccentric, not a bumbling idiot that laughs at his own jokes.And about the other 25 minutes of the anime... I dont even want to talk about it. Unfunny and cringe scenes one after another. Hellsing Ultiamte had some of those as well, but a lot fewer in comparison and they were not as painful to watch.-Graphics & Animations-A huge downgrade. In some shots we still get the classic high quality Hellsing art style, but most of the time we get crappy static shots. The anime basically pauses and gives us more time to look at badly drawn scenes. Most of the movement comes from Walter\'s wires. There is not a lot to say about animations since there are barely any.-Atmosphere-The anime almost manages to create a suspensful or exciting atmosphere in the Millenium HQ scenes, but fails due to way too little time and the focus on Walter\'s arrogance. The other parts of the anime are ""jokey"", but never funny in any way, I am sorry to say, pure cringe, even for fanservice.-Music & Sound-Fine, but 100% recycled from Hellsing Ultimate.To make it short: Dont buy it, dont watch it.

They serve as a prequel to Hellsing and show a young (VERY bishonen) Walter kicking Nazi ass in WW2. What\'s not to love here? I was ready to give this OVA a 9 because of the GORGEOUSLY animated action scenes, but the shenanigans they pulled in episode 3 brought my score down to a 7/10. For some reason I cannot fathom they decided to stack on a full trailer for the anime Drifters to the end of episode 3. Like, if you wanna make a trailer for Drifters, then...just do that, don\'t interrupt Hellsing to do so. And I say ""interrupt"" specifically because the Hellsing portion fades to black just as Alucard enters the fight to back up Walter, who was getting a beating by The Captain. Obviously Alucard and Walter are both alive in Hellsing, so I know they didn\'t lose the fight, but it still would\'ve been nice to see HOW that fight ended. Instead time and money is spent on the aforementioned trailer, which is why I finished the OVA a little annoyed. just do that, don\'t interrupt Hellsing to do so.

Não que ele seja ruim pelo contrario esse anime so com 3 episódios já me deixou muito hypado por isso eu dou a nota 9. Seria incrível ver o Alucard e o Walter lutando juntos contra os nazistase teria muito material a mais para explorar. Hellsing the dawn está mais para um complemento para a incrível historia de Hellsing. Recomendo a todos fãns de Hellsing que vejam porque é muito foda. Más a pouca duração dos episódios (entre 9 e 6 minutos) traz um sentimento de desperdicio pois eu acho que todos queriam...ver uma parceria do Alucard e do Walter principalmente depois do final de Hellsing ultimate então por causa deste sentimento que traz eu não dou 10 mas sim um 9 ver uma parceria do Alucard e do Walter principalmente depois do final de Hellsing ultimate então por causa deste sentimento que traz eu não dou 10 mas sim um 9']"
Yume-iro Pâtissière: Mune Kyun Tropical Island!,https://myanimelist.net/anime/8894/Yume-iro_Pâtissière__Mune_Kyun_Tropical_Island,"['As an OVA to Yumeiro Patissiere, which I think takes place sometime during the first season, I found it to be quite enjoyable, showcasing a different side of Yumeiro Patissiere.Story: 8/10The OVA is only about 7 minutes long, which doesn\'t leave much room for an intensely complicated plot. Simply, Team Ichigo (Ichigo, Kashino, Andou, and Hanabusa) and their sweet spirits are stranded on a deserted island. The OVA is simply full of comedy, fluff, with a smidge of romance. Perfect for a lighthearted OVA, in my opinion. Thus, giving it a score of 8 for the enjoy-ability and simplicity.Art: 7/10The art of the OVA is...similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime. Then again, I could be mistaken. However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime.

Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable.

The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime. Then again, I could be mistaken. However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime. In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day.

Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day.

Simply, Team Ichigo (Ichigo, Kashino, Andou, and Hanabusa) and their sweet spirits are stranded on a deserted island. The OVA is simply full of comedy, fluff, with a smidge of romance.

Perfect for a lighthearted OVA, in my opinion. Thus, giving it a score of 8 for the enjoy-ability and simplicity.Art: 7/10The art of the OVA is...similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime. Then again, I could be mistaken. However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime. In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day. If you love Yumeiro Patissiere, it\'ll definitely bring a smile to your face!Overall: 8/10All in all, there\'s not much to say about the OVA, considering this review is quite short compared to the ones I\'ve written for both Yumeiro Patissiere and Yumeiro Patissiere SP Professional.

However, is totally worth the 7 little minutes it takes up. Perfect for anyone looking for a quick shot of cute fluff or a fanatic of Yumeiro Patissiere :) similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime.

In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him.

Perfect for anyone looking for a quick shot of cute fluff or a fanatic of Yumeiro Patissiere :)', 'Okay I don\'t know whether to laugh or not. Less than 2 mins in and it\'s SO BAD. Wait... okay, this is definitely a joke. ""I\'m so sexy when I\'m by myself."" LOL. But the only thing that actually made me laugh was the antics about 4mins in. The rest is just a waste of time. ', 'As an OVA to Yumeiro Patissiere, which I think takes place sometime during the first season, I found it to be quite enjoyable, showcasing a different side of Yumeiro Patissiere.Story: 8/10The OVA is only about 7 minutes long, which doesn\'t leave much room for an intensely complicated plot. Simply, Team Ichigo (Ichigo, Kashino, Andou, and Hanabusa) and their sweet spirits are stranded on a deserted island. The OVA is simply full of comedy, fluff, with a smidge of romance. Perfect for a lighthearted OVA, in my opinion. Thus, giving it a score of 8 for the enjoy-ability and simplicity.Art: 7/10The art of the OVA is...similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime. Then again, I could be mistaken. However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime. In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day.

Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day. If you love Yumeiro Patissiere, it\'ll definitely bring a smile to your face!Overall: 8/10All in all, there\'s not much to say about the OVA, considering this review is quite short compared to the ones I\'ve written for both Yumeiro Patissiere and Yumeiro Patissiere SP Professional. However, is totally worth the 7 little minutes it takes up. Perfect for anyone looking for a quick shot of cute fluff or a fanatic of Yumeiro Patissiere :) similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime.

', 'As an OVA to Yumeiro Patissiere, which I think takes place sometime during the first season, I found it to be quite enjoyable, showcasing a different side of Yumeiro Patissiere.Story: 8/10The OVA is only about 7 minutes long, which doesn\'t leave much room for an intensely complicated plot. Simply, Team Ichigo (Ichigo, Kashino, Andou, and Hanabusa) and their sweet spirits are stranded on a deserted island. The OVA is simply full of comedy, fluff, with a smidge of romance. Perfect for a lighthearted OVA, in my opinion. Thus, giving it a score of 8 for the enjoy-ability and simplicity.Art: 7/10The art of the OVA is...similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime.

However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime.

Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality.

However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime. In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day. If you love Yumeiro Patissiere, it\'ll definitely bring a smile to your face!Overall: 8/10All in all, there\'s not much to say about the OVA, considering this review is quite short compared to the ones I\'ve written for both Yumeiro Patissiere and Yumeiro Patissiere SP Professional. However, is totally worth the 7 little minutes it takes up. Perfect for anyone looking for a quick shot of cute fluff or a fanatic of Yumeiro Patissiere :) similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit.

While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day.

', 'As an OVA to Yumeiro Patissiere, which I think takes place sometime during the first season, I found it to be quite enjoyable, showcasing a different side of Yumeiro Patissiere.Story: 8/10The OVA is only about 7 minutes long, which doesn\'t leave much room for an intensely complicated plot. Simply, Team Ichigo (Ichigo, Kashino, Andou, and Hanabusa) and their sweet spirits are stranded on a deserted island. The OVA is simply full of comedy, fluff, with a smidge of romance. Perfect for a lighthearted OVA, in my opinion. Thus, giving it a score of 8 for the enjoy-ability and simplicity.Art: 7/10The art of the OVA is...similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense!

Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime. Then again, I could be mistaken. However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime. In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day. If you love Yumeiro Patissiere, it\'ll definitely bring a smile to your face!Overall: 8/10All in all, there\'s not much to say about the OVA, considering this review is quite short compared to the ones I\'ve written for both Yumeiro Patissiere and Yumeiro Patissiere SP Professional. However, is totally worth the 7 little minutes it takes up. Perfect for anyone looking for a quick shot of cute fluff or a fanatic of Yumeiro Patissiere :) similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere.

Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day.

Simply, Team Ichigo (Ichigo, Kashino, Andou, and Hanabusa) and their sweet spirits are stranded on a deserted island. The OVA is simply full of comedy, fluff, with a smidge of romance.

Perfect for a lighthearted OVA, in my opinion. Thus, giving it a score of 8 for the enjoy-ability and simplicity.Art: 7/10The art of the OVA is...similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime. Then again, I could be mistaken. However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime. In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day. If you love Yumeiro Patissiere, it\'ll definitely bring a smile to your face!Overall: 8/10All in all, there\'s not much to say about the OVA, considering this review is quite short compared to the ones I\'ve written for both Yumeiro Patissiere and Yumeiro Patissiere SP Professional.

However, is totally worth the 7 little minutes it takes up. Perfect for anyone looking for a quick shot of cute fluff or a fanatic of Yumeiro Patissiere :) similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime.

In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him.

Perfect for anyone looking for a quick shot of cute fluff or a fanatic of Yumeiro Patissiere :)', 'Okay I don\'t know whether to laugh or not. Less than 2 mins in and it\'s SO BAD. Wait... okay, this is definitely a joke. ""I\'m so sexy when I\'m by myself."" LOL. But the only thing that actually made me laugh was the antics about 4mins in. The rest is just a waste of time. ', 'As an OVA to Yumeiro Patissiere, which I think takes place sometime during the first season, I found it to be quite enjoyable, showcasing a different side of Yumeiro Patissiere.Story: 8/10The OVA is only about 7 minutes long, which doesn\'t leave much room for an intensely complicated plot. Simply, Team Ichigo (Ichigo, Kashino, Andou, and Hanabusa) and their sweet spirits are stranded on a deserted island. The OVA is simply full of comedy, fluff, with a smidge of romance. Perfect for a lighthearted OVA, in my opinion. Thus, giving it a score of 8 for the enjoy-ability and simplicity.Art: 7/10The art of the OVA is...similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime. Then again, I could be mistaken. However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime. In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him. Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day.

Ichigo is clueless as usual.Enjoyment: 9/10Despite how short the OVA is it really had me laughing; which was the whole point, which makes it that much more enjoyable. While the whole thing doesn\'t have a particular striking story and is very similar to the essence of the actual anime; it is quite enjoyable as a quick watch or maybe even just a rewatch to brighten up your day. If you love Yumeiro Patissiere, it\'ll definitely bring a smile to your face!Overall: 8/10All in all, there\'s not much to say about the OVA, considering this review is quite short compared to the ones I\'ve written for both Yumeiro Patissiere and Yumeiro Patissiere SP Professional. However, is totally worth the 7 little minutes it takes up. Perfect for anyone looking for a quick shot of cute fluff or a fanatic of Yumeiro Patissiere :) similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime.

', 'As an OVA to Yumeiro Patissiere, which I think takes place sometime during the first season, I found it to be quite enjoyable, showcasing a different side of Yumeiro Patissiere.Story: 8/10The OVA is only about 7 minutes long, which doesn\'t leave much room for an intensely complicated plot. Simply, Team Ichigo (Ichigo, Kashino, Andou, and Hanabusa) and their sweet spirits are stranded on a deserted island. The OVA is simply full of comedy, fluff, with a smidge of romance. Perfect for a lighthearted OVA, in my opinion. Thus, giving it a score of 8 for the enjoy-ability and simplicity.Art: 7/10The art of the OVA is...similar to that of Yumeiro Patissiere. Fairly basic, nothing special. Nothing particular that stands out immensely. The colours and use of tropics was a fresh change though, I must admit. The sunny atmosphere set up by the artwork was quite nice. The one thing I have a problem with is the fact that Ichigo and Vanilla go snorkeling in the coral reefs and can breathe while being completely submerged in water. That doesn\'t make any sense! Just a simple mistake such of that in the art design of the scene bugs me.Sound: 9/10The OVA again, uses tracks from Yumeiro Patissiere, except for some of the more tropical sounding themes that aren\'t including in the anime. Then again, I could be mistaken. However, as usual, Yumeiro Patissiere brings forth happy, bouncy music that can help boost the atmosphere so much more.Character: 7/10The characters are very similar to how they are in the anime. In fact, they are showcased just that little bit more. Andou seems to have a sort of \'moment\' with Ichigo that can only show that at that point there is some feelings contained inside his otherwise calm personality. Hanabusa seems to shine with his narcissism; while Kashino displays some streaks of bashfulness and some of his ""angel"" like qualities often seen in him.
